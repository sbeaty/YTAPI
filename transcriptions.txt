Title: What If the Sphinx Is Way Older Than We Think?
[0.0] It's just much more likely than not that
[2.08] the Sphinx is significantly older. Why
[3.919] wouldn't the pyramids be older? Aerial
[5.68] view of the Sphinx. And then we see the
[7.359] Sphinx ditch here. You know, on the west
[9.679] side, you can see the rounded forms of
[13.04] the limestone exposed here. Assuming
[16.0] these megalithic blocks here are were
[18.56] quarried cuz you know, Matt, that the
[20.88] original Sphinx is mostly its bedrock
[23.92] emerging from the sand at some point.
[25.76] This is the assumption and that makes
[27.439] sense to me. And that was what was
[28.88] carved into the head. And then the
[30.56] blocks around the body were quarried
[33.04] away in order to expose, you know, from
[35.76] roughly the neck down of the sphinx.
[38.16] This is a an exhausted New Kingdom
[40.399] limestone quarry. And note the traces of
[43.12] the stepwise removed blocks. This is
[46.0] essentially the Egyptian method of stone
[48.16] quarrying by means of separation
[50.079] trenches. The assumption is is that
[52.0] they're using chisels to remove the rock
[55.76] between each of the separate blocks. And
[58.48] here would be a cross-section profile.
[61.039] Here you can see the stepped profile.
[63.039] And then this block is removed. And then
[65.119] this is excavated. And generally what
[67.6] they'll do is they'll look first for
[69.6] natural bedding planes because that
[71.439] provides the easiest way to separate the
[74.159] blocks,

Title: AI Says the Sphinx Is 12,000 Years Old?
[0.24] Boom. Oh wow. When you show the images
[3.2] of the Sphinx to AI, it spits out 9 to
[6.879] 12,000 years old as the age of the
[9.84] Sphinx. Really? Yeah. Well, that's a
[11.92] convenient way to Yeah. Yeah. I don't
[14.4] believe in AI. And I think like that's
[16.16] just the beginning though. I feel like
[17.52] when you start to survey the entire
[19.68] surface of the planet of the earth with
[22.24] LAR, ground penetrating radar and you
[24.88] know you start to like get sonar on the
[27.279] coast and you start to just feed all the
[29.679] satellite imagery that we have of the
[31.599] earth into into AI and you say look tell
[34.239] me about the history of the earth from a
[36.96] geological standpoint like what
[39.04] happened. I feel like it it it ought to
[40.719] be able to paint a fairly accurate
[43.12] picture within the next couple of years.
[44.8] And so and I think we are just on the
[47.28] threshold developing entirely new models
[49.76] of of the earth, global change, the
[52.079] history of the planet. And where to me
[54.0] is so fascinating and relevant is when
[57.12] we start understanding the nature, the
[60.239] extent of global change during the
[62.239] period of time that we humans, modern
[64.4] humans have inhabited this planet. And
[66.88] it's been extraordinary.

Title: The Physics of Miracles
[0.08] God actually worked through scientific
[2.159] what what we could now describe as
[4.16] scientific means that there's a level at
[6.4] which we can transcend the merely
[9.519] supernatural which is to me super nature
[13.519] to understand that yes we're endowed
[16.64] with the means to understand maybe not
[19.439] the ultimate you know I think of it as
[21.84] the miracle at the beginning there was
[24.0] the whatever whatever was the inception
[27.68] of the universe that was a miracle
[29.76] circle and everything has basically been
[31.679] physics since then and that's exactly
[34.079] according to the way God set it up and
[37.04] we are beings of matter and energy and
[40.0] spirit and this means that we can
[42.559] transcend the limitations of the
[44.64] material realm because we do have this
[47.039] spiritual side to our being like I said
[49.36] I don't really uh accept put faith in
[51.92] dogmas although I do believe that many
[54.48] dogmas have elements of truth in them if
[57.6] you can get past the outer form and Look
[59.68] at the essence of what where did this
[61.359] dogma come from? What was its ultimate
[64.0] origin?

Title: The Moon Is Not What You Think
[0.24] What if I told you that engraved into
[2.72] the lunar surface is a historical record
[5.279] that could provide critical insight into
[8.48] the history of our own planet.
[11.44] Carved deep into the lunar surface are
[13.84] many stories. Stories if they had
[16.24] occurred on Earth would have been washed
[18.88] away by geological forces.
[22.16] But the moon is a Rosetta stone and
[24.96] timelessly holds the evidence of
[26.8] something beautiful, awesome, and even
[30.08] sinister. Today, we'll be exploring
[33.28] recent discoveries on the moon, their
[35.68] secrets and revelations now imparted to
[38.64] mankind, and perhaps some crucial
[41.68] lessons learned here today on Squaring
[45.28] the Circle.
[47.47] [Music]
[57.76] Greetings. I'm Randall Carlson and this
[60.239] is my podcast, Squaring the Circle.
[62.879] Today I will be joined by my friend,
[65.04] colleague, and ally, John Arthur. And
[69.04] welcome to the stage, John. Glad to be
[71.52] here, sir. Glad to have you. So, John, I
[76.159] just recently spent a virtually a whole
[78.72] week with you and you with me and uh
[82.96] hold what group of what about 40 other
[84.96] people, I think. Yes, sir. I think it
[86.799] was 38. 38. Did that include the staff?
[90.56] I'm not sure. It was right around there.
[92.799] Okay. So, what were we doing? Well, we
[96.079] were touring uh the Lake Bonavville
[98.0] flood plane. Uhhuh.
[101.52] We started in Salt Lake City. We had
[104.96] some tour buses
[107.119] uh and a group of really fun,
[110.399] interesting people that uh many of who
[113.28] were old friends from previous events
[115.28] and tours that we've done. And we
[117.68] started in Salt Lake City and we drove
[120.159] north through Red Rock Pass out onto the
[123.6] Snake River plane. We diverted to the
[126.479] northeast and we visited the ruins of
[128.879] the uh Teton Dam disaster
[132.8] which was very interesting and
[134.56] informative in multiple ways. I I found
[137.44] Did you find that? Well, for me it was
[139.84] the highlight of the trip. We had a
[141.36] wonderful lady from the local museum
[143.68] come out and she gave us a great uh
[145.599] dissertation on the the building of the
[148.48] Teton Dam. But uh that was interesting
[151.92] and then also just the fallout from it
[153.68] and very enlightening in in the thought
[156.319] process of understanding the Bonavville
[158.48] flood. Yes, it was I even though it was
[161.92] an epic flood, a huge flood in its own
[164.64] right, it was still minuscule compared
[166.959] to the the ancient flood whose evidence
[170.64] we were following in the landscape. And
[173.84] I will mention that we got enough
[175.76] documentation and data that we we will
[178.319] be doing a presentation and telling that
[181.2] story. It's a it's a really valuable
[183.68] important story uh what happened uh
[187.04] because that was the last monumental dam
[191.28] uh project in America undertaken by the
[194.4] Bureau of Reclamation
[196.48] and there's a story that needs to be
[198.319] told there with multiple lessons that we
[200.8] can extract from it. So that will be
[203.599] coming up in the near future. We will
[205.599] get together and we we will tell that
[207.28] story about the Teton Dam disaster. Uh
[211.04] and then from there we followed the
[213.2] route of the Snake River which was the
[216.319] pathway of the great Bonavville flood
[220.72] and we saw some amazing landscapes. I
[223.92] think you would agree. Absolutely. It
[226.08] was gorgeous. Couldn't put the camera in
[228.0] an ugly position, right? or in a
[231.599] position that didn't have a
[234.0] hell of a story to tell. Yeah. Think
[236.799] about Massacre Rocks.
[240.08] My gosh, you know, when you're standing
[242.08] there or or Swan Falls Boulder Bar or
[246.56] the the canyon there at Shashon Falls, I
[249.36] mean, there was no Bruno Canyon. I mean,
[252.56] the list goes on. These were epic events
[257.12] that left a lasting imprint into the
[261.199] landscape of the western United States.
[264.88] And um I think everybody who was on that
[267.36] tour came away with their eyes opened to
[269.919] some of the
[271.759] incredible events uh mind-blowing events
[275.52] that have transpired in our own
[277.6] backyard. You know, at this point, I've
[279.84] spent many weeks, months traversing
[282.639] these landscapes that could only be
[285.84] created under conditions vastly
[288.24] different than what prevails there now
[290.88] in the present. It raises questions and
[293.759] those questions haven't been answered.
[297.28] Uh so we're faced with the idea that um
[302.24] you know there have been these
[304.08] tremendous outsized events that have
[307.12] occurred on this planet. And that
[310.0] coupled with the idea that we now know
[313.039] that life has been profoundly affected
[315.12] by catastrophic events.
[318.72] Mass extinction events have been not
[322.16] some well even the term mass extinction
[325.28] is relatively new in the lexicon. Once
[327.68] upon a time it was just extinctions
[330.08] because extinctions were considered to
[331.759] be long slow drawn out incremental
[334.88] things and as fast as species were going
[338.24] extinct they're being replaced. Right?
[341.68] Well that model of life history on Earth
[345.039] is completely obsolete. We now know
[347.52] there are these epic mass extinction
[350.16] events that might eliminate half, 3/4 or
[354.08] even 90% of all species on Earth, both
[358.88] terrestrial and marine. Well, the thing
[362.88] now I think that that we're we're moving
[365.28] towards is that same model applied to
[368.8] human civilization
[370.72] that we have to look at mass extinction
[372.96] events relative to human civilizations
[376.4] that have risen and then abruptly fallen
[379.919] for no obvious reason other than the
[383.039] fact that perhaps you had cultural
[385.759] groups that were not adaptable, not
[389.36] prepared for natural changes in the
[393.039] environment and the climate that
[395.199] basically pulled the rug out from their
[398.16] efforts from under their efforts.
[400.88] So I think this is one of the most
[403.68] important insights
[405.759] uh as an evolving civilization on earth
[408.4] that we can have is the realization that
[410.479] there have been these gigantic outsized
[413.919] events sometimes over vast areas of the
[417.6] earth's surface large regional events
[421.68] continental events and even global
[424.319] events right which leads us to I think
[428.08] some of the implications of what I call
[430.56] the new catastrophism.
[432.639] And one of the things I'd like to quote
[435.599] here is from a an interesting paper that
[437.919] came out. No gosh, when was it? Um
[441.599] I think it was uh 2020. Uh I'll I'll get
[446.16] the the the origin of this uh in a
[450.0] second here. But but let me quote from
[452.08] this paper. It was called it was by
[454.08] William E. Burroughs published December
[457.68] 14, 2020.
[460.08] Title of the paper is this, the big
[462.4] one's coming. If we don't want to go the
[465.68] way of the dinosaur,
[467.759] it's time to colonize the moon.
[470.8] Which I think brings us back to the
[472.4] discussion we had in the previous
[474.08] episode of Squaring the Circle. We're
[476.8] talking about finally now humankind is
[479.759] getting motivated and inspired to return
[482.8] to the moon. Okay. Now this interesting
[487.44] story and I will provide the the source
[489.36] for this so people can go in and read
[490.879] the whole thing for themselves because
[492.319] it's quite interesting but starts by
[495.12] quoting uh from a novel called Encounter
[498.4] with Tyber. So that apparently would
[501.12] maybe is a reference to Rome maybe which
[506.0] was founded by Ramulus and Reheis on the
[509.44] river Tyber.
[511.36] Um, so there was an epic novel written
[515.76] by Buzz Aldrin and who was an astronaut
[519.519] and John Barnes and in this novel they
[525.44] are the story revolves around an inter a
[529.12] multi-generational
[530.8] intergalactic spaceship
[533.68] and uh
[535.839] so there's a conversation going on
[537.519] between the commander called OEP Osapac
[541.92] or O o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o
[542.64] o ozapac oapo o o o o o o o o o o o o o
[544.24] o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o
[544.32] o o o o o o ozapac, I believe. I'm not
[545.519] sure how to pronounce it, but um she was
[549.2] the commander of this multigenerational
[551.279] intergalactic spaceship. And here's the
[553.839] quote. There's not a place in the
[556.64] universe that's safe forever.
[560.0] The universe is telling us spread out or
[564.56] wait around and die."
[568.16] End of quote.
[570.08] Then goes on to say, "Astronomers and
[571.839] scientists around the world who have
[573.76] studied the solar system and beyond have
[576.88] seen damage to every solid body they
[580.72] scrutinized
[582.24] and know that the universe is as
[584.64] abidingly dangerous as it is beautiful."
[588.56] as Galileo observed in the year 1610
[593.92] when he trained uh his primitive
[596.32] telescope on the moon and saw impact
[599.36] craters
[601.36] and I'll mention millions. We now know
[604.399] there's millions of impact craters on
[606.24] the moon. Solar system exploration has
[609.68] borne out what astronomers have seen.
[613.36] Voyager 2, the first interplanetary
[617.2] spacecraft to scrutinize the four major
[620.24] planets beyond Mars on its aptly named
[625.279] 12-year grand tour, sent imagery home
[631.04] that not only provided scientists with a
[633.279] virtual library of information on the
[635.12] planets, but that like its Pioneer 10
[638.399] and 11 predecessors
[640.72] showed the Jovian moons to be heavily
[643.519] cratered by impacts made by very large
[648.8] rocks moving at terrific speed.
[653.839] He then goes on to talk about one of my
[655.76] heroes, the late Jean Shoemaker, who was
[659.2] uh instrumental with his wife Carolyn
[662.24] and David Levy in the discovery of comet
[665.2] Shoemaker Levy 9, which we witnessed
[667.519] impacting Jupiter back in July of of of
[671.36] 1994. I think one of the most important
[673.76] astronomical events of the 20th century
[676.48] because it really did alert the human
[678.72] species that yes, giant impacts occur on
[683.04] planets. We're witnessing one, right?
[685.519] But not just one, we witnessed 21 of
[688.0] them. And I think that opened the door
[690.32] to something I had already suspected by
[692.399] then, which was that multiple impacts
[695.6] were far more common than we had
[697.519] imagined.
[699.04] So,
[700.56] uh, this this, uh, the big ones coming
[704.64] paper goes on to talk about Gene
[706.56] Shoemaker, who was actually killed in
[708.64] the outback of Australia, uh, going to,
[711.92] uh, research a crater that now bears his
[714.24] name, Shoemaker, uh, in in um, and while
[718.32] I'm reading this, you might pull up uh,
[720.16] an image, if you will, of Shoemaker
[721.92] Crater. So, Gene Shoemaker was a
[724.399] planetary geologist
[726.48] and he said that the next time a really
[728.959] big asteroid or comet crashes into
[731.12] Earth, it could cause an explosion
[733.92] equivalent to all the world's nuclear
[736.56] weapons going off at the same time. It
[739.68] could cause mass extermination.
[742.48] Now, while that's absolutely true, it's
[746.32] also true that a much smaller impact or
[750.959] maybe even a multiple impact event that
[755.2] did not carry nearly the energy, let's
[758.48] say, as the dinosaur killer maybe
[761.12] wouldn't cause a mass extinction that
[763.44] would show up in the geological or
[765.2] paleontological record millions of years
[767.36] from now, but it could certainly cause a
[770.88] civilizational or cultural mass
[773.279] extinction. Ask any dinosaur what that's
[775.92] like. Now, here here's the point I want
[778.079] to stress. What is the probabilities of
[780.56] a dinosaur scale impact occurring?
[783.12] They're very in any time in the next few
[785.2] centuries. Well, they're very low, but a
[788.56] much higher probability
[790.88] would be a much smaller event that
[793.36] maybe, like I said, would not cause a
[796.48] mass extinction on the scale of the the
[799.12] Great Five, which is something we
[801.2] actually need to dive into at some
[802.959] point, talking about those, but could
[806.32] certainly cause the collapse of
[807.76] civilization and not the extermination
[811.04] of the human species, but the the uh the
[814.959] retro progression of the human species
[818.0] back to a stone age existence
[820.88] because our technological civilization
[823.519] is actually far more vulnerable than
[827.2] people realize
[829.2] and uh even a small cosmic event could
[832.639] cause serious disruption. Here we go.
[835.36] The shoemaker impact structure lies in
[837.839] the arid central part of Western
[839.6] Australia near Wuna. The crater is about
[842.88] 30 kilometers or 18 miles in diameter
[846.16] and contains seasonal lakes. Yeah, we
[848.56] see some of those seasonal lakes there.
[850.959] So, they he was on his way to explore.
[853.04] He was exploring this and documenting
[854.88] this crater when he was killed
[856.959] apparently in a very
[859.519] uh uh freak accident. I mean, you're out
[863.04] in the back in in the in the Australian
[865.279] back country where you you presumably
[867.279] are not encountering heavy traffic and
[870.0] there was some kind of a a crash, I
[873.04] think, in his uh you might look up Jean
[875.6] Shoemaker and might tell us about his um
[878.56] his demise. I want people to know about
[880.48] Gene because he was heroic. He was the
[882.639] one that trained uh he was primarily uh
[885.36] the one who was in charge of training
[887.44] the Apollo astronauts and teaching them.
[890.56] Uh and some of the sites that I've been
[892.959] to were sites that NASA used to train
[896.16] astronauts to understand impact
[898.88] phenomena on the moon.
[901.6] Um, so he he passed away in a head-on
[904.959] car collision on the remote Taname track
[909.36] a few hundred kilometers northwest of
[911.36] Alice Springs, Australia. His wife, uh,
[914.72] Carolyn was severely injured in the
[917.12] crash.
[919.199] In 99, some of his ashes were carried to
[921.68] the moon by the Lunar Prospector space
[924.32] probe in a capsule designed by Carolyn
[926.72] uh, Porco. Oh, wow. Okay. See, I'd
[929.76] forgotten that. I remember now, but I
[931.68] had completely forgotten that that yes,
[934.399] some of his ashes were carried to the
[936.16] moon. And then what what happened to
[938.16] him? So that they were put on the
[940.32] Bearinger meteor crater. And a quotation
[943.44] from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet was
[945.6] inscribed there. And when he shall die,
[948.8] take him and cut him out in little
[951.44] stars. And he will make the face of
[954.16] heaven so fine that all the world will
[956.72] be in love with night and pay no worship
[959.36] to the garish sun.
[962.32] Wow.
[964.399] So that was gen. And um you know when I
[967.759] uh worked on the uh
[971.36] Fire from the Sky back in 96,
[974.72] we one of one of my regrets was that we
[977.199] did interview Jean Shoemaker, but I was
[979.519] not able to be present at that
[981.68] interview. But he was interviewed at my
[984.8] recommendation.
[986.399] Uh and uh so that that was a
[990.399] disappointment of of mine and I always
[992.24] thought I would get the chance to to
[993.92] meet him until of course freak out. I
[996.72] mean who would think you're going to get
[997.68] in a head-on collision out in the middle
[1000.0] of the Australian outback like it said
[1002.079] remote. Yeah. Yeah. So,
[1005.92] so anyways, in the paper by William
[1007.759] Burroughs, he goes on to say after um
[1011.68] referencing the dinosaur extinction, you
[1013.68] ask any dinosaur what that's like, he
[1016.16] then says, "It is therefore imperative
[1019.04] that we adopt a dual strategy for
[1021.6] survival. Start an active planetary
[1024.799] defense system that can spot potential
[1027.919] impactors close in and divert or destroy
[1030.72] them.
[1032.24] and establish colonies on other worlds
[1036.88] starting with the moon to spread out
[1040.4] rather than die. I will also mention
[1042.88] that there's another option there. He
[1045.839] says that we can spot potential a
[1048.64] impactors close in and divert or
[1050.96] destroy. On the other hand, those
[1053.6] impactors, bear in mind, the the the
[1056.72] more dangerous they are, the closer they
[1058.64] are coming to the earth. But the closer
[1061.039] they are to the Earth, the more
[1062.24] accessible they're going to be. And so I
[1065.36] want to see within a generation, I want
[1067.679] to see uh I want to see asteroid mining
[1072.559] uh getting underway, whether with humans
[1076.0] in space or robotic. Maybe it could
[1078.559] happen all robotically. I think that a
[1080.96] lot of it could, but I think that a
[1082.48] human presence um is still going to be
[1085.28] necessary. But I believe that that's
[1088.0] something that needs to happen sooner
[1090.08] rather than later. And of course, what
[1092.72] we now know about the asteroids uh as a
[1096.72] resource is that pretty much everything
[1100.88] that we're mining the earth that we're
[1103.2] extracting from the earth to build our
[1106.0] industrial civilization
[1108.08] is available in the asteroids
[1112.08] or the the lunar regulithm. Um, so with
[1115.919] that in mind, there's been several
[1118.32] interesting new developments in our
[1120.16] studies of the moon. Um, let's get into
[1123.28] that a little bit. Um, do we want to
[1125.919] talk about
[1127.679] uh the these tremendous Well, since
[1130.08] we've been talking about the potential
[1131.36] of impacts, let's look at this the
[1133.84] impact of uh one of the great impacts on
[1137.679] the moon which created the shoe marker.
[1141.039] Do you want to pull that one up again?
[1142.4] You had Yes, sir.
[1144.96] There's shoe maker and shoe marker.
[1147.28] Shoeacher. So, here's Shoeacher.
[1154.88] Is that it? Shoeacher. Shoeacher Crater.
[1158.4] Oh, Shoeacher Crater. Okay. I'm I'm
[1160.72] sorry. I was momentarily confused. I was
[1163.44] thinking of Schrodinger Crater.
[1166.0] Schrodinger Crater. Let me pull that one
[1167.679] up real quick. Yeah, because that's the
[1169.52] one that um that created the uh uh the
[1172.799] two valleys. The two valleys we want to
[1175.039] talk about. If people haven't seen this
[1176.72] already, if if you haven't already,
[1179.12] subscribe to my newsletter. Uh I I
[1181.76] covered this in the May newsletter from
[1184.4] this year, but let's get into it a
[1186.72] little bit here. Um ah there it is. This
[1190.799] is uh Schrodinger on the moon in the
[1195.039] southern part of the far side. Uh, and
[1198.24] this is close to where some of the
[1199.679] Aremis landings are supposed to take
[1202.32] place.
[1204.08] Several things interesting here. Notice,
[1207.44] uh, you've got this central ring here. I
[1212.0] don't see an uplift.
[1214.48] Uh, but there is a So, this was
[1216.559] originally a multi-ed crater.
[1220.72] Uh, see what can we find out about that
[1224.4] crater. Let's see
[1226.96] if uh Ooh, look at this. There's an
[1229.2] oblique view. Oops. Go back to where you
[1233.039] were. Okay. So, we can see I believe one
[1236.4] of the great canyons we see going off
[1238.799] here to the uh Yeah, right in there.
[1241.52] Yeah.
[1243.2] And we're going to we're going to be
[1244.32] looking at that. Uh Schrodinger. Uh pull
[1247.36] up the the the the data on Schrodinger.
[1251.12] Or I could do it if Let me see here.
[1253.6] I'll I'll I'll pull it up. So, there's
[1255.919] another one. Val plank extends from the
[1259.44] crater to the upper right of center. Oh,
[1261.52] look. Yeah, you can see it up here. See
[1263.28] this long? Yeah. Nice and clear.
[1267.52] Oh, yeah. Look at that.
[1270.48] So, two Grand Canyonized valleys on the
[1273.2] far side of the moon formed within 10
[1276.08] minutes. This is a headline from uh ABC
[1279.28] Action News.
[1281.76] Okay. And you can see uh this is Val
[1284.799] Plank going up here to the left I
[1286.799] believe. And then Val uh Schrodinger is
[1291.28] the one going up to the right. It's not
[1294.32] quite as prominent, but there it is.
[1296.32] Yeah.
[1298.48] Yep. The impact here. And you have the
[1300.799] two valleys get carved out. Yeah. About
[1303.919] 3.8 Eight billion years ago, two massive
[1306.24] canyons
[1307.76] uh likely formed on the moon in a span
[1310.159] of less than 10 minutes.
[1312.799] Less than 10 minutes. Yeah, less than 10
[1315.12] minutes. The extraordinary formations,
[1316.799] each comparable in size to Earth's Grand
[1319.52] Canyon, are hidden on the far side of
[1321.039] the moon, the side that always faces
[1322.88] away from Earth cuz it's in a it's in a
[1325.679] stable orbit with the the far side
[1327.84] always being far away away from us. Yes.
[1331.039] Away from us. So the lunar canes are
[1332.96] both part of the larger Schroinger
[1334.88] impact basin where an object yet to be
[1337.44] identified slammed into the moon
[1339.2] billions of years ago. The colossal
[1340.96] impact also led to the creation of the
[1343.36] canyons as well according to a new study
[1345.84] published Tuesday. Uh yeah in the
[1349.44] journal of nature communications. Mhm.
[1352.799] We're taking a little bit of a detour
[1354.559] here to uh tell a story that I think is
[1357.6] going to be valuable. I was coming down
[1359.76] the stairs and I think somebody just
[1362.0] ahead of me had spilled a little bit. My
[1364.08] foot hit it, slid out from under me and
[1366.64] I tumbled down three or four stairs to
[1369.2] the bottom. I sure banged up my left
[1371.76] knee. It was painful but uh I was very
[1376.48] relieved to remember that I had brought
[1379.36] I happened to pack my CBD from the god
[1382.799] sav and I was really grateful that I had
[1387.28] remembered to do that. So, I that night
[1390.96] I put some of the SAV on, went to bed.
[1393.919] Though, I've I've, you know, being in
[1396.08] the construction and building industry,
[1397.84] I've had many falls and in uh injuries
[1400.24] and stuff, and I figured I'm going to be
[1402.799] laid up with this for a month. We drove
[1405.44] home. I think it was 3 to 4 days later.
[1407.679] I continued applying the SAV, and I
[1409.84] would say within a week, I was getting
[1412.08] around pretty good. I always bring the
[1414.0] oil uh when I travel and I I'm now after
[1417.52] this episode I'm like, "Okay, I'm always
[1419.44] gonna have the SAB with me, too." Okay,
[1421.76] so there it is. That's a nice clear
[1423.84] image. Um
[1427.039] let's go to the next image here. You can
[1429.44] see Okay, so here you can see right down
[1432.32] here is the South Pole. You see how
[1433.84] close it is to the South Pole and the
[1436.72] impact
[1438.4] uh occurred.
[1440.799] It came was would have been an oblique
[1442.559] impact coming in from like this
[1444.24] direction. If you can see my cursor and
[1447.36] you can see that the impact uh caused
[1452.0] this massive uh fan to spllay out. This
[1456.32] would have been a combination of debris
[1459.039] and uh magma formed in the tremendous
[1463.6] heat generated by the impact. And right
[1466.24] here, look at my cursor. You can see
[1468.559] here's one of the canyons and here's the
[1471.279] other canyon. And you can actually
[1473.279] follow those canyons like in a V. And
[1476.32] that's that point is where the first
[1479.039] encounter would have occurred. And the
[1481.36] object was probably moving at, you know,
[1483.6] 30 miles per second, something like
[1485.52] that. And so when it hit and made a
[1488.72] massive explosion, plowed into the crust
[1491.12] of the of the uh moon, I think the EV it
[1495.6] was uh estimated to be at least 15 miles
[1498.559] deep originally.
[1501.679] Um and so here's an oblique view and you
[1505.52] can see the two canyons. Here's Plank
[1508.48] coming out this way, long and linear.
[1511.36] And here's uh Schrodinger coming off
[1514.0] this way. You can see the arrows are
[1516.159] pointing to the two canyons.
[1519.039] They are larger and deeper than Grand
[1522.799] Canyon. They're comparing in Grand
[1524.24] Canyon, but they're actually greater in
[1526.4] scale than Grand Canyon. Let's go to the
[1528.64] next one here. So, here's the Grand
[1530.72] Canyon, 1.8 kilometers deep, right?
[1535.039] Distance along the transsect. So, this
[1536.799] is a transsect or a cross-section of the
[1540.08] deepest part of Grand Canyon. Okay? And
[1543.2] 1.8 8 km. That's about a mile, right?
[1546.64] Um, go to the next one and you'll see
[1549.52] that here is Val plank 2.6 kilometers.
[1553.36] Now, let me do a quick calculation. 2.6
[1555.919] times 180 even my mind. 280. So, that's
[1561.76] 1.6 miles deep. So, that's half again
[1567.12] more than the depth of Grand Canyon.
[1571.039] And uh
[1573.039] let's look at here. Apparent crater
[1574.799] floor, right? Is this prior to slumping
[1579.039] it was this,
[1581.52] right? So after the uh after the impact,
[1586.0] what they're calling here the post
[1587.2] impact fault, you had a lot of material
[1590.72] that slumped down into the crater,
[1593.76] filling the bottom of it. All right? And
[1596.48] then what they're calling the crater
[1598.159] brea lens. The brea is the fallback
[1600.88] stuff. So you have the impact, a bunch
[1603.919] of this stuff is blown up into the into
[1606.48] the sky. I won't say atmosphere because
[1609.039] moon doesn't have an atmosphere. And
[1610.799] then it falls back. So you had the
[1613.36] fallback brea that they've cut off the
[1616.88] bottom. So it was actually the original
[1618.88] crater or the original valley was
[1622.0] actually deeper.
[1624.08] Then you had this slumping into it that
[1626.96] made it even shallower, but it's still
[1628.72] 2.6 kilometers.
[1631.12] And uh let's see. I think the next one
[1633.84] shows how it was formed. So what you had
[1638.4] was imagine you've got this linear chain
[1641.919] of material being thrown out from the
[1643.919] impact. Here comes the impact in like
[1646.0] this at an oblique angle. Boom. It
[1648.72] explodes. But spled out from that point
[1652.4] of impact are two almost trains of
[1655.44] debris almost like we could imagine
[1657.84] Shoemaker Levy nine and then boom boom
[1660.72] boom boom they're hitting right after
[1662.88] one another in a chain or in a sequence
[1665.679] and that's what excavated and throughout
[1668.159] this. So it was this secondary impacts
[1671.76] that excavated the the canyons. So this
[1676.159] is um this is Schrodinger here and you
[1679.919] can see you can actually count one, two,
[1681.76] three, four, five, six, seven, eight
[1684.96] impacts just in this section right here
[1688.24] hitting each other just they would have
[1690.08] been closely spaced just like boom boom
[1692.799] boom boom boom boom boom right after one
[1694.559] another gouging out this tremendously
[1697.52] deep canyon.
[1700.0] Now on Earth, all of that would have
[1702.24] succumbed to erosion after this many,
[1705.039] you know, after this long. But here on
[1706.96] the here on the moon, it's perfectly
[1709.12] preserved. Perfectly preserved. Yes. And
[1712.32] so it gives us kind of an insight as to
[1714.24] what one of these impact events looks
[1716.0] like. Maybe not immediately after, but
[1718.96] we can reconstruct what what what it
[1721.12] would have looked like at the time.
[1722.72] Correct. Yeah. And that's why I think in
[1724.96] the in the opening statement, I referred
[1727.12] to the moon as the Rosetta Stone.
[1730.399] Because it uh because see here's the
[1732.559] thing. If if we were to remove the
[1734.72] geological processes on Earth, plate
[1737.6] tectonics, uh continental drift,
[1739.84] subduction, the biosphere, the
[1742.32] hydrosphere, the cryossphere, all of
[1744.799] these things that are constantly
[1747.12] modifying the surface of the earth,
[1749.76] guess what? It would look like the moon.
[1753.2] It would look like the moon. And if
[1755.44] anyone doubts that impacts are an
[1758.32] ongoing process in the solar system, I
[1761.36] mean, just go out with a pair of
[1763.279] binoculars at night and look at the
[1764.96] moon. Just look at the moon and then
[1767.52] remember that, oh yeah, there was a lot
[1769.679] of there was the there was the great
[1771.12] bombardment episode, sure, billions of
[1774.159] years ago, but it's been ongoing since.
[1777.52] And what is what this is was shown to us
[1780.64] demonstrated directly by Shoemaker Levy
[1783.679] 9 in 1994. You know, I think it was
[1786.559] Shoemaker himself or one one of the the
[1788.64] planetary geologists that said this is a
[1790.64] once in a-lifetime event. And my
[1793.36] response is, well, okay, but what do we
[1795.679] mean by that? You know, yeah, nobody
[1798.559] expected to see anything like that. It
[1801.279] was completely unexpected. And there was
[1803.84] a lot of astronomers
[1805.84] that began to reconsider
[1808.399] the pro impact probabilities in the uh
[1811.12] aftermath post Shoemaker leaving 9
[1814.799] reality.
[1816.64] And you know again how we've got one
[1819.52] example and I don't know what your
[1822.64] statistical
[1824.48] uh framework would be but what that
[1827.36] tells me is the very real possibility
[1829.679] that events like that are way more
[1832.88] numerous than we had imagined
[1835.76] if we were to see it again something
[1837.36] like that again. I mean is it going to
[1839.44] be a million years before something like
[1841.2] that happens again a thousand years a
[1844.32] century a decade? We don't know. We
[1847.679] don't know. The next graphic is really
[1850.32] cool because it kind of shows the uh the
[1853.76] scale. Uh let's see which one was this?
[1855.919] This was Shoemaker. I mean Schrodanger.
[1858.399] You can see the astronauts here standing
[1861.44] on the rim looking into this valley
[1863.52] that's bigger and deeper than Grand
[1866.24] Canyon. And I sure would like to live to
[1869.039] see the day when humans are standing on
[1871.919] the rim of this canyon.
[1875.679] I want to see drone footage. A drone
[1878.32] flying up this canyon
[1881.52] or close or close. I want that.
[1885.679] And I think I would like to see
[1887.76] millions, even billions of other of my
[1889.76] fellow humans want that same thing
[1892.799] because again, the question is what's
[1895.6] the alternative?
[1897.76] What is it? If if you don't want to do
[1899.679] this, if you don't think we should
[1901.12] expand into the into the cosmic
[1903.44] frontier, what's your alternative?
[1907.36] I'll relapse into the hedenism, but
[1909.12] that's a different topic for a different
[1910.559] time.
[1912.559] Relapse into heeden. Yeah. I mean, it
[1914.96] could
[1917.2] until of course the infrastructure of
[1919.039] our civilization collapses in in Yeah.
[1923.36] Yeah. But that's a different issue.
[1925.12] That's a different issue. But it would
[1927.679] be uh worth exploring. Let's talk about
[1931.36] some of the specifics of going back to
[1935.12] the moon.
[1937.2] And one of the things, of course, the
[1939.2] problem with establishing a lunar base,
[1942.08] a colony on the moon is the problem of
[1944.08] radiation.
[1946.559] And
[1948.559] uh
[1950.24] how do we solve that problem?
[1952.88] Well, there's there's a new discovery
[1954.88] out
[1957.44] on a really really interesting uh uh
[1961.279] cave under Mara Tranquilatus.
[1966.559] Yeah, let's uh Okay, so let's uh let's
[1971.84] segue into that by looking at the first
[1974.88] of all the one of the recent very recent
[1979.2] um
[1981.36] uh proposals that have been made for um
[1986.799] for uh solving that problem. This was uh
[1991.2] this was a paper that was published in
[1993.039] the journal planetary and space science.
[1995.679] this year. Uh just just just this past
[1998.559] April,
[2000.64] Sylvane Bluier and five others authored
[2004.08] this um it's entitled a regulithbased
[2008.64] lunar habitat for astronaut protection
[2011.919] and organ dose assessment. So this new
[2014.32] report uh was on ways to mitigate the
[2016.88] risk from galactic cosmic rays and solar
[2020.64] flares during lunar missions. Uh the
[2023.6] authors of this report point out that
[2026.08] and I'm going to quote here future
[2028.08] habitats must be designed with robust
[2031.76] shielding against these hazards.
[2034.72] Turns out there is a potential solution
[2037.2] in the form of lunar regulith. Now
[2040.399] here's the definition of lunar regulith.
[2043.76] The layer of loose rock, dust, sand, and
[2048.0] soil resting on the bedrock that
[2052.0] constitutes the surface layer of most
[2055.76] dry land on the Earth, the moon, and
[2059.119] other large solid aggregated celestial
[2063.839] objects.
[2066.159] End of end of definition. It is readily
[2069.44] available on the moon and it does not
[2072.48] incur heavy transport costs
[2075.52] uh that would be uh that would occur
[2078.48] with the lifting of pre-fabricated
[2080.639] materials from the earth.
[2083.04] Uh so for this work the authors
[2085.599] simulated the effectiveness of a
[2088.72] two-layer dome with an inner layer
[2091.44] consisting of a thin aluminum based
[2095.04] alloy covered by an outer layer composed
[2098.72] of regulith. So this is what the authors
[2101.839] explain in their introductory remarks.
[2107.04] Amid growing geopolitical competition,
[2110.72] national space agencies are increasingly
[2113.52] focused on returning to the moon. Unlike
[2116.72] the Apollo program, the Aremis program
[2119.359] aims to establish a permanent base where
[2122.64] astronauts will stay on the lunar
[2124.72] surface for extended periods ranging
[2127.44] from weeks to several months and brave
[2130.72] the harsh environmental conditions.
[2133.28] Among the foremost concerns is the
[2136.4] threat of space radiation and its
[2139.359] potential impact on astronauts in the
[2142.72] short and long term following exposure.
[2147.839] End of quote from the paper. So among
[2152.0] the radiation hazards that are faced by
[2154.88] astronauts are one solar energetic
[2159.28] particle events uh acronym SEP
[2163.839] that usually occur during solar maximum
[2166.56] periods when the sun goes into a
[2168.16] hyperactive stage. It starts spewing out
[2171.44] these highly energetic particles, right?
[2174.56] And this forms a a type of radiation
[2177.52] that could affect uh living things could
[2181.04] would certainly affect humans on the
[2183.68] moon. Right. The other one are galactic
[2186.56] cosmic rays that occur when the moon is
[2189.52] in a quiet period because the when the
[2192.0] moon is active. I mean sorry when the
[2194.64] sun is active it act the the uh solar uh
[2199.68] wind acts as a buffer that essentially
[2203.76] shields or insulates the earth from the
[2206.72] most intense of the galactic cosmic rays
[2210.64] uh which is symbolized by the uh acronym
[2213.28] GCR.
[2214.96] Uh so you have a highly energetic solar
[2219.2] particle events during periods of
[2221.52] hyperactive sun and during periods of
[2224.88] quiescent sun of inactivity you that now
[2229.04] allows the galactic cosmic rays to to
[2232.24] get in uh and so that dominates during
[2235.119] periods of solar inactivity. So these
[2238.0] two threats to astronaut safety are
[2240.4] considered distinct threats. Uh and they
[2243.359] have to be treated separately since they
[2245.359] uh their biological effects are between
[2248.8] GCRs and SCPs are different from each
[2252.16] other. And now I'm going to show a
[2254.4] diagram. So you can see here uh let me
[2257.28] just enlarge it a little bit more.
[2261.2] Okay. So this is uh you can see here
[2264.64] this is just a do it looks kind of small
[2267.2] to me. I think I'd be a bit
[2268.72] claustrophobic in that but the same
[2271.119] principle would occur on a larger scale.
[2274.24] And you can see here you got like the
[2276.16] virtual source which is the starting
[2278.079] surface and then you've got your here's
[2280.32] your 4mm thick uh aluminum dome uh and
[2285.04] then you've got your layer of regulith.
[2287.76] And so right here, this is showing this
[2289.52] would be enough to uh to mitigate or
[2293.359] filter out the the cosmic rays and the
[2295.839] solar energetic particles. And then you
[2298.72] can see sort of a a 3D view over here.
[2302.96] See, maybe I could even go in a little
[2304.72] further.
[2310.88] So that's one possibility of creating
[2313.76] these domes. Now, how could you do that?
[2316.56] um on a larger scale. Well, that's being
[2319.2] explored right now as we speak. So,
[2322.16] that's one possibility, but there's
[2323.76] another possibility that you were
[2325.599] actually referring to a few minutes ago.
[2328.88] And
[2330.8] what was that? What was that
[2332.8] possibility? Do you remember? Yeah, I
[2335.2] do. So, we were kind of talking a little
[2337.599] bit about the uh the cave that has been
[2342.079] discovered
[2343.68] on Mar Tranquilatus.
[2346.48] And this cave is really interesting
[2349.92] because it's a lot wider underneath than
[2354.56] it is at the surface. There is a there's
[2357.04] a sistern like cavern here. And this
[2361.76] also from NASA. If you're listening on
[2363.839] audio, my apologies, but I'll try to
[2366.079] explain as best as possible. Uh, thank
[2368.4] you for being on Apple or Spotify,
[2371.44] wherever, but we're also on YouTube and
[2373.119] Rumble. But we're looking at a 100 meter
[2376.8] crosssection at the top for this one
[2379.28] cave. And now we have evidence of
[2382.96] conduit caves that are 170 m deep. So
[2387.359] 100 m wide, 170 m deep.
[2391.52] potentially conduit caves connecting
[2395.52] some of these openings in the lunar
[2398.4] regulith and actually the lunar surface
[2400.72] uh rock. We actually have uh
[2404.48] a place where you could build a space
[2408.16] station or uh habitation a colony full
[2412.56] colony below the surface of the moon
[2415.839] which is amazing. And before you say,
[2418.8] "Well, there's no resources." Well,
[2421.04] there's some there there's some other
[2422.4] really interesting uh evidence. By the
[2424.72] way, we were talking about the moon
[2426.48] being a a fantastic time capsule. Uh
[2431.599] real quick, I I'll share this. This is
[2434.48] from NASA. NASA mission uncovers the
[2436.8] moon's buried treasures. Again, we'll
[2438.24] put this link in the description, but
[2439.599] this is really interesting. NASA has
[2441.68] convincingly confirmed the presence of
[2443.68] water ice and characterized its patchy
[2446.56] distribution in permanent the
[2448.48] permanently shadowed regions of the moon
[2450.24] like the cave that we were just speaking
[2451.839] about. They dropped one of the uh uh
[2455.92] boosters from the LCSS.
[2460.72] Uh and when that impacted it kicked up a
[2465.599] huge regulith uh uh plume and in that
[2470.16] plume or read from here the twin impacts
[2472.88] of the LCSS and a companion rocket stage
[2475.76] in the moon's uh cious crater on October
[2479.2] 9th 2009 lifted a plume of material that
[2482.72] might not have seen direct sunlight for
[2484.72] billions of years. As the plume traveled
[2487.04] nearly 10 miles above the rim of Cabius,
[2489.839] instruments aboard the LCSS
[2492.8] and the LRO made observations of the
[2495.28] crater and debris in the vapor clouds.
[2497.76] That's the important part here. After
[2500.319] impacts, grains of mostly pure water ice
[2504.56] uh were lofted into the sunlight in the
[2506.56] vacuum of space. Seeing mostly pure
[2509.28] water uh ice grains in the plume means
[2511.599] water ice was somehow delivered to the
[2513.359] moon in the past or this is important
[2516.4] chemical processes have been causing ice
[2518.48] to accumulate in large quantities. They
[2521.28] also see uh uh volatile compounds and uh
[2525.52] you know like methane and a few other
[2527.28] things present in this discovery. So
[2531.68] really, really interesting stuff that is
[2534.24] being kept in craters just like the one
[2538.64] here near the Apollo landing site,
[2541.44] Apollo 11 site and uh possibly really
[2545.04] good institute uh uh resource mining
[2548.16] available, but either comets
[2551.839] or you know and some of this might be
[2554.64] comet debris, but there there are some
[2557.04] other explanations too and I don't know
[2558.4] if we'll get to it this time, but it's
[2561.359] that there are some interesting
[2562.48] explanations potentially for how ice is
[2565.04] forming on the moon chemically. Well,
[2567.839] yeah. I mean, I first became aware of
[2570.0] these holes back in 2010.
[2573.76] Uh where was it? It was uh
[2577.76] was it in the journal Science? Let's
[2579.599] see.
[2581.2] It was a it was an article entire down
[2583.599] the lunar rabbit hole.
[2586.64] This was published on July 20th. Again,
[2589.2] I can I'll find out the uh the exact uh
[2592.8] reference and we can include that. But
[2595.359] uh July 12th, 2010,
[2600.0] uh a whole new world came to life for
[2604.24] Alice when she followed the white rabbit
[2607.04] down the hole. There was a grinning cat,
[2610.319] a hookah smoking caterpillar, a mad
[2613.2] hatter, and much more. It makes you
[2615.68] wonder what's waiting down the rabbit
[2618.0] hole on the moon. NASA's Lunar
[2621.52] Reconnaissance Orbiter or LRO is beaming
[2624.96] back images of caverns hundreds of feet
[2628.16] deep, beckoning scientists to follow,
[2632.8] says Mark Robinson of Arizona State
[2634.96] University, principal investigator of
[2637.76] the LRO camera said they could be
[2640.48] entrances to a geologic wonderland.
[2644.56] We believe the giant holes are skylights
[2647.28] that formed when the ceilings of
[2650.079] underground lava tubes collapsed.
[2653.28] Japan's Kagu Kagu Kaguya
[2657.92] spacecraft first photographed the
[2660.8] enormous caverns last year. Now, the
[2664.24] powerful lunar reconnaissance orbiter
[2666.48] camera, the same camera that
[2668.56] photographed Apollo landers and
[2670.16] astronauts tracks in the moon dust, is
[2673.04] giving us enticing highresolution images
[2676.8] of the cavern's entrances and their
[2679.359] surroundings.
[2680.96] So, here we go. Look at this is one
[2682.8] here. This pit in the moon's Marius
[2685.599] Hills is big enough to fit the White
[2688.16] House completely inside.
[2692.24] And then we have another one. This
[2694.88] cavern in Mari Ineni Inenia Ineni is
[2699.68] almost twice the size of the previous
[2702.0] one in the Marius Hills. So nobody knows
[2705.44] how deep these things go. They could go
[2707.52] into a huge honeycombed labyrinth of
[2711.28] underground caves.
[2713.839] And as it turns out, those caves would
[2716.0] be ideal for being shielding astronauts
[2720.88] or colonies or whatever it might be.
[2725.839] Fahrenheit
[2727.44] consistently inside those caves
[2728.96] consistently inside those caves where
[2731.359] you have 200 I think it's 230 during the
[2733.92] day and negative something. Uh I'll I'll
[2737.68] I'll pull those exact numbers up. I
[2739.119] won't misspeak, but keep going. Yeah. So
[2741.76] I mean with with that knowledge now it
[2744.96] changes the whole equation of colonies
[2747.92] on the moon.
[2749.92] It does. Now if we had an energy source
[2754.24] that becomes the next interesting
[2755.839] question that we'll explore in future
[2758.88] is innovations that are on the horizon
[2761.92] of energy sources that could be used to
[2764.96] power
[2767.68] and and we'll talk about geothermal on
[2770.319] the moon maybe next time because that's
[2773.359] a whole interesting study all on its
[2775.359] own. But 260
[2778.0] plus Fahrenheit,
[2779.92] 120 degrees C during the day. And I
[2782.64] misspoke, negative 280°
[2786.4] at nighttime.
[2789.28] 170°. So that gets a bit chilly.
[2793.76] So compare that to 67° Fahrenheit, 17° C
[2799.76] all day.
[2802.24] 57 or 67? 60 uh 63°. Here we go. So I I
[2807.599] I read one that said 67 and this one
[2810.24] says 63. It's 17 C. Well, that's So I
[2814.319] mean that's to me I love a 67 degree
[2818.64] temperature. Yeah. I'm too warm when
[2821.92] it's 70°. I like s in the 60s. So 63
[2825.839] it's perfect. Yeah. I'm from Minnesota,
[2828.079] right? Okay. So I like it a little
[2830.56] little cooler. Yeah. But so so there you
[2833.92] got Yeah. So now let's consider what
[2836.56] we've got. We've discovering that the
[2837.92] moon is an incredible source of
[2839.76] resources and raw materials. The
[2842.16] evidence is is really supporting the
[2845.599] notion that there's going to be abundant
[2847.92] water salvageable on the moon. We know
[2851.119] that some parts of the lunar regulith
[2853.76] are up to 40% oxygen. Now we have these
[2857.359] giant caves.
[2860.319] I mean, it almost looks like somebody
[2862.64] designed the moon just to be there
[2864.56] waiting for us so that we to make it a
[2867.119] little bit easier for us to become a
[2868.96] space fairing civilization.
[2871.52] Why not use it? Why not? So, the lunar
[2875.44] ark, this is one of the themes and ideas
[2878.079] now we've been discussing, but this was
[2881.2] way back in 2007. And I saved this cuz I
[2883.92] was already by 2007 I'd already been
[2886.56] thinking for at least a decade or more
[2888.8] that the moon was a likely perhaps arc
[2893.359] for the preservation of human
[2894.8] civilization in the event of a
[2896.8] catastrophe, a global catastrophe. This
[2899.2] is what what was published on August
[2901.44] 14th, 2007 in National Geographic. The
[2904.8] moon should be developed as a sanctuary
[2906.96] for civilization in case of a
[2909.28] cataclysmic cosmic impact. According to
[2912.319] an international team of experts, NASA
[2915.52] already has blueprints to create a
[2917.52] permanent lunar outpost by the 2020s.
[2920.64] Well, you see, just as always when
[2922.96] government does something, we're running
[2924.48] behind schedule, right? Um, and what
[2927.04] it's taken is some international
[2928.64] competition. It's taken the, you know,
[2931.04] China, India, Japan to say, well, screw
[2934.319] you. If you're going to sit on your
[2935.52] duff, we're going to the moon. And then
[2937.92] we have the private sector. You know,
[2940.0] for all whatever you may think about
[2941.76] Elon Musk, look, he's spearheading
[2945.92] what could potentially be one of the
[2947.44] most important evolutionary developments
[2949.28] of human civilization along with Jeff
[2952.0] Bezos. And I'm Let's not get into
[2954.4] talking about Katy Perry in space. You
[2957.599] know, who knows? I don't know. It looked
[2960.64] like a publicity stunt, but who knows? I
[2962.72] don't know. or or um you know Virgin
[2966.16] Galactic. There's other incipient
[2969.68] private space the private space industry
[2972.24] is set to really take off to the next
[2975.28] level and I'm 100% for it. Anyways,
[2978.4] let's go on here. Uh but that plan
[2981.04] should be uh expanded to include uh a
[2984.559] way to preserve humanity's learning,
[2987.44] culture, and technology if Earth is hit
[2990.079] by a doomsday asteroid or comet, said
[2992.72] Jim Burke of International Space
[2995.28] University in France. and we should
[2997.92] probably reach out to them. Um
[3001.839] because what I'd like to see happen is
[3003.599] an international network of space
[3006.16] enthusiasts getting together um to help
[3009.76] move this paradigm forward and convince
[3012.16] people um that it probably is presenting
[3015.599] the optimum option for the future of our
[3018.48] civilization on this planet. And if you
[3020.559] don't think so, well, articulate some
[3022.88] alternatives. I'd like to hear it. I
[3024.48] haven't heard them. I've been asking for
[3025.599] him for 40 years now and haven't heard
[3027.2] him. So, um, so Burke, once a project
[3031.28] manager on some of the earliest American
[3033.52] lunar landings, now heads an ISU study
[3036.72] on surviving a collision with a
[3038.319] near-Earth object. An impact of the size
[3041.359] that wiped out the dinosaurs hasn't
[3043.2] happened since long before the rise of
[3045.359] humans, he pointed out. Yet scientists
[3047.92] expanding knowledge of asteroids and
[3049.76] craters left throughout the solar system
[3052.079] has created a consensus that Earth
[3054.0] remains vulnerable to a civilization
[3056.8] crushing collision. And I've been
[3059.2] documenting many near misses since this
[3062.88] was published in 2007.
[3065.359] I started documenting near misses in
[3067.839] 1988. And there have been dozens. There
[3070.48] have been dozens. not ones that would
[3073.119] cause mass extinction on the scale of
[3074.8] the dinosaurs, but a considerable number
[3078.559] that could cause major disruptions to
[3081.599] civilization. Um,
[3084.48] uh, this called for the creation of a
[3088.24] space age Noah's arc, Burke said, a
[3091.28] lunar ark. Humans are just beginning to
[3094.48] send trinkets of technology and culture
[3096.72] into space. NASA's recently launched
[3099.68] Phoenix Mars lander, for example,
[3101.52] carries a mini disc inscribed with
[3104.16] stories, art, and music about Mars. The
[3108.559] Phoenix lander is a precursor mission.
[3112.4] uh in a decadesl long project to
[3114.96] transplant the essentials of humanity
[3117.599] onto the moon and eventually Mars. The
[3120.559] International Space University team is
[3123.359] now on a more ambitious mission to start
[3126.16] building a lunar biological and
[3128.8] historical archive.
[3131.119] uh initially through robotic landings on
[3133.599] the moon. Laying the foundation for
[3136.319] rebuilding the terrestrial internet plus
[3139.76] an earth moon extension of it should be
[3142.72] a priority.
[3145.52] The founders of the group Alliance to
[3148.0] Rescue Civilization
[3150.319] agreed that extending the internet from
[3152.64] the Earth to the Moon could help avert a
[3155.28] te technological dark age following
[3159.119] nuclear war, acts of terrorism, plague,
[3162.64] or asteroid collisions.
[3165.28] Um, and then we have a quote here. Read,
[3168.0] killer asteroids, a real but remote
[3170.48] risk. Uh but the group also advocates
[3173.44] creating a moon-based repository of
[3175.68] Earth's life complete with human staffed
[3179.04] uh facilities to preserve backups of
[3182.24] scientific and cultural achievements and
[3184.72] of the species important to our
[3186.8] civilization said ARC's Robert Shapiro a
[3190.16] biochemist at New York University. Now,
[3194.16] in 2007, there weren't any serious
[3197.76] concerns about nuclear war, but in the
[3200.64] last couple of years, we've moved
[3203.68] dangerously closer to that as a
[3206.64] possibility. And even now as we speak uh
[3211.76] the these corrupt leaders in in Europe
[3215.119] are proposing that Ukraine start
[3217.68] launching uh 300 mile 400 mile missiles
[3222.48] at Moscow
[3224.64] to achieve what? To accomplish what? So
[3228.72] see that's that to me symbolizes the
[3231.68] alternative. You know there there's a
[3234.24] major fork in the road. We're at this
[3235.76] fork right now and people need to
[3237.92]  wake up, right? Because one or
[3240.48] the other, we're going to go down this
[3242.319] road and and make no mistake, why are we
[3244.4] there? Again, it's about resources. It's
[3246.72] about who's going to control those
[3247.92] resources underground in Ukraine.
[3250.96] Trillions of dollars of resources,
[3253.44] precious metals, strategic metals,
[3255.44] hydrocarbons, natural gas, all of that,
[3258.48] right?
[3260.0] So, we're willing to risk World War II
[3262.319] and potentially nuclear war to struggle
[3265.839] over Earth's presumably
[3269.04] finite resources.
[3271.119] Are we going to go that route or are we
[3273.599] going to go the route of what we you and
[3275.839] I have just been talking about? Now, if
[3278.0] you don't believe, again, I'm going to
[3279.68] say this again. If you don't believe
[3281.839] that this is something we should pursue,
[3284.16] that we should be sitting down with the
[3285.68] Russians, the Chinese, whoever, the
[3288.0] Japanese, the Indian government, which
[3290.0] is now moving forward with a space
[3292.88] program, whoever it might be, right?
[3296.079] Even the probably the the Arab world now
[3298.64] is becoming more and more uh attuned to
[3302.319] the idea of of establishing their own
[3305.119] version of the space program. Well, we
[3308.16] need to be sitting down as an
[3309.76] international community and saying,
[3312.079] "What kind of a future are we going to
[3313.839] have?" If you don't want to do this, if
[3316.559] you don't think we need an outpost on
[3319.04] the moon, a colony on the moon, a base
[3321.04] on the moon, what's your alternative? I
[3324.559] want to hear it. I want to hear it in
[3325.839] detail. Articulate that. And if you
[3328.16] can't do it, then shut up and get on
[3329.92] board.
[3332.48] Right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, really what
[3336.64] what what it comes down to is do you
[3338.559] have a mindset of growing the pie or
[3340.96] fighting over the pieces? Do you want to
[3342.72] bake more? Exactly. Or you want to just
[3345.839] squabble. Well, well said. That's
[3348.24] exactly what it is. And there's a lot to
[3351.119] explore, a lot to do, and we should be
[3354.0] about doing that. Yeah. And so, Donald
[3357.2] Trump, are you listening?
[3359.599] You came in with some some, you know,
[3363.52] some things that I could have gotten
[3364.88] behind. Um, let's get on with the
[3368.079] program, Donald. We need to invigorate
[3370.72] our space program. You know, you're
[3373.2] saying we need a trillion dollars for
[3374.88] the military. Well, to do what? I want
[3376.96] to hear what our long-term strategic
[3379.52] goals are with a trillion dollar
[3382.0] military. Does that include
[3385.599] space or or or is the plan to just
[3387.92] militarize space? Um I don't think we
[3391.119] need to go down that route. Um and this
[3393.68] is why I would like to ally with uh
[3396.64] Space Force because I definitely know
[3398.96] there's interest in Space Force. I've
[3400.72] gotten this directly from former
[3402.799] Lieutenant Colonel Match Lommire who is
[3405.839] a friend of mine. We were actually going
[3408.96] to have a conference and I was going to
[3411.76] speak at it at Space Force about
[3414.88] planetary defense. This was precoid and
[3418.079] with the onset of CO well that got put
[3421.76] on hold and then we were regrouping
[3424.799] after CO when they started opening
[3426.799] things up again. Matt Lommire was
[3429.28] spearheading a uh a a second iteration
[3433.599] of the conference where we would be
[3436.16] discussing uh planetary defense. And
[3440.72] then what happened? Well, he wrote this
[3442.48] book right here, Irresistible
[3444.24] Revolution, talking about how the how
[3449.359] the Pentagon was succumbing to all of
[3451.839] this wokeness, diversity, equity,
[3454.48] inclusion was becoming more important
[3457.119] than merit, becoming more important than
[3459.76] skills and abilities. Um, in in an
[3463.52] institution where your abilities and
[3466.16] skills should be paramount above
[3468.4] everything else, right?
[3471.28] Um, and so because he wrote this book
[3473.92] and went on a couple of podcasts to talk
[3476.16] about it, he got booted from Space
[3478.64] Force. Um, he may end up becoming under
[3482.96] secretary of the Air Force. I hope he
[3485.119] gets approved. I haven't heard the
[3487.28] latest. I need to look at that where
[3488.88] that's at, if it's in limbo or what.
[3492.4] Um but yeah so I think there is an
[3496.16] interest in space force of and I think
[3499.2] that ultimately that is going to become
[3501.28] the ultimate rationale for the existence
[3504.48] of space force. I think that will at
[3507.44] some point supersede
[3510.079] uh you know the other ideas which are
[3513.119] you know securing uh space for American
[3517.76] interests and so on which I'm I'm for. I
[3520.64] don't want it to be taken over by
[3523.52] another country, but I believe we need
[3526.4] to pursue cooperative. I mean, I was
[3528.72] just looking into the um the building of
[3531.359] of Grand Coulie Dam and Hoover Dam,
[3533.76] which used to be called Boulder Dam. And
[3535.52] I have to confess, I liked the name.
[3537.52] When I was a kid, it was Boulder Dam and
[3539.52] then later changed to Hoover. I like to
[3542.799] I like Boulder Dam better, but when they
[3545.92] built uh when the when the uh bids were
[3548.88] let out um when the contracts were let
[3551.599] out for bidding on Grand Coulie Dam,
[3555.04] which at the time was the largest I
[3556.48] think was the largest engineering
[3557.839] project in the in the world at that
[3560.0] time. Um certainly it was in America.
[3562.96] Yeah. Well, it was certainly in North
[3564.24] America, but I think the world, right?
[3567.44] Um there was no single company that
[3570.4] could undertake the construction. Uh
[3574.16] there was it was a big complicated
[3577.599] project that had many facets and many
[3580.48] skill sets that needed to be integrated.
[3583.52] So what happened was three companies
[3585.28] that had been competitors formed a joint
[3588.079] venture. They be they formed a
[3589.599] consortium
[3591.2] and only that way were they able to pull
[3593.359] it off. like I think they it was in from
[3596.24] it took five years about I think it was
[3598.24] 1937 it was finished in 1942
[3601.599] when Boulder Dam was built and these are
[3603.76] huge complicated structures you had
[3606.799] literally six formally competitive
[3609.76] companies that formed a consortium and
[3612.88] under that cooperative approach they
[3616.16] were able to again create these
[3618.72] incredible monuments uh epic testimony
[3623.119] to the to the uh skills and abilities of
[3627.28] the engineering skills and abilities and
[3629.839] technical capabilities of humans when
[3632.64] when we um when we stop fighting each
[3636.0] other. Friendly competition, hell yeah.
[3639.28] Absolutely. Friendly competition is
[3641.92] great. But when we start killing each
[3644.319] other and throwing potentially nukes at
[3646.559] each other, we've gone too far,
[3649.2] right? And it's better at that point to
[3651.68] let's say hey let's work together
[3653.76] because we've got a much larger common
[3655.76] goal here where everybody's going to win
[3658.799] if we pull this thing off. So I kind of
[3662.0] look at now our space the the the the
[3665.68] creating a space fairing civilization
[3668.799] is the counterpart for our degeneration
[3672.16] alive on earth now to the great
[3674.64] cathedral building enterprise of the
[3677.04] high middle ages. when you had this
[3679.68] incredible cooperative effort coming
[3681.92] together across uh France, England,
[3685.2] Germany, hundreds of thousands of highly
[3689.68] skilled crafts people from stonemasons
[3694.16] to engineers to astronomers to
[3696.88] carpenters to glazers to sculptures uh
[3701.68] sculptors. All of these things were
[3704.319] brought together under this incredible
[3706.96] almost miraculous undertaking that we
[3710.64] should definitely talk about more
[3713.119] because I really do believe it provides
[3714.72] an analog because to pull off that
[3718.079] incredible epic enterprise of the Gothic
[3720.72] Cathedral building era, you had to have
[3724.559] the entire society motivated and
[3727.839] inspired and moved to do this or it
[3730.799] couldn't have happened Because for every
[3733.28] person working on the actual project
[3735.839] itself, whether they be stonemasons,
[3738.319] sculptors, glazers, carpenters, engine,
[3741.119] whatever, right? The vast diverse skill
[3744.16] set brought together for every one
[3745.839] person there had to be 10 people in the
[3748.0] supportive social infrastructure
[3750.64] to make that possible.
[3754.48] So I think that might be a good place to
[3756.16] leave it for this episode of Squaring
[3758.0] the Circle.
[3759.92] I think so. I think so. There's a lot
[3762.24] more to talk about and we will as we go
[3765.119] forward. We'll have to talk about uh
[3768.24] lunar.
[3770.24] Do do you want to talk about that?
[3773.52] LTPS. Yeah. Let's save that. We're
[3777.2] talking here.
[3779.28] John Arthur is referring to lunar
[3781.2] transient phenomenon. Yep. Very
[3784.48] interesting. Very interesting phenomena.
[3786.559] And maybe we'll get into some some more
[3789.359] stuff uh next time. I'll I'll I'll just
[3791.839] tease it. There was a lot that we were
[3793.119] talking about for this episode. We'll
[3794.559] save it for next time. Okay. Yeah, it'll
[3796.88] be fun. It'll It's going to be fun. And
[3799.2] it was fun seeing you again, John. It
[3801.839] was certainly fun being out in the field
[3803.599] with you. And uh I tell you, you made an
[3806.72] impression on everybody, man. Carrying
[3808.96] Tell what what that how much did that
[3811.44] camera setup weigh that you had? About
[3813.92] 25 pounds. Oh, well, that's not too bad.
[3816.4] But it was big and it was bulky and some
[3820.0] of those areas we went into climbing
[3822.16] down, climbing up, people were
[3824.799] impressed. John, you made a you made a
[3827.039] favorable impression on a lot of people.
[3830.24] It was it was fun. So, we've got that
[3833.76] stuff that's going to be coming up and
[3836.079] that is going to be some great stuff. I
[3838.559] cannot wait to see it. We're going to
[3841.28] have fun. What if I told you that the
[3844.559] moon has frequently exhibited
[3846.799] unexplained activity on its surface?
[3850.0] Flashing lights, mysterious fogs,
[3853.44] changing colors, ejections of vapor. For
[3858.0] centuries, inexplicable visual
[3860.16] phenomenon has been witnessed on the
[3862.4] moon. What explanations have been
[3864.96] offered by scientists for this activity
[3867.76] on a celestial body that is assumed to
[3870.48] be geologically dead? Is it assumed that
[3874.559] this activity is entirely natural in
[3877.76] origin? And if not, what could this
[3880.799] possibly imply?
[3883.039] Join me today as we dive into the
[3885.68] unanswered questions surrounding the
[3887.76] mysterious subject of transient lunar
[3890.96] phenomenon as well as other curious
[3894.0] lunar anomalies on Squaring the Circle.
[3898.0] [Music]
[3908.48] Greetings everyone. Welcome back to
[3910.319] another episode of Square in a Circle
[3913.039] and I am here today and I'm going to be
[3915.52] joined by my friend and colleague John
[3917.839] Arthur. Hello John. Good to see you
[3920.319] again. Good to see you as well sir.
[3922.4] Howdy. Here we are. Yes, here we are uh
[3925.599] once again diving into interesting
[3928.96] topics.
[3930.64] So far, John, the things we've been
[3932.559] talking about together on this program
[3936.16] uh to me have been extremely
[3938.72] interesting,
[3940.319] and it's great to have someone to
[3942.48] communicate uh with about these kinds of
[3945.599] topics who has an interest and
[3949.44] understands and gets it. So, we've got
[3952.799] some interesting stuff to dive into in
[3955.039] this episode. Uh in the opening
[3958.319] statement we I was talking about
[3960.64] transient lunar phenomenon or TLPS
[3965.28] transient lunar phenomena or TLPS are
[3969.76] eancent.
[3971.28] Hey there's a word for us eancent. While
[3974.4] I'm reading this why don't you look up
[3976.079] eancent.
[3977.599] I like that word.
[3979.359] TLPS are eancent
[3982.079] localized glows and obscurations
[3986.96] on the moon. Uh and then it's talking
[3991.28] about mentions three craters. Aristarus,
[3995.039] Alonsus and Schroeders Valley are
[3999.039] wellknown areas of activity.
[4002.799] The emitted light is usually described
[4004.96] as reddish or pinkish, sometimes with a
[4008.4] sparkling or flowing appearance. The
[4011.599] coloration may extend for a distance of
[4013.92] 10 10 miles or more on the lunar surface
[4017.68] with brighter spots 2 to three miles
[4020.72] across and is commonly associated with
[4025.119] now this is interesting veiling
[4028.24] of surface features. The average
[4031.2] duration of an event is some 20 minutes,
[4034.48] but it may persist intermittently for a
[4037.44] few hours.
[4039.2] No permanent alteration has been
[4041.2] detected at the site of any TLP.
[4044.16] These phenomena are regarded as distinct
[4047.68] from the possible low-level general
[4050.079] luminescence
[4051.599] most easily detected during a total
[4055.28] lunar eclipse.
[4058.079] So, what did we find for eancent? I want
[4060.4] to add that word to my vocabulary. So,
[4064.16] somebody says, "Well, how are how are
[4065.599] you feeling today, Randall?" And I can
[4067.44] say, "I'm feeling a bit eancent."
[4071.839] I have an eancent cold or I had an
[4075.359] eancent uh moment of heat exhaustion
[4079.28] today, meaning transient or soon passing
[4082.24] out of sight or memory.
[4085.039] Well, I don't Yeah. Well, then actually
[4087.28] sometimes I do feel a bit eancent like
[4090.64] like you're passing out of memory or out
[4092.24] of sight.
[4094.079] Yes. Um
[4097.759] well, there we go. Um
[4100.56] so transient something that is passing
[4103.359] by. So these are really really short.
[4105.44] Some of them are seconds, some of them
[4107.12] are minutes, some of them are hours.
[4108.719] Yeah. Well, here we've got some
[4111.199] interesting uh examples witnessed. Now,
[4113.679] this one, the first one here that um
[4117.52] this was going back to 1787.
[4121.04] Famous astronomer William Herschel. So,
[4124.159] in April of 1787,
[4127.04] astronomer William Hershel observed
[4130.159] three luminous spots on the moon's dark
[4133.679] side, interpreting them as active
[4136.88] volcanoes.
[4138.88] Now, how did astronomer William Hershel
[4142.0] observe three luminous spots on the
[4144.159] moon's dark side in 1787?
[4149.759] Interpreting them as active volcanoes.
[4152.64] Contemporary research suggests that
[4155.279] Hershel may have witnessed the impact of
[4157.6] a meteorite
[4159.44] possibly from the Lirid meteor shower
[4161.679] causing a transient glow due to impact
[4165.44] melt. Well, that would certainly make
[4167.04] sense, but I'm still not
[4170.239] uh
[4172.159] understanding how he would observe three
[4174.239] luminous spots on the moon's dark side.
[4176.799] It I'm I'm sure the accounts talking
[4178.88] about a partial a partial moon. Has to
[4182.159] be. It's got It's got to be. Yeah. Has
[4183.92] to be talking about that. And and so the
[4186.48] the one thing I find interesting is by
[4188.239] definition TLPS they generally say that
[4191.279] there's no um there's no deformation
[4196.239] related to TLPS. But the assumption here
[4199.52] is that obviously he he saw a meteorite
[4204.0] uh shower or meteorite impact. So that's
[4208.32] interesting to me because
[4211.44] they they've dated some of these these
[4215.679] impacts as uh much older
[4220.48] than some of these events
[4223.199] because it because of our basic
[4225.84] understanding of lunar geology. So, I'm
[4228.719] not I'm not sure what to make of that
[4231.36] because again, by definition, TLPS, they
[4234.32] want to classify them one way, but then
[4236.239] here we see it's a potentially a
[4239.12] meteorite impact. Don't know.
[4241.12] Interesting. Worth noting.
[4244.48] Okay, this is so now in 1866,
[4250.4] lunar. Yeah, I remember first reading
[4252.159] about this and thinking, well, now this
[4253.6] is certainly one of the more interesting
[4255.199] examples. In 1866, lunar observator
[4259.92] observer JF Julius Schmidt
[4265.04] reported that the lin
[4268.08] the lin lin l i n e with the little uh
[4272.96] uh mark above it. What? So that adds an
[4277.36] extra syllable I believe. Right. the
[4280.88] Lynn. But for now, the Lynn crater
[4284.159] previously documented as a prominent
[4286.88] feature. Hey, uh what why don't you pull
[4289.92] that up and see if we can get an image
[4291.44] of it. Uh yeah, absolutely. So, yeah,
[4295.679] this is from space.com. Let me let me
[4298.4] open this up real quick. And by the way,
[4300.0] you're correct. It is the Len Crater.
[4302.96] Yeah. Okay. Uh oop let me get the What
[4306.08] do you call that? Uh not hypocritical
[4308.239] marks. Um,
[4310.88] uh,
[4312.96] and throw that up real quick. Here we
[4315.44] go. Um,
[4318.64] Dioritical, I believe. Oh, look at that.
[4322.4] So, that's the Len Crater. Uhhuh.
[4327.199] Len Crater. Okay. So, listen to this.
[4329.36] what what JF Julius Schmidt reported in
[4333.12] 1866
[4334.96] that the Len crater previously
[4337.52] documented as a prominent feature had
[4340.08] seemingly vanished
[4342.96] or transformed into a mere white spot.
[4346.96] This observation sparked debates about
[4349.44] lunar surface changes and remains one of
[4352.239] the most discussed TLP cases.
[4357.36] Uh interesting. Okay. Then we have
[4360.32] another case here. On November 15th,
[4362.56] 1953,
[4364.32] Dr. Leon Stewart captured a photograph
[4366.96] of a bright flash on the moon, which he
[4370.159] interpreted as a meteorite, a meteor
[4372.4] impact. Decades later, researchers
[4376.159] identified a fresh lunar crater matching
[4378.96] the location and timing of Stuart's
[4381.76] observation,
[4383.36] providing rare photographic evidence of
[4385.36] a TLP. So there we go. I mean, so we've
[4388.719] got at least in one circumstances, we
[4391.36] have the evidence suggesting that it was
[4393.52] in fact a meteorite impact.
[4396.88] Um,
[4399.12] and then, uh, during the Apollo 17
[4402.4] mission in December 1972,
[4406.0] astronauts Harrison Schmidt and Ronald
[4409.36] Evans reported observing brief flashes
[4413.28] of light on the moon's surface while in
[4416.239] orbit. These observations added
[4419.12] credibility to TLP reports as they came
[4422.96] from trained observers in space. Now, my
[4426.64] first thought is is that a meteorite
[4428.88] impact is going to provide a single
[4431.36] flash.
[4433.04] And if you've got a flashing
[4436.4] or multiple flashes, what does that
[4439.36] mean?
[4442.96] Uh number of different question marks
[4445.199] are arisen. Are we looking at natural
[4446.88] phenomenon? What is this? I don't I
[4450.719] don't know. But uh let's see. Here's
[4454.64] another. This is from the book of the
[4456.64] moon by Thomas Hawkley
[4459.52] and he's asking this question. Is the
[4462.64] moon volcanically dead today?
[4467.199] Not necessarily. He says in recent times
[4471.12] there have been some notable
[4473.84] claims of observation
[4476.48] of activity on the moon. In 1958,
[4480.56] Nikolai Koserev who lived from 1908 to
[4485.6] 1983. I note there he's born in the same
[4488.32] year as the Tangusa event.
[4491.12] Uh he was with the Pul Pulovo
[4494.0] Astronomical Observatory in the USSR.
[4498.239] He saw a brightening around a crater. He
[4502.32] was able to obtain a spectrum of it
[4506.159] which he claimed showed the presence of
[4509.28] get this carbon containing gases.
[4514.8] Barbara Middhhurst has cataloged this
[4517.28] case as well as other reports of
[4520.08] transient lunar phenomena on the moon.
[4522.8] Barbara Middhhurst
[4525.199] maybe she has a book. Why don't you, if
[4527.76] you don't mind, Barbara Middlehurst,
[4531.199] just like it sounds.
[4538.96] So, Welsh astrometer. Uh, she lived from
[4542.159] 1915 to 1955.
[4544.719] Okay.
[4546.719] Uh, see, oh, she lived she retired to
[4549.92] Clear Lake Houston, the Nassville. Oh,
[4553.76] here, so to speak. and
[4557.76] see she was an editor for the
[4559.199] encyclopedia bratannica in this field.
[4565.12] Okay. Co-editor uh uh with Gerald uh
[4569.12] Koopier uh for telescopes 1960 the solar
[4573.04] system 3 planets and satellites solar
[4575.28] system 4 the moon meteorites and comets
[4578.96] that's where I know her name from
[4580.239] because I have the I've got that hard
[4582.32] book hard copy moon meteorites and
[4585.12] comets.t That's Yep. It's right up there
[4586.719] in the shelf. So, she was the editor of
[4589.84] that book, correct? Correct. Co-editor
[4592.64] with uh Gerard
[4595.199] Cupier. It's a ku i p. I think it's
[4600.48] pronounced kyper. Is that kyper? Yeah,
[4603.04] like kyper disc. Ah, yeah.
[4607.12] Looks like a good German name. Yes. So,
[4610.08] John, you actually learned something
[4611.84] today. Kyper. I did. I've been a little
[4613.679] frustrated in these episodes we've done
[4615.84] because you keep seeming like you
[4618.48] already know everything.
[4623.679] Uh,
[4625.36] okay. So, that's Barbara Middle. And
[4626.96] when did she pass? She passed away uh at
[4630.32] 95.
[4632.159] In what year? 1995. Oh, in 1995. So, in
[4637.12] 1995 she was 79.
[4641.44] Just missed 80. She just missed 80
[4643.76] years. She was in 1995. Uh born in 1915.
[4648.64] Uhhuh. Okay. That's when you after
[4650.32] Tangusa.
[4651.92] Yeah. Okay. So, Tangusa, that's kind of
[4653.92] like the the conometric standard now by
[4657.28] which everything is referred, right?
[4662.08] Before after Tangusa.
[4664.8] Yeah. Okay. So this is now this was an
[4667.76] article that came out in science news
[4670.64] back in 1971 during the heyday of Apollo
[4674.64] right October 23rd 1971
[4678.239] uh must have been an editor because we
[4680.96] don't we're not given the name of the uh
[4683.6] the author of this article but the title
[4685.92] is possible observation of water vapor
[4690.159] on the moon the presence or absence of
[4693.52] water vap of water on the moon is
[4696.8] central to theories of lunar origin and
[4698.96] development. And of course, the whole
[4700.159] question of water on the moon is still a
[4702.8] very important question, not as much now
[4705.679] as as far as questions of lunar origin
[4708.719] and development, but as far as lunar
[4710.88] colonization.
[4712.719] Um,
[4714.56] after examining returns of Apollo 11,
[4718.48] scientists were fairly convinced that
[4721.12] there was no water there because of the
[4723.44] lack of hydrris minerals,
[4726.239] those that contain O radicals
[4730.159] in the samples. They theorized,
[4732.8] therefore, that the original melt from
[4735.52] which the rocks were formed had very
[4738.159] little, if any, water. The returns from
[4742.0] Apollo 12, 14, and 15 seem to support
[4744.88] this finding.
[4746.88] Now, John W. Freeman Jr. and H Kent
[4751.12] Hills of Rice University in Houston have
[4755.12] announced what they believe to be water
[4757.6] vapor detected on the moon by the
[4761.52] Suprathermal
[4763.36] ion detector experiment or side.
[4768.159] Super ion uh detector experime super
[4774.08] supra thermal ion detector experiment.
[4779.12] Might look that up. Supra thermal supra
[4784.159] suprathermal
[4785.84] uh ion detector experiment
[4789.36] uh which goes by the acronym of side
[4792.64] just si
[4796.96] and pulling it up.
[4799.76] So that this was the the uh instrument
[4802.239] that they were using. Uh
[4805.84] the sides or super thermal ion detector
[4809.04] experiments have been quietly measuring
[4812.64] and then in in in quotes clouds
[4817.36] clouds of low energy ions
[4821.84] uh during the lunar day and before
[4824.159] sunrise and sunset.
[4827.28] ions thought to have escaped from the
[4829.36] Earth's magnetic bow shock wave and ions
[4833.76] from man-made impacts, lunar landings
[4836.88] and liftoffs.
[4840.0] So there could be water vapor, you know,
[4843.12] generated by uh as it says man-made
[4846.159] impacts, lunar landings and lifts off.
[4849.12] So the suprathermal ion detector
[4851.679] experiment, part of the LEAP package,
[4856.56] measured positive ions reaching the
[4858.8] lunar surface, including magnetospheric
[4862.0] ions and those generated from
[4863.76] ultraviolet ionization of the lunar
[4866.0] atmosphere and from the free streaming
[4869.52] solar wind/unar
[4872.0] surface interaction. Okay. Flux, number,
[4875.28] density, velocity, and energy unit
[4877.6] charge were determined for these ions.
[4880.8] The scientific objectives of the
[4882.88] experiment were to provide information
[4884.56] on the energy and mass spectra of the
[4887.199] positive ions close to the lunar
[4889.12] surface. Okay. Measure the flux and
[4891.84] energy spectrum of the positive ions in
[4894.0] the Earth's magn uh magneto tail.
[4898.32] Magneto tail. Yeah. on my computer on my
[4901.28] monitor the uh the text is very small.
[4905.12] Um
[4907.04] so okay well that kind of gives us an
[4909.04] idea. The experiment was housed in a
[4910.8] rectangular box which was deployed on
[4914.0] the surface of the moon by the
[4916.56] astronauts during their first EVA.
[4920.8] A bubble level on the top of the box was
[4923.199] used to ensure proper leveling. Well,
[4925.12] now that's what we use in uh you know in
[4928.32] in our carpentry work. We have a little
[4930.0] bubble level. Is that an image over
[4932.0] there on the left of the instrument
[4933.52] itself? Correct. Yes, it is. Let me let
[4936.239] me do that real quick. Okay. Just so we
[4939.52] can see what the instrument looks like.
[4941.04] This thing was sitting on the moon
[4944.239] and it was this thing that detected the
[4946.32] water vapor. Yep.
[4949.36] Okay.
[4951.04] Um,
[4953.36] so then let's go on and see what it
[4955.84] says. Okay, so it's monitoring Okay, so
[4959.28] it's monitoring um low energy ions
[4963.679] during the lunar day and before sunrise
[4966.0] and sunset. Ions thought to have escaped
[4968.719] from the Earth's magnetic bow shock wave
[4971.76] and the ions made from man-made impacts.
[4974.719] One, lunar landings and liftoffs. Okay,
[4978.239] so pretty standard stuff. Everybody's
[4980.88] okay. This is just what we would imagine
[4982.56] we it should be detecting.
[4985.199] But on March 7th, the instrument saw
[4989.36] something unusual
[4991.52] at the number 14 site.
[4994.48] A very high flux of ions in the spectrum
[4998.96] predicted for water vapor.
[5002.4] Apollo 12's side also detected the ions.
[5008.56] The flux of 783
[5011.28] counts per 1.2 seconds was much higher
[5015.199] than anything seen before, more than 100
[5019.04] times greater than that detected when
[5022.159] the lunar module vented.
[5024.96] Another unusual aspect of the detection
[5027.76] was that the flux occurred at the same
[5030.56] time that swarms of moon quakes were
[5034.32] detected.
[5036.639] Rumblings that lasted from 12 to 14
[5040.4] hours. The ion occurrence began shortly
[5044.159] after the moon quakes began and stopped
[5047.44] shortly after the quakes seized.
[5051.199] Freeman speculates that water vapor
[5053.36] could have come from a fissure created
[5055.76] by the quakes and says hills the
[5059.679] findings would not contradict the lack
[5062.48] of water vapor in materials found at the
[5064.96] surface if the vapor was coming from
[5070.0] deep within the lunar interior.
[5076.0] So
[5078.56] is
[5080.239] what would that imply or suggest if
[5082.159] water vapor is coming out of the moon
[5084.0] deep from within the lunar interior?
[5086.639] Well, one of the scientists
[5088.96] working on it, um, lunar scientist
[5092.639] Farooq Albbaz,
[5096.0] uh,
[5097.52] said this, "The implications, if the
[5101.44] observation is confirmed, are
[5104.639] considerable.
[5106.56] If water vapor is coming from the moon's
[5108.96] interior,
[5110.639] this is serious.
[5112.719] It means that there is a drastic
[5114.639] distinction between the different phases
[5116.8] in the lunar interior that the interior
[5120.32] is quite different from what we have
[5122.88] seen on the surface.
[5131.04] So this was uh from an article that
[5133.6] appeared in Sky and Telescope in 1991,
[5138.159] March of 1991,
[5140.719] simply entitled Lunar Transient
[5142.639] Phenomena.
[5145.04] Accounts of lunar transient phenomena,
[5147.84] TLPS,
[5149.52] are not new. Over the past 30 years, I
[5153.04] have collected close to 2,000
[5155.36] observations dating from as far back as
[5158.88] 557 AD.
[5162.96] Wow. So, somebody back there at the
[5165.679] early stages of the dark ages is
[5167.92] witnessing some kind of TLP up on the
[5170.719] moon.
[5172.239] Most are visual reports of bright spots,
[5176.4] flashes, hazes,
[5179.36] and curious temporary colorations of the
[5182.48] lunar soil.
[5184.48] Reputable observers such as William
[5186.48] Herschel, uh, Wilhel Wilhelm Stru and E
[5191.44] Barnard have seen them. Some LTPS have
[5196.8] even been photographed as well as
[5199.52] recorded polarometrically,
[5203.36] photototrically,
[5205.199] and spectroscopy.
[5208.32] Wait a minute. Spectroscopic.
[5211.52] I'll get it. Hang on. Spectroscopically.
[5216.96] Spectroscopically.
[5219.199] That's a mouthful. Spectros
[5222.239] spectroscopically
[5224.8] scopically scopically
[5227.52] scopically I'm going to have to practice
[5229.44] that one. Yeah, you you practice that
[5231.92] one. I'll practice I'll practice
[5233.679] magnanmity
[5235.199] as we were talking about before we got
[5236.88] on when you said magnamity. Magnamity.
[5242.719] Yikes.
[5245.76] Okay. Um, so yeah, I will uh it's
[5250.32] probably not that critical because we
[5252.159] don't use that word that frequently.
[5254.48] Like that's not a word I use like on a
[5256.4] daily basis. Spect spectroscopically.
[5259.44] Spectroscopically
[5262.08] spec spectroscopically.
[5264.159] I think I've got it. Yeah. Yet yet,
[5267.679] John. Despite a profusion of
[5270.159] observations and six Apollo missions to
[5273.44] the moon, the nature of LTPs remains
[5277.6] elusive
[5279.12] and their origin an enigma.
[5283.12] I like enigmas. They've always
[5285.679] fascinated things that don't seem to
[5288.239] quite have an expl ready explanation
[5291.199] that you can pull off the shelf.
[5294.0] Um,
[5296.56] so going on with the sky and telescope
[5299.44] article, about 200 of some 30,000 lunar
[5304.8] features visible in telescopes have been
[5308.48] recorded as LTP sources.
[5312.32] Half shown activity only once. Of the
[5316.08] remainder, a mere dozen features
[5318.719] contribute three4s of all reports. one
[5322.48] area, Aristotarkus,
[5324.8] Heroditus, and Schroeders's Valley is
[5328.159] responsible for fully onethird of the
[5330.4] total number cited. And I believe you
[5332.32] pulled up a image of uh Aristarkus,
[5336.32] didn't you? Yeah, previously. Let me
[5338.719] pull it up right now. And so, has
[5341.199] Heroditus uh one of those smaller
[5343.44] craters overlapping it? Maybe. Uh let me
[5347.12] pull that up.
[5350.88] I'll start here
[5353.679] and one moment.
[5360.56] So, here's a starkus.
[5363.199] Mhm.
[5366.4] And Herodotus is to the right of it. I
[5369.44] see what that looks like a long valley
[5372.32] extending out of it. Mhm. Now, that's
[5375.36] interesting. the light of our last
[5376.96] episode.
[5379.28] It's interesting how the formation is
[5381.76] has has run.
[5384.08] Mhm. Because that because it's at a
[5386.88] curve as opposed to the the other two
[5388.56] valleys that are a straight shot, right?
[5392.32] So, this is an oblique closeup. Oh, look
[5394.96] at this. Here's where you can see it in
[5396.4] the night sky. Okay. Okay.
[5401.04] And then this is a LRO knack image of
[5404.4] the central peak with colors showing
[5406.48] variations in the composition. Uhhuh. So
[5410.239] that's interesting.
[5414.719] That's the central peak. Okay.
[5417.76] This is from the Clementine.
[5419.92] Uhhuh. Okay.
[5422.56] All right. Here we go. This is money.
[5424.639] Aristarus Heroditus.
[5428.639] There we go.
[5430.88] Oh yeah. Here are starkus B
[5435.92] and Z up to the north. U T and S to the
[5440.08] south and F and H.
[5445.199] And for those of you on audio, we'll be
[5447.12] putting this in the uh uh the links to
[5449.52] these these different uh images
[5453.84] in the description.
[5456.88] Okay. Excellent.
[5458.8] And there's one last one.
[5461.84] And that is Aerist Starks. Look at that.
[5465.12] This is Aerist Starkus F. So it's the
[5466.8] one that we were looking at right here
[5470.96] below. I don't know if you're seeing me
[5472.32] here. Hover over it with your mouse. Oh,
[5474.56] yeah. There. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Got it.
[5477.28] So,
[5478.88] yeah.
[5480.88] And let's go to the
[5485.84] Yeah.
[5488.56] So pretty good.
[5492.32] Yeah, some good images there. Yep.
[5497.84] Uh, so the Aristarus Heroditus
[5501.92] Schroeders Valley. Could Schroers Valley
[5505.199] be that what we saw coming off of
[5508.08] Heroditus? Yes. Let me pull that back
[5509.92] up. Actually, it's just to the north uh
[5512.08] west.
[5513.679] So, let me see if I can get my cursor
[5515.6] here. Here we go. And that's it up
[5518.8] there. Just a little bit closer here.
[5523.199] Here we go. I got it. Valroi.
[5529.52] So, it is a second It is a second whole
[5532.88] whole uh uh impact site. It's not the
[5535.679] same.
[5538.32] But that's interesting. Is it a impact
[5540.88] site? cuz you see how the
[5544.159] valley actually
[5546.32] shifts to the west. We're taking bit a
[5549.28] little bit of a detour here to uh tell a
[5551.84] story that I think is going to be
[5553.84] valuable. I was coming down the stairs
[5556.239] and I think somebody just ahead of me
[5558.239] had spilled a little bit. My foot hit it
[5560.56] slid out from under me and I tumbled
[5562.96] down three or four stairs to the bottom.
[5565.52] I sure banged up my left knee. It was
[5568.56] painful but uh I was very relieved to
[5573.52] remember that I had brought I happened
[5575.44] to pack my CBD from the god sav and I
[5580.639] was really grateful that I had
[5582.88] remembered to do that. So, I that night
[5586.639] I put some of the sav on, went to bed.
[5589.52] Though, I've I've, you know, being in
[5591.679] the construction and building industry,
[5593.44] I've had many falls and in uh injuries
[5595.84] and stuff, and I figured I'm going to be
[5598.4] laid up with this for a month. We drove
[5601.12] home. I think it was 3 to 4 days later.
[5603.28] I continued applying the SAV, and I
[5605.44] would say within a week, I was getting
[5607.679] around pretty good. I always bring the
[5609.6] oil uh when I travel and I I'm now after
[5613.199] this episode I'm like okay I'm always
[5615.12] going to have the SAB with me too. Next
[5617.199] paragraph says that most LTP activity
[5621.92] occurs along the edges of Maria near
[5625.76] volcanic features like domes sineuous
[5629.12] reals and craters with dark halos or
[5633.04] floors.
[5634.639] But these regions, like the rest of the
[5637.679] moon, have long been considered
[5640.159] geologically dead.
[5643.84] But here's the thing. I looked it up. Uh
[5647.52] Valis uh uh Schroieri is believed to
[5650.719] have been formed by volcanic activity.
[5653.44] Oh, says says uh Peter Wolsuk from uh
[5657.679] observing the moon,
[5660.56] his book in in 2000 he published. Uhhuh.
[5665.679] So, we're starting we're starting to see
[5668.159] maybe there is some volcanic activity on
[5670.32] the moon. But the thing is though, okay,
[5674.48] so when we talk volcanic activity,
[5677.44] what time frame are we talking about?
[5679.28] this is something that would have
[5680.4] happened millions, hundreds of millions,
[5682.96] billions according to the standard
[5684.639] chronologies or is this something I mean
[5687.44] because we're looking at the the TLPs
[5689.92] now we're looking at are you know within
[5692.719] the well said I think we got the law the
[5694.96] the the earliest one we we had quoted
[5698.88] was 550 something. Yeah. Yep.
[5702.8] Okay. So now here's another one. On
[5704.719] January 24th, 1956,
[5708.639] amateur lunar observer R Hton
[5713.52] was drawing the crater libig lib
[5720.32] on the edge of Mare Humorum.
[5724.48] Oh, this ought to be interesting. When
[5726.88] something bright flashed in the field of
[5729.84] his 7-in telescope.
[5732.56] The flare came from the nearby crater
[5735.44] Caendish,
[5737.12] which was just emerging from the lunar
[5739.36] night.
[5740.88] Closer inspection
[5742.96] revealed that a peak on the crater's
[5745.679] eastern wall was repeatedly flashing.
[5751.199] Hton called astronomer Brian Warner and
[5753.84] told him what to look for. Warner 2 saw
[5757.76] the flashes and called them so
[5760.639] conspicuous that they were seen
[5763.52] immediately.
[5765.44] The other peaks in the vicinity remained
[5767.84] normal.
[5771.52] So the it was actually then uh the
[5774.639] flashing came from the crater Cavendish
[5779.12] starting with a C. Cavendish. Yes sir.
[5782.239] It's right here.
[5785.679] Wh let's do this. There we go.
[5789.44] Caendish. So I suppose that's the larger
[5791.76] crater.
[5794.56] Something that's interesting here that
[5796.639] just sort of an aside when you see these
[5799.84] overlapping craters. What that kind of
[5802.56] has allowed astronomers to do is to
[5804.719] establish a relative chronology. Not
[5807.28] absolute but relative. which simply
[5809.28] means that the smaller younger crater
[5812.8] the smaller crater is the younger is
[5815.44] younger than Cavendish. Why? Because it
[5818.239] it breaks and superimposes itself on the
[5820.88] rim. Whereas if Caendish was the younger
[5825.199] crater, its rim would remain intact and
[5828.239] you would only see like half of the
[5830.56] smaller crater. That makes sense,
[5832.08] doesn't it? Absolutely.
[5834.8] Um, and then this is Liebig. Again, for
[5838.639] those of you on audio, uh, just check
[5840.88] out the comment or check out the, uh,
[5842.88] description.
[5845.44] But this is big. Lie big on the moon.
[5848.48] Okay.
[5850.159] On the night of November 2nd to the 3
[5855.36] in 1958,
[5857.679] Soviet astronomer Nikolai A. Kazarev
[5862.56] witnessed a strange phenomena while
[5865.76] making spectrograms of the crater
[5867.84] Alonsus
[5870.4] with the Crimean Astrophysical
[5872.239] Observatory's 50-in reflector. The
[5875.36] crater Alonsus.
[5878.48] So that's a phusu.
[5883.04] As he watched through the telescope's
[5885.52] guiding eyepiece,
[5887.6] he saw the crater's central peak blur
[5890.88] and turn an unusual reddish color. The
[5894.719] spectrograms confirmed his visual
[5896.8] impressions of a volcanic event.
[5900.48] They show an emission spectrum of carbon
[5903.36] vapor. So there we go. Carbon vapor
[5906.159] again. So there's the crater central
[5908.88] peak. Very obvious in this one, isn't
[5911.6] it? Correct. Right. Central peak blur
[5914.96] and turn an unusual reddish color.
[5919.199] So,
[5920.88] okay. What? Okay. So, a vol uh a
[5924.4] volcanic event that's spewing out carbon
[5927.6] dioxide from the central peak of this
[5929.76] crater.
[5932.96] What's going on?
[5935.199] Carbon vapor.
[5937.36] H. What does that seem to imply?
[5942.48] Good question.
[5945.76] Okay. Then on July 19th, 1969,
[5950.0] the Apollo 11 command module had just
[5952.8] achieved orbit around the moon when the
[5954.639] mission control center in Houston,
[5956.4] Texas, received word that amateur
[5959.199] astronomers reported transient phenomena
[5962.719] in the vicinity of the crater Aistarus.
[5966.48] So Aristarkus seems to be a hot bed of
[5968.96] TLPS.
[5971.36] asked to check out the situation.
[5974.0] Astronaut Neil Armstrong looked out his
[5976.159] window toward the Earthlit region and
[5978.88] observed on quote area that is
[5982.639] considerably more illuminated than the
[5985.119] surrounding area. It seems to have a
[5988.56] slight amount of fluoresence
[5991.199] to it. Fluoresence.
[5995.28] So what is fluoresence?
[5998.32] F L O U R E S C E N C E fluoresence.
[6005.679] Uh looks like a lower. Yeah, just as uh
[6009.76] Heroditus here looks like is then
[6011.76] emerging from the lunar night.
[6015.28] And what is this coming up this way? Uh
[6018.719] here that's going to be uh Val Shreter.
[6023.52] Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
[6026.56] And so that seems to be somehow
[6029.679] associated with these craters. And
[6032.4] again, fellas is associated with
[6035.36] volcanic formation.
[6038.56] Not sure, but that's the current
[6040.719] hypothesis on on deck.
[6044.08] This is from an old journal from
[6046.239] Scientific American way back in the
[6048.0] early part of the 20th century.
[6050.639] John A. Cook is asking, "Is the moon a
[6054.32] dead world?"
[6056.8] So far as can be ascertained by the most
[6060.239] careful examination,
[6062.48] not the slightest change ever takes
[6065.04] place on its surface.
[6067.52] Thus wrote one of the world's greatest
[6070.08] astronomers, Simon Newome, in Astronomy
[6073.92] for Everybody, page 128, published in
[6077.199] 1910.
[6079.36] This appearance app this appears to be
[6082.0] the consensus of opinion among
[6084.0] astronomers.
[6085.84] Notwithstanding the evidence that the
[6087.76] crater len
[6090.08] was prior to the year 1866
[6094.32] a sixmile crater very deep visible under
[6098.56] all illuminations and that in that year
[6102.48] it became invisible for some months
[6106.159] seemingly concealed by a fog or haze
[6110.96] that hung over it and upon clearing up a
[6115.04] much smaller crater was in its place and
[6118.4] surrounding it a white spot like a drop
[6120.8] of white wash on the dark sea floor
[6124.159] occupying the space of the original
[6127.36] crater. There we go. This map is based
[6131.52] upon a survey of 300 TLPS
[6136.08] by Barbara Middlehurst and Patrick
[6138.08] Moore. Shows the approximate
[6140.08] distribution of observed events. Red
[6143.199] hued events are in red. The remainder
[6145.92] are in yellow. So every red dot that you
[6148.32] see was a TLP that had a red hue to it.
[6153.679] Uh the description this map displays an
[6156.32] approximate distribution of transient
[6158.32] lunar phenomena. It is based on a
[6161.28] monochrome map by Barbara Middlehurst
[6163.52] and Patrick Moore that was published in
[6165.199] the book on the moon in 2001.
[6168.639] Red dots indicate TLP that appeared to
[6171.84] the observer as a reddish cloud. Yellow
[6175.199] dots are all other events.
[6178.48] H you should you've got that interesting
[6181.76] video uh of some of the events. I think
[6184.96] maybe we should take a look at that. And
[6186.96] again from the lunar surface you can see
[6189.199] if you're on audio you can see a bright
[6191.199] flash that's very short. Mhm. This is a
[6195.36] black and white
[6197.6] effectively image here. So, we don't
[6199.92] know the hue, but it's very bright.
[6202.48] Yeah. Yeah, I see it.
[6206.159] And
[6208.239] Jim ID, where are we? We just missed it.
[6212.88] Here we go.
[6214.8] It's very faint. So, if you're watching,
[6217.119] you can see what we're talking about
[6218.8] here. Let's go a bit further.
[6223.76] And at the bottom of the screen,
[6228.08] thank you. I know you're sharing. I
[6230.88] don't need to see the sharing screen.
[6232.48] There we go. There's our little dot. Oh,
[6235.52] right down there. Play. Bottom center.
[6238.08] Right. Correct. Bottom center. Right at
[6239.679] the Yeah, right at the edge. And then
[6242.719] scroll just a bit further.
[6245.36] So, in the green box, you see that
[6247.04] little itty bitty light?
[6250.239] What's going on there?
[6253.28] It's interesting.
[6257.36] And then we have another one in the
[6258.8] green box bottom right.
[6262.08] Okay. Just just caught it. It was small,
[6264.4] but I saw a second. Yeah, it's a flash
[6267.84] in a pan. Then they have this UFO
[6270.159] caught. Now, we were talking, is this a
[6272.719] is this an aircraft
[6274.96] or or what? This is at the Alamo. Uh um
[6279.119] we looked that up before we started
[6280.96] tonight. And it's a 14-in
[6284.32] optic. So it's a 14-in element in the
[6287.52] bottom of the telescope.
[6290.48] So the main light gathering source.
[6292.96] Well,
[6294.639] I mean, would you would you capture an
[6297.199] image like that? Let's say it's an
[6298.96] airplane in the atmosphere.
[6302.639] Are you going to catch that in this?
[6308.0] I mean, when you're we're we're looking
[6309.36] at something that's quarter million
[6311.199] miles away. I know it's strange. Where
[6313.92] is this object within that in the depth
[6317.199] of field? Is it near to the camera? Is
[6320.48] it
[6322.32] out there? I mean, what the hell is it?
[6325.28] Yeah, explain that to people. You would
[6326.639] think it would be much much larger if
[6329.199] this was a an aircraft in atmosphere.
[6332.48] You would think, but someone who's much
[6334.719] smarter than I am and has actually lots
[6337.6] of experience with optics might be able
[6339.52] to to speak to that. If you know, hey,
[6341.92] drop that in the comment section. What
[6343.36] do you think? You think that's an
[6345.199] aircraft or is it something else?
[6348.719] So, looks looks to me like an aircraft,
[6351.84] but the but the perspective is odd. You
[6354.48] would think it would be much larger in
[6356.96] the element. Well, yeah, because if it's
[6360.159] close up, I mean, obviously the the
[6363.44] width of this thing here is you're
[6365.52] encompassing what here? 1,000 miles from
[6368.719] left to right of within the image. Yeah.
[6371.6] And then and then it's going to be
[6373.76] closer. If this is closer, obviously
[6376.8] it's closer, but if it was in say the
[6378.96] Earth's atmosphere,
[6381.76] um, wouldn't it pass through the frame
[6384.08] so fast we wouldn't even Yeah. I mean, I
[6387.6] don't know. This is weird. It is. It is
[6389.92] a very interesting video. Can we watch
[6392.88] the video of just the part where this
[6394.719] thing is flashing through the the the
[6397.04] field of view
[6399.04] that fast?
[6400.88] Do it again. What in the hell is
[6404.8] Yeah.
[6410.08] Huh. So, it's interesting. And this is
[6413.199] how fast it goes. It's
[6418.08] Here we go.
[6422.159] Just in, you know, a matter of a second
[6424.08] or two. It's across the frame. Mhm. But
[6426.96] it's quite a few frames for something
[6428.56] that would be an atmosphere. That's
[6430.96] interesting.
[6432.8] So, but we have all these small
[6435.52] transient phenomena, these little
[6437.119] blinking lights, these flashes, and some
[6439.119] of them are happening in the same place.
[6442.639] Which now we know that the moon is not
[6447.679] one homogeneous
[6449.76] chunk there. It's porous. Yeah. Talked
[6453.76] about last what it appears. And we'll
[6456.239] get into that in just a second. Well,
[6458.08] before we segue, we got that one last
[6461.199] case that's very interesting to me. Uh,
[6465.119] this was the record of Gervazi of
[6468.159] Canterbury.
[6469.92] He was an English monk and historian and
[6472.88] he's citing the eyewitness account of
[6476.159] five monks on the evening of June 18th,
[6479.52] 1178.
[6481.679] So what I'm going to read here is
[6483.04] translated directly from the Latin.
[6487.52] Now there was a bright new moon and as
[6490.88] usual in that phase its horns were
[6493.679] tilted toward the east.
[6499.76] Okay. And suddenly the upper horn split
[6504.56] in two.
[6506.639] From the midpoint of this division, a
[6510.0] flaming torch sprang up, spewing out
[6514.8] over considerable distance. Fire, hot
[6518.56] coals, and sparks. Meanwhile, the body
[6522.0] of the moon, which was below, writhed
[6524.88] and throbbed like a wounded snake.
[6531.36] So, what were they witnessing? Well,
[6532.96] let's see. It was um
[6537.76] it was uh Jack Horton. Jack Horton
[6542.96] suggested that possibly it was an impact
[6545.6] that produced Geo Georgano Bruno
[6551.119] crater. Pull up an image of that once.
[6553.84] And one reason why he now that's been
[6555.6] disputed. Others have thought uh that
[6558.88] Bruno Crater was too old. Uh I don't
[6562.08] have an opinion on the matter. However,
[6564.719] relatively speaking, Bruno Crater is
[6566.719] young. And one way that you know that
[6568.96] it's young is because the uh the uh
[6573.92] galactic cosmic rays haven't caused the
[6576.88] ejecta blanket to darken. The ejecta
[6579.28] blanket is very light. Yeah. Like you
[6581.76] can see right there. Um,
[6586.159] yeah, look at that. That's that's crater
[6588.32] Bruno. It's I think it's about 20 mi in
[6590.48] diameter
[6592.8] and uh
[6594.96] it's a very young relatively young
[6596.8] crater. So, uh, Horton proposed that
[6600.639] that it seemed to be about in the right
[6602.719] place one would expect it to be.
[6606.08] But uh whether Bruno Crater is or isn't
[6610.32] the cause of what these five monks
[6612.719] witnessed, they obviously witnessed
[6614.56] something.
[6616.08] And I would think that it sounds to me
[6619.119] like it was probably some type of an
[6621.119] impact event
[6623.119] being June in in June. And that would
[6626.159] have been uh that would have actually
[6629.92] when you adjust from the Julian to the
[6632.32] Gregorian calendar, this comes very
[6635.44] close to being uh the peak of the torid
[6637.76] meteor shower.
[6640.719] So this could have been I think this has
[6642.88] actually even been proposed this event
[6644.639] as being an impact of a torid meteor on
[6646.96] the moon in 1178.
[6651.76] And that's what I was alluding to
[6653.199] earlier. Some of these
[6655.44] are are dated. Some of these creators
[6657.28] are dated much older than uh uh
[6660.32] supposedly human human uh dwelling on
[6663.36] the on the earth is by the typical
[6665.199] geological, you know, historical
[6667.36] concept. And then this one,
[6671.84] I don't know, it's interesting. Yeah,
[6674.239] it'd make a lot of sense. And I think
[6676.159] you just reminded me of that word that I
[6678.4] was looking for earlier and I couldn't
[6681.28] think where they sometimes you hear
[6683.44] quite frequently people substituting the
[6686.239] letter B or inserting the letter B. So
[6690.08] I've got to get this off my chest if
[6692.0] that's okay. Okay. So there's a word
[6694.239] that Randall hates it when people insert
[6696.239] a B into this word. Yes. The word is
[6700.0] supposedly.
[6702.48] Supposedly.
[6704.08] supposedly.
[6706.32] And
[6708.0] supposedly, the way you pronounce
[6710.0] supposedly is supposedly.
[6714.239] However, I quite frequently hear people
[6717.52] pronouncing it supposedly.
[6721.599] I didn't say supposedly, did I? No, not
[6725.28] you, John. Because if you did say that,
[6727.76] John, I think I would immediately have
[6730.239] to be seeking a a new uh co-host, a new
[6734.08] producer. Yes, I think so. But
[6737.04] supposedly you would.
[6739.84] Supposably I would find a new producer.
[6744.48] Yes. Someone is typing a comment right
[6747.44] now. Hey, I say it that way. No. Okay.
[6750.96] Well, don't. So
[6753.76] supposedly
[6755.679] uh there is a ratio between crater width
[6759.44] and crater depth. This is from this is
[6762.159] one of the early books, one of my
[6763.599] favorites back when I really started
[6765.76] diving into this stuff kind of
[6768.239] semi-seriously.
[6770.239] uh Zedan Kopal Copal Kopal in 1979
[6775.36] wrote a book called the realm of the
[6777.599] terrestrial planets
[6780.32] and he's talking about the number of
[6781.92] craters on the moon.
[6784.239] He says the number of craters on the
[6786.08] moon is indeed immense.
[6790.159] Those with diameters in excess of 1
[6792.48] kilometer are estimated to more than
[6796.0] 300,000
[6798.32] on its visible hemisphere and to at
[6801.199] least 1 million on its far side.
[6804.88] Those smaller still number too many for
[6808.4] any realistic estimate. There are 16
[6812.08] formations of the type enclosed within
[6814.719] unbroken walls with diameters in excess
[6818.639] of 200 kilometers. The crater Clavius
[6823.199] Clavius near the moon's south pole is
[6826.4] one of them. And I think we were looking
[6828.159] at that a little earlier, weren't we?
[6831.199] Um the crater I believe it would be
[6834.56] Clavius, not Clavius. Clavius is
[6837.52] correct. Okay.
[6843.04] Uh, one second. That's That's Bruno.
[6846.239] There it is. Yeah.
[6849.84] Notice how
[6852.32] Okay. There. Yeah. How how you got these
[6854.639] smaller craters
[6857.119] uh juaposed on the rim of the larger
[6860.239] one, which, you know, immediately tells
[6862.4] you that they're obviously younger. All
[6864.4] of those craters in the middle, the
[6866.8] smaller ones that you see there, this
[6868.56] they're uh obviously formed. So, so
[6872.639] Clavius,
[6874.159] right? We we agreed it was Clavius. So,
[6876.159] Clavius formed first and then subsequent
[6879.599] to the formation of Clavius, you had all
[6881.679] these younger craters that were formed.
[6884.719] And the ratio you were looking for
[6886.239] earlier is 1.1 to uh uh sorry.11
[6892.239] to 2 uh oh I believe uh the diameter to
[6897.92] depth to depth diameter to depth say
[6900.56] that again I want to so let me let me
[6903.28] pull it up.1
[6905.199] to20
[6907.76] uh the the diameter will uh multiply the
[6911.04] diameter by 020 would be the diameter
[6915.04] Right. And 1.1 is the depth because
[6917.599] obviously the diameter is greater than
[6919.28] the depth. So So no, no, no. So So
[6922.0] you're you're you're in a range. So your
[6923.92] your depth your depth will be 10 11 11
[6928.4] to 20% of the D. Got Yeah. Yeah. Yes.
[6931.199] Got it. What? Say the Say the number
[6933.199] again. Right. So it's.11.1.
[6937.599] So let's say we have a crater that's 12
[6939.679] miles in diameter
[6942.159] times.11.
[6944.08] Its depth should be uh 1.32 miles.
[6949.44] That's or that's at one end of the spec
[6951.76] and the other one was 2 something. Uh
[6954.159] yeah 2.0. So it would be uh oh just
[6956.88] times two 2.4 miles in in depth in
[6960.0] depth. Right. Yeah. Okay. Thank you for
[6962.239] that. I knew that. I just didn't
[6964.4] understand what you were saying. Yeah, I
[6966.4] I apologize. It's okay, John. I I
[6969.28] forgive you. Um Thank you. Yes. Um but
[6973.44] you're going to I expect you will be
[6976.56] doing much better in the future, right?
[6978.88] Absolutely. Okay. All right. So 0.2. So
[6982.239] we're basically saying if we're using
[6984.88] 02, that's easy because now we're saying
[6986.639] the width is five times the depth.
[6989.119] Correct. So a 10 mile crater 2 miles
[6992.159] wide. Uh, I mean, sorry, 10 mile wide
[6995.119] crater, two miles deep. 20 mile crater,
[6998.32] four miles deep.
[7000.48] Right. Got it. So, he's talking here in
[7005.199] in the realm of the terrestrial planets.
[7008.159] Uh, he says there are 16 formations of
[7012.48] the type enclosed within unbroken walls
[7016.0] with diameters in excess of 200
[7018.56] kilometers.
[7020.4] Okay. So if we go I'm going to just I
[7022.239] like to think in miles. Uh so that's 120
[7025.84] miles. If I go times.2
[7029.19] [Music]
[7030.8] that's a depth of 24 miles.
[7036.48] The crater clavius near the moon's south
[7039.76] pole is one of them. Over 70 craters 32
[7043.199] of which are visible from the earth
[7045.44] possess diameters between 100 and 200
[7048.159] km. These are usually characterized by
[7051.599] fairly smooth floors sometimes checkered
[7054.8] by smaller craters such as for instance
[7058.719] clavius
[7060.239] which are again absent in others. The
[7064.08] elevation of their walls, one to three
[7067.199] kilometers,
[7069.04] represents so small a fraction of their
[7072.48] dimensions that even their rims are
[7076.4] mostly below the horizon for an observer
[7079.119] situated at the center.
[7085.52] And I have a graph here of a number of
[7089.44] these uh craters.
[7095.679] And you see the scale bar at the bottom.
[7098.719] So like Alonsus, right? That looks to be
[7103.119] darn close to maybe 80 to 90 miles in
[7106.0] diameter.
[7107.599] But again, what seems to happen here is
[7110.88] that the the the classical scaling ratio
[7115.84] diameter to depth seems to hold
[7120.0] uh until you get up to 18 or 20 miles,
[7122.8] right? But then crater diameter
[7126.239] continues to increase, but crater depth
[7129.199] does not.
[7132.88] Okay.
[7134.48] So what's going on here?
[7138.48] Like down here this. So we see that
[7140.4] Alphonsus has an central uplift peak.
[7143.119] Archimedes does not. But if Archimedes
[7146.719] look at looking at this scale bar, it
[7148.48] looks like Archimedes is roughly 50
[7152.0] miles in diameter.
[7154.32] So 50 times times.2 then is going to be
[7157.84] 10 miles in depth. It should be a hole
[7160.4] in the lunar. Now, I don't know if
[7162.159] that's the the original depth of the
[7166.239] crater or does that include the fallback
[7168.56] brecha that infills the crater and
[7170.8] usually makes the final crater uh
[7175.36] shallower than the transient crater when
[7179.199] all the stuff has been excavated, but
[7181.199] before it's infilled back in.
[7185.04] Let me see here. Look at the crater
[7188.239] Plato.
[7190.4] So
[7192.4] now look at look at the cross-section of
[7194.239] Capernicus there. What you can see there
[7196.0] is the central uplift and then you're
[7197.76] seeing the two flanking peaks. That
[7200.239] would be the cross-section of a central
[7202.0] ring.
[7205.76] You can see the Tiko has a central
[7207.679] uplift and so does would it be
[7210.639] Theophilus
[7212.48] more so than Theopilus? I think it would
[7215.119] be Theophilus
[7216.88] is what I'm guessing.
[7219.119] Now in earth the the infilling there's
[7222.48] definitely a distinction between the
[7225.52] three three things. Uh the maximum depth
[7230.0] which would be what's called the
[7231.44] transient crater.
[7233.92] Then in the say in the immediate
[7236.08] aftermath after all of the fallback
[7238.639] material and slumping has infilled the
[7242.239] crater and then over time often times
[7245.28] you'll have some rebound and subsequent
[7248.08] also infilling.
[7250.159] So in say in the immediate aftermath of
[7255.04] the at at in those first few seconds of
[7257.679] impact that's the maximum depth that's
[7260.0] the transient crater. Then you would
[7262.96] have in the days following, weeks
[7265.36] following, years following, you'll have
[7267.119] the second stage which has had the
[7269.52] material falling back in because there's
[7272.4] probably a lot of uh instabilities. Now,
[7276.08] this is on Earth, you're going to have
[7278.08] slumping and stuff, but on the moon as
[7280.32] well. It certainly has been observed on
[7282.4] Mars. And this is going to infill the
[7284.96] crater. And then over long periods of
[7287.36] time, you're going to have more sediment
[7288.96] accumulation and pro possibly some more
[7292.48] rebounding vertical movement upwards. So
[7296.08] the final depth of the crater may not be
[7300.0] close to what the original depth was.
[7301.92] But here,
[7304.0] you know, like looking at Archimedes and
[7305.679] Plato, okay, you got a 50- mile crater
[7308.639] that should be 20 miles deep, but or 10
[7312.8] miles deep rather. Um,
[7316.88] but where's the material that would
[7318.639] slump into it? I mean,
[7322.159] and is there rebound? Was it originally
[7324.719] five? Let's see. So, let's say 50 miles
[7327.679] deep times
[7329.599] um Yeah. So, that's 10 miles deep. So,
[7333.04] but how how deep is it? A few miles. So,
[7336.159] is there infilling? If there's material
[7338.159] infilling it, is that the case? Well, so
[7341.04] here's here's what they say on uh uh
[7343.84] this article for impact cratering
[7346.4] mechanics and crater morphology. So the
[7349.52] depth of a crater is considerably less
[7351.84] than the diameter. For example, simple
[7353.599] craters on the moon have a depth
[7355.04] diameter ratio of 1.4 to 2.0. That's
[7357.76] where we got it. The diameter is 57
[7359.84] times greater than the depth. For
[7361.84] complex craters on the moon larger than
[7364.48] 20 km, the depth of depth diameter ratio
[7368.159] ranges from uh 0.1 to 0.05. That's what
[7370.96] I was reading a moment ago. The diameter
[7372.8] is from 10 to 20 times larger than the
[7374.8] depth. This is because of the slumping
[7376.4] of the inner walls and formation to the
[7378.159] central peak causing uh causes a
[7380.96] shallower depth. But here's where th
[7382.639] this is this is what what I think is
[7385.119] necessary here. This uh to understand
[7388.0] strength of the of shock wave of the
[7389.92] shock waves is so great that the rocks
[7391.44] are subjected to enormous pressures. The
[7394.08] interaction of the shock waves with the
[7395.679] unconfined surface called a free surface
[7398.32] is responsible for excavating the
[7400.0] crater. After passage of the shock wave,
[7402.639] the compressed rock snaps back along the
[7405.84] free surface. This provide produces a
[7408.719] tensional uh uh wave called a
[7411.199] rarifaction wave. Okay. decompresses and
[7414.8] fractures the rock, setting it into
[7417.199] motion along the fracture planes. The
[7419.04] net effect is to momentarily convert the
[7421.679] rock into a fluid-like material that
[7423.679] moves laterally upward and out a city
[7426.8] growing excavation cavity. In the
[7428.0] meantime, the projectile has been
[7429.76] largely destroyed by the shock waves
[7431.199] generated it. So you you have some rare
[7433.44] faction that occurs to the earth or to
[7436.32] the moon in this case. Yeah. So I think
[7438.88] that's why especially with those larger
[7441.199] craters you actually have a momentary
[7445.52] uh rarifaction or it's I would use the
[7448.4] word liquefaction but it would be
[7449.599] incorrect but you have this moment of
[7453.679] uh sand being shooken by just the the
[7457.599] the intense slapback wave. Uhhuh. Uhhuh.
[7461.52] Sure. And allows it to kind of settle.
[7464.48] I've got a an aerial view of Meteor
[7467.04] Crater. the famous one.
[7470.0] Uh I think this is wrong. I think
[7473.76] there's been some discussion and at one
[7475.76] point
[7477.28] uh it was dated to 26,000 years, but I
[7480.639] think it's gone back to being closer to
[7483.119] 50,000 years. But the age is not the
[7486.719] important part here for this discussion.
[7488.639] It's the ratio of uh width to depth. So
[7492.96] you got three fifths of a mile. So 5,280
[7497.84] uh divided by 5 * 3 will give us 3,168
[7503.92] ft in diameter, right? And its depth uh
[7508.8] what it say 600 ft deep. So we divide
[7513.36] that by 600
[7515.84] and then we invert that. So we're
[7518.8] looking at a point about 0.19
[7521.76] right here is the ratio.
[7524.0] fits right in right in the zone. Right.
[7526.48] Yeah. Now, let's look at some of these
[7529.599] lunar craters
[7531.84] like Mari Serenatus.
[7534.239] Seren serenitatus,
[7537.36] right?
[7538.96] It's almost flat.
[7541.599] I mean,
[7543.76] and presumably it's a crater. And you
[7545.52] got another one here, one of the mares.
[7548.88] Um,
[7550.96] here's Theophilus, which is this right
[7554.4] here.
[7558.239] And you can see the smaller craters. You
[7560.32] can see here, they're they look just
[7562.88] from visual appearance like they're
[7564.239] fitting the ratio. And they've got
[7565.76] central uplifts.
[7567.76] There's no central uplift in Theophilos.
[7572.239] And here's Alonso right here. Another
[7575.36] view of Alonso. And look at this. must
[7577.28] be uh yeah, Tollameus, which is this is
[7582.56] the lower left. So you've got Tollus,
[7584.8] Alonsus, and then
[7588.08] no, the Aristarus, Heroditus was next to
[7590.719] Aristarus. So I don't know what this
[7592.8] crater is up here. But look, what is
[7596.239] striking me is that from this is that
[7598.48] once you get to Alonsus,
[7600.96] you're kind of at that transitional
[7602.88] stage where diameter continue to
[7605.36] enlarge.
[7607.04] But it doesn't get any deeper.
[7610.639] 0.05. So 5% to 10%
[7614.88] of the diameter at that size. Uhhuh.
[7618.239] Yeah.
[7619.92] Uh in the book The Moon and the Planets,
[7622.96] a catalog of astronomical anomalies by
[7626.88] uh William R. Coralus uh in 1985.
[7632.159] had a a
[7634.639] a heading in there a uh a a contribution
[7638.0] said entitled apparently anomalous
[7641.92] long-term persistence of craters.
[7645.36] Um, so he's talking here about quote an
[7650.0] un an and apparently unresolved paradox.
[7654.4] The science of realology
[7657.119] rho
[7659.199] log gy.
[7661.44] The science of realology deals with the
[7664.88] flow of solids under stress.
[7669.04] equations describing the deformation of
[7672.079] solids under the influence of prolonged
[7675.119] forces such as gravity are
[7677.44] welldeveloped.
[7679.199] That terrestrial rocks can deform in
[7682.0] relatively short periods of time can be
[7684.48] seen in the movements of salt and ice
[7688.32] glaciers and the sagging of old
[7691.44] tombstones under their own weight. The
[7694.719] thrust of this article is that the
[7696.56] moon's crater walls must flow like any
[7699.199] other solid. In fact, after three or
[7702.88] more billion years, the lunar craters
[7706.239] should all but have disappeared.
[7712.32] the unit of this. Oh, did you find a
[7714.639] definition for realology? Just to help
[7716.639] us get realology is the science uh that
[7720.88] studies the flow and deformation of
[7723.199] matter, especially materials that
[7725.199] exhibit both solid and liquid
[7726.8] characteristics. It focuses on how
[7728.8] materials behave when subjected to
[7730.48] forces, including their ability to flow,
[7732.8] change shape, and respond to stress.
[7736.639] Okay?
[7739.28] because I encountered the term quite
[7741.04] frequently when I'm trying to understand
[7742.639] the distribution of mass in the earth
[7744.96] that takes place between glacial and
[7746.96] interglacial transitions.
[7750.4] Um so this goes on the unit of viscosity
[7755.04] and that's the you could say the
[7757.599] sluggishness of of like if you have a
[7760.56] glass of milk and a glass of molasses.
[7764.239] The molasses is you pour them both out.
[7766.4] The molasses can take much longer and
[7768.88] slower because it has higher viscosity.
[7772.4] Uh and the unit of viscosity is the
[7775.36] poise pis
[7778.48] right viscosity.
[7781.679] So terrestrial rocks have viscosities
[7785.199] well under 10 the 23rd poisons or poise
[7789.84] poisons I guess. Uh
[7796.32] so granite for example is 10 to the 20th
[7799.76] poisonous.
[7801.28] What? Look up poises for us. So it was
[7804.32] uh poise is a measurement named after
[7807.44] Jean Marie Po.
[7810.159] Po
[7812.159] I I guess is how you would say his name.
[7814.0] It's a P O I S E UI L E. It is defined
[7819.76] as uh the viscosity of a fluid where a
[7822.56] sheer force of one dine that's dy ne per
[7826.88] square centimeter is required to
[7828.4] maintain a velocity difference of 1 cm
[7831.599] per second between two parallel planes 1
[7833.76] centimeter apart.
[7836.8] Okay. Okay. So, we're talking here about
[7839.76] viscosity
[7841.52] um and how the unit of measure. We don't
[7844.079] necessarily get into the uh scientific
[7847.52] definition of a poise. Simply, it's just
[7849.84] a unit of measure to determine how
[7852.639] readily a material will flow under
[7855.52] pressure,
[7858.159] whether that's gravity or some other
[7860.48] externally applied pressure. I would
[7863.04] suppose since they're using uh granite
[7865.84] as an example of 10 to the 20th poisons
[7869.599] that would be granite tested in some a
[7872.48] laboratory in some type of a machine
[7874.639] that would uh determine at what point it
[7878.96] reaches its elastic limit I'm guessing.
[7882.239] Um
[7884.0] so the unit of terrestrial rocks have
[7886.159] viscosities well under 10 the 23rd
[7888.719] poises for example granite is 10 to the
[7892.159] 20th poise by analogy to to terrestrial
[7896.159] rocks uh lunar rocks should be under or
[7901.52] the rocks composing craters should be
[7903.44] under 10 the 23rd poisones also lunar
[7907.28] basults for example are very much like
[7909.44] terrestrial basults. So using the
[7912.48] equations of realology, the lunar
[7915.84] craters should be flattened by gravity
[7919.84] in less than a million years
[7923.199] if the viscosities of similar
[7925.28] terrestrial rocks such as basaltt are
[7928.56] used.
[7930.4] Actually some scientists have have
[7932.4] estimated the viscosity of the lunar
[7934.639] crust at 10 to the 27th
[7938.96] power poisons based on the assumption
[7942.239] that the lunar crust solidified over 3
[7944.639] billion years ago. Uh in contrast the
[7948.639] viscosity of the terrestrial mal mantle
[7951.28] is usually taken as 10 the 22nd poisons.
[7954.56] So this is a factor of 10 the 5th lower.
[7958.4] So in other words, 10 to the 5ifth
[7960.0] lower, what is that? That's going to be
[7962.48] a 100,000.
[7964.8] 100,000. So in other words, the the
[7969.599] craters seem to be a 100,000 times more
[7973.52] rigid than you would expect to find
[7976.4] equivalent craters on Earth composed of
[7978.32] the same material. I think that's what
[7980.639] what this is telling us. That that's
[7983.04] based on the dating metric. Mhm.
[7986.88] So, what the heck is going on there?
[7990.48] Either the dating metrics wrong or or
[7992.719] the moon is very very hard. Very they're
[7997.84] or they're new
[8000.8] or they're new or they're new. They're
[8003.52] newer than a million years.
[8006.639] So,
[8008.32] which again would be the dating metric
[8009.76] would be there'd be something wrong with
[8011.44] our current understanding of the moon.
[8015.52] Something is not quite adding up here.
[8018.88] Yeah. Yeah.
[8021.199] Well, then there's something else. Uh
[8025.76] the size seismic signature of observed
[8029.199] moonquakes.
[8032.719] This is also now from the realm of
[8034.8] terrestrial planets. Same book.
[8038.159] The seismic signature of the observed
[8041.28] moon quakes is very different from that
[8044.56] of terrestrial earthquakes.
[8047.52] Whereas seismic disturbances on Earth
[8050.96] are damped out in a matter of minutes,
[8054.88] the aftermath of lunar tremors persists
[8058.239] for 60 to 100 minutes or even longer.
[8063.84] Such long echoes can be caused only by
[8067.199] an extraordinary amount of scattering of
[8069.84] seismic waves in a highly fragmented
[8073.28] surface layers.
[8075.76] Uh about 20 km deep in which
[8079.76] compressional waves propagate with a
[8081.84] velocity of about 7 kilometers per
[8084.239] second.
[8086.239] Below approximately 60 kilometers, this
[8088.56] velocity increases quite abruptly to 8.1
[8091.599] kilometers per second. Uh no doubt as a
[8094.88] result of a corresponding change in
[8096.8] composition. But I find this
[8098.239] interesting. Now it's from and then
[8100.639] remains the same from there down to at
[8102.639] least a thousand kilometers.
[8105.44] Uh
[8110.239] uh so it says here long echoes.
[8115.599] Echo.
[8117.119] I'm thinking an echo. We're we're
[8118.88] talking about echoes. Reverb baiting
[8122.079] within within the moon. Echoes.
[8126.32] How do you generate echoes? Have you
[8128.0] ever
[8130.32] been able to
[8132.48] produce an echo? Yeah, you find
[8135.599] somewhere where it's hollow and you
[8139.119] speak into it, whether it's a canyon or
[8141.84] a valley, somewhere where there's a lot
[8143.52] of space and takes a while for that to
[8146.239] come back. Back in the early 80s, I
[8150.32] started a drum circle
[8152.8] and my leading student, my old friend
[8155.84] Jerry, who played in the band with us,
[8157.76] he had a little shop
[8160.239] uh
[8161.92] outside in Atlanta. at a place called
[8163.92] Little Five Points. And there were, you
[8166.8] know, buildings. They were about two
[8168.239] stories tall, but when there was no
[8171.199] traffic, it you could actually get a an
[8174.079] echo. And we discovered that when we
[8176.96] were drumming,
[8179.679] the the the sound would be bouncing off
[8181.84] the building across the street with this
[8184.4] slight little delay, which was really
[8187.119] cool because it was almost like you were
[8189.52] playing with multiple drummers and you
[8191.36] were syncopating your uh your drumming,
[8195.04] right? But yes, I mean, the first thing
[8198.0] that come to my mind, of course, is a
[8199.84] canyon. We were
[8202.399] where were we just on the tour? We were
[8204.479] finding some echoes. Where was that? Was
[8206.24] that It wasn't Bruno. It was the one
[8208.319] right before Bruno with all of those
[8210.559] wonderful rock uh rocky banks. It was
[8215.12] I'm trying to remember. It was It was in
[8216.8] the raptor preserve.
[8219.2] Oh, and uh Wy, right? Wy Wyatt. Wyatt.
[8224.479] Wyatt was echoing. Yeeha or wahoo.
[8228.479] Wahoo.
[8231.439] Woohoo.
[8239.12] Yes. Okay, that's right. Wyatt uh
[8242.479] traditionally does that on every trip.
[8244.8] We We hear hollering and whooping,
[8248.0] echoing off in the distance. And we know
[8250.24] WY. Wyatt. See, I got you doing it now.
[8253.519] I'm sorry. Yeah. Wy Wyatt.
[8257.04] So, okay. This is interesting.
[8260.24] Uh
[8262.8] however, an analysis of seismic data
[8265.2] furnished by moon quakes with epicenters
[8267.439] on the moon's far side has shown that
[8270.08] for seismic events emerging from depths
[8272.559] greater than 1,000 kilometers
[8275.599] uh which is less than 700 km from the
[8278.559] moon's center, sheer waves cease to
[8281.92] leave any discernable trace in seismic
[8285.28] messages recorded on the surface.
[8288.88] So that must suggest that that zone
[8294.479] uh
[8296.08] from 700 kilometers
[8299.519] which is what about 450 miles maybe from
[8303.76] the center of the moon there's a zone in
[8305.84] there
[8307.76] where you have this echoing phenomena.
[8311.2] Uh
[8313.439] some would call that interesting worth
[8315.84] exploring.
[8317.359] Yeah. And here I have a graphic to show
[8319.519] some of the seismic signatures of three
[8321.439] lunar events recorded by Apollo 12
[8324.319] seismometer in 1969.
[8327.12] Uh the top event is the crashing of the
[8330.399] lunar module.
[8332.8] The two lower ones are caused by natural
[8334.88] moon quakes. Look at that middle one.
[8338.24] I mean that's just echoing and echoing
[8341.12] on. Looks like I wish the what the
[8344.639] horizontal axis is here. Okay. Oh, right
[8347.04] here. What is that? 10 minutes. 10
[8349.28] minutes. Wow.
[8352.24] So, this is uh looks like couple hours
[8355.359] the thing is ringing. It's like you
[8357.12] threw a rock on a on a tank empty like
[8361.519] an empty diesel tank, you know,
[8363.2] thousandgallon tank and it just was
[8364.96] reverberating for hour.
[8368.639] When you first said tank, I'm thinking
[8370.319] like a Abrams tank in the middle of But
[8374.639] I got you. Yeah. Think about like so
[8377.2] we've got an a tank uh on on our
[8380.559] property that's 1,000 gallons of diesel.
[8383.28] Mhm. When that sucker is empty, you
[8384.96] throw a rock on it. Yes. It'll it'll
[8387.519] it'll sit there for two or three
[8389.28] minutes. B. Yeah. I see. I remember
[8392.16] that. Well, because at my grandparents
[8394.16] house in Minnesota, they had a fuel tank
[8396.24] in the basement. And exactly the same. I
[8399.439] discovered as a little kid that, you
[8401.04] know, when usually at the end of the uh
[8403.76] winter when it was um pretty empty, I
[8406.16] could go in there and I could bead on it
[8408.319] and uh yes, it would echo and reverb
[8411.68] bait. I definitely remember that very
[8413.84] clearly. Um
[8417.28] so yeah, there we go. Uh what's going on
[8420.24] here? Well, let's get back into some
[8422.399] commentary
[8423.92] to see if we can get some clues. So the
[8427.92] seismic phenomena
[8430.24] just described
[8432.16] leave and and you consistent with what
[8435.2] you're you commented the seismic
[8438.08] phenomena described leave no room for
[8439.92] doubt that our initial assumption of a
[8442.24] homogeneous moon cannot be true.
[8445.6] It cannot be true in detail and that the
[8447.84] internal density is likely to change
[8450.88] with each change in the velocity of
[8453.04] propagation of seismic waves.
[8456.08] Now, let's pause for a minute. We talked
[8459.04] about I think this was while we were
[8462.24] recording the episode, right? That um if
[8464.8] we look at a lunar rock from the surface
[8469.04] was 3.34 gram per cubic centimeter,
[8472.399] right? Maybe we I think I think we
[8475.68] covered that on on So, go ahead and just
[8478.399] rehash that really quick. Yeah. Okay,
[8480.88] let's let's rehash that. So, let me back
[8483.2] up a little here. Um
[8487.12] uh
[8490.24] next to its size that's the primary uh
[8494.64] physical characteristic of the moon. But
[8496.479] next to its size the second physical
[8499.12] characteristic of the moon which is a
[8500.8] fundamental importance for its structure
[8503.52] is its mass. The mass of the moon like
[8506.56] any that of any other celestial body
[8508.8] which cannot be placed on our
[8510.399] terrestrial scales can be determined
[8513.359] only from the effects of its attraction
[8515.52] on another nearby body of known mass.
[8520.399] In the case of the moon, this has first
[8522.319] been the earth and then in the more
[8524.0] recent past
[8526.56] different types of space probes. Now
[8528.96] this is being written in 1979.
[8531.439] The ratio of the mass of the earth to
[8533.28] the mass of the moon
[8535.76] uh of the earth moon masses was found
[8539.28] from such work to be equal to 81302.
[8544.56] So in other words the earth is 81.03 03
[8550.479] 81302
[8554.16] times the mass of the moon or in round
[8557.6] numbers it's 80 81 times as massive
[8561.84] and since the mass of the earth is known
[8564.0] that of the moon comes out to be 7.350
[8568.08] * 10 25th g or more than 73 trillion
[8574.24] tons.
[8577.2] Now, there's a uh a trivia for you. If
[8580.64] you're ever in a trivia contest, John,
[8583.04] and the question comes up, how much does
[8585.6] the moon weigh? You can say, you can
[8588.88] raise your hand. You can go 73 trillion
[8591.2] tons. Got it. Wow. Okay.
[8596.399] This is that in fifth grade.
[8599.04] Yeah. This is the weight of our nearest
[8601.6] celestial neighbor. And although it may
[8603.359] loom incomprehensibly large for the
[8605.6] reader accustomed to terrestrial weights
[8607.92] and measures, on a cosmic scale, it only
[8610.96] constitutes it constitutes only a
[8614.88] relatively modest lump
[8620.319] and
[8622.24] nor is the mean density of the lunar
[8625.92] globe unusual. Well,
[8630.319] that we're going to recall some
[8631.68] qualification in a minute. If we divide
[8634.56] the lunar mass by its volume 2.199
[8638.399] * 10 25th cubic cm, we find that its
[8643.84] mean density
[8645.84] is equal to 3.34 g per cubic centimeter.
[8650.24] So in other words 3 point you know uh uh
[8653.2] the standard is 1 g per cubic centime is
[8656.0] water I think uh taken at I don't know
[8661.04] probably what temperature room
[8662.479] temperature I'm guessing uh that is and
[8665.52] that's about the same as basaltic rocks
[8668.64] in the earth's crust and st if you go
[8671.6] out and you pick up a standard rock
[8674.8] from the side of the road or side of a
[8676.64] creek or river it's probably going to be
[8678.88] right very close to that range 3.34 g
[8681.84] per cubic cm or 3 and a3 times more
[8686.24] dense than water. Okay? Uh
[8691.2] and it's going to be cons and here's the
[8693.04] important point. It's going to be
[8694.479] considerably smaller than the mean
[8697.68] density of the terrestrial globe.
[8701.2] So in other words, let's let's clarify
[8703.84] what we're talking about here. You pick
[8705.76] up a surface rock on the earth and it's
[8708.479] going to have a mean density of around 3
[8710.479] and a3 g per cubic cm which is a whole
[8714.56] lot smaller than the mean density of the
[8716.64] earth. Put in let's see what the what is
[8719.04] the mean density mean density of the
[8721.6] earth. Uh I'm going to guess it's what
[8726.08] probably in the high 5 something
[8729.76] close to six gram per cubic centimeter
[8732.88] maybe 5.51. So right on 5.51 g per
[8737.28] cubic. Now that's the mean density. So
[8740.72] you figure surface 3.34
[8743.92] the center of the moon has to be a lot
[8745.76] more dense in order for the mean density
[8749.12] be to be 5.51.
[8751.28] Okay. Yep. So if you pick up a rock on
[8756.399] the surface of the earth, what you find
[8758.16] is that it's its density is way less
[8762.16] than the mean density of the earth. as a
[8764.64] whole. Okay.
[8768.08] Well, here's the problem with the moon.
[8770.56] The mean density of the moon is about
[8773.04] 3.34 gram per cubic centimeter.
[8777.84] So, what would that imply? Well, would
[8780.24] that imply then that the moon is
[8781.92] homogeneous?
[8783.76] See? Well, if you go and you if you dig
[8786.88] a hole to the center of the moon and you
[8788.96] start taking scoops of lunar material,
[8792.8] well, if the mean density is the same
[8795.28] throughout the whole mass of the moon is
[8797.92] the same as the mean density of material
[8800.479] you pick up on the surface, well, then
[8803.52] do you assume that the uh that the that
[8808.319] it's homogeneous, that it's the same
[8810.08] material throughout?
[8812.08] But that poses problems, doesn't it?
[8816.8] Does that make sense if you go, "Oh,
[8818.479] well then the very core of the moon is
[8821.68] no denser than 3.34 gram per cubic
[8824.24] centimeter."
[8825.92] Does that make sense? Well, let's see.
[8829.439] For the moment, it goes on. For the
[8831.439] moment, let us abandon the global
[8834.24] properties of the moon and turn our
[8835.68] attention to its interior.
[8838.08] The primary clues to its structure are
[8840.08] already in our hands. Namely, its known
[8842.319] mass and size combining an am mean
[8845.28] density of 3.34 g per cubic centimeter.
[8848.96] The average density of lunar rocks
[8851.28] brought back from the moon between 69
[8853.439] and 72 by Apollo 11 through 17 missions
[8857.52] ranges between 3.1 and 3.5 g per cubic
[8862.16] centimeter. Just right in the range of
[8865.439] terrestrial rocks. Well, this
[8867.84] coincidence becomes even more convincing
[8869.76] when we recall that densities of 3.1 to
[8872.479] 3.5 g per cubic centimeter are those of
[8875.439] their material at zero pressure,
[8879.04] while the mean density of 3.34 g per
[8882.0] cubic centimeter refers to matter
[8884.8] compressed by self attraction.
[8887.76] So here's here's what he's getting at.
[8889.68] Well, what's doesn't seem to add up here
[8893.359] is that of course the overall density of
[8897.28] the moon
[8898.96] is going to be the same as the surface
[8901.359] of the moon which is uh material at zero
[8906.399] pressure.
[8908.88] So it's almost as if the whole
[8910.88] composition of the interior composition
[8912.88] of the moon
[8914.88] is at what? Zero pressure. But that
[8917.2] doesn't make sense because you've got
[8919.28] matter compressed by self attraction. So
[8922.399] now you got the law of gravity which
[8924.24] would s completely seem to contradict
[8926.399] the notion
[8928.24] of a homogeneous moon. But there we go.
[8931.92] So the moon is basically a very low
[8934.24] density object.
[8936.24] Uh
[8938.96] so now
[8942.88] what does that mean? Uh well, we found
[8946.319] out that craters aren't obeying the laws
[8951.6] that we would expect,
[8954.0] right? Uh
[8957.76] and
[8959.439] then we have the seismic signature of
[8962.56] observed moon quakes
[8965.04] which suggest what?
[8967.439] Paracity. All paracity. Porocity.
[8972.08] Um
[8974.72] so then now let's come back to this. So
[8977.12] the seismic phenomena described leave no
[8979.52] room for doubt that our initial
[8980.96] assumption of a homogeneous moon cannot
[8983.68] be true.
[8985.6] It cannot be true in detail and that the
[8987.6] internal density is likely to change
[8990.16] with each change in the velocity of
[8991.92] propagation of seismic waves.
[8995.2] Then
[8997.6] here we get to the one of the the the
[8999.92] the
[9001.84] perhaps the the the crux of the matter.
[9004.399] We also possess irrefutable evidence
[9007.28] that the distribution of mass inside the
[9010.0] moon is not strictly radially
[9014.399] symmetrical.
[9017.84] A sufficient proof that the moon does
[9020.96] not conform exactly to a spherically
[9024.88] symmetrical model has been provided by
[9028.08] the f familiar phenomena of synchronism
[9032.24] between rotation
[9034.56] and revolution of our satellite
[9038.319] in brief by the fact that the moon
[9040.0] continues to show us the same face.
[9044.64] If its mass, now get this, this is
[9048.88] critical. If its mass were distributed
[9051.84] concentrically
[9053.68] throughout its interior, its
[9056.24] gravitational potential
[9058.88] would be equivalent to that of a mass
[9062.16] point.
[9064.08] But if this were so, the terrestrial
[9066.88] attraction would be powerless to exert
[9070.399] any effect on its motion and the moon
[9073.04] could rotate at any speed about an
[9076.08] arbitrary axis.
[9079.359] So that familiar synchronism
[9082.64] between rotation and revolution what is
[9085.04] called one one spin orbit coupling
[9089.84] suggests that the moon is not behaving
[9093.76] as radially distributed mass.
[9097.439] Yet the moon's mass of 73 trillion tons
[9102.24] is such that the realology of the moon
[9105.6] should allow it to settle out to a
[9110.16] radial distribution about its center of
[9113.04] mass. So coming back to the Apollo
[9117.04] seismic experiment that the team that
[9121.12] was conducting that experiment reported
[9123.6] now this is from 1970.
[9126.479] It's from the journal science. It's uh
[9130.0] entitled missile impacts
[9133.6] as sources of seismic energy on the
[9135.92] moon.
[9137.359] The Apollo passive seismic experiment
[9139.68] team has recently reported first results
[9141.92] from the impact of the ascent stage of
[9144.72] the lunar module
[9146.88] on the lunar surface as part of the
[9148.8] Apollo 12 mission. Seismic energy from
[9151.84] the impact was recorded by the
[9154.16] seismometers deployed on the lunar
[9156.479] surface by Apollo 12 uh astronauts as
[9160.319] part of the implaced science station
[9162.64] called the Apollo lunar surface
[9166.24] experiments package. The impact
[9169.359] experiments have emerged as an extremely
[9171.92] powerful tool in the seismic exploration
[9174.08] of the moon. The purpose of this report
[9177.12] is to aid in the interpretation of the
[9179.84] lunar impact signals by presenting
[9182.96] seismic data reported recorded from
[9186.16] missile impacts at White Sands Missile
[9188.72] Range. Seismic signals from a total of
[9192.24] five missile impacts were recorded
[9195.52] between early 68 and 1969 at White Sands
[9199.6] Missile Range, New Mexico. So what were
[9203.84] the results of this experiments by
[9206.399] looking at seismic signals at white
[9208.24] sands missile range compared to the
[9211.12] results of impacts on the moon.
[9215.28] The lunar module impacted 70 75.9
[9219.2] kilometers from the Apollo 12 lunar
[9221.68] seismic station in the sea of storms.
[9225.68] The signal recorded by the long period
[9228.08] vertical component seismometer is
[9230.24] strikingly different from that of the
[9233.04] missile impact signals, the ones at uh
[9236.72] White Sands. Hm. Well, we were kind of
[9240.0] starting to suspect that, weren't we? As
[9243.2] described by Laam at al the duration of
[9246.56] the lunar module impact signal is
[9248.88] extremely long approximately 55 minutes
[9252.399] in comparison with the missile impact
[9254.56] signals which uh at a range of 79.9
[9258.08] kilometers would have lasted several mi
[9260.72] minutes at most. The LM or lunar module
[9264.8] impact wave has a very emergent
[9267.52] beginning builds up slowly to a maximum
[9270.72] over a period of 6.8 8 minutes and then
[9274.64] gradually decreases in amplitude. The
[9277.28] attenuation of seismic waves that
[9279.76] propagate through the outer regions of
[9281.76] the moon is extremely low compared with
[9284.56] the attenuation observed for propagation
[9287.6] through the crust of the earth.
[9292.399] As one hypothesis
[9294.8] to explain the unexpected character of
[9298.16] the lunar module impact signal, Laam and
[9301.6] others suggest that the moon not only
[9303.52] has a high Q or quality factor. We don't
[9306.64] need to get into what that is,
[9309.359] but it is also very heterogeneous.
[9314.16] What is the definition of that term?
[9316.56] Something that's composed of different
[9318.64] components. Not homogeneous but heter
[9321.439] not homogeneous genius. Yes, very
[9324.8] heterogeneous.
[9326.72] The nature of this heterogeneity,
[9329.359] if indeed this interpretation of the
[9331.28] data is correct, has important
[9333.6] implications relative to the origin and
[9335.84] evolution of the moon. The complete lack
[9338.88] of similarity between the lunar impact
[9341.2] signal and the signals from the missile
[9343.84] impacts reported here supports the view
[9348.24] that the structure of the moon in the
[9350.16] vicinity of Apollo 12 landing site is
[9354.0] radically different from the typical
[9356.88] crustal structure of the earth.
[9360.0] This is from AE Ringwood 1979. The
[9364.24] origin of the Earth and Moon.
[9368.0] So what do we know now about the
[9370.24] structure of the moon from lunar
[9371.6] seismoggrams? Well, we certainly could
[9373.84] not take any chances when it came to
[9375.68] providing the necessary sources for the
[9377.68] lunar seismic network. If the moon were
[9380.16] totally inactive seismically, we would
[9382.72] have to generate some large artificial
[9384.88] seismic sources ourselves and rely on
[9387.92] these to probe the moon. Fortunately, it
[9391.359] did not take much energy to adjust the
[9393.68] trajectories of the discarded Saturn 5
[9397.12] third stage boosters in order to guide
[9400.319] them towards pre-selected impact points
[9402.88] on the lunar surface.
[9405.76] But these were not the only artificial
[9407.68] projectiles to be used as seismic
[9409.92] sources. After the landing phase, each
[9413.52] lunar module ascent stage was jettisoned
[9416.88] and crashed onto the lunar surface as
[9419.6] soon as its two astronauts had safely
[9422.56] transferred back to the orbiting command
[9425.28] module.
[9427.439] But boosters and spent lunar modules
[9431.359] have not been the only projectiles to
[9434.399] hit the moon in recent years. There have
[9437.12] also been several large meteorite
[9439.359] impacts, several of which occurred at
[9442.0] considerable distances from the seismic
[9444.96] network, some even on the far side. So,
[9448.88] how thick is the lunar crust and of what
[9451.04] does it consist? Well, perhaps the most
[9454.08] intriguing aspect of all lunar
[9455.92] seismoggrams is that they last for so
[9458.96] long. In some cases, seismic waves are
[9463.12] still being recorded a full hour after
[9465.439] the first primary wave arrived. In other
[9469.2] words, the moon rings like a bell when
[9473.439] it is struck.
[9475.52] Ring a bell?
[9477.52] Does that ring a bell, John?
[9482.88] H
[9484.479] I remember these. And that's not just
[9486.88] any bell, is it? No, that's the Liberty
[9489.52] Bell. That is the Liberty Bell. Yes. I
[9492.8] touched it back when they still allowed
[9495.12] you to get near it. Oh, really? Yes.
[9498.399] Uh-huh. So, it really does have a crack
[9500.16] in it, doesn't it?
[9503.2] So if there were carbon gases or water
[9506.319] vapor, some such thing being generated
[9508.56] inside the Liberty Bell and you closed
[9510.56] off its bottom, it would probably come
[9512.88] out that crack, wouldn't it? Probably
[9514.72] would. Y Mhm. Okay.
[9518.56] So that's a replica of the 1976
[9521.12] commemorative bsentennial silver dollar.
[9527.2] I thought that was interesting little
[9529.28] juxiposition.
[9530.8] Yes. Yeah,
[9535.359] don't beat around the bush. What exactly
[9538.16] are you saying? I'm Hey, I'm just taking
[9542.56] note of uh
[9548.319] the moon. Uh
[9551.68] now, the next thing we need to explore
[9553.6] is maskcons. And I think we should save
[9555.92] that for the next episode. I think so.
[9559.12] Do you know what a maskcon is?
[9561.439] a mass. So, okay. M A S C O N. Okay. I
[9567.6] don't a mass. It's a It's a contraction
[9570.479] of mass concentration.
[9574.56] Got it. Uhhuh. And where we'll leave it
[9578.72] is that mass concentrations were
[9582.08] discovered in the early days of
[9584.319] exploring the moon in preparation for
[9586.399] the Apollo landings. Uh and so they sent
[9589.84] up uh a series of lunar orbiter missions
[9593.68] uh that and this was written in 1968.
[9597.6] Okay. Uh it appeared in the journal
[9600.56] science masscon lunar mass
[9603.12] concentrations.
[9604.88] Uh so the lunar orbiter missions have
[9606.88] provided both highquality photographs of
[9608.96] the moon and supplementary scientific
[9611.92] information concerning the gravitational
[9614.16] field of the moon.
[9616.319] Uh previous investigators have concluded
[9619.6] that the moon was gravitationally
[9622.399] rougher than anticipated.
[9625.359] Uh this roughness of the moon has been
[9628.08] of interest to the Apollo project
[9630.08] because of the resulting perturbations
[9633.76] on the trajectory of the Apollo orbiting
[9637.04] spacecraft.
[9638.56] For these reasons, a new analysis has
[9640.8] been done with the use of the accurate
[9643.6] tracking data received here by the NASA
[9646.0] deep space network operated by the Jet
[9648.8] Propulsion Laboratory.
[9651.84] We now report that this new processing
[9655.52] of the lunar orbiter data has produced
[9659.92] unexpected results.
[9665.359] So, we'll pick it up there on the next
[9667.28] episode of Squaring the Circle. Thanks
[9670.24] for joining me, John. And thanks for
[9672.08] joining me, all of you folks that have
[9673.84] been listening in. Uh, please do check
[9676.64] out the visuals that John will be
[9678.96] posting. And uh, feel free to make
[9681.92] comments.
[9683.68] And on that note, I have not much more
[9686.0] to say. John, how about you? Nope. All
[9689.439] good. All good. All right, my friend.
[9692.479] Thank you much.
[9694.56] Until next time. Yes, sir.

Title: Can We Nudge an Asteroid Off-Course?
[0.0] [Music]
[0.32] wouldn't the primary focus of our
[4.08] species to be able to get off the planet
[6.08] and become interplanetary? We should be
[7.839] focusing on ways to preserve the species
[10.4] whether it be avoiding asteroid impacts
[13.44] or comet impacts either or that or
[16.56] getting off of Earth for a certain I
[18.8] like both because anything we can do to
[20.8] maximize the probabilities. Now you know
[23.359] the dart mission that's just underway is
[26.16] an attempt to rendevous with an asteroid
[28.48] and deflect it to learn and understand
[30.64] the technologies and whereby if we see
[34.079] that object coming towards the earth and
[36.88] it's on an impact trajectory we could
[39.76] nudge it so that it misses the earth.
[41.68] Now that would work with an asteroid. It
[43.84] I don't know how well that would work
[45.04] with a comet. How would you do that with
[46.48] an asteroid? All you have to do is nudge
[48.16] it a little bit. So there this this is
[49.84] what the dart mission is testing. So, we
[52.079] could actually get into talking about
[53.68] that, but but yeah, all you need to do
[55.92] is is, you know, if you attach a rocket
[58.239] to it and you know, if you catch it
[61.28] early enough, then just a little bit of
[64.0] a nudge, right? Like a turns a direct
[66.32] hit into a a wide miss, right? Like a
[69.04] It's like the theory of hitting a golf
[70.32] ball. If you just a millimeter angle
[73.6] difference when you're hitting a golf
[75.04] ball equates to,
[78.24] you know, 50 100 to 100 yards any
[80.479] direction. Well, there we go. Sure.

Title: Where Did All the Water Really Go?
[0.16] Where did all the water go? You had all
[2.399] this melting. Where did the water go?
[4.64] Well, you know, I started really
[6.48] studying the Missoula floods in the
[8.8] early 1980s, exploring every nook and
[11.36] cranny of this landscape and realizing,
[14.32] no, there are some huge gaping holes in
[16.64] this box. If we're going to understand
[18.4] what transpired inside that box, we have
[21.84] to also understand what was going on
[23.76] outside that box because nature didn't
[26.24] really recognize if if you have an
[28.56] enormous amount of rainfall coming in
[30.64] moving over. If the jetream is moving,
[32.88] being shunted to the southward because
[34.64] of the formation of this huge ice sheet
[36.559] here, well, that jetream isn't it's
[38.719] ignoring this box. It doesn't recognize
[41.2] that box. Oh, we can't go any further
[43.28] south. There's a box there

Title: Sacred Geometry: Why Perfection Isn’t the Goal
[0.16] In the real world, it isn't necessary to
[2.8] square the circle with absolutely
[5.6] perfect mathematical precision. Ancient
[7.919] philosophers, geometricians, and
[9.76] builders had several methods by which
[12.559] they could approximate the squaring of
[14.799] the circle with near exactitude. And
[18.08] there are multiple examples of these
[20.32] techniques being employed in a wide
[22.8] variety of times and places around the
[25.84] world and throughout history. The idea
[28.32] here is that one does not need to
[30.48] realize perfection in the manifested
[33.04] realm. Rather, a close enough
[35.2] approximation to effectively rep induce
[38.64] resonance among the parts and the whole
[41.84] system will suffice. As an example, the
[46.0] human ear, unless highly trained, would
[49.12] not hear the difference between the note
[51.36] A in the diietonic scale vibrating at
[55.039] 440 hertz or cycles per second and the
[59.84] note A vibrating in the verie scale at
[63.12] 432 cycles per second. So reiterating
[67.92] a fundamental idea at the core of the
[70.479] philosophy of sacred geometry is the
[72.72] idea of harmony and how it might be
[75.84] achieved through the reconciliation
[78.799] of opposing forces, systems or events.

Title: How Fast Did This Ancient Lake Collapse?
[0.16] I'm having a hard time visualizing
[2.72] something that's not catastrophic. My
[5.04] problem is is the assumption that that
[7.2] span of time between the lake topping
[9.679] out, how much time elapsed between the
[12.0] topping out of the lake at its highest
[14.08] elevation and the breakout of the flood,
[17.52] say at 35 to 40 million cubic feet per
[20.16] second. Is it going to be a matter of
[22.56] weeks and months or is it a matter of
[24.4] years, centuries, hundreds of years the
[27.039] lake is at that level? Well, let's talk
[29.599] about what kind of climatic regime is
[32.48] going to be necessary to sustain a lake
[35.04] of that size. The amount of loss through
[38.16] evaporation has to be just almost
[40.16] microscopic compared to the input into
[43.12] the basin from whatever source. But one
[45.52] study I recently read said I think they
[47.84] were estimating that 3.3%
[51.2] of the lake volume was contributed by
[53.76] melting glaciers. That's the case.

Title: This Desert Was Once 1,000 Feet Underwater
[0.24] One of the first thing that impressed me
[1.92] was the vastness of Lake Bonavville. The
[5.12] realization of how extraordinarily huge
[8.16] this body of water was. It was
[10.8] incredible. And you know, you're driving
[12.48] around on in the deserts there and
[14.48] you're realizing that 15,000 years ago,
[17.52] you'd have been at the bottom of a,000
[19.68] ft deep lake. Here you are, you're in a
[22.08] desert, right? Dry as a bone. And 15,000
[26.48] years ago, you would have been at the
[28.0] bottom of a lake 1,000 ft deep.
[30.08] Obviously, something changed. Something
[32.719] I mean, as it is now, the environment of
[35.84] this area in Utah does not support the
[38.879] existence of hard hardly any lake at
[41.04] all. Great Salt Lake is the remnant of
[43.84] Lake Bonavville. It varies from season
[46.96] to season depending on the amount of
[48.64] rainfall, 20 to 30 ft in depth. So, I
[51.28] mean, it's minuscule compared to ancient
[54.079] Lake Bonavville. I mean, there's no way
[56.16] you could have Lake Bonavville without
[57.92] having an extraordinarily amplified
[61.68] volume of rainfall or precipitation.

Title: Could We Survive Another Younger Dryas?
[0.08] If you're talking about something like
[1.199] the Shoemaker asteroids that were broken
[4.16] into 21 different pieces and hit Jupiter
[7.12] within the period of a week, how would
[9.12] we deflect 21 comets? We would be
[12.16] screwed. Yes, we would definitely be
[13.84] screwed. to me make the argument for and
[16.0] this has actually been proposed be a
[18.0] good rationale for a lunar base where we
[20.08] could offload a lot of our technology
[22.8] and information and things to the moon
[25.119] thereby perhaps preserving it kind of
[27.359] like a hard drive like a safe like a
[29.279] safe storage for everything we have if
[31.279] we did get wiped out by something it
[33.04] would virtually erase us from the planet
[36.079] if anything like younger dus happened
[38.32] now oh yeah I mean the remnants of human
[42.8] population would be reduced to a stone
[44.879] age existence. Isn't it true that it
[47.28] only takes like about a hundred years
[50.16] for if you erased human civilization off
[52.8] the face of the earth right now within a
[54.32] 100 years all of our buildings, all of
[56.16] our structures, everything that we have
[58.16] would be consumed by the earth. All you
[60.399] would have would be it would take longer
[62.0] than that. Okay? I mean reinforced
[64.0] concrete structures are going to take
[66.159] probably 400 years to a,000 years. Yeah,
[69.28] but that's just assuming but a thousand
[72.479] years is nothing on the scale of things
[74.0] that we're talking about. Yeah.

Title: What If Humanity Vanished Overnight?
[0.08] what would happen if all of a sudden all
[1.68] people disappeared, human infrastructure
[3.76] was still there? What would happen to it
[6.319] over the millennium? And and pretty much
[8.08] the conclusion was there wouldn't be
[9.44] anything left to speak of after 10,000
[12.16] years with the exception perhaps of the
[15.599] pyramids. But you know, the thing is
[17.84] there and that's just assuming
[19.68] gradualistic processes.
[22.08] That's not even counting. You might have
[23.92] some serious catastrophes in the in what
[26.72] I've tried to So, in fact, there's
[28.0] somebody now who put out a video called
[30.0] Why Randall Carlson is wrong. How does
[32.16] that make you feel? Oh, it doesn't make
[34.399] me feel bad. I mean, I look, I'm totally
[36.32] cool with that. And the reason is is
[38.559] that this particular video basically is
[42.399] just your standard issue response to
[45.6] these kinds of questions. And basically
[48.879] what it boils down to is this. Well, if
[50.8] there was something existing and of

[54.48] basically contrives his own scenario of
[57.36] what I'm saying, which isn't what I'm

[61.199] clear from what I watched the video a

Title: Why Ancient Cultures Obsessed Over "Squaring the Circle"
[0.16] Mathematically to square the circle
[2.08] means to draw or construct in the lingo
[5.2] of geometry a circle and square of equal
[8.96] area using only the tools of classical
[12.08] geometry and that would be an unmarked
[14.639] straight edge. Now this is of course is
[16.64] a marked straight edge but these are the
[18.96] two tools an unmarked straight edge and
[21.119] compasses and these were all that were
[23.199] allowed within the geometric exercises
[26.16] the drawing exercises in the traditional
[29.599] uh modes of teaching. Now a variation of
[32.8] this idea of the squaring of the circle
[35.28] is also called the rectification of a
[38.239] circle. In this case, uh you have a
[40.8] circle and a square of equal perimeter
[43.44] rather than area. And a circle and uh
[46.64] square of equal perimeter are
[48.16] constructed again using only the
[49.92] classical tools of traditional uklidian
[52.559] geometry as taught in themies and lodges
[56.239] of ancient times. The exercise of
[58.48] squaring the circle has profound meaning
[60.8] within the system of sacred geometry as
[63.68] it is called. While there seems to be an
[65.68] attitude among some uneducated
[67.76] superficial thinkers that sacred
[69.6] geometry is somehow woo, the truth is
[72.799] that it is every bit as rigorous as the
[75.36] most demanding standards of Uklid. The
[77.84] thing that differentiates ordinary
[79.92] ukitian geometry as a set of axioms,
[82.799] definitions, and propositions from
[85.6] sacred geometry is that to scholars in
[88.4] ancient times, geometry was conceived as
[90.72] a vehicle for the propagation of
[93.119] symbolism and deep philosophical
[95.6] painting.

Title: What Triggered This Massive Geologic Shift?
[0.16] Northwest exposures, a geological story
[3.2] of the Northwest. Several quite
[5.2] different things happened about 17
[7.12] million years ago. The entire chain of
[10.4] big western Cascades volcanoes which had
[13.92] been erupting vigorously for at least 20
[16.64] million years abruptly became extinct.
[20.16] Overwhelming flood basalt lava flows
[23.039] began to pour across a vast region of
[26.32] the inland Pacific Northwest. faults
[29.199] began to break the former plains of
[31.519] Nevada and Utah into the swarm of broad
[34.96] valleys and jagged mountain ranges of
[36.88] the basin and range and the climate
[38.879] became very wet and warm. Was it a
[41.44] coincidence that all those changes came
[43.44] at once? It seems far more likely that
[46.879] they had a common

Title: How Lake Bonneville Unleashed a Mega Flood
[0.0] Imagine a hard bedrock sill, even like
[3.6] granite grrenitic type metamorphic rock,
[5.92] hard rock sill, and then you've got 350
[9.28] feet of more or less aluvial soft, not
[13.2] completely lithified material that has
[15.92] been outwashed from erosion off the
[19.76] adjacent mountain ranges and it's
[22.24] relatively young compared to that bed
[25.039] hard bedrock sill. So now the question
[28.0] is the water in Lake Bondavville rises
[30.24] up and at some point it is now just just
[34.079] above 5,000 ft above sea level. It gets
[36.719] equal in elevation to that to the
[40.16] surface of this fan aluvial fan. So it
[44.719] starts flowing over. Now the question is
[48.64] how long of a time elapse between the wa
[51.92] level of the lake coming up to the sill
[55.68] or the top of that aluvial fan and the
[60.16] bursting out of that lake discharging 35
[64.799] million 40 million cubic feet per second
[67.92] because that's a hell of an event Here.

Title: Sci-Fi, Psychedelics & the Brain in 1968
[0.16] But I had my junior year I for some
[2.399] reason got obsessed with science
[3.919] fiction, the psychedelics which were
[5.92] available back then in 1968 and that
[8.96] completely altered my perspective and it
[11.28] sort of was fortuitous in a way that I
[13.36] had spent this year immersed in science
[15.28] fiction because getting into the science
[17.199] fiction stories that really does
[18.88] something to you cognitively while
[20.8] you're trying to imagine what it is
[23.199] that's being described through words and
[25.199] on paper and so forth. Well, obviously
[27.199] if you're doing those drawings, there's
[28.96] going to be a correlation of activity in
[31.519] your brain, right? If you're writing,
[33.36] it's going to be the same way. Now, if
[35.36] you're writing, does that activate a
[37.12] different part of your brain than
[39.28] drawing? I don't know. Or is it part of
[41.6] the same functionality of the brain?

Title: What If We've Been Here Before?
[0.0] It has been an inconceivably long
[2.08] journey from our unknown beginnings to
[4.48] have arrived where we now find ourselves
[6.879] as a civilization and as a species. But
[10.16] it is not enough to merely survive. Our
[12.96] ancestors accomplished that and
[15.12] evidently a great deal more than that.
[17.6] For over 200,000 years, mankind has
[21.52] occupied this planet. The evidence
[23.84] implies that those people of so long ago
[26.56] were anatomically at least equivalent to
[29.679] modern humanity and that must include
[32.32] the presumption of an equivalence in
[35.04] intellectual capacity. If pre-existing
[38.16] models of prehistory are correct, we
[41.2] must assume that for thousands of
[43.28] generations, humankind achieved no
[46.719] cumulative learning that could lead to a
[49.36] scientific understanding of the world
[51.84] and nature. But how can it be that for
[54.559] thousands of generations, our ancestors
[56.879] never advanced beyond primitive nomadic
[59.28] lifestyles of hunting, gathering, and
[61.199] foraging?

Title: Did Ancient Myths Record Real Cosmic Impacts?
[0.16] What I'd like to do now is get into the
[3.36] actual impact cratering phenomena where
[6.48] objects from space strike the earth and
[9.519] we'll take a look at a little bit of the
[12.16] evidence that it's accumulated over the
[13.92] last few decades for the formation of
[17.039] craters and astroblings. Let's talk
[19.279] about the difference between the two. A
[21.52] crater generally, now this is obviously
[23.84] overlap in the definition, but a crater
[25.92] generally is an open B-shaped structure
[28.88] or depression that we can actually see
[30.96] in the landscape. And it's quite
[33.92] obvious, such as Meteor Crater in
[36.32] Arizona near Winslow is the the type
[40.16] example that we would invoke in terms of
[42.559] a classical crater shape. the accounts
[45.2] of these events that have happened in
[47.039] recent times where people have lived to
[49.84] recount their experiences such as we saw
[53.199] I think very clearly indicated in the
[55.199] stories coming out of the Tangusa event
[57.68] of 1908. We're going to see that there's
[60.16] a very strong correlation between the
[62.96] imagery of myth and legend and folklore
[67.119] and traditional sources and accounts as
[69.92] there has been from the more recent
[71.68] scientific and eyewitness accounts of
[74.4] cosmic phenomenon.

Title: Are We Tapping Into Ancient Lightning Tech?
[0.08] If I were to separate positive and
[1.76] negative charges, what would I think
[3.84] should happen? They should come back
[5.44] together. They should equalize. And if
[7.04] it's just a gas, then theoretically
[9.519] nothing should be stopping that from
[10.88] happening. Like that should just happen
[12.48] very quickly. Ken shoulders found no.
[15.28] For some reason, these these negative
[17.44] electric electron charges are clustering
[20.279] together when normally you would think
[22.16] they should just immediately dissipate
[23.439] and the plasma should just neutralize.
[25.279] And the crazy part about this is that if
[27.119] you can take that effect and scale it up
[30.08] now you're making like a literal like
[31.84] Zeus like lightning like you know that
[34.239] you can just strike down onto people and
[36.64] especially if you can stabilize it that
[38.719] to me seems kind of scary. Do you
[40.48] believe in electric universe or plasma
[42.079] universe theories? To the extent that I
[44.079] understand it sounds like there are
[46.16] elements of it that are plausible but I
[48.16] haven't up to this point I have not
[50.559] really needed to go there. Although I
[52.8] get asked so often that I feel like I
[55.12] need to take a dive into it and really
[57.44] try to come away from it with some basic
[60.239] understanding. Absolutely though. Hell
[62.16] yes. Definitely electrophenomena,
[64.0] electromagnetic phenomena is key to
[66.4] pretty much

Title: Great Pyramid's Big Void is Finally Being Opened - Matt Beall
[0.35] [Music]
[11.32] [Music]
[28.24] Heat. Heat.
[30.24] So, you've got a few things going on. I
[33.28] do. What I'd like to hear, you know,
[35.6] whatever whatever you're uh comfortable
[38.16] revealing. Yeah, for sure. It's probably
[40.399] an understatement I got a few things
[41.76] going on. Life is crazy. Life is crazy.
[44.0] But it certainly is. Yeah. Yeah. But
[46.559] it's good, man. I mean, the best thing I
[48.079] got going on is I'm talking to Randall
[49.52] Carlson right now. So, that's that's
[52.8] that's pretty freaking cool. Um, not
[55.039] that many people can say that, actually.
[56.64] Just me and Becket. So, it's pretty
[58.16] freaking cool. But um yeah, man, I
[60.719] released an episode with Zahi Hawas
[63.28] today. So that was pretty awesome on the
[66.08] Matt Bell Limitless channel. So um you
[68.88] know, it was um it it was it was his
[71.28] only other podcast that he's doing in
[73.84] the States while he's here. He's in
[75.439] North America, so the US and Canada for
[78.08] uh three months actually, and he's doing
[79.68] all these lectures and book signings and
[81.759] stuff. I think he's doing 30 of those.
[83.2] But um uh yeah, we were able to um meet
[88.159] and go to dinner and uh you know, he's
[91.119] an interesting character. He's about
[92.64] like you would, you know, like you would
[94.32] like you like you would think. But um
[96.64] but there was some there was some really
[98.4] there was some really good uh uh
[100.56] information to come out of the
[101.84] conversation and and some new stuff that
[104.479] just dropped. And so, you know, it's
[106.24] such a small channel. Um, I mean it's
[108.479] it's growing, you know, my channel, but
[110.0] but uh it's it's not gonna it's not
[112.0] going to be like, you know,
[113.439] international news, but I feel like it
[115.04] should be. So So being able to talk
[117.04] about it on your on your show today is
[119.2] is meaningful because it'll get out to
[120.96] more people. And um the the bits of
[123.2] information the I guess you know, one of
[124.719] the one of the big things is that we're
[126.56] going to be exploring the big void
[129.28] within the Great Pyramid. Uh and that's
[132.0] probably going to be happening in
[134.599] January, possibly February. Wow. Um it
[138.16] was as of a few months ago, it was
[139.44] supposed to be in November, but I guess
[140.72] it's gotten pushed back by a couple
[142.64] months, but um yeah, basically um I I
[146.4] had the opportunity and and have the
[148.16] great honor of being able to um be a
[151.44] part of the team. I'm I'm funding the
[154.319] robotics um component of the investment
[157.92] in order to um to explore the big void.
[161.2] So, um, I jumped all over that
[163.599] opportunity and and get to be, you know,
[166.0] a part of that team that goes and
[167.44] actually, uh, experiences it as the big
[170.239] void within the Great Pyramid is being
[172.0] explored by robotics next year. So,
[174.16] early next year. So, so, so you'll be
[176.16] taking I think this will be your first
[178.56] sojour in Egypt. You got it. Yeah. Yeah.
[181.44] It's pretty mind-blowing. Yeah. Yeah. No
[183.68] doubt. No doubt. Yeah. I've kind of held
[185.44] off on going because I knew that, you
[187.2] know, or planning a trip cuz I knew that
[188.879] this was going to be, you know, coming
[190.72] up. So, um, yeah, it's, uh, it's going
[194.48] to be freaking cool, man. I mean, like
[196.64] to to get in there. It's like one of the
[198.239] biggest chambers and one of the biggest
[199.92] places, I think, in the world that
[201.36] people want to know what is in there.
[203.84] You know what? So, tell tell me more
[205.92] about the big void. I mean, wow. The big
[208.64] void. Yeah. Yeah. So, the Big Void is
[210.879] the size of two semi-truckss and it
[213.84] exists within the Great Pyramid and it's
[216.319] above the uh the Grand Gallery. Above
[219.84] the Okay. Above the Grand. Yeah. Yeah.
[222.879] So, and it's there's some question about
[224.799] whether or not it's like um diagonal
[228.239] shaped or if it's flat like horizontal
[230.879] shaped. But um I think the the current
[232.959] best thinking as far as I know is that
[234.56] it's it's it's kind of like shaped like
[236.4] the Grand Gallery. So diagonal shaped
[238.319] above the Grand Gallery and um you know
[241.04] the question is like what what's what's
[243.36] in there and um you know it wasn't
[246.56] discovered until the um till the team of
[249.68] people got in and started to scan the
[251.92] place and to you know they they
[253.519] recognized they found this big void and
[256.0] gosh that was years ago man I mean um
[258.079] you'll be able to Was this the Italian
[260.639] team? No, no, this wasn't the this
[262.639] wasn't the Italian team. It was actually
[263.84] the scan pyramids team. Um Okay. I I
[267.36] remember that was Yeah. Okay. That we
[269.6] are going back a ways. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[271.68] And they explored the uh the the the
[275.28] shaft in the Queen's chamber and Genan
[277.68] bricks door and uh found that found that
[280.88] the two copper pins up there that that I
[283.52] still don't think have a very good
[284.96] explanation. But this is a team that
[287.28] kind of broke off from that team.
[288.88] There's they there's actually two
[290.4] separate teams now. And this is called
[291.68] the pyramids team. That's called the
[293.199] scan pyramids team. Um Sean Whitehead
[296.0] and Will
[297.639] Westway are I think Westway I think. Um
[301.199] I haven't met Will yet, but um uh they
[304.479] are kind of the you know two of the
[306.16] leaders of this team. And then Zahiwas
[308.32] himself is the director of the team.
[309.84] He's the kind of the senior leader of
[312.0] the team. So um you know I wanted to
[314.24] make sure I didn't screw up my
[315.44] relationship with this group of people
[316.72] by having them on my podcast. and you
[318.639] know throwing too much uh you know um uh
[322.639] you know too too many challenging
[324.16] questions out at him. But we had just a
[326.08] terrific discussion and again um it came
[329.44] out today and I think we we went over
[330.8] some great stuff. But um but yeah, go
[332.56] ahead questions.
[334.639] I'm glad to hear that. I mean, you know,
[336.72] it sounds to me like Zahi is more open
[340.08] than he used to be to I maybe I don't
[343.12] know. He would seem I I I don't know. I
[346.16] always respected him because I thought,
[348.479] okay, and and you know, look, you know
[351.84] what Carl Sean used to say, um, you
[354.72] know, the famous saying out not
[356.56] outrageous, but uh, extraordinary claims
[359.039] require extraordinary proofs. Yeah.
[361.6] And I figured there's a role for
[364.08] skeptics and and you know, as long as
[366.56] it's a fair-minded skepticism and you
[369.319] ask legitimate questions and don't
[372.319] necessarily start from the uh you know,
[376.24] the supposition that you're whoever
[378.639] you're challenging is is is wrong, has
[382.56] no basis of credibility or any of that.
[384.88] So, um because that's how you I mean
[387.919] that's how the scientific process works,
[390.0] right? Right. No doubt. Yeah. Yeah. In
[392.16] terms of open-mindedness, I mean, he'll
[393.68] he'll tell you that he's open-minded,
[394.96] but but if you ask him, you know, what
[397.039] like um he he's not open-minded to the
[401.44] possibility that some group of people
[403.759] other than the ancient Egyptians during
[406.16] the time of Kufu and Cafrey built the
[408.08] the Great Pyramid, the Middle Pyramid,
[409.919] the the Sphinx, you know, the all the
[411.84] great. He's not open to that. So, he
[413.759] he's 100% in his mind. He knows that
[417.199] that all of those structures were built
[418.88] by the Egyptians in the time that is um
[421.44] you know fed to us by academia that that
[424.08] and that's a fact and that there's no
[425.919] possibility that it's anything other
[427.36] than that. So there's not there's not
[429.44] any open-mindedness as it relates to
[431.199] that being anything other than an older
[433.84] civilization. Yeah. No no possible way.
[436.56] Yeah. Now I, you know, I've got enough
[438.479] geology background that and I've studied
[441.199] rock weathering and erosion, right? And
[445.68] everything that I've seen on the Sphinx,
[447.68] I've, you know, I visited there myself.
[449.44] I had a chance to firsthand study the
[452.479] the pattern of erosion. And, you know, I
[455.44] came away convinced that, yeah, we're
[457.039] looking at, you know, overland water
[459.44] flow, sheet flows that probably came
[461.36] from the from the west. Uh it could have
[464.56] also been a rising of the Nile because
[467.12] you raise a Nile 120 130 feet and it's
[470.319] going to submerge the the the snake. Uh
[473.52] that is not an outlandish claim, right?
[476.16] And there is evidence that yeah the Nile
[478.879] River has from time to time flooded it
[481.36] to an extraordinary depth above its
[483.759] modern flood plane. Right. So it seemed
[486.4] perfectly reasonable to me to accept the
[488.96] possibility or probability that that was
[492.08] water erosion. So when you're there, you
[493.84] know, you probably I'm sure you'll have
[495.28] a chance to look at it yourself
[497.039] firsthand. Yeah. Um and you before you
[500.0] go, I could uh provide you with some
[502.0] photos and some interesting studies uh
[504.639] that might enhance uh you know, your
[507.28] experience when you're there seeing some
[509.039] of this stuff firsthand. But cool. But
[511.28] yeah, I came away uh convinced, yeah,
[513.839] that's water erosion.
[515.56] So how it so then that raises the
[518.64] question when would that water have
[521.44] caused that erosion and there's two
[523.2] things two ways to look at it
[525.72] one water flow over a protracted period
[529.2] of time say millennia which of course
[532.0] then implies that the Sphinx is older
[536.24] because we know I mean there's there's
[538.88] robust evidence going back to the 1950s
[541.92] that that Egypt used to relatively lush.
[546.399] The Sahara, the area around Giza was was
[549.2] a relatively lush climate and there was
[553.04] uh tremendous amounts of of water
[555.12] flowing. There were huge lakes for
[556.88] example um you know the bedrock of the
[560.56] Giza plateau is mostly limestone.
[562.959] Limestone
[564.48] erodess under it dissolves basically
[566.959] under wa uh under a particularly acidic
[569.92] water. And this is why you have so many
[572.88] caves. For example, Tennessee and
[574.88] Kentucky. You're going to find Mammoth
[576.88] Cave. The f you've heard of that, of
[578.88] course. And Mammoth Cave is is, you
[581.279] know, primarily uh eroded in limestone.
[584.64] Um so when you start, let's say, with
[586.56] fractured bedrock, which could be
[588.64] primarily, I guess, tectonic, uh which
[591.36] causes fractures in bedrock, that allows
[593.76] water to percolate through and that
[596.399] water will erode and create caves. So,
[599.519] you know, you've got in Kentucky large
[602.16] regions of the bedrock are almost
[603.839] honeycombed with caves and that's
[605.6] because it's limestone. So, it's not out
[608.399] of the question that you would have
[610.88] major apertures or cavities within the
[613.68] limestone bedrock of Giza Plateau,
[616.56] right? Uh and that there has been water.
[619.68] So the question then becomes
[622.56] uh I don't think you can explain that
[625.36] erosion around the Sphinx by any other
[627.839] means than water. I mean I've seen many
[630.079] examples of wind erosion and water
[633.12] erosion and I'm definitely come down on
[635.519] the side of water erosion. So it raises
[637.6] the question when was that water there?
[640.32] Now Robert, you're familiar somewhat
[642.0] with Robert Shocks. Oh sure. Yeah. Yeah.
[644.88] Right. and uh you know he Anthony West
[648.959] before you kind of invited Shock out
[650.959] there. Yeah. Yeah. And I did have the
[653.6] privilege of meeting and getting to know
[656.24] uh John Anthony before he passed. Um
[660.16] which was great. We were in Egypt at the
[661.92] same time. Uh and we barely crossed
[664.16] paths at Carneack. Just enough to wave
[666.24] at each other. But uh but yeah, so it
[669.36] went from you know, Schwaller Dubich was
[671.36] the first one who proposed water erosion
[674.56] on the Sphinx and that and and John
[677.12] Anthony West got his cue from from
[679.68] Schwaller Dubich who wrote the famous
[681.76] two volume Temple and man actually which
[684.56] is right there. I've been looking at it
[687.04] recently. Um it's a deep dense work. Um,
[692.32] but anyway, so it went from Schwaller to
[694.399] Lubich to John Anthony West, then from
[696.399] John Anthony to Robert Shock, and then
[699.279] Robert took the uh took the ball and
[701.839] kind of ran with it. And uh, yeah, you
[704.399] know, I mean, I'm convinced that yes, it
[707.279] is water erosion. So then the next
[709.279] question is,
[711.279] when was the Well, it's the Sahara has
[713.44] been a desert for 5,000 years. So I
[717.12] don't think it was in the last 5,000
[718.8] years.
[720.519] So was it was it a protracted period of
[724.16] time like several millennia or was it a
[728.24] singular event? Now that I don't have an
[730.399] answer to but it does look like there
[732.88] have been major flooding events in Egypt
[736.72] particularly back during that kind of
[739.04] that younger dus window evidence of
[741.92] extreme Nile floods and so on all over
[744.88] North Africa. I mean all over North
[746.959] Africa. Yes. evidence of flooding all
[748.72] over. And but but yeah, if you ask
[751.24] Zahee, there is zero chance that it's
[754.48] water erosion. Zero. What does he What
[757.2] does he think it was? He says it's wind.
[759.04] He says it's wind. I know. There's no
[761.36] way. There's no way. I'm sorry. Yeah.
[763.519] Like, I'm not I'm not, you know, I'm not
[765.12] going to be as close-minded and take
[766.56] that to zero. But man, if that's wind
[768.639] erosion, doesn't that have to be like a
[770.16] million years older? I mean, it's like
[772.72] it it's it's for for for for wind to do
[775.6] that to limestone within the on the on
[779.36] the Sphinx means that limestone all over
[782.639] Egypt would look like that. If that's
[785.04] really what wind does to limestone. I
[787.44] mean, there's there's trillions of tons
[789.519] of limestone blocks all over Egypt, and
[792.0] none of them none of them look like
[793.44] that. None of them look like that,
[794.959] right? So, it it just doesn't make any
[796.88] sense. The whole thing to me. No. uh uh
[800.68] but you know uh I think that we will
[804.72] find there are going to be other
[806.399] examples uh you know the Assyrian uh you
[810.24] know Robert makes the uh the argument
[813.519] that the Assyrian is is much older
[817.2] and if you if you bury it something or
[819.44] you take the limestone you sheath it in
[821.279] granite now granite is not going to
[823.04] erode like limestone in a in in water
[826.0] right um but you know we've
[829.6] We can look at I I almost am tempted to
[832.16] pull it up here. I've done some
[833.839] interesting research on uh the quarrying
[837.92] techniques. Now, when I was in Egypt, I
[839.76] didn't have time to visit quaries. I've
[842.44] been next time I get back that's going
[844.8] to be high on my list because when you
[847.36] look at the quaries in Egypt
[848.959] particularly the limestone quaries going
[851.04] back to the old kingdom the the erosion
[854.079] on some of the the walls are
[857.0] so many so slight that you can still
[860.079] discern whether they you know the pick
[862.32] marks and the chisel marks. Yet, if you
[865.6] look at the the the the surrounding
[868.88] enclosure of the Sphinx, in some places,
[871.519] one to two feet of limestone material
[874.48] has been removed. Mhm. Um I'm tempted to
[878.399] to pull something up here just to look.
[880.639] Do you have by any chance
[882.44] any share on your end? Uh yeah, we we we
[886.16] we do actually. So So that was one of
[888.8] the things you know that the that the
[890.399] big void is going to be explored. That
[892.959] was a big drop that we had. And then the
[895.92] second thing was that there is a a a a
[901.12] third chamber or a second unexplored
[903.76] chamber that's been located within the
[906.56] Great Pyramid. and uh that that um we
[910.079] don't have plans to explore that one
[912.079] yet, but that was something that he he
[914.56] dropped on our show that um I guess is
[918.079] he's also mentioned on his lecture tour
[920.56] that he's doing, but that there's
[921.839] another chamber that has yet to be
[923.76] explored. It's not as big as the big
[925.279] void, but that was something else. And
[927.839] then Ryan, um if you could pull up for
[931.12] us the the graffiti that that that he
[935.279] also talked about on the show. So
[936.72] there's there's apparently Randall bin
[939.519] graffiti that has been discovered by
[942.639] Zahi's team um up within the relieving
[947.199] chamber, so-called relieving chamber of
[949.44] the so-called above the king's chamber
[952.16] and and that there's more graffiti that
[955.68] says basically Kufu's gang was here. So
[959.6] yeah, this is what he found. And there
[962.32] were I think Ryan, correct me if I'm
[964.48] wrong, but I think there were like three
[966.0] different sets of graffiti. Is this this
[968.88] maybe is even all three of them. Um but
[970.88] he said that he found them in multiple
[972.32] rooms above the king's chamber. And by
[974.0] rooms, he just meant little
[975.199] compartments. But but yeah, apparently
[977.44] it says um that Kufu's people were here
[980.8] and it was like the the 13th year of
[984.6] his reign or something like that. But it
[987.759] still is not conclusive proof that Kufu
[991.68] was the one who created the pyramid. I
[993.68] mean, these could have been uh there was
[995.519] that that uh we also talked through that
[997.759] u that piece of papyrus that that uh
[1000.639] talked about the um the the Torah
[1003.48] limestone that was being brought over
[1006.48] during Kufu's reign, but that certainly
[1008.48] could have been just an exterior
[1010.68] renovation. Um, and these people that
[1013.759] were part of Kufu's team could have just
[1015.68] been, you know, could have just been in
[1017.12] the pyramid doing doing work or doing
[1019.12] renovations or whatever. So, there's
[1020.72] there's still like no there's still no
[1023.6] conclusive proof in my mind even after
[1026.079] talking to him for a couple hours. I
[1027.76] mean, it's like you find all this
[1029.679] evidence and like you want to fit it
[1031.039] into your narrative, but it's it's just
[1033.679] evidence. It's just a theory. I mean,
[1035.199] it's a sure it's a good theory, but it's
[1036.799] not necessarily the that that like we
[1039.76] have all the answers just cuz we found
[1041.28] some ripped up piece of paper that said
[1042.799] that Kufu was cing and transporting uh
[1045.12] Torah limestone, which is, you know, so
[1048.88] um yeah, that that was that but I mean
[1050.799] that was a pretty big deal. This this
[1052.96] picture right there that he showed on
[1054.4] the show was a pretty big um you know,
[1056.559] another pretty big drop of information
[1058.32] it felt like. So, Zahi's team discovered
[1060.799] this this graffiti. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
[1064.4] Yeah. And he has no motive, you know. I
[1066.32] mean, I wouldn't.
[1070.64] Okay.
[1072.4] But, uh, No, I'm sure he's I'm sure they
[1074.48] really did. I'm sure it's brand new
[1075.76] graffiti. I mean, I'm I mean, I'm sure
[1077.12] it's like brand new discovered graffiti.
[1078.799] I'm I'm I'm sure that he didn't like
[1080.16] forge it, but but again, it I mean, it
[1082.4] looks really old, but but like it could
[1084.48] have come from Kufu and they could have
[1086.559] just been doing renovation, you I mean,
[1088.96] um, I I think that that there's I think
[1090.799] that we just need to remain open to the
[1092.919] possibility that it was created at a
[1095.679] different time that that, you know, that
[1097.44] that we don't necessarily know that for
[1099.52] sure. And I it just feels like the
[1101.24] Sphinx, I mean, that that it's it's just
[1103.84] much more likely than not that the
[1105.6] Sphinx is significantly older. So, why
[1107.6] wouldn't the why wouldn't the pyramids
[1109.44] be older? All right, aerial view of the
[1111.76] Sphinx. And then we see the Sphinx ditch
[1114.08] here. um you know on the west side you
[1117.52] can see the the rounded forms of the uh
[1121.919] of the limestone uh exposed here. Let's
[1125.12] go to the next one here. um just with
[1128.679] so yeah and here you can kind of see the
[1132.24] uh in the background here and you know
[1134.64] the sphinx temple and the valley temple
[1136.559] in the in the front here with assuming
[1140.4] that uh these blocks these these
[1143.76] megalithic blocks here are were quarried
[1147.679] uh because you know Matt that the
[1149.76] original sphinx is mostly it's bedrock
[1153.2] and a yardang is an outcrop this
[1156.32] limestone art out outcrop. So there was
[1158.24] this yard dang emerging from the sand at
[1161.039] some point. This is the assumption and
[1162.799] that makes sense to me. And that was
[1164.24] what was carved into the head and then
[1166.48] the blocks around the body were quarried
[1169.52] away in order to expose, you know, from
[1172.559] roughly the neck down of this of the
[1174.96] Sphanx. Randall, pull that mic a little
[1177.52] closer for me. Sure. Okay, you got it.
[1180.0] Okay. So then I'm going to This is a an
[1183.76] exhausted New Kingdom limestone quarry.
[1186.72] And note the traces of the stepwise
[1189.36] removed blocks. Uh I wish I had a person
[1192.4] standing in here. You could see this is
[1193.76] actually you see this doorway and you
[1195.36] think, "Oh, this is six feet high." But
[1196.96] this is really these these layers here
[1199.36] are like three feet each of these. So a
[1202.0] person standing here is going to be
[1203.36] relatively small. But this is new
[1206.76] kingdom and this is essentially the
[1210.08] Egyptian method of stone quaring by
[1212.24] means of separation trenches.
[1215.4] Um the assumption is is that they're
[1217.919] using chisels to remove the the the rock
[1221.919] between uh each of the separate blocks.
[1225.76] Uh and here would be a cross-section
[1228.96] profile. Here you can see the stepped
[1231.0] profile. This is your working trench
[1233.52] here. And then this block is removed and
[1236.32] then this is excavated. And generally
[1238.72] what they'll do is they'll look first
[1241.12] for natural bedding planes because that
[1243.28] provides the the the easiest way for to
[1246.559] separate the blocks, right?
[1249.559] Um so here's a cross-section profile of
[1252.559] what a
[1254.919] prequarry excavation pre-exavation
[1257.84] quarry would look like. Um, and they're
[1260.48] just you remove the the overburden to
[1263.36] get to the to the bedrock to the
[1265.679] limestone and then each block is
[1268.32] successively
[1270.28] removed. And this is kind of what you're
[1273.039] left with here is once those blocks have
[1275.039] been removed, you've got this stepped
[1276.799] profile. You'll still see stepped
[1278.48] profiles in modern quaries, right?
[1282.559] So here's uh this is stone pickmarks on
[1285.76] a limestone quarry from a ramicide times
[1289.6] roughly 1200 years BC. So you can see
[1293.6] very prominent the the the the pick
[1295.84] marks have not been eroded away. Here is
[1299.52] stone pickmarks in a quarry from the
[1301.36] early new kingdom. So this is roughly
[1303.6] 3,500 years ago. And again they they
[1306.08] haven't there hasn't been enough
[1308.159] material removed to uh obscure the the
[1311.679] pick marks. So for 3,500 years this has
[1314.88] been a desert environment which is a
[1316.64] very low uh erosional environment right
[1320.159] because there's water is the primary
[1322.799] agency of erosion here. And then this is
[1325.84] uh old kingdom. So this is circuit 4,000
[1329.2] years ago. And again you see the pick
[1331.919] marks that are left on the quarry walls.
[1334.72] Right. So, very little erosion has
[1338.12] occurred. Now, let's go back to the
[1340.48] sphinx. And you can see they're they're
[1343.36] riven with these solution cavities. And
[1345.52] I mean, this this is textbook water
[1348.32] erosion, particularly sheet floods
[1350.64] flowing over
[1352.72] uh the the walls of the ditch here.
[1356.24] Um, so here is a cross-section through
[1359.2] the west wall of the Sphinx enclosure
[1361.76] showing the actual limestone layers.
[1364.559] It's 22 ft in height and basically the
[1370.159] recession of the original quarry wall is
[1373.679] going to be a function of the inuration
[1376.4] of the limestone, meaning how hard is
[1378.32] the limestone. So, you know, this down
[1381.2] here is going to be a harder limestone
[1382.96] than than number 11 right here. Uh
[1386.08] because this is softer limestone. It's
[1388.64] it's it's eroded. It's recessed greater.
[1392.48] Now, here is a profile of what an
[1396.88] original quarry would have looked like.
[1399.36] And you can see here, this lines up
[1402.24] nicely with the natural bedding planes.
[1404.08] This is I've just taken this to scale.
[1406.0] This is the actual diagram we looked at
[1408.559] in the previous slide. Juxtaposing it on
[1411.6] the cross-section of the west wall of
[1413.36] the sphinx enclosure. We can see that
[1415.679] there's some nice lining up of the
[1417.36] bedding planes, but it gives you an idea
[1420.799] of what the original wall would have
[1423.76] looked like the day after all the blocks
[1426.32] were removed. M so the er the erosion
[1429.679] and the recession of the quarry wall is
[1432.159] not going to begin until again because
[1434.24] until the the blocks have been removed
[1437.2] and at that point now the weather can go
[1439.679] to work and start eroding the the the
[1443.039] profile and so you've got this original
[1446.36] profile and then this would be the end
[1449.2] result of the regime of erosion. So it
[1453.52] gives you an idea of how much uh
[1456.08] material has actually been removed from
[1458.24] that wall because that wall was
[1461.039] originally would have been and I don't
[1462.88] think even Zahi would argue this is that
[1465.919] you know the the the blocks that form
[1468.159] the the the Sphinx temple were removed
[1471.279] quarried and we can see the blocks
[1473.039] they're big rectalinear
[1475.08] blocks so there's no doubt that this
[1478.64] would have been roughly the profile at
[1481.6] the point the blocks were removed. D.
[1484.08] And again, the an important point is
[1486.799] that the erosion wouldn't commence until
[1488.96] the blocks have been removed. But
[1491.6] clearly there's erosion. You can argue
[1493.84] it's wind or you can argue it's water,
[1495.6] but there is erosion. I would say that
[1499.279] it's clearly water. There's a difference
[1501.6] between wind and water erosion because
[1504.159] for one thing, wind what it does is it's
[1506.96] going to pick up and entrain sand and
[1508.96] it's going to be almost like a um you
[1511.919] know, it's going to almost create a a
[1513.6] sand blasting effect
[1516.4] that creates a lot of pock marks and
[1518.559] things. It's it's very distinctive from
[1520.32] water. Water wants to smooth things off,
[1523.12] round things off. wind erosion is like I
[1526.08] said it's going to leave a very
[1527.919] granulated surface with pock marks and
[1530.64] so on. Um but I think this gives you an
[1533.52] indication of how much material had to
[1535.6] be removed in order to get the profile
[1538.64] that's there now. What what what percent
[1541.52] chance would you say that wind could be
[1543.679] the culprit for the erosion that we see
[1545.84] around the Sphinx? Is it zero or is it
[1548.08] just I would say wind has contributed
[1551.64] some amount to it clearly but again we
[1555.2] know that for a lot of the history of
[1557.919] the Sphinx at least since uh you know
[1560.72] Katherine's times it's been buried under
[1563.4] sand. So once it's buried it's wind
[1567.039] isn't going to do much. Um I would say
[1570.08] from my opinion that is wind erosion is
[1572.96] a component but a very a minor one.
[1576.559] compared to water. Right. Right. Um and
[1579.36] I don't know if I have them in this
[1580.72] particular presentation, but I have a
[1583.039] lot of photographs of water erosion,
[1585.6] particularly of limestone. And when you
[1588.159] look at it, it it's very suggestive that
[1592.0] highly suggestive that that this is
[1593.84] water, not wind. Um like I say, this is
[1597.279] just some stuff that I've collected in
[1599.44] this study of limestone erosion.
[1602.799] Limestones are highly soluble in acid
[1605.679] waters. However, they do not dissolve
[1607.679] equally over their surfaces and the
[1610.32] action of diss dissolution is usually
[1613.799] concentrated down joints and fissures.
[1616.64] The concentration of dissolution
[1618.96] processes down joints and fissures leads
[1621.76] to the focusing of water into such
[1624.159] joints and fissures. And if you go back
[1626.559] and you look at this, I mean, that's
[1628.4] exactly what he's describing right here.
[1630.799] Yeah. Exactly. Right. Right.
[1634.4] Right. So, um, so it's old. I think it's
[1639.919] got to be old. But now the question is
[1644.12] is again the the the the time frame um
[1648.799] because if you've got highly acidic
[1650.88] waters and they're loaded with let's say
[1653.44] sand or other grit material that could
[1656.32] accelerate the erosion, you could
[1658.64] accomplish a lot of erosion in a matter
[1660.72] of you know a few weeks or months
[1663.0] easily. On the other hand, if it's a
[1665.96] more that's where it's at in my mind
[1668.72] right now. Are we looking at something
[1670.4] that's extremely old where the the the
[1674.48] flooding that produced this erosion was
[1677.559] relatively um spread out? Or are we
[1681.6] looking at a single event or several
[1684.64] concentrated events? I don't know. I I
[1687.44] honestly don't know. But you can get an
[1689.679] idea. This is my uh approach to this was
[1693.2] to um study limestone erosion.
[1697.2] So here we got this is going back to 64.
[1699.279] This is rate of erosion of intertidal
[1701.919] limestone. Let me just real quick ask
[1704.0] you a question before you get absolutely
[1705.76] rand. It's But doesn't it feel like
[1709.24] if I if if this erosion was taking place
[1712.88] and it was destroying the monument, the
[1716.32] beautiful pristine stone monument that
[1719.919] whatever culture of people had
[1723.64] built, wouldn't they be repairing it and
[1726.799] like flattening the walls out so that
[1729.84] you didn't see all this all these rocks
[1732.399] on the on the the uh the the the the the
[1735.36] the casing wall around the Sphinx. Like
[1738.72] so I mean it almost it I mean just
[1740.88] logically it just seems like it all that
[1742.88] damage all that erosional damage would
[1744.88] have to be done after whatever that
[1746.64] civilization was that built the Sphinx
[1749.08] was no longer there whether they were
[1751.76] wiped out or or just you know correct.
[1754.64] Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Precisely. That's
[1757.44] exactly what I how I would interpret it.
[1759.76] Then another culture later on comes
[1762.88] along and maybe excavates removes the
[1766.24] sand and right you know if you and you
[1769.279] know it's interesting you of course this
[1771.84] is totally dismissed by mainstream
[1774.72] archaeology but you know if you read
[1777.88] Plato and his uh in his two dialogues
[1780.96] where he he he addresses the story of
[1783.76] Atlantis we we the report that comes
[1786.159] from the the elderly Egyptian priesthood
[1789.2] is that they have, you know, they they
[1791.679] inform Solon that they have their sacred
[1794.08] registers go back 9,000
[1796.76] years. Now, is that conceivable? Well, I
[1799.76] mean, mainstream archaeology just just
[1802.0] dismisses it. It's not conceivable. We
[1804.559] don't even need to consider that that
[1806.64] it's a possibility. M um but again in in
[1810.559] the in the uh spirit of the outrageous
[1813.12] hypothesis I think we could go well
[1815.36] let's consider is it possible that a
[1818.32] tradition could have been handed down
[1819.6] for 9,000 years. I don't know how Native
[1823.12] Americans are able to have myths and
[1825.52] stories about great floods in in North
[1827.76] America but they dozens and dozens of
[1831.279] them. And we know there have been
[1834.36] tremendously great floods in North
[1837.039] America at the end of the last ice age,
[1839.36] right? Um it's certainly doable. I mean,
[1841.52] we've handed down Christianity for 2,000
[1843.679] years, you know, Judaism for for 2,000
[1846.399] years. Um you know, Buddhism for 4600
[1850.48] years. I mean, it's like we're we can
[1852.48] humans can pass stuff down for a really
[1854.559] long time. For a really long time. Yeah.
[1856.64] So I don't ne I don't reject that out of
[1859.12] hand that they could have had traditions
[1861.52] passed down for 9,000 years. So if we go
[1863.76] back to this let's say the old kingdom,
[1866.159] we're almost halfway back essentially we
[1869.039] are halfway back to that 9,000 years,
[1871.76] right? Yeah. So is it so out of the
[1874.48] question that they had traditions about
[1876.72] a former civilization that could have
[1880.399] occupied that region? Not at all. and
[1883.52] that there would just just like now
[1885.44] we're looking at monuments in Egypt that
[1887.44] are 4,000 years old.
[1890.12] Well, perhaps there were monuments that
[1892.88] have been lost since then that were
[1895.6] thousands of years earlier than Old
[1898.159] Kingdom times, right? and and and when
[1900.72] we when we factor in the extent to which
[1904.24] we know the climate and environment of
[1907.12] North Africa and around Egypt, how
[1910.36] drastically it's changed. Um, you know,
[1914.559] it's likely that there were catastrophes
[1916.96] that could have interrupted the the
[1919.36] continuum of civilization. In fact, I
[1921.6] think that's a that's at this point an
[1924.72] established reality in my mind. I mean,
[1927.12] even just a couple of degrees of
[1928.72] temperature change to mess with the
[1930.72] crops for a couple years and you've got,
[1932.64] you know, you've completely lost a
[1934.159] civilization. So, yeah, I think we did
[1936.88] talk about that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So,
[1939.519] this this is we don't need to get into
[1941.6] this in in great detail, but this is the
[1943.84] kind of research I did to try to get my
[1945.679] head wrapped around uh what this Sphinx
[1949.039] erosion meant. And so this is this is
[1952.32] you know you have limestone shores
[1954.0] throughout the world which show
[1955.44] characteristic erosional features. In
[1958.399] quturnary limestones quaterturnary would
[1961.2] be the last 2 and a half million years
[1963.84] of the tropics and subtropics. There is
[1966.48] commonly a wide flat intertidal platform
[1970.72] which bounded at its landward side by an
[1973.519] undercut cliff. The notch or intertidal
[1976.799] nip it's called. This type of chore
[1979.279] profile is welldeveloped in Western
[1981.24] Australia. While there has been much
[1983.44] discussion about the nature of the
[1985.519] erosive process, surprisingly little
[1988.48] attention has been paid to the rate at
[1991.2] which it proceeds. So let me see. I
[1993.84] think here. Yeah. So all direct
[1996.72] estimates of the rate of erosion of
[1998.64] intertidal rock surfaces give figures of
[2001.519] quite a different order. Emory in 1941
[2004.799] on the basis of dated inscriptions
[2007.2] estimates the rate of retreat of sea
[2010.0] cliffs at la lyola laala California at 1
[2014.48] ft and 600 years at a mean rate of half
[2018.399] a millimeter a year. So now you're
[2020.88] talking intertidal. That means it's a
[2022.96] high energy erosional environment,
[2025.84] right? Because that's high tide, low
[2028.24] tide. The sea is encroaching. The surf
[2031.519] is pounding and washing against this
[2034.159] exposed limestone cliff. So what they
[2037.6] were able to do was determine that it
[2039.76] took uh 1 foot in 600 years. Now this is
[2043.76] a highly energetic erosional
[2045.6] environment. Now, going back to the
[2047.84] Sphinx wall, if we have a foot of
[2049.52] material removed, does that mean it was
[2052.159] subjected to 600 years of highly erosive
[2056.28] activity? I don't know. But we can go on
[2060.24] here. The shore rocks at Point Peron
[2062.48] near Perth are mainly hard, secondarily
[2065.44] cemented eolonite, which is wind blown
[2068.879] with a high calcium carbonate content,
[2071.28] which would be what you would find
[2072.8] typically in limestone. Here there is a
[2075.44] platform some 20 meters wide. Behind
[2077.839] this there is a typical notch. The notch
[2081.28] here faces inshore and is thus sheltered
[2084.0] from the full impact of the waves. To
[2086.48] obtain a direct measurement of the rate
[2088.48] of erosion, stainless steel rods were
[2091.76] driven firmly into the hard rock of the
[2094.079] notch in pairs at three levels above the
[2097.52] platform. There's been no movement of
[2099.52] the rods since they were placed. So
[2101.92] here's a a profile of it. It shows the
[2104.28] three rods driven into the rock. So now
[2108.48] what they were able to do was to measure
[2110.72] over a period of years how much the
[2113.52] limestone recessed because the the rod
[2117.2] is not eroding. So it's going to recess
[2120.64] and then you're going to have more of
[2122.16] the metal rod exposed. Right. That makes
[2125.52] sense, right? Sure. Yeah. Absolutely.
[2127.28] Not note positions of steel pegs and
[2130.56] amount of rock eroded from
[2133.96] 1953 to
[2136.52] 1962. And uh here was 2 mm, 4 mm, and 9
[2141.52] mm. And that makes sense because the
[2144.24] lower is going to be subject to more
[2147.359] erosion than the higher ones cuz the you
[2150.16] know at high sea level yeah it's going
[2152.079] to be eroding up at that higher level
[2154.96] which is um here is uh heights above the
[2158.2] data. Uh so this is mean sea level right
[2162.16] here. This is mean sea level. So just a
[2164.88] little bit above mean sea sea level. The
[2166.72] rate of erosion was 9 mm. Um but as you
[2170.0] get higher it's less erosion. That makes
[2172.32] sense, right? Because down here the
[2174.8] waves are washing up against this more
[2178.28] consistently. Yeah. So then
[2180.92] uh we'll skip all this but so at this
[2183.92] level the mean rate of erosion was 1
[2186.16] millimeter per year. A figure that is
[2188.16] again very close to estimates from
[2190.72] limestone shores elsewhere. And uh so 1
[2195.28] millimeter per year. So, you know, a
[2198.4] thousand years is going to be 1,000
[2200.92] millimeters or a meter, right? Right.
[2204.16] So, that's 1,000 years of erosion would
[2207.96] remove three a little over 3 ft of
[2211.04] limestone, right? Cut that in half, you
[2213.92] know, you're looking at about a foot and
[2215.28] a half. So, that's 500 years. And that's
[2217.839] sort of consistent with the other study
[2219.76] we just looked at. So here um we can get
[2223.92] an idea of okay how much does limestone
[2226.88] erode under what particular regime of of
[2230.32] climate and so forth and energy. Um we
[2234.48] can look at uh others like this is an
[2237.44] interesting way to to determine erosion
[2240.64] rates. You look at inscription
[2242.24] legibility method for estimating rock
[2244.48] weathering rates. Well, if you have a
[2246.32] gravestone, it's going to have a date
[2249.359] inscribed into it, isn't it? Right. It's
[2251.68] going to have a a gra So, the death of
[2253.92] that individual and when they were
[2255.68] buried there, they've got a grave
[2257.119] marker. It's got the date of the death.
[2259.52] So, that's the date that that stone was
[2261.76] put out into the weather. So, there's
[2264.079] been those kinds of studies.
[2266.44] Um then
[2268.76] uh so this Emory was the first to
[2272.48] quantify rock surface recession rates
[2274.72] from inscription legibility by noting
[2277.52] that 3.2 mm deep carvings in the
[2281.2] wavewashed calccarious sandstones, this
[2283.839] is the one we just looked at, were
[2286.24] obliterated in six years. So cliff
[2288.64] retreat to 50 mm per century. Um
[2293.599] uh yeah. So then on these on this study
[2297.68] here's the this the summary of it. The
[2300.079] mean of several observations gave us the
[2302.079] rate of solution about 1 in in 500
[2304.44] years. So now let's let's just take
[2306.72] that. Now this is here's here we're
[2308.64] looking at an environment where it's
[2311.04] going to be maybe 40 to 50 inches of
[2314.16] rainfall per year but much lower
[2316.96] erosional energy available obviously
[2319.52] than a clip cliff that's faced right
[2321.599] into the pounding surf. Right. So this
[2324.48] represents a low energy erosional
[2326.96] environment. The cliff face represents a
[2329.599] high energy erosional environment. And
[2332.24] here it says the mean of several
[2333.599] observations gave uh 1 in in 500 years.
[2337.119] Now let's go back to the Spanx. If it
[2340.0] was just under a normal erosional
[2343.2] environment where you might get 40 in of
[2345.599] rainfall per year, which is kind of what
[2347.68] we get here in the southeastern United
[2349.599] States, 40 to 50, one inch in 500 years.
[2352.48] Well, we can see that conservatively in
[2354.8] some places 12 or 16 in or more of rock
[2359.04] face have been removed. So, let's use 12
[2362.96] * 500 and now we're looking at 6,000
[2366.48] years of erosion. So, you can begin to
[2369.2] see here we're establishing some
[2371.8] parameters, but whether it's a fast
[2375.2] erosional environment or a slow
[2376.88] erosional environment, we're faced with
[2379.28] some conundrums. We're we're faced with
[2381.44] some questions here like okay if it was
[2385.64] quarried say 10,000 years ago when there
[2389.44] was fairly significant rainfall for four
[2392.72] or 5,000 years well maybe it could do
[2395.52] that over like we just said here f six
[2397.92] this came up to 6,000 years. Okay that's
[2400.8] one scenario. The other scenario is
[2403.359] you've got a high energy erosional
[2405.44] environment and it happened much
[2408.04] quicker. Right? So what I've tried to do
[2410.96] in this study is establish the
[2412.72] parameters here within which this
[2416.24] erosional phenomena could take
[2418.68] place and they're very consistent. you
[2421.119] know, limestones, their origins,
[2422.64] distribution, and uses. The United
[2424.48] States Bureau of Standards, they
[2426.56] conducted an experiment because what
[2428.32] they did here, they took 2-in cubes of
[2430.48] rock and exposed on the roof of the
[2433.92] bureau's building in Washington, and
[2436.48] after careful weighing spread over a
[2438.64] period of about 7 years, it was found
[2441.28] that from exposure to the weather, an
[2443.68] oolytic limestone would lose a layer
[2445.76] about 1 millm in thickness in a 100
[2448.64] years.
[2450.0] The loss from a compact crystal
[2451.76] limestone was about 1/3 less. And so 1
[2454.88] millimeter per 100 years equals 38 of an
[2458.16] inch in a thousand years. Now that's in
[2461.68] the environment of Washington
[2463.72] DC. You see it's sitting on the roof.
[2466.56] Mhm. Uh this will be the last one we'll
[2469.119] look at. I've got more. But this kind of
[2471.2] this one was a um uh in the Tennessee
[2474.8] River. Uh what they were doing was they
[2477.68] were uh yeah the purpose of this paper
[2480.0] is to present a few figures on the rate
[2481.68] of solution of some limestone boulders
[2484.0] in the Tennessee River at Watts Bar Dam.
[2487.2] Since the limestone dissolved very
[2489.52] slowly and almost unnoticeably to man
[2491.839] there is very little exact information
[2493.599] on this subject. So in 1912 to 1913 the
[2497.28] core of engineers United States Army
[2499.2] constructed a navigation dyke of large
[2501.599] limestone boulders almost in midstream
[2504.64] of the Tennessee River at Wattsbar. The
[2507.68] second stage coffer dam at Wattsbar. You
[2510.24] know coffer dam is when they isolate a
[2512.64] part of the river to divert the flow.
[2516.0] Right? So that's what they did. They
[2517.44] created this coffer dam and it exposed
[2519.839] this navigation dyke of limestone
[2522.0] boulders that had been below the river.
[2525.52] So the river has been washing over it
[2528.16] for for decades, right? Uh let's see.
[2531.28] Okay, it had been in the river for 27
[2533.52] years. So now they build a coffer dam.
[2536.64] They now expose these limestone boulders
[2539.28] to to the atmosphere and they're able to
[2542.4] study how much erosion occurred. Uh the
[2545.52] boulders are required from a nearby
[2547.2] source. We don't need to get into all
[2549.04] that. Um it was found that pure
[2551.68] limestone had dissolved from one quarter
[2553.68] to 3/4 inch more than the impure lamini
[2557.44] only because the impure lamini had had
[2559.68] harder stuff in it. But anyways, it is
[2562.319] by this means that the rate of solution
[2563.76] of limestone is established. The rate of
[2566.56] solution of these limestone boulders is
[2568.64] not comparable to the rate of solution
[2571.119] of a limestone under normal groundwater
[2573.8] conditions. But in case of free movement
[2576.96] of the river water as under a limestone
[2579.72] bluff over the limestone on the bed of
[2582.72] the river through open joints or seams,
[2585.359] the rate is comparable. And so here was
[2588.4] the rate 1/2 inch in 25 years.
[2592.079] Okay, so let's think about that. You've
[2593.76] got limestone boulder. It's submerged
[2595.76] under a freshwater river. That fresh
[2599.2] water flowing over that is going to
[2601.52] erode it at a rate of a/ inch in 25
[2604.4] years. Let's go back to 16
[2607.64] in* 25
[2610.24] * 2. So at that
[2613.8] rate, water washing over the
[2617.319] limestone would have removed. It would
[2619.52] have taken 800 years to remove 16 in.
[2623.52] And we're see 16 inches of material
[2625.68] removed from the sphinx wall. So now you
[2628.56] can I think begin to see sort of the
[2630.56] complexity of this and the some of the
[2632.24] problems confronted. What was the first
[2635.44] of all you have to go to what was the
[2637.76] water flow? How what was the volume of
[2639.52] water flow for how long? Was it a single
[2642.48] episode? Was it multiple episodes? Was
[2645.119] it more normal erosion? But that in
[2647.839] itself would imply many millennia of
[2650.96] erosion. So you this is kind of where
[2655.72] um the you can you can kind of brings
[2658.96] the problem into into bold relief. Now
[2661.28] what I would like to do see is some
[2663.28] optically stimulated luminescence type
[2666.079] dating on the exposed walls of the
[2668.8] sphinx ditch. Nobody's ever done that to
[2671.04] my knowledge. Which would show the
[2673.68] problem there might be is because the
[2676.079] the exposure to galactic cosmic rays
[2679.56] which create the the the the imprint
[2683.96] um have been interrupted from time to
[2687.04] time when the when the ditch became
[2688.8] filled with sand. But I would still
[2691.599] think you could get some kind of an
[2693.44] idea. But going back to the question of
[2697.44] water flow in Egypt, well, isn't it also
[2700.16] an issue that it's been kind of probably
[2702.839] slowly continuously eroding over, you
[2706.319] know, at least the last 40 46 years, but
[2711.28] probably 10,000. I mean, a problem as it
[2713.599] relates to the OSL, right? Yes. This is
[2717.44] Yes. But yeah, right. And I'm not an
[2720.319] expert in OSL. So, but I think that give
[2723.52] me a couple more days. Okay. Um and uh
[2726.88] but it seems like that could be a a
[2729.44] viable way of of getting at least some
[2732.4] estimate of how long that ditch has been
[2735.68] exposed to the air. Okay. uh because
[2738.96] that's you know it's being used in in
[2741.28] glacial studies because you know if you
[2743.68] have a rock that's under the glacier
[2745.839] that's been worried and then the glacier
[2748.64] recedes exposes the rock to the
[2751.72] atmosphere now the the whole process uh
[2756.56] uh begins at that point. Mhm. Uh so
[2761.52] exposure to the atmosphere resets the
[2764.0] the the uh atomic clock in in the rocks
[2768.88] and then it starts creating uh you know
[2772.56] isotopic byproducts and then you can
[2774.96] measure that and get some estimate. Um
[2779.28] yeah. So but it's not wind.
[2782.24] I don't think it's wind. I don't think
[2783.52] it's wind, man. No, I I don't because
[2786.0] you know, Robert shown pictures of of
[2788.079] wind erosion and it's very distinct. You
[2790.16] don't have to be a geologist if you look
[2792.24] at a few of them and then I can show you
[2793.76] pictures. Okay, here's wind erosion.
[2795.359] Here's water erosion. Right. And and
[2797.119] you'd see it all over all the other
[2798.64] limestone in Egypt and this place was
[2801.119] covered with sand for thousands of
[2803.119] years. So it's like Exactly. Yeah. It
[2805.52] doesn't make any sense. So this is going
[2808.8] and this is way back from 1960. Uh so
[2811.92] what is that 40 50 65 years ago but this
[2816.319] was an early textbook on geomorphology.
[2819.2] Mhm.
[2820.16] uh BW Sparks he was one of the early uh
[2824.4] highly esteemed geologist wrote
[2826.839] geomorphologists wrote wrote a textbook
[2829.599] and he's talking about uh in Egypt all
[2832.96] right he says
[2834.44] um stream floods although stream floods
[2837.92] and sheet floods may be effective agents
[2841.359] in the formation of semierid
[2844.44] landforms many deserts bear the imprint
[2848.079] of even more significant ificant water
[2850.76] action. It seems very doubtful whether
[2854.0] the required amount of water ever falls
[2856.96] in present conditions and many
[2859.599] authorities have attributed such erosion
[2861.76] to a wetter period during the pleasy.
[2865.04] For example, the valley on the west side
[2866.88] of the Nile at Luxor containing the
[2869.76] tombs of king of the kings appears to be
[2873.119] a water eroded valley, but the tombs
[2876.079] themselves show no signs of destructive
[2878.4] water action. This means that water
[2881.04] action of any significance probably
[2883.96] ceased at least 4,000 years ago. M
[2889.56] um so he goes on but yeah I mean there
[2892.4] is evidence and it's continued to
[2894.52] accumulate in the last 65 years since
[2897.68] this was written that there have been
[2900.28] extreme per periods of extreme rainfall
[2903.119] and flooding throughout Egypt. Mhm. So
[2905.839] why is it such a huge leap to think that
[2909.2] you know the Giza plateau could have
[2911.119] been uh subject to some of these water
[2914.0] flows? Yeah.
[2915.48] Um, I feel like I should show you some
[2918.4] pictures here. Let's see.
[2922.92] because to just to give you an idea how
[2925.44] how impressive uh some of these water
[2928.24] flows might have been. Let me go
[2931.8] to miss. Okay. So a wadi is a a water
[2938.319] eroded channel in the desert floor that
[2941.04] has very little water in it now if any
[2944.24] except during flash floods when you
[2947.839] might have you know every few years
[2950.64] every decade or so you might get uh
[2953.599] rainfall and then you the wadi will
[2956.079] become active for a short period of time
[2958.48] and then it goes back into being uh
[2961.44] being dry not necessarily really know
[2964.079] how to pronounce all these words, but
[2965.52] Wadi Firan. It's the largest oasis in
[2968.319] the Sinai Desert. And what it is is
[2971.72] this, it's a watercarved valley. Uh, and
[2977.44] one of the uh questions would be again
[2980.8] uh how
[2982.119] long was this did it take to cut this
[2984.96] valley? I'll go through and show you a
[2986.559] couple of more here. So, here's a
[2988.24] photograph and this is the Wii here.
[2990.16] It's a valley. It's been carved by
[2992.839] water.
[2996.76] Um, and here you can see the floor of
[3000.24] the Wadi Fen, the largest oasis in the
[3003.119] cyanade. You'll notice that it's a lot
[3005.359] of boulders. Right. Right. This this is
[3008.0] this is all water deposit. That's a
[3010.079] camel down there.
[3012.24] Uh, well, that's a just a little uh what
[3015.68] does it say here?
[3018.4] That's not a real camel. Okay. That's
[3020.48] just a little little little icon. Um Oh,
[3025.359] okay. So, here I thought he was
[3027.52] literally standing on that rock. That's
[3029.04] funny. So, here's uh Aadi in the Sahara
[3033.92] Suda or Black Desert. And this is very
[3038.16] typog. You'll see very similar
[3040.079] formations in the deserts of
[3042.52] southwestern US, right? Um, you notice
[3046.16] the cliff face here, the material that's
[3050.16] uh spled up against the the cliff face.
[3053.52] Uh, and then the flat valley floor.
[3056.48] You'll notice there's a whole bedrock uh
[3059.28] floor. You see some of it prominent
[3061.76] here, but uh it's buried out here. Um,
[3065.92] and Randall, that that material that's
[3068.4] that's pushed up against the cliff face
[3070.319] there, would that have been deposited
[3072.319] there during the actual flood fl from
[3075.04] the floodwaters themselves? Okay. So,
[3078.24] when you see this kind of a formation
[3080.72] typically in the in the term that's
[3082.24] usually uh used to uh describe it as
[3086.04] talis. So, there's two ways of imp
[3088.319] placing it. Uh, gravity or water.
[3092.48] Now, gravity when that means that the
[3095.68] rocks are falling off the cliff face and
[3098.079] piling up, right? Well, the larger the
[3101.52] uh material banked up against the the
[3104.4] cliff, the more the cliff is going to
[3106.4] have receded.
[3108.24] And what you see in many cases is that a
[3111.2] lot of the material particularly well I
[3113.04] can even show you photographs of some of
[3115.28] the stuff that we see uh out in the
[3118.4] western US is definitely water impaced.
[3122.4] I don't know about this but I would
[3124.24] guess if if I had to guess I would say
[3126.72] it's most likely water in place. I'll
[3129.119] show you like look at this right over
[3130.88] here. You're going to see something in
[3132.8] just a minute I'll show you which we
[3134.8] know was water in placed. Um, and you'll
[3138.16] notice that the cliffs are pretty pretty
[3140.72] vertical here. They're pretty sheer,
[3142.64] right? So, did all of this material come
[3145.119] off the cliff? Probably not. And this
[3147.599] this uh this mineral that you see, the
[3150.88] mineral uh concentrations you see on the
[3153.599] surface would have indicated at one time
[3156.16] there was a lot of water in here. It was
[3158.88] probably sluggish and then it evaporated
[3161.359] and it like if you dug down you might
[3164.16] have 50 or 100 feet of sediment here and
[3166.64] then at the bottom of that you're going
[3168.0] to have bedrock. Wow. Now let's see. So
[3171.119] here's another example of a watt. Now
[3173.04] this has very sheer walls, right? You're
[3177.119] going to see bigger rocks and more
[3179.04] rubble if it's gravity and more like
[3181.52] kind of sand and dirt. What you're going
[3183.599] to see like look at this rock right
[3185.44] here. If it's if it's fallen off a
[3187.92] cliff, it's going to have sharp edges,
[3190.559] angular edges, right? Uh and it has if
[3193.839] you see this rounding, that indicates
[3196.4] it's been moved by water, right? Water
[3199.92] will will roll and tumble a rock. It'll
[3202.48] start by breaking off the edges and the
[3204.52] corners. Just like imagine your your you
[3207.359] know your little lapidary unit. You
[3209.119] throw your pebbles in there and what
[3210.559] comes out is smooth rounded rocks,
[3213.599] right? Yep.
[3215.559] So, here's another one. You can see some
[3218.0] of the rocks in the foreground. So,
[3220.319] these have been
[3221.8] transported. Um, this would you would
[3224.559] call this sub angular because it's
[3227.28] somewhat angular, but the corners have
[3230.24] been have been eroded off right here.
[3232.559] They're rounded. They're not
[3235.24] sharp. And let's see. Again, you'll see
[3238.48] massive piles of boulders. Some of them
[3241.2] have sharp edges, so they probably were
[3243.839] stripped off the canyon walls and not
[3246.079] transported very far. The amount of
[3249.119] rounding is an indication of the uh the
[3252.88] distance of transport. The more they're
[3255.52] transported, the more rounder they get.
[3257.839] Makes sense. Yep. And here you've got
[3259.76] this large flat floor. Um, we can see
[3262.8] exactly the same kind of thing
[3264.48] throughout the evidence of the Pacific
[3266.8] Northwest where you had these gigantic
[3270.24] uh flows, discharges of 50 to 100
[3273.359] million cubic feet per
[3275.48] second. And when the water drains away,
[3278.0] it'll often times create a flat floor.
[3280.8] Uh, also the natural arched bridges
[3285.44] which they're they're all over the world
[3287.44] now, but none of them to my knowledge
[3289.839] are actually in the process of being
[3292.44] created. They're in the process of being
[3295.0] destroyed by the modern erosional uh uh
[3299.76] environment. In fact, there was one that
[3301.52] I
[3302.28] visited maybe a decade ago that recently
[3305.319] collapsed out in uh where was it? Which
[3308.48] one was that again? I think that one was
[3310.319] in Arizona. Uh, but it's very difficult.
[3313.92] Ask a gradualist-minded geologist to
[3316.8] explain the the genesis of rock arches
[3319.92] and natural
[3321.24] bridges. Here's another one. Look at
[3323.599] this. See, see these features here?
[3325.92] Yeah, it's cool. Yeah. Ain't that cool?
[3328.319] Yep.
[3330.079] Okay. Uh, let's just jump on. Uh, yeah.
[3333.599] So, here we have This is a very
[3335.76] interesting I can I'll provide this if
[3337.76] you'd like to read this. This is a very
[3339.599] interesting study uh in the journal
[3342.48] global and planetary change
[3344.48] reconstructing an extreme flood from
[3346.88] boulder transport and rainfall runoff
[3349.2] modeling wadi Isa is Isla South Cyani
[3353.4] Egypt and this is where it is there's
[3356.0] many dozens and dozens of these wadis um
[3359.68] and this one here is draining the
[3362.799] uplands here out onto the what would
[3365.28] have been the coastal plane at one time
[3367.92] and so So here you can kind of get to
[3369.96] see when this wadi was created. This is
[3373.44] some of the sediment that's being
[3375.2] transported within that wadi. So this is
[3379.44] this I mean like you look at this. This
[3381.599] is a rock that was plucked from the
[3384.079] canyon walls, transported and dumped
[3387.2] here once the now picture this clearly
[3389.76] by wind Randall. Clearly this was wind
[3391.839] erosion here.
[3393.4] Well, uh, that would have been quite a
[3396.48] wind. At least 20 or 30 miles an hour
[3399.92] yesterday. At least. At least. So,
[3402.079] picture this, a channel, a narrow
[3404.24] channel, and the water you in water
[3407.44] flow. In hydraology, you've got a a
[3409.68] conservation of mass pro uh uh
[3413.28] circumstance. So, that you have a narrow
[3415.92] channel like this. The water's rushing
[3417.68] through it. Right now, let's say that
[3420.0] that narrow channel opens out into an a
[3423.0] basin. Well, that water that's rushing
[3425.599] through that channel at one velocity, um
[3429.52] let's say it's moving at 20 to 25 miles
[3432.16] an hour or more even. Once it breaks
[3435.2] through of the confining channel, it
[3437.119] spreads out and then it slows down. The
[3440.0] competency of flowing water to transport
[3442.559] sediment is based upon primarily the
[3445.44] velocity of the water. Secondarily the
[3447.68] depth of the water but primarily its
[3449.799] velocity. Now when it breaks free of the
[3452.799] confining channel it both spreads out
[3455.44] and it slows down. So at the mouth of
[3458.72] many uh mountain uh river creek channels
[3464.0] and valleys so on you will see a a fan
[3467.92] delta. It's called spled out from the
[3470.4] mouth of the of the channel, right? And
[3473.44] and you will see that at the as you go
[3476.24] up towards the mouth of the channel, the
[3478.64] sediment will be larger. It can be
[3481.28] boulders, but at the distal end of it,
[3483.44] it could be finer pebbles, even sand or
[3486.64] even silt. Right? So, what's happening
[3489.04] is we're this guy is standing right at
[3491.119] the mouth of a wadi. So, as this water
[3493.76] is breaking loose from the confinement
[3496.079] of the channel, it's dumping its cargo
[3498.559] of
[3499.559] sediment. Now, let's go to the next one.
[3501.76] Look at this
[3502.68] boulder. So, this is a boulder that has
[3505.2] now been transported in the water
[3508.119] flow. So, that is a pretty substantial
[3511.359] flow of water. So, how do you get that?
[3513.76] Well, it had to have been rainfall,
[3515.44] extreme rainfall.
[3517.48] Somewhere, you know, up valley there was
[3520.319] a rainfall. Now, this is probably over
[3522.24] the the highlands there. We saw the you
[3524.72] go back to the map here uh right here.
[3528.72] So, you have rainfall over the Sinai
[3530.88] massive and then that runs off. It
[3533.52] collects in these channels. It runs off
[3536.4] but there's enough rainfall that the
[3538.559] flows in these channels are enormous
[3541.68] enormous flows very destructive highly
[3544.24] catastrophic.
[3545.76] And then when it when it the French term
[3548.4] is douche. When that water debouches out
[3552.079] onto the plane, it dumps its its cargo
[3555.92] of of boulders.
[3558.559] So you can see this here.
[3562.599] Um here's where you can see it's it's
[3565.599] it's emerged from the confinement of the
[3568.4] uh channel where it would have been very
[3571.119] much deeper. But once it comes out onto
[3573.52] the plane, it shallows. And this dash
[3576.64] line shows the water level. And that's
[3578.64] probably 50 feet above the valley floor.
[3581.599] And then it begins to dump its cargo.
[3585.16] Um, now notice this giant flood rolled
[3588.2] boulders. So this guy,
[3590.92] so looking at this picture, you see the
[3594.16] boulders. Those boulders were stripped
[3597.28] from the quarrying or the the excavation
[3601.359] of the channel the wadi.
[3604.119] So behind him you see a cliff in front
[3607.52] of him over on the other side there'll
[3609.599] be another cliff. So the water flow
[3613.119] excavates the cliff, entrains the the
[3616.16] the quarried boulders, sweeps them down
[3619.2] current and then once the channel begins
[3621.92] to open up, it dumps that cargo of
[3625.4] boulders. Okay. Now compare that to the
[3628.079] next
[3628.839] picture, which is a picture of me taken
[3631.359] in southern Idaho. How fast is the water
[3633.92] traveling to move those boulders? Oh,
[3636.24] probably 40 to 50 m an hour. Yeah. So
[3639.04] it's moving fast. Yeah. But but take
[3641.599] just for comparison. Look,
[3644.72] it's the same phenomena. This is Idaho.
[3648.0] This is the Sinai. Yep. And like across
[3652.24] from me is another cliff like this one.
[3655.28] The the counterpart before this this
[3658.559] water flow happened
[3660.839] here. There was not this cliff didn't
[3663.88] exist. Right. Right. This is I'm on a
[3666.88] boulder bar here that's three miles long
[3669.119] and hundreds of feet thick. In fact, I
[3672.16] just took a tour group out and we
[3673.76] visited this boulder bar a few weeks
[3675.52] ago. Uh this picture was taken I think
[3678.24] in
[3679.4] 2000 I'm younger there. Um early 2000s.
[3684.48] When was I there? It was 2002 2003
[3689.04] something like that. So I took a group
[3691.119] of 38 people back. This is one of the
[3693.76] sites we visited.
[3696.16] And uh I wanted them and and again look
[3699.2] at the this is interesting like look at
[3701.359] this boulder. You see there's a sharp
[3703.52] edge right here. So this boulder was
[3706.319] quarried. It was rolled and somewhere
[3708.4] before it was
[3709.72] dumped it it was it had enough of a of a
[3713.52] of a a an impact against it that part of
[3718.64] the rock broke off. Okay. Right. So you
[3722.16] can see that right here. Y um and as you
[3725.119] go you'll see that most of these rocks
[3727.04] are rounded but a lot of them you know
[3729.119] because again this is a very violent
[3732.48] uh thing that's happening here and these
[3734.0] rocks are rolling and tumbling so
[3736.319] they're not only getting round rounded
[3738.16] off but at some points many of them will
[3740.319] break and
[3742.52] fracture and uh what type of rock was
[3745.68] that Randall was that that one basalt
[3747.52] was it? This is basalt. Yes. Okay. So
[3750.319] here we have what are called imbrecated
[3752.24] boulders and cobbles and water will do
[3755.839] this very distinctive type of stacking.
[3758.319] The uh the analogy I use is imagine
[3761.839] you've got a bookshelf with books on it,
[3764.96] right? I can almost turn my camera here
[3767.28] and we could look at my bookshelf, but
[3768.72] you'll get the idea. If I push it this
[3772.0] way, it'll tilt. You see? Yeah. If I
[3775.599] push it this way, the books will tilt
[3777.76] this way. Well, the water will do the
[3780.319] same thing. It'll take these rocks and
[3782.0] it'll stack them like that. And that's
[3784.559] what you see here, right? So, you can
[3787.2] look at this and you can look you can
[3790.16] see the direction of water flow is
[3792.0] indicated by the black
[3793.96] arrow. See, just imagine that you're the
[3797.839] that the that the force that the
[3800.079] pressure of the flow is coming from the
[3802.96] left towards the
[3804.92] right. And this is in Wadi.
[3808.96] Isla, if that's how you say it. This is
[3811.92] in uh Montana. And you're seeing if as
[3815.359] you look at this, you can see the same
[3816.88] type of imicate structure. Uh and the
[3820.079] water flow is from right to left. Here
[3822.96] you can see imitate boulders in the
[3825.2] southern
[3827.96] Appalachians. And once you've once
[3829.92] you've recognized this, you can you know
[3833.039] you you understand the process. So
[3835.2] looking at this, you don't even need the
[3837.119] arrow, do you? You can, you would know
[3838.64] that the water flow is from left to
[3840.4] right, right? See that? Yep. And then
[3844.16] you have masses of alovvium, which is
[3847.68] where the finer grain stuff is dumped in
[3850.72] thick layers. And again, look up here at
[3852.96] the top, Matt. You'll see this big old
[3855.24] boulder up here. The way to understand
[3858.4] what you're looking at here is this is a
[3860.88] dried out gigantic mud flow.
[3865.119] a mud flow. And this is in Wadi Isla,
[3869.16] Egypt. And then this one is in the
[3872.079] Mojave Desert of California. I think
[3875.119] it's I think it's Isla.
[3877.599] Thank you.
[3879.48] Easy. Okay. From now on, for the rest of
[3882.24] my life, I'm going to know how to
[3883.599] pronounce that word. Isla. Isla. That
[3886.319] makes sense. Isla. Isla. Uh so yeah, you
[3889.839] notice the what are called the hoodoo
[3891.839] here. And you'll see the same thing
[3893.76] right over here. Right. So after after
[3896.799] the imp placement of this mud flow, it
[3899.039] dries out and then overwash will carve
[3902.799] these hoodoo like features
[3905.4] here. So
[3908.24] uh
[3910.16] that's cool. Yeah, it's cool. And and
[3912.319] and it's literally like a language that
[3914.799] you can learn. And I'm trying to teach
[3916.88] people how to to read this language
[3919.24] because there's an epic story written
[3921.88] large into the surface of the entire
[3925.28] planet that we live on, right? And now,
[3928.559] you know, we've got things like this. We
[3930.079] can look at, you know, we've got
[3932.0] photographs. And when I took this, this
[3933.839] was um God, this had to have been more
[3935.92] than 20 years ago when I was exploring
[3937.92] this this channel here. And
[3940.24] interestingly, this this this led from
[3942.4] the
[3943.48] um this led from the uh the Mojave
[3948.72] Desert. And I was able to trace the
[3950.96] water flu through us through a
[3952.72] succession of canyons and basins that
[3955.96] held former lakes. All of this water
[3959.28] ended up in Death Valley and it
[3962.48] literally filled Death Valley a thousand
[3964.559] feet
[3965.4] deep. It's called Lake Manley. And you
[3969.599] know once you once you begin to realize
[3971.92] that the world we inhabit is the whole
[3974.88] the whole planetary surface has been
[3976.839] sculpted by these tremendous events um
[3981.2] gigantic floods, ice ages, impacts, huge
[3985.359] volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, the list
[3988.72] goes on and on and we realize my god
[3991.599] this is this the the model of earth
[3993.92] change now is way beyond the gradualist
[3998.16] models of a half century ago. Right.
[4001.039] Right. Yeah. No doubt about it. Yeah.
[4002.48] It's fascinating stuff, man. And I
[4004.72] guess, you know, it just seems like we
[4006.079] we ought to be able to very soon,
[4008.64] probably a lot sooner than we think,
[4011.039] plug in videos and images and just
[4014.319] overview of the terrain of wherever we
[4017.839] want to, all over the globe, North
[4019.92] America into AI and say, "What happened
[4023.039] here?" Yeah. you know, and and just be
[4026.079] and and just have it spit out like,
[4028.0] okay, there's a 98% possibility that the
[4031.52] uh you know, this is from from the the
[4034.079] glaciers rapidly melting or what, you
[4036.24] know, whatever the hell, right? Yeah. It
[4038.24] it shouldn't shouldn't being long I
[4040.0] think that there's global agreement upon
[4043.28] our human history and and what these
[4046.72] like it's you know it's it's one it's
[4049.52] there's very few people that can
[4050.88] actually read the earth and the images
[4053.28] of the earth and and look at rock
[4055.039] formations like you can and it feels
[4057.599] like AI should be able to help us be
[4060.319] able to actually spread some
[4061.76] intelligence amongst humanity that you
[4063.52] already have that you that you've had
[4065.119] for you know decades now and be able to
[4067.52] to really come to some conclusive
[4069.52] agreement upon what happened and where,
[4072.24] you know, well, working with Becket,
[4074.16] Beckett has already opened my eyes to
[4076.079] the possibility of AI. We've we've done
[4079.2] some very preliminary reconstructions of
[4083.039] like glaciated landscapes, uh, meltwater
[4086.559] discharge coming off the the glacial
[4088.799] front, uh, creating landscapes. So, this
[4093.44] was just, you know, a few weeks or a
[4095.039] month ago we did this. And I mean, I
[4097.199] knew the potential was there, but
[4098.88] working with Beckett, I was like, boom.
[4101.52] Oh, wow. Right. Right. It's going to
[4103.92] change everything in just a couple of
[4105.759] years. I mean, when when when you show
[4107.92] the images of the Sphinx to AI, and I
[4110.64] told Zahi this, it it spits out and you
[4113.359] take out archaeological bias, it spits
[4116.319] out 9 to 12,000 years old as the age of
[4120.4] the Sphinx. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Like
[4123.04] every time. I mean, Wow. Yeah. Yeah, I
[4126.239] mean that's what that's what I that's
[4127.92] every time I do it and every every time
[4129.6] I ask AI like if you take out
[4131.199] archaeological I mean just try it you
[4132.88] know after the after the show see what
[4134.64] it says to you and it's like yeah that
[4136.56] thing's it's 9 to 12,000 years old and
[4138.88] uh so he's like I don't believe in AI.
[4141.92] It's like okay well that's a convenient
[4143.759] way to Yeah. Yeah. I don't believe in
[4146.159] AI. Okay. Right. I don't believe in
[4147.92] intelligence. So, so yeah, I mean it's
[4150.56] um it it it it's pretty fasc and I think
[4153.199] like that's just the beginning though,
[4154.719] you know, when you start that's those
[4156.08] are images. Like I feel like when you
[4158.159] start to like you you survey the entire
[4161.279] surface of the planet of the earth with
[4163.759] you know with LAR and with um you know
[4167.279] ground penetrating radar and you know
[4169.759] you start to like get sonar on the coast
[4172.08] and you start to just feed all the
[4174.64] satellite imagery that we have of the
[4176.56] earth into into AI and you say look tell
[4179.199] me about the history of the earth from a
[4181.92] geological standpoint like what
[4184.0] happened. I feel like it it it ought to
[4185.679] be able to paint a fairly accurate
[4188.08] picture within the next couple of years.
[4189.759] And so I feel like that's I hadn't heard
[4191.679] anybody talk about this, but I feel like
[4193.04] that that's coming and that that like
[4194.64] we're we're on the brink of really
[4195.92] understanding a lot. I absolutely think
[4198.08] you you have to be right. Um and I think
[4200.56] we are just on the threshold of
[4204.8] developing entirely new models of of the
[4207.36] earth, global change, the history of the
[4209.52] planet. And where it to me is so
[4212.08] fascinating and relevant is when we
[4214.88] start understanding the nature the
[4217.679] extent of global change during the
[4219.6] period of time that we humans modern
[4221.84] humans have inhabited this planet and
[4224.239] it's been extraordinary. Yeah. Um just
[4228.4] extraordinary. And there's so many
[4229.76] things that I'd love to talk to you
[4231.76] about in further depth. I'm sure we'll
[4233.36] get a opportunity coming up in a few
[4236.64] weeks at the at the cosmic summit. Uh,
[4239.44] one of the people there that would be
[4241.28] worth checking out is is Dallas Abbott,
[4244.239] who's been uh in the forefront of doing
[4247.76] uh research into mega tsunamis around
[4250.56] the world and the evidence for gigantic
[4253.52] tsunamis um in some cases uh you know
[4258.0] with runup heights of over 600 ft. Mhm.
[4261.92] Um, which means, you know, that that
[4264.239] that's essentially a measure of how high
[4266.719] the the wave was when it made landfall.
[4270.0] And that's beyond the capacity of a
[4272.64] volcanic eruption or even a large
[4274.8] earthquake. You're probably getting into
[4277.28] it's extraterrestrial, right? I mean,
[4279.52] yeah, it sure certainly does seem like
[4281.679] that. Yeah. And uh yes, I like an
[4285.04] impact. I mean, like a comet, like a
[4286.96] correct. Yeah. or an asteroid, you know,
[4289.28] you got something like you got a half a
[4290.96] kilometer object moving at, you know, 20
[4293.44] miles per second, which is realistic.
[4295.52] Yeah. Yeah. That slams into the ocean.
[4297.76] Yeah. You you're going to get and here's
[4300.64] the thing. When you look at like if it
[4301.92] happens during the ice age, you know,
[4303.44] you had a much greater exposure of the
[4306.0] lowlying coastal plains around all the
[4308.88] continents, right? So your your run up
[4311.84] you with a tsunami, you've got two
[4313.76] things to consider. the runup height and
[4316.719] the runin distance. Now, obviously, if
[4319.92] you've got a steep terrain, and you can
[4323.199] still have a 100 foot wave that comes
[4325.199] in, but it's not going to go far inland.
[4327.6] But if you've got a very shallow plane
[4330.159] that can wash inland many, many miles.
[4332.4] So, you've got the runup height and the
[4334.64] runin height. During the ice age, a
[4337.44] tsunami could have a much greater
[4340.679] runin distance uh because of the the
[4344.56] exposed shallow coastal plains like
[4346.48] right here in in if we and I'm sure it
[4349.76] would have been roughly the same in in
[4351.12] in Florida. If I go here over to like
[4353.76] Savannah
[4355.36] uh on the on the uh east coast of
[4358.199] Georgia, you know, I'm right there
[4360.08] standing at the beach. And if I'm
[4361.76] suddenly transported back to the late
[4363.76] glacial maximum 15 to 20,000 years ago,
[4367.52] sea levels are 400 ft lower and the and
[4370.239] the coastline, the beach is going to be
[4372.32] 50 miles further east and I'm going to
[4374.32] be standing in the middle of the forest.
[4376.239] Right. Right. Right. Mhm. However,
[4379.199] again, that coastal plane is is low
[4381.8] gradient. So, any tsunami making
[4384.719] landfall has the potential to wash in um
[4387.92] a lot farther um because of that, right?
[4391.52] But but then of course what happens is
[4393.44] is with sea level having risen 400 feet
[4397.12] and that rise in sea level we were just
[4399.84] talking earlier about the energy
[4401.84] expended at a at a uh intertidal zone
[4405.199] you know and in its work its erosive
[4407.6] work on limestone. Well during a 400t
[4410.719] sea level rise we now know that that
[4413.12] that sea level rise was not a continuum
[4415.84] a smooth rise. it was um pulsed. You
[4420.88] know, there were meltwater pulse 1A,
[4422.8] meltwater pulse 1B. I think there's a
[4425.04] third meltwater pulse that we're going
[4427.28] to soon be able to identify that's
[4429.52] coincides almost exactly with the lower
[4431.92] younger driest boundary because the work
[4434.64] of um uh not Roy Breenidge
[4439.159] um oh work on the McKenzie River in the
[4442.159] meltwater floods into the Arctic Ocean
[4445.28] seem to be dating right at the younger
[4447.44] lower younger dest boundary. Okay. Um,
[4451.04] so yeah, we're we're kind of on the
[4452.48] threshold, I think, of unraveling a
[4454.96] whole and creating a whole new model of
[4456.8] Earth history. Yeah. And once we have
[4458.64] that as the context, we should then can
[4461.04] take a a fresh look at the human story
[4464.56] within that framework, right? Yeah. I
[4467.92] was just thinking how incredible it was
[4469.36] that humans could be hunting that much
[4470.96] during this time period.
[4473.199] Yeah. Yeah. Well, and then that brings
[4475.92] us, of course, to the question of the
[4478.08] mass extinction of the great megapana.
[4480.4] Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That they
[4481.84] that they over hunted them all while all
[4483.84] this incredible climate changes and and
[4486.239] sea level changes and meltwater pulses
[4488.56] were all happening. Yeah. So, yeah, it's
[4492.719] uh I'm going to show you a quick graph
[4494.88] here. Do you find that academia now is
[4497.52] kind of just ignoring this this period
[4500.96] as as Oh, yeah. as opposed to like like
[4503.28] they used to strongly say, you know,
[4505.44] over hunting is the story and you know,
[4508.88] like we we we know what happened and
[4510.96] it's just gradualism and there's no
[4512.8] catastrophe. Now, it seems like they're
[4514.4] all like, ah, I don't I don't it's not
[4516.159] really my area. I don't really want to
[4517.44] talk about it. Like, it feels like they
[4519.159] recognize that there was some that
[4521.52] they're going to have to change the
[4522.719] story here and that that it's probably
[4524.48] best just to distance themselves. that
[4526.32] that's that's kind of what I gather from
[4528.64] just listening to various, you know,
[4530.56] people on the I I think your impression
[4532.8] is is accurate. Uh yeah, although I've
[4536.32] gotten a lot of uh communications over
[4538.88] the last few years from geologists,
[4543.36] some of them saying that they think I'm
[4545.84] right on some of my stuff. I've gotten
[4548.64] uh emails and and comments and things
[4551.04] from younger geologists or or or or
[4554.4] college age, you know, in their 20s that
[4556.4] are going into geology. And like I got
[4559.679] one not too long ago. He was saying, you
[4561.199] know, I used to think geology was so
[4562.96] boring, but I started listening to some
[4565.12] of your podcasts and seeing some of the
[4566.88] evidence you presented about great
[4568.48] catastrophes and I saw found it so
[4571.12] interesting I've decided to go and get
[4573.12] my degree in geology. Yep. So, I'm kind
[4576.08] I think that it'll take another 5 to 10
[4578.32] years, but I think we're going to have a
[4580.0] whole new crop of of young scientists
[4582.48] who are much more willing and not so
[4585.76] invested in the gradualist model, right?
[4588.719] And there's many reasons and and a lot
[4590.56] of them get into politics and we won't
[4592.48] need to discuss that today, but at some
[4594.719] point it's a discussion we need to have.
[4597.88] Now, this have you ever seen this graph?
[4600.32] The oxygen is did I show this to you?
[4602.4] Yes. I believe you mentioned this when
[4603.92] you were on my show. Yeah, I mentioned
[4605.6] it, but I might have not shown it to
[4607.199] you. Okay. I don't Yeah. Okay. So, and
[4609.76] if you don't really remember, then it's
[4611.12] good to uh to revisit it. So, oxygen
[4614.08] isotopes in Greenland. We don't need to
[4615.76] get into the the technology, but
[4617.76] basically um the the heavier, you know,
[4621.52] you've got oxygen 16, oxygen 18. in an
[4625.52] energetic uh uh environment in in warmer
[4630.239] weather, there's more energy to
[4632.239] evaporate ocean water. That more energy
[4634.64] means that more of the heavy oxygen can
[4637.84] get evaporated uh and then precipitated
[4641.44] out as rain or snowfall. Uh in colder
[4644.48] times, you don't have the available
[4646.239] energy. And so what happens is the ratio
[4650.32] of oxygen 16 to oxygen 18 in rainfall
[4654.239] and snowfall changes because less oxygen
[4658.08] 18 is being lofted out of the oceans.
[4662.08] Right. Mhm. So when there when it's uh
[4664.88] cold you're going to have more 18 to 16
[4668.4] in the oceans. When it's warm you're
[4671.12] going to have more uh 18 relative to 16.
[4676.96] preserved for example in ice courtes and
[4679.04] that's what's going on here. So shifts
[4682.0] to the left mean cold shifts to the
[4685.12] right mean warm. Okay so this is the
[4688.8] last you look down the right the
[4690.4] vertical side here you see 10 that's
[4692.96] 10,000 years ago and this is this is a
[4696.4] depth of 1500 m in the Greenland ice. So
[4700.32] 1 1500 meters of ice have accumulated in
[4703.04] 10,000 years uh at the summit of
[4705.96] Greenland. Uh show and it like it's
[4709.44] showing here it show shows temperature
[4712.08] constantly and repeatedly warming and
[4714.32] cooling 2 to three degrees Fahrenheit or
[4716.84] more. Right now look at this little
[4720.0] spike down here. This is called the it
[4722.08] was a 200year roughly cold spell in the
[4725.679] middle of the postglacial climatic
[4729.32] optimum was possibly 3 to 4° very sudden
[4734.52] cooling. If it happened now it would
[4737.92] cause major disruptions to agriculture
[4740.8] and and uh agricultural crops and food
[4744.48] production. uh it would probably in fact
[4748.4] severely stress
[4750.36] civilization. This is again was a
[4752.56] century or two of of really cold
[4755.159] weather. Uh and then notice something
[4757.92] here as we come up near closer to the
[4760.48] present. Notice that the magnitude of
[4763.12] these oscillations increases.
[4766.0] Now, if if I turn this on the side, you
[4768.239] could actually see that
[4770.44] um that the climate has cooled since
[4774.0] what's called the the the postglacial
[4776.08] climatic optimum. During the climatic
[4779.96] optimum, temperatures worldwide were 1
[4782.64] to 3° warmer than now. Sea level
[4786.4] studies, and I've got dozens of them,
[4788.32] show that during this warm period, sea
[4791.12] levels were three, four, five, even six
[4793.679] feet higher than now. This is
[4796.84] wellestablished but again this is not
[4800.0] being talked about because it doesn't
[4801.679] fit the paradigm because there's a
[4804.08] political agenda now which wants to make
[4807.199] people believe that anything that's
[4809.36] happening now in terms of climate change
[4812.08] or environmental change is the
[4814.32] consequence of human activity primarily
[4817.199] the burning of fossil fuels right but
[4820.32] yet when we look in the past what we
[4822.56] discover is evidence that completely
[4824.96] contradicts predicts this model that
[4827.92] previous to the industrial revolution
[4830.8] the climate was steady state. It most
[4833.44] certainly was not. And this polyine
[4836.88] graph right here shows that it is
[4839.28] regularly oscillated every few decades
[4842.32] up to one to even in sometimes up to two
[4845.04] and three
[4846.52] degrees. But what's interesting is when
[4848.96] to me really interesting is when we get
[4851.04] down here to about the 1500 meter depth
[4854.4] 10,000 years ago, we see we see the the
[4857.44] the graph trailing off to the left.
[4860.4] Well, the reason is it's this is it's
[4862.32] the last phase of coming out of the ice
[4864.32] age right here, the last most recent ice
[4867.76] age. So if I go to the next uh slide
[4872.32] I've just taken that's what we just saw
[4874.88] and this represents climatic change over
[4877.44] the last 10,000 years. Now the ice core
[4880.88] goes down to bedrock and it goes back
[4884.04] 250,000 years. Right? So now let's take
[4887.679] a look at uh evidence for what kind of
[4891.679] climate changes were going on prior to
[4894.48] the holysine which the holysine is the
[4896.8] modern epoch the last it's now dated to
[4900.159] interestingly to 11,600 years ago. It's
[4904.08] associated with meltwater pulse 1b and
[4908.04] coincidentally coincides with the
[4910.239] Egyptian story of the 9,000 year sacred
[4913.76] registers
[4915.36] uh prior to Solon's time. Remember Solon
[4919.04] uh visited Egypt in 600
[4921.56] BC. Add the 9,000 years 11,600. Look up
[4925.679] the inception of the holysine
[4927.88] 11,600. Look up Meltwater Pulse 1B
[4931.52] 11,600.
[4933.44] So, now let's go back
[4936.44] uh 250,000 years and see what the
[4940.56] climate was doing.
[4945.44] Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. It's crazy.
[4948.48] Yeah. How come we're not talking about
[4951.96] this? Well, because it doesn't fit the
[4954.6] narrative. Something was going on here.
[4956.639] I mean, you want to talk about global
[4958.639] warming? Look at this down here. This is
[4961.6] the so-called emian marine isotope stage
[4965.44] 5e right here. Sea levels were up to 40
[4970.239] to 50 ft higher than they are now during
[4973.199] this warm period right here. Greenland
[4976.639] ice
[4977.88] cap no more than half the mass of a
[4980.96] pres. It was melted so much back that it
[4983.92] actually formed two distinct ice masses
[4986.88] with a huge conduit between them. You
[4989.199] could travel across Greenland from east
[4992.159] to west where now the ice dome is.
[4996.0] That's how much the Greenland ice sheet
[4998.639] melted during this period of the emian
[5001.28] which was is dated now to
[5004.44] 116,000 to 139,000 years ago. 13,000
[5008.56] years half of a processional cycle. And
[5012.08] that was the emian. What in the world is
[5015.28] going on here? Is that the sun?
[5019.199] I don't know. I think Robert Shack would
[5021.84] make an argument, a strong argument that
[5024.08] this might be
[5025.56] solarinduced. I don't know. But this is
[5028.32] we need we need more studies unburdened
[5031.679] by the constrictions of political
[5034.4] narratives and politically driven
[5036.52] agendas to address questions like this.
[5039.6] Is what what is the norm? Is this the
[5041.84] norm or is this the norm? Well, for
[5045.6] glacier versus interglacial, I guess,
[5047.76] right? This this is interglacial. We've
[5049.679] got interglacials. Look right here. This
[5051.92] is this is the younger dus. This spike
[5054.96] to the left you see right here. Yep.
[5057.36] That's the younger dus. Yep. So, you see
[5060.639] that the climate went through a spasm of
[5064.08] warming right here. And that spasm of
[5066.88] warming is meltwater pulse
[5069.239] 1A 14,600 years ago. Then it slammed
[5073.52] back into full glacial cold and then
[5076.32] there was a second spike of warming here
[5079.12] and that's meltwater pulse 1b and you
[5083.04] have these two rapid pulses of sea level
[5086.08] rise. So is this basically saying that I
[5089.6] mean if there's more ice on the calves
[5092.56] so so going back you know past 15,000
[5096.08] years or whatever obviously the the
[5098.719] global temperatures are going to be
[5100.0] colder but but there's going to be more
[5102.6] dramatic more volatile changes in
[5105.52] temperature as when when there's more
[5107.679] when there's more ice in totality when
[5109.84] temperatures are lower there's going to
[5111.199] be more volatility.
[5113.28] Correct. Yeah. Yeah. And then there's
[5115.6] going to be some events like whether
[5117.44] it's solar
[5119.56] or whatever freaking aliens or
[5122.4] something, you know, who knows? But but
[5124.08] that that uh that that that that cause
[5126.48] that huge spike from time to time. It it
[5129.44] makes uh makes human you know human
[5133.04] survival in one place for extended
[5135.28] periods of time very challenging because
[5136.96] the climate's constantly changing and
[5138.56] and so the food that you you know the
[5140.4] the animals that you hunt or the
[5142.32] whatever food that you're growing or
[5144.0] whatever trees exist or plants that
[5146.0] you're eating or shrubs it's going to
[5147.36] change. So it would be obviously more
[5150.4] difficult to establish you know some
[5152.8] Yeah. So, two key terms here, resilience
[5156.4] and adaptability, right? They were
[5159.6] masters of adaptability, our ancestors.
[5162.48] Yep. To survive a couple hundred
[5164.4] thousand years of what we just saw. Now,
[5167.04] the critic would say, "Oh, well, that's
[5168.4] just Greenland. That's that's only
[5170.4] local." Well, no, it's not local. We
[5172.56] know now from proxy studies from all
[5175.199] over the planet. Was it uniformly severe
[5178.56] everywhere? No, because there were some
[5180.679] places um where the effects of global
[5184.56] change were were milder. Now, if we look
[5188.6] at using as our as our proxy the loss of
[5193.12] species at the end of the last ice age,
[5196.32] right? So, you got over a 100 species of
[5198.679] megapa went extinct. And that could be
[5202.32] 120. It depends on how you divide the
[5204.239] species up, but just for round numbers,
[5207.36] 100 species, probably more. Where was
[5211.12] the greatest concentration of species
[5213.12] lost? North America. And a very close
[5216.159] second was South
[5218.679] America. So, North America and South
[5221.12] America both lost in the ballpark of 3/4
[5225.36] of megaponal species. And a megapana is
[5228.719] a is an animal over 100 pounds in body
[5231.199] weight about 44 kg. Right? So North
[5234.96] America, South America lost 3/4 of all
[5238.639] species over 100 pounds in body weight.
[5242.239] Eurasia was about
[5244.6] 35% and Africa was about
[5247.4] 10%. What how would you interpret that?
[5251.12] A solar impact into the Americas
[5253.76] something. I mean, not solar, but like a
[5256.239] a a like a comet impact into something
[5259.44] some something that that hit the
[5261.679] Americas harder than it hit the rest of
[5263.28] the world. Something we'll leave it
[5265.199] undefined for now, although I would
[5266.88] certainly lean towards an impact event
[5269.679] uh as the as the most likely candidate.
[5272.32] Yeah. Um but yeah, so what happened was
[5276.239] America lost most of its megaponal large
[5279.92] megaponal species. Africa lost the least
[5283.12] amount. So when you look at Africa, the
[5285.44] Serengeti plane, and you're seeing the
[5287.28] rhinos and the elephants and the hippos
[5290.08] and the giraffes and the the the water
[5293.12] buffalo, the big animals, those are most
[5296.4] of those are the place to see holdovers,
[5298.8] right? Didn't go extinct, right? And it
[5301.6] could be it could be in part that
[5303.6] Africa's climate and and terrain and the
[5306.08] food sources that that were abundant in
[5308.6] Africa just because of the because of
[5312.0] the type of of of food and climate and
[5314.8] terrain that exists within Africa that
[5316.639] it was more hearty and that it just it
[5318.96] just survived and that that it was a bit
[5320.88] more delicate in the United States and
[5322.48] in in North and South America. Uh but
[5325.52] yeah, definitely seems like it hit
[5326.8] closer to home over here. Yeah, I I kind
[5328.88] of think of North America as ground zero
[5331.12] for whatever happened. And I again, we
[5333.84] we could do another conversation
[5335.52] sometime. I could show you the evidence
[5337.92] that I've accumulated that would suggest
[5340.08] that it was some kind of an impact
[5342.159] related event. Yeah, that seems like the
[5344.32] most likely. Now, now you've said the
[5346.48] the end of the last ice age a couple of
[5348.719] times, but but I mean we're it's is it
[5351.36] really the end or are we just in an
[5353.199] interglacial period and going back into
[5355.28] the same ice age? you that's that's a
[5357.679] fundamental question that you've just
[5359.199] asked and that's an important question
[5361.6] because when we look at uh previous
[5365.56] interglacials now one of the things you
[5367.679] got to bear in mind looking at this
[5369.04] graph is the it's been compressed right
[5373.04] so if we were to stretch it out so you
[5375.44] had the same uh you know uh the same
[5379.76] ratios as the as on the y ais
[5383.199] what you would see is that there are
[5384.8] interglacials
[5386.56] in that in there, but most of them with
[5390.0] the exception of the emian were shorter
[5392.32] than the
[5393.4] holy. In fact, it looks like, you know,
[5395.679] 5 to 8,000 years typically was about how
[5398.96] long an interglacial lasted. Um, and
[5402.88] we're we're 10 11,000 years into the
[5406.199] holy. And this is why I think it's very
[5409.04] important that we try to come to grips
[5410.88] with understanding, you know, what's
[5412.8] going on here, what's changing and and
[5415.199] can't the if if the Gulf Stream shuts
[5418.159] down, for example, because the Earth
[5420.48] heats up a little bit more or because of
[5423.6] whatever whatever happens, doesn't that
[5426.08] push us back into the depths of an ice
[5428.56] age if that gets shut off? Well, that is
[5431.04] an interesting question. Now it is
[5433.679] evidence that the that the uh the the
[5437.04] the ocean circulation was
[5439.96] interrupted right during the
[5442.52] deglaciation phase. But the thing you
[5445.12] have to bear in mind is that there were
[5448.32] gigantic
[5450.56] uh flows into the North Atlantic. I mean
[5454.4] we're talking about billions of cubic
[5456.48] feet per second. There's nothing like
[5458.48] that going on now. So we're looking at a
[5462.239] completely different set of
[5463.36] circumstances when it looks like the
[5466.08] thermo thermmoaline circulation was uh
[5471.04] was interrupted at the end of the last
[5472.88] ice age. Um so I'm not concerned too
[5477.04] much about we don't see anything
[5478.92] comparable to the influx of water into
[5482.56] the North Atlantic now like we did
[5486.08] during those meltwater pulses. Right.
[5490.199] Um, I should have a
[5493.92] Yeah. Um, yeah, we want to know what's
[5496.159] next, Randall. I mean, you got to tell
[5497.679] us, man. Are we going back into an ice
[5499.28] age? And and, uh, when's it going to
[5501.12] happen, man?
[5503.0] Okay. Well, I think one of the, you
[5505.6] know, one of the big picture things that
[5507.12] I look at is I think that our planet,
[5509.679] we're part of a cosmic
[5511.56] ecosystem. Involve changes. Solar
[5513.84] changes. It involve changes in the
[5516.08] cosmic environment. Like for example, uh
[5519.92] galactic uh rays seem to also fluctuate
[5524.239] like larger scale events even on the
[5526.639] galactic level might be affecting us in
[5529.28] our solar system. We can see that in the
[5532.239] type of isotopic evidence because
[5535.04] typically in normal solar times you got
[5537.44] the solar wind which acts as a buffer
[5540.08] and insulates earth from uh the direct
[5544.239] bombardment of galactic cosmic rays
[5546.8] which cause spalation of neutrons which
[5549.92] leaves uh an leaves a proxy evidence uh
[5554.639] like carbon 14 and burillium 10. uh
[5557.84] burillium 10 we can find in ice cores.
[5560.159] Carbon 14 we find in organic material,
[5563.36] trees and plants and so on. And if
[5565.92] there's a sudden spike of burillium 10
[5568.0] or carbon 14, what that suggests is that
[5570.56] there was a greater influx of galactic
[5573.36] cosmic rays which then in turn suggests
[5576.239] that the sun was in a period of very low
[5579.6] activity. And so the buffering effect of
[5581.92] the sun now has allowed because of the
[5585.76] diminishment in the power of the sun,
[5587.92] the solar wind, you now have a greater
[5590.6] influx of of cosmic rays. The sun also
[5596.0] now also we know from the early 90s and
[5599.04] solar observing satellites uh seems to
[5602.8] have a much higher degree of variability
[5604.719] than we had previously assumed. Okay. So
[5608.88] the same thing can happen if you the sun
[5611.12] goes into a hyperactive phase. You will
[5614.0] get proxy fingerprints that show again
[5618.719] the same thing. They're different but it
[5620.56] you know I don't want to get into too
[5621.84] much of the technical explanation
[5624.0] because we're running out of time. But
[5626.96] um clearly uh there are many variables
[5630.08] that work here and sometimes they may
[5632.719] work in such a way that they reinforce
[5635.04] each other. uh uh shall we say
[5638.0] constructive amplification. Other times
[5640.4] they may uh you know uh mitigate each
[5644.8] other, right?
[5647.0] So it's there's a lot of work that needs
[5649.6] to be done in sorting this out. This is
[5651.44] why we need true science, authentic
[5653.679] science unburdened by political agendas
[5657.04] to try to understand the true and
[5658.88] authentic environmental history of this
[5660.639] planet. Right? You know, one of the
[5662.32] things might be I think that in the
[5664.4] larger framework uh impact events could
[5668.4] be behind a lot of it, right? Uh um uh
[5673.12] also including enhanced spikes of
[5675.6] seismic activity and volcanism. And we
[5678.88] see that in the this tremendous mass
[5681.6] transfer that took place when you had 6
[5685.12] to 7 million cubic miles of glacial ice
[5688.4] piled up on the continental land masses
[5692.239] rapidly melting and and transferring
[5694.719] back into the oceans. Two things now
[5697.199] that evidence is emerging that there was
[5699.12] massive seismic activity and earthquakes
[5702.56] and a huge spike of volcanism. And it
[5705.28] only makes sense, right? because the
[5708.4] pressures of transfer removing that ice
[5712.159] from the from the continents and the
[5714.719] isoatic rebound after that ice is
[5717.679] removed. Likewise, the transfer of these
[5721.84] trillions and trillions of tons of
[5724.08] weight, say, back into the oceans,
[5727.12] you're now going to have an isoatic
[5729.12] depression and that's going to be
[5730.639] concentrated along the the the sutures
[5734.32] where the continental spreading is
[5736.08] taking place because that's the most
[5738.239] that those are the weak zones in the
[5740.08] Earth's crust. So it only makes sense
[5742.48] and empirical data supports that that
[5745.84] there were significant vertical
[5747.76] movements of the ocean
[5750.28] floors during this period of mass
[5753.4] transfer that would cause accelerated
[5756.28] volcanism. There could be all kinds of
[5758.4] consequences. There could be feedback
[5760.32] loops that take thousands of years to to
[5763.6] play out. I would go even so far as to
[5766.159] speculate that maybe some of the
[5767.679] volcanism and earthquake activity that
[5770.8] we're seeing today might be residual
[5773.92] from what happened 10 to 15,000 years
[5776.159] ago. Sure. Could be. Yeah. As a
[5778.32] possibility. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah.
[5780.239] It's interesting. And and you know, we
[5781.679] we I mentioned AI a little bit earlier
[5783.76] and we talked about that a little bit
[5784.88] earlier as a way to to kind of tell us a
[5786.8] little bit about what the human past has
[5789.84] looked like or what the geological past
[5791.679] has looked like. But it can probably
[5793.199] also help us with what is the future
[5794.96] going to look like, you know? It can
[5796.719] probably also help us predict like
[5798.4] what's what's what what what's really
[5800.32] happening like like what's really
[5801.84] happening with the polls for example,
[5803.52] you know, like is Ben Davidson right or
[5805.679] is Stefon Burns right? you know, like
[5807.84] are we is there about to be a pole flip
[5809.6] or is this just a normal um what you
[5812.96] know, excursion, you know, or um so, you
[5816.08] know, are we headed into a another are
[5818.96] we headed back into the depths of the
[5820.88] ice age or are we going to be in this
[5822.96] interglacial period for you know, a few
[5825.199] more thousand years? It's like it it
[5827.199] feels like and it doesn't seem like
[5829.36] anybody can hide that information from
[5832.0] us from the people is it's not like you
[5834.719] can have a gatekeeper or various
[5836.88] governments could hide that because AI
[5839.04] is going to be out there for everybody.
[5840.239] Not anymore. Right. Not anymore. Um
[5842.719] right. I you know again if you look at
[5846.48] the precedent you know the emian was the
[5850.4] period that was considered to be the
[5852.08] closest analog to the holene. And we now
[5855.679] know though that there were major
[5857.679] climatic fluctuations within the emian
[5860.56] that go way beyond what we've seen
[5862.4] within the holysine. But um again going
[5866.88] by the precedent uh and looking at
[5869.76] interglacial
[5871.4] periods I mean this was part of what
[5874.0] fueled the concern in the 70s um because
[5877.76] there was a cool between the 1940s and
[5880.159] the early 1980s the climate was actually
[5883.199] cooling. Um at the same time we're
[5887.04] discovering that uh these climatic
[5890.719] changes had happened way quicker than
[5892.719] anybody had imagined. Um, and so the
[5895.6] fear was that, okay, well, if if the
[5898.639] interglacials are only 5 to 10,000
[5901.199] years, and we've already been in the
[5902.88] holene for at least 10,000 years, maybe
[5906.08] it's all coming to an end, right?
[5909.32] Uh, I don't know. I don't know. But I am
[5912.96] definitely an advocate of more study,
[5917.199] more more scientific work. And I also
[5921.36] believe that the testimony, the legacy
[5924.159] of our ancestors that's come down to us
[5926.56] in the form of myth and legends and so
[5928.719] on is going to be highly instructive and
[5933.32] valuable in making sense out of this. In
[5936.08] fact, I think that the scientific record
[5938.56] and the mythic record, if you want to
[5940.4] call it that, are perfect complements of
[5942.4] each other.
[5944.08] Yeah. To combine those and to to try to
[5946.4] understand what Yeah. to spit out some
[5949.04] some knowledge. Yep. Yep. Two quick
[5951.679] quotes here. One was from
[5954.04] um one, okay, this is from an editorial
[5957.119] that appeared in
[5958.36] Nature immediately after the publication
[5961.6] of the uh graph that we were just
[5964.32] looking at. Right? This is by Richard
[5966.4] Fairbanks. He was with Lamont Doherty
[5968.56] Earth Observatory and he was one of the
[5971.199] people studying and analyzing these ice
[5973.52] cores. Now bear in mind that a
[5977.44] generation or two before the belief was
[5980.4] the transition out of the ice age might
[5982.48] have been a process that took 30 to
[5984.96] 50,000 years. And then as radiocarbon
[5988.56] dating came along it was shortened to
[5990.639] perhaps 10 to 15,000 years. And now
[5993.92] we're getting the isotopic dating. We're
[5996.239] getting uh the Greenland ice cores. And
[5999.04] what we're finding there
[6001.639] is is pretty sobering actually. And this
[6005.28] is this is the quote from measurements.
[6008.48] And this is referring again to this
[6010.32] graph that we're we're just looking at.
[6012.639] From measurements of annual ice layer
[6015.36] thickness over the past 15,000 years.
[6018.639] The authors find that the Greenland's
[6021.119] that Greenland's climate and we just saw
[6023.84] the graph of the the closeup I showed
[6027.199] you of the younger dryest and the two
[6028.88] warming spikes right associated with
[6031.28] meltwater pulses for measurements of
[6033.92] annual isolator thickness over the past
[6036.0] 15,000 years. The authors find the
[6038.159] Greenland's climate emerging from the
[6040.639] last ice age twice shifted from glacial
[6044.96] to interglacial conditions over an
[6048.36] astonishingly quick 3 to 5 years.
[6052.52] Wow. Yeah. This is what the record of
[6056.48] the earth is is
[6057.719] is instructing us about this. Yeah.
[6062.0] That's crazy, man. And they asked
[6064.199] somebody, anybody who tells you now,
[6067.04] Matt, from now on, oh, well, the science
[6068.639] of climate change is settled. Yeah.
[6071.04] Yeah. Don't believe him. Yep. Now,
[6074.08] that's not to say we I I'm totally of
[6076.88] the philosophy we need to be good
[6078.719] stewards of this planet. We absolutely
[6081.76] do. But our stewardship needs to be
[6084.48] based upon real science, authentic
[6086.639] science. And again, if we're here and
[6091.28] you know, we at one time shared this
[6093.76] planet with other homminid species,
[6096.239] right? I mean, I think 14 other homminid
[6099.6] species have been identified, all of
[6101.76] which are extinct. We're we're like the
[6103.6] last man standing. Mhm. I think it's
[6106.239] coming down on us. We need to be
[6108.639] adaptable and resilient because whether
[6111.44] it happens in our lifetimes, I think
[6113.52] there's no doubt these changes are
[6115.92] ongoing. they're in our future. Uh but I
[6119.84] think that once we understand them, I
[6121.84] think we can we can create a sustainable
[6125.52] civilization. And this would be a topic
[6128.56] for maybe our our next conversation is
[6131.84] how do we take this knowledge and apply
[6134.4] it to creating a civilization that might
[6136.96] actually survive for millennia? Right.
[6139.6] Right. Yeah. Yeah. What do we need to do
[6141.76] to create a civilization that's going to
[6143.199] be able to survive through climate
[6145.199] change, through ups and downs on
[6147.6] temperature, through crop changes? Like,
[6149.52] what do we need to get ourselves off of
[6151.28] in terms of the supply chain? Do you
[6153.679] know are there like we we we go around
[6155.6] in Florida. We're going out and we're
[6157.04] we're planting all these non-native
[6158.8] trees and and and none of them produce
[6161.28] any food or fruit and we're pumping
[6163.36] pumping water out out of the water table
[6165.36] to keep all this this lawn grass
[6167.199] irritate ir irrigated and all these
[6169.119] these non-native trees irrigated and
[6170.88] it's like why like why not use regular
[6174.08] field grass? Like why not plant trees
[6176.159] that actually give us food and then you
[6178.08] know something bad does happen. We we
[6180.8] we're not like we're not just stuck on
[6183.04] this supply chain of of depending on
[6185.28] Walmart for our freaking survival like
[6187.6] you know 100%. Yeah. So I would Yeah.
[6191.28] for years advocated and endorsed the
[6194.32] idea that you know the lawn culture
[6197.04] there's a I love a nice little strip of
[6200.08] lawn. Even when we kid, you know, we had
[6202.88] some uh, you know, we had lawn in
[6204.96] Minnesota and I remember hot days after
[6206.88] working on the neighbor's farm. I'd come
[6208.8] home and I would love to lay in the cool
[6211.199] grass, you know, as the sun is getting
[6213.52] low in the sky. And, you know, it makes
[6216.159] a nice buffer between 100% nature and
[6219.239] your your livedin environment, but it's
[6223.04] completely beyond. To me, it's like,
[6225.119] "Hey, give me one nice little maybe, you
[6227.52] know, 20 by 20, 30 by 30 of of lawn. Let
[6231.28] me have the rest devoted to food crops."
[6234.639] Yeah. Imagine if in suburbia we traded
[6239.199] out the lawn culture for growing food
[6241.28] crops, right? Right. Then there's no
[6244.159] dependence on anybody. Yeah. And then if
[6246.56] there's an interruption in the supply
[6248.28] chain, it's not that big of a deal.
[6251.44] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I went down to Peru in
[6253.04] the Sacred Valley and was driving around
[6254.719] there and you know as as as there's not
[6257.52] a lot of money down there obviously, but
[6259.199] people are growing their own food, you
[6261.36] know, so it's like it's it's not as if
[6263.119] people are out on the streets committing
[6265.04] crimes like you know it's not like
[6267.84] they're struggling from for survival
[6269.6] from the standpoint that they can't eat
[6271.28] and that they've got to go out and rob
[6273.28] everybody, you know. So it's like, yeah,
[6274.8] people are poor. Yeah, housing is is a
[6277.04] challenge, but but you know, people are
[6278.719] eating, man, you know, and and like
[6280.239] that's that's such a huge part of like
[6283.28] if we can't figure that out as a society
[6286.719] and like but the government doesn't want
[6288.239] us to figure out, you know, they they
[6289.6] want us to continue to be relying upon
[6291.92] upon upon them. And so, nobody's going
[6293.76] to help us with this. But as a people,
[6295.52] we've got to start to start realizing
[6297.36] some of this stuff like 100% agreement
[6300.48] what you just said. The government wants
[6302.4] to foster dependence. Yeah. No doubt. No
[6305.28] doubt. No doubt. And And we I think
[6307.84] we're moving and we want independence.
[6310.239] Yep. I kind of think of it as there's a
[6312.0] new independence movement to foot. And I
[6314.8] want to see it I want to see it
[6317.04] proliferate. Me too. Me too. Uh very
[6319.28] much so. I'm going to have to run. You
[6322.08] probably do too. But I feel like there's
[6325.04] a lot of conversations in our future.
[6328.48] Um, and we're growing a really an
[6331.36] audience um, of people who are just, I
[6334.88] think, hungry for these kinds of ideas.
[6337.6] And I certainly don't claim to have the
[6339.28] final word on anything, but I have been
[6341.199] thinking about this stuff, studying it,
[6343.36] researching it for over half a century.
[6346.08] Yep. I came out of high school in 18. I
[6348.639] kind of made a commitment to myself. I
[6350.84] thought, I want to become an educated
[6354.679] man. I want to become educated. What
[6356.96] does that mean? So I set about using
[6360.239] most of my spare time from 1969 to now
[6365.36] engaged in study and research and
[6368.119] learning. And I feel like now I don't
[6370.88] have the final answers to everything.
[6373.199] No, not by a long shot. But I have some
[6375.639] insights that I think that I could share
[6378.639] that would help those coming behind me
[6381.52] on this quest, save them some time,
[6384.48] right? Um because my mentors, the people
[6387.76] that I looked up to, studied under,
[6390.56] read, etc., they're basically all gone
[6393.48] now, you know, and it's a little bit
[6396.719] scary and disconcerting when I finally
[6400.639] realize I'm kind of on the point on the
[6403.84] tip of the sword right now, you know? Uh
[6407.76] and it's a kind of a weird feeling like
[6410.639] I think I want to retire to my my layer
[6413.36] here. You see, I've created this layer
[6415.679] with with everything I want that I've
[6418.0] fantasized for decades, and now here it
[6420.32] is. You have to drag me kicking and
[6422.639] screaming out of it.
[6425.199] But um but yeah, there's, you know,
[6427.44] we're looking at possibly a tour to the
[6429.52] Azors. Nice. Focused on Atlant the
[6434.08] Atlantis story. Nice. Nice. Um but yeah,
[6437.04] there's all kinds of things and and I'd
[6439.119] love to keep sharing it with you. I
[6441.6] think we've had some great discussions.
[6443.199] This is our third discussion now, right?
[6445.44] Yep. This is our third. Yeah, we did two
[6446.88] on my show and this is the first one
[6448.4] we've done on yours and Yeah, man. I
[6450.08] mean, you are carrying the torch,
[6451.52] Randall. I mean, like you you said it
[6453.44] and for an entire generation, you're
[6455.28] educating people about like about, you
[6458.4] know, stuff that people aren't getting
[6460.48] anywhere else. I know that you you were
[6462.159] inspiring to me. Um I'm pro I might not
[6464.88] be, you know, podcasting if it wasn't
[6466.88] for you. you know, I mean, you you get
[6468.8] hit by a lot of different things in your
[6470.639] life, but but just seeing you and and
[6473.04] Graham on on Joe Rogan a number of years
[6475.119] ago, like totally opened up my mind to
[6477.28] so many different possibilities about
[6479.52] just, you know, uh Earth's history and
[6482.0] and human history. So, um no, man,
[6484.88] you're you're uh you're not retiring
[6486.56] anywhere. You got to keep educating
[6488.159] people. You got to keep doing what
[6489.36] you're doing, right? I'm yeah I'm I'm
[6491.92] looking into uh you know protocols that
[6495.04] might hopefully add a couple of decades.
[6498.239] You know you get to that age you're a
[6500.32] little bit behind me but you know you
[6502.159] get to this age you know once I cross
[6504.6] that big seven decade threshold I could
[6509.04] tell the machine is got some wear and
[6511.84] tear on it and I need an upgrade. You
[6514.719] know I need to overhaul the machine.
[6517.28] Yep. I'm doing pretty good. But you're
[6519.28] doing great man. And you're doing great.
[6521.28] Well, I can do better.
[6524.8] Yeah. So, again, I hope we can keep this
[6527.36] dialogue going. I'm really looking
[6528.8] forward to the Cosmic Summit, hanging
[6530.8] out with you there. I'm sure maybe we
[6532.48] can grab dinner together one night. I'd
[6534.32] like for you to You've met Julie. Oh,
[6536.56] yeah. Julie was here. Yes. Jesse. Yeah,
[6538.48] of course. They were in the studio. They
[6540.239] were. Yep. Uh Jesse, he's looking
[6542.56] forward to the uh to the summit. Good.
[6545.199] there's something interesting to talk
[6546.56] about with him uh as far as you know uh
[6549.44] some of the uh medicinals that he's been
[6552.48] on and and the the some pretty
[6554.8] impressive changes. Okay. That we've
[6556.96] seen in the last year. Okay. Um so I
[6559.84] mean yeah, we got a lot to talk about.
[6561.28] Yeah, for sure. For sure. No, I look
[6562.88] forward to it, man. I look forward to
[6564.08] seeing you for sure at Cosmic Summit and
[6566.08] and getting together. My wife's going to
[6567.52] be there as well, so uh yeah, I look
[6569.28] forward to seeing you and Julie and
[6570.48] Jesse and uh um yeah, for sure. I mean,
[6573.28] you know, I'd love to continue to have
[6574.96] you as a guest. You're always one of the
[6576.639] one of the favorites. You're my number
[6577.92] one episode. So, your your your first
[6580.96] episode that we did is the number one
[6582.719] episode on YouTube. On YouTube. So,
[6585.52] Okay. Well, I like hearing that. Yeah.
[6587.92] Yeah. No doubt. No doubt. Yeah. Yeah.
[6590.159] For sure. All right. Well, I think maybe
[6592.719] we can surpass that. For sure. Oh, we
[6594.8] will. We will. No. Yeah. I mean, my my
[6596.56] numbers are getting up there. Yep. which
[6598.48] is good because it's actually giving me
[6600.719] a little more resources to work with cuz
[6602.88] I've pretty much worked on a shoestring
[6605.199] for years. You know, all of the the
[6608.0] tours that I'm doing now that started
[6610.08] around six or seven years ago were
[6612.639] preceded by my my buddy and colleague
[6615.44] Brad Young and usually a small group of
[6618.159] guys going out on our own dime all the
[6621.6] recon and exploring these landscapes for
[6624.639] 20 years plus before it actually turned
[6628.0] into guided tours where I'm taking
[6630.8] dozens of people out to these sites and
[6634.0] essentially teaching them the language.
[6635.84] anguage of the earth. One of the one of
[6638.56] the I'll leave you with this um quote.
[6640.4] It's from the forget which chapter. It's
[6642.639] from the book of Job and it's kind of
[6644.639] been one of my guiding uh uh ideas since
[6649.679] for for decades ever since I first
[6652.32] encountered it because I do I love
[6654.56] reading the Bible along with other
[6656.96] spiritual literature. But you know I
[6659.28] kind of read it from a different
[6660.4] perspective maybe than most people. But
[6662.719] but this quote from Job, "Speak to the
[6667.159] earth. Speak to the earth and it will
[6670.88] teach thee." I love it. Yeah. Love it.
[6674.96] Yeah. That's powerful. Yeah. All right.
[6677.6] Yes, sir. It's a good one to end on, my
[6679.84] friend. Good one to end. All right,
[6681.6] Matt. See you in a few weeks. Yep. See
[6683.36] you then. Great to chat with you, man.
[6685.04] So long, Ryan.
[6687.28] See you, Ryan. See you back. All right,
[6688.48] Randall. We'll see you. Okay. Is will
[6690.719] Ryan be there at the I will be there.
[6692.639] Ryan will be there. Yeah. Okay. Yep.
[6694.88] Yep. So maybe we'll do more this time,
[6696.96] Ryan, and passing in the elevator. We're
[6699.44] getting out and off the elevator. We'll
[6702.08] figure this out. We'll figure it out
[6703.599] soon enough. Yeah, that was great,
[6705.44] Randall. I really appreciate it, man.
[6706.719] That was a great conversation. It was. I
[6708.96] enjoyed it, too.

Title: Could Atlantis Be Real? Here's the Logic.
[0.28] Atlantis. You know, when when you say
[2.399] Atlantis to the average person, they'll
[4.319] say beautiful resort, you know, in
[6.08] Bahamas or Dubai. But when you say
[8.16] Atlantis to someone like you, you think
[10.8] a complete different thing, right? I'm
[12.639] of the mind that we need to consider
[14.96] that as a realistic possibility because
[17.359] think about it. We come from basically
[20.52] feudalism, subsistence farming, hunter
[23.84] gathering all within the last 300 years
[26.64] to a millennium. Look how fast we have
[29.039] progressed since the scientific
[31.119] enlightenment. Now we consider I I use
[33.44] the more conservative based on hard
[35.68] skeletal evidence of how long have
[38.96] modern humans been on the planet. And
[41.44] basically what I'm seeing now is
[43.84] evidence, skeletal remains, hard
[46.28] evidence 175 to 200,000 years old that
[49.6] appears to belong to, for all intents
[52.879] and purposes, modern humans, which would
[55.16] imply similar levels of intelligence.
[58.16] How easily could a millennia of human
[62.039] progress get lost in the noise of
[64.799] 200,000

Title: Did Atlantis Wage War on the World?
[0.16] many great and wonderful deeds are
[2.24] recorded of your state in our histories
[5.359] that he's talking about this protoinian
[7.359] state that allied with the the the
[9.719] Egyptians to fight off this incursion of
[13.599] this great Atlantean empire. He says
[15.679] many great and wonderful deeds are
[16.96] recorded in your state in our histories
[20.8] but one of them exceeds all the rest in
[23.6] greatness and valor. For these histories
[27.359] tell of a mighty power which unprovoked
[30.64] made an expedition against the whole of
[32.96] Europe and Asia and to which your city
[36.0] put an end. This power came forth out of
[40.32] the Atlantic Ocean. For in those days
[43.36] the Atlantic was navigable and there was
[46.079] an island situated in front of the
[49.079] straits which are by you called the
[51.36] pillars of Heracles. The island was
[53.68] larger than Libya and Asia put together
[55.84] and was the way to other islands. And
[59.039] from these you might pass to the whole
[62.32] of the opposite continent which
[64.96] surrounds the true

Title: Academia Got Prehistory Wrong
[0.16] All the models of prehistory that are
[3.12] now dominating the narratives of
[5.799] academia were models that were developed
[9.2] were developed during a period of where
[12.08] there was a certain interpretation of
[15.2] Earth history. What we would call
[17.8] gradualism,
[19.56] incrementalism,
[21.08] uniformitarianism, the idea that things
[23.199] change so slowly and almost
[26.039] imperceptibly. And in that framework,
[29.039] when humans come along, whatever we do
[31.679] that affects the climate or the
[33.28] environment in any way whatsoever can
[36.0] now be seen to perturb this passive
[39.84] state of of climatic and environmental
[42.48] change that has prevailed on the earth
[45.04] for thousands and thousands, tens of
[47.52] thousands, hundreds of thousands of
[49.2] years. I challenge that narrative
[51.76] because having now spent over three
[54.32] decades going on four decades in the
[57.039] study of past environmental change on
[59.84] this planet I have become convinced
[62.359] overwhelmingly and I'm not the only one
[64.96] that yes the history of this planet and
[68.88] specifically within the time that we
[70.64] humans have been here has been
[72.24] profoundly dynamic and that we need to
[75.04] come to terms with that. One of the ways
[78.159] that the environment has changed in ways
[81.68] that we didn't even anticipate a
[83.84] generation or two ago is in the form of
[86.64] great tsunamis. Please.

Title: Biblical Floods Were Real
[0.16] One of the things that I came prepared
[1.92] to show you today that the legends of
[4.96] gigantic world destroying floods are
[7.68] based on real events that we can now
[10.24] prove overwhelmingly. What I would call
[12.639] biblical scale floods up in the Pacific
[15.36] Northwest. Peak discharges 700 thou 700
[18.96] million to a billion cubic feet per
[20.72] second. Now, how do you even picture
[22.8] something like that? I call it the
[24.4] hidden cipher of the landscape because
[26.16] it's on such a huge scale that most
[27.84] people don't even know it's there. you
[30.0] know, and then what I do is I say it's
[31.76] like learning a new language only in
[33.84] this case the story is engraved into the
[37.52] planetary surface and it's been laying
[39.84] there for 10, 12, 14,000 years because
[43.28] nobody had the perspective to decipher
[45.44] it until now. That's a pretty grandio
[47.68] statement to make. Give me a week, two
[49.6] weeks, and I will I will instruct you in
[52.239] that language, and we will go into the
[54.399] field, and I will show you the after
[57.039] effects of biblical scale floods that
[59.039] have swept over the

Title: Why I Supported Leaving the Paris Climate Accord
[0.08] One of the things that pertains directly
[2.24] to topics I talk about a lot which is
[5.279] climate change the dynamically
[7.44] everchanging climate of this planet is
[10.08] that we pulled out of the Paris climate
[12.519] accords and a lot of people are upset
[15.28] about that but I would like to reassure
[17.6] you there is no reason to be upset in
[19.92] fact that was definitely the move to
[22.48] make. Why do I say that? Does that mean
[24.96] I'm a climate change denier because I'm
[27.359] in favor of pulling o out of the climate
[29.76] accords? No, not at all. What it means
[32.64] is is that in fact just the opposite. I
[35.92] totally affirm the climate of this
[37.92] planet changes. It changes all the time.
[40.239] It changes regularly and quite
[42.48] frequently. It changes a lot faster and
[45.2] more severely than we have witnessed in
[47.84] our lifetimes. And this is something uh
[50.399] an important uh insight into the way our
[53.199] planet works. that is being overlooked
[55.68] and we are spending a lot of money or
[57.52] have spent a lot of money or were going
[59.84] to be spending a lot of money to meet
[62.0] the restrictions uh and goals of the
[64.72] Paris climate agreement. But primarily
[67.439] what it meant was and what the agenda
[70.32] was all about was a gigantic wealth
[72.56] transfer from the developed nations to
[75.04] the undeveloped nations all done in the
[77.28] name of climate justice. In effect, what
[79.759] it is is is to me a giant shakeddown
[82.799] effort. Uh and of course the potential
[85.84] recipient nations of the large s being
[89.0] transferred from primarily America and
[91.92] American taxpayers. Of course, they're
[94.0] all on a board with it, and they will,
[96.32] of course, endorse the climate crisis
[98.96] narrative if it means that they're going
[100.479] to be on the receiving end of tens to
[103.52] hundreds of millions, maybe even
[105.439] billions of dollars. course.

Title: The Truth About Rising Sea Levels
[0.16] sea levels have risen and fallen even in
[2.8] recent times and how much they have.
[4.96] Most people don't realize, you know, we
[6.64] talk about uh oh, sea levels have risen.
[9.599] Uh if they rise another foot and a half,
[11.92] we're going to have all of the, you
[13.599] know, New York City is going to be
[14.88] underwater. The Maldes are going to be
[16.64] underwater. You know, it's going to
[18.32] create a great catastrophe. Look at it
[20.4] this way. The sea levels have risen in
[22.32] the last century about 8 in, which is
[24.56] about the same as they rose the century
[26.48] before that. And at the current rates of
[29.199] sea level rise, it may be a couple
[31.359] inches more than that. But I think
[33.76] projecting current rates of sea level
[35.92] rise, we're not getting into some of the
[38.16] earlier scare stories that we were being
[40.16] bombarded with back 20 and 30 years ago
[42.399] that oh my god, sea level is going to
[43.92] rise four or five or 6 feet by the end
[45.92] of the the century and so on. We've seen
[48.32] no indication that anything is going to
[50.48] attain that rate of of sea level rise.
[53.68] For one thing, because we don't have
[55.8] catastrophically melting 6 to 7 million
[59.039] cubic miles of catastrophically melting
[61.359] glacial ice. We don't have that now. In
[63.92] fact, it's even questionable how much
[66.24] actually has been lost from the two
[68.479] great reservoirs of glacial ice on the
[70.4] planet, Greenland and Antarctica. And
[73.439] consider the consequences for what would
[76.08] happen again today if ancient tsunami
[78.96] that may have been at least 600 ft in
[82.72] its runup height uh in the recent S.

Title: Did a Doom Gun Wipe Out the Mammoths?
[0.16] For hundreds of years, thousands of
[3.439] mammoths, in tmbed mammoths and mammoth
[6.08] tusks were being exumed from the
[8.32] Siberian perafrost. Just in-your-face
[11.04] evidence that this was not humans doing
[13.44] this. You know, it was not humans that
[15.759] were were slaughtering these mammoths
[18.0] and burying their remains. The
[19.84] instantaneous nature would almost it
[21.92] would almost be like people had figured
[23.359] out some new thing like they figured out
[25.439] some doom gun, you know,
[28.439] they shot the whole the doom gun. Well,
[32.239] look at the near extinction of American
[34.16] vice. What brought that about? Trains
[37.04] and high-powered rifles, right? It was a
[40.04] technological a major technological
[42.32] advancement that was able to bring about
[44.239] the near extermination of the American.
[46.239] But I had assumed that the bison
[48.16] population had been relatively stable. I
[51.039] am not convinced though that that there
[54.0] was this massive die off of the Native
[56.239] American population yet. I'm not
[58.32] convinced. Maybe well because I haven't
[60.32] looked into it yet. But but you know,
[61.92] one of the things I have seen is that um
[64.159] the assumption there is predicated upon
[65.84] that the Europeans arrived and brought
[67.36] the diseases that Native Americans had
[69.2] no defenses for.
[70.72] The thing is is that, you know, there's
[72.72] so much evidence now showing that, you
[74.799] know, there were lots of explorers and
[77.119] immigrants to the new world prior to the
[80.159] arrival of the Europeans.

Title: Are These Hidden Powers Real?
[0.16] Okay. Nobody ever told me that there
[2.399] were other realities and that those
[4.48] realities perhaps were even more real
[6.64] than the reality of the five senses that
[8.72] were so immersed in. Did you find
[10.48] yourself kind of with those same kinds
[12.639] of insights? And yeah, I started to have
[15.24] experiences of, you know, these kind of
[18.48] hidden powers of the mind, lucid
[20.88] dreaming or precognition or other other
[24.72] kinds of call it psychic abilities. And
[27.519] also just synchronicity, the power of a
[30.4] real good synchronicity to just rock
[33.2] your world. That kind of materialist
[35.36] view of things. You can dabble in these
[37.84] things and kind of get impressions of
[41.6] like, wo, did I just do that? Like, did
[44.64] I just have a a a psychic experience or
[47.2] did I just have some sort of
[49.64] precognition or something? And it's one
[52.719] thing for you to kind of sit there with
[54.399] yourself and and try to work with it and
[56.48] and try to figure out whether or not
[57.92] you're tricking

Title: The Secret Geometry of Plasma
[0.08] The plasmas are cohering to patterns of
[3.919] energy would ordinarily be invisible but
[6.96] under the certain circumstances if you
[9.12] bring in two vibrating systems and
[11.519] they're in resonance you can have this
[14.32] effect at a distance which seems to be
[16.88] one of the most interesting phenomena
[19.359] associated with that. I think that the
[21.439] ideas a lot of this stuff are more of
[23.84] just like to understand the concepts and
[26.08] then imagine what could be you know it's
[28.08] like okay so now I realize we have this
[31.0] self-organizing property that happen and
[33.36] then to your point you're saying well
[34.96] when we're dealing with these plasmoids
[36.719] it's self-organization that we're seeing
[39.6] so how do we explain that well we look
[42.079] at simatics and we see self-organization
[44.16] happen at specific frequencies we just
[47.12] use you know general physics and waves
[49.039] and we go oh standing waves waves could
[51.039] be what we would need for that as well.
[53.44] And the question people should be asking
[54.96] is if I have a plasma and a plasma is
[57.76] just an amorphous blob like a gas. If I
[60.64] were to separate positive and negative
[62.359] charges, what would I think should
[64.32] happen? They should come back together.
[66.24] They should equalize. And if it's just a
[67.88] gas, then theoretically nothing should
[70.24] be stopping that from happening. Like
[71.84] that should just happen very quickly.
[74.24] But that's where Ken shoulders comes

Title: The Mystery of the Carolina Bays
[0.16] Carolina bays to an an asteroid impact
[3.2] and and this was the catastrophe that
[5.12] caused the sinking of Atlantis. When I
[7.359] read that, I thought, well, geez, these
[8.8] things are right in my backyard that
[10.8] he's talking about here. I just got
[12.8] really into reading and researching
[15.04] impacts and things like that and
[17.199] realized, okay, you've got impacts into
[20.16] the ground, you've got impacts that
[22.16] explode in the atmosphere. goes back in
[24.519] 1895. LC Glenn described some peculiar
[28.72] elliptical depressions locally called
[30.72] bays in the vicinity of Darlington,
[33.36] South Carolina. A careful study of the
[36.0] photographs showed that the origin of
[38.0] these bays involved problems of
[41.04] extraordinary interest. It was
[42.96] discovered that the typical bays near
[44.8] Conway differ somewhat from those
[46.879] described by Glenn, but apparently only
[49.039] in non-essentials. In most respects,
[51.36] they are identical.

Title: What Really Ended the Ice Age?
[0.0] Excuse me. If that happened now, you
[1.92] would have a lot of dead people. We're
[3.52] screwed. So, what you had, there's this
[5.12] period called, you might have heard of
[6.16] it, the younger dus. It was this episode
[9.2] that brought the ice age to an end.
[11.92] Because of astronomical forces, the
[14.16] earth, its tilt, the the shape of its
[16.8] orbit and so on, its distance from the
[18.96] sun, there are gradually accumulating
[21.52] changes in the amount of thermal energy
[23.279] reaching the surface of the earth.
[24.64] Generally the thought was is that these
[26.24] Malankovich forces what were behind the
[28.48] period of glaciation and deglaciation.
[30.56] The problem is they play out over tens
[32.239] of thousands of years. In order to get
[34.079] rid of that ice it requires energy. You
[37.2] don't melt 6 million cubic miles of ice
[40.32] without some source of energy to do the
[42.879] work. How could it, you know, 5 6,000
[45.44] years? We thought it was 100,000 years.
[47.52] But now radiocarbon dating is showing us
[49.92] that it's happened onetenth or one, you
[52.559] know, 20th of the time. How do you
[54.32] explain that? They called it the energy
[56.92] paradox because in 7374 there were
[60.399] several conferences held, several papers
[62.32] written in which they identified the
[64.32] energy paradox and they couldn't come up
[66.08] with an answer. The point is is that
[69.36] this energy had to have come from
[71.119] somewhere. So what are the
[72.32] possibilities? So the the energy that
[74.479] melted this these miles of glacial ice
[76.96] that covered a lot of the earth's
[78.159] surface. We don't know that happened. It
[79.92] wasn't just cuz it got sunnier out. No.
[82.56] Unless the sun was involved on some
[85.479] level exponentially beyond anything
[87.84] we've experienced, right? That it's not
[89.119] now, right? But it wasn't just like we
[90.64] had a hot August one year. No. No. Okay.

[5.72] conceptualize in any way that allows
[8.72] them to even answer the question. Mhm.
[11.04] Does it? Well, yes. Okay, it does. Okay.
[15.679] Or no, because most people now, unlike
[18.8] our ancestors of long ago, don't pay
[21.6] much attention to the moon. Our
[23.119] ancestors all over the ancient world
[26.24] paid obsessive attention to the moon.
[28.64] They built huge structures and monuments
[32.32] dedicated to observing the motions of
[35.84] the moon. And they did this all over the
[37.68] world. Why were they so interested in

Title: How Fast Did the Ice Age Hit?
[0.0] So there's ice age earth. Now that's
[1.76] what the earth would have looked like 15
[3.2] to 20,000 years ago. What you've got to
[5.2] do is consider that northwestern Europe
[8.0] mantled in ice. Northern America mantled
[10.559] in ice up to a mile and a half thick.
[12.16] Reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
[13.84] All of Canada was buried under ice.
[16.72] Still is. No, Canada is not big enough.
[18.56] Just kidding. Intellectually perhaps.
[21.359] No, Tech Tucker. It's not still. Okay,
[23.76] so there's no human civilization in
[26.8] Western Europe or Well, that's becomes
[29.199] the question. Would there have been
[31.119] civilization in say unglaciated?
[33.92] Certainly wasn't any civilization in the
[35.84] area that of the glaciation. When you
[37.76] have a cycle of glaciation coming, it
[40.0] pretty much obliterates everything that
[41.76] was there before. The climate changes
[43.6] associated with the transition into an
[45.36] ice age and out of an ice age almost
[47.32] inconceivably extreme. Radiocarbon
[49.52] dating, you know, became a thing in the
[51.12] 1950s. And as we begin to to learn more,
[53.6] we started finding out, well, wait a
[54.879] minute, there were forests growing in
[56.32] Canada 40 to 50,000 years ago. How's
[58.32] that possible? Well, if if there was,
[60.399] you know, a mile of ice over Canada.
[62.559] What happened is the span of time
[64.239] between these events just kept
[65.68] contracting and contracting. Then in the
[68.479] 1980s, 1990s, we began to extract high
[71.28] resolution ice cores from Greenland,
[73.52] from Antarctica, from mountain glaciers.
[75.28] But the story they told was of climate
[77.92] change that occurred inconceivably fast
[80.88] where you might have had 10 to 12°
[83.439] centigrade which is close to like 18°
[85.92] Fahrenheit literally in less than 5
[88.159] years. Now this is very demonstraable.
[90.96] Really? Oh yeah. Yeah.

Title: How 1.2 Quadrillion Gallons of Water Destroyed North America | The Big Picture Ep 9
[0.16] Break free from this realm of
[2.04] superficiality and take the big picture
[7.44] [Music]
[17.24] in. We left off the big picture last
[20.279] time looking at evidence of impact all
[23.76] across North America, specifically in
[26.08] the United States. And Randall has just
[28.96] gotten back a week ago. Two weeks ago
[32.0] from a tour of the Bonavville flood
[35.2] area. Yeah. Two weeks ago. Yeah. Two
[37.76] weeks ago. And there's been some
[40.079] exciting new discoveries. There was a
[42.719] lot of footage taken, a lot of content
[44.8] that's being created from it, and it's
[47.12] being edited, but it's going to be
[48.8] something that is pretty mind-blowing,
[51.28] Randall. So, what what did you discover?
[53.199] give us a sneak peek before we go
[55.36] through it more in depth on a later
[56.96] episode. Well, it wasn't so much like
[59.44] any uh you know mind-boggling new
[62.879] insights, but it was definitely a deeper
[65.799] appreciation and additional questions
[68.799] about what exactly happened.
[72.2] Um first point is, you know, it had been
[75.6] the last time I made a traverse of the
[78.159] Bonavville flood route was 25 years ago.
[82.479] Wow. So, I had was vague and I was
[86.08] definitely in need of a refresher. So,
[90.64] one thing that impressed me this time
[93.6] that I didn't my first time I pretty
[96.4] much immediately left Salt Lake City and
[99.52] headed north and began uh following the
[102.72] route of the of the breakout flood. Now,
[105.28] we've we've talked about we did a whole
[107.2] episode where we're talking about the
[108.64] Bonavville flood. So, not to go over all
[112.079] of that again. If people haven't seen
[114.32] that, go back and watch it, right? And
[116.799] then what I'm talking about here will
[119.04] make more sense. But one of the first
[121.92] thing that impressed me was the vastness
[124.479] of Lake Bonavville, the realization of
[127.8] how extraordinarily huge this body of
[131.2] water was. I mean, it was it was
[134.08] incredible. And you know, you're driving
[135.84] around on in the deserts there and
[138.239] you're realizing that 15,000 years ago,
[142.64] you'd have been at the bottom of a
[144.319] thousand foot deep lake. Here you are.
[147.28] You're in the desert, right? Dry as a
[150.76] bone. And 15,000 years ago, you would
[154.56] have been at the bottom of a lake a
[156.0] thousand feet
[157.879] deep. Obviously, something changed.
[160.599] something. I
[162.599] mean, so as it is now, the environment
[167.36] of this area in in Utah does not support
[171.12] the existence of hard hardly any lake at
[173.44] all. Great Salt Lake is the remnant of
[176.239] Lake Bonavville. It varies from season
[180.0] to season depending on the amount of
[181.68] rainfall, 20 to 30 feet in depth. So, I
[185.2] mean, it's minuscule compared to ancient
[188.48] Lake Bonavville.
[190.159] So clearly you've
[193.0] got I mean there's no way you could have
[195.36] Lake Bonavville without having an
[199.319] extraordinarily amplified volume of
[202.4] rainfall or
[204.12] precipitation, right? Because here
[206.159] here's the thing. Right now, Great Salt
[209.519] Lake will fluctuate in area as it gets
[212.239] deeper. Of course, it's area it surface
[214.48] area gets wider. But the more surface
[217.36] area you've got, the more evaporation
[219.519] you're going to have. So there's this
[221.92] kind of equilibrium point where
[224.239] precipitation and inflow into the basin
[226.879] is going to uh equal the the outflow
[230.72] through evaporation. Right? So if you
[233.44] have more rainfall, the lake can deepen.
[236.159] If you have less rainfall, you go into
[238.159] drought conditions, the lake can dry up.
[240.879] There are many what are called pia lakes
[243.439] throughout the southwestern deserts of
[245.84] and and other deserts of of the world,
[248.08] right? But the ones I've visited have
[249.92] been in the southwestern United States.
[251.68] But a pia lake is basically a lake basin
[254.48] that is oftentimes just a dry basin. And
[257.759] then in years with the uh more
[260.799] precipitation, it'll actually turn into
[262.8] a temporary lake. And then there's this
[265.36] fluctuation. A little bit more rainfall,
[267.52] you got a lake. a little bit less
[269.36] rainfall, it evaporates away and it
[271.759] might be a dry basin for five years or
[274.4] 10 years and then you have a few years
[276.16] of of uh a augmented rainfall and then
[280.479] it turns into a lake, right? But I don't
[284.639] think that's what Bonavville was because
[286.56] for one thing the lake Bonavville was so
[289.72] huge. And as it grows, my point here is
[293.68] as it grows, its surface area is
[295.84] enlarging as well. And so it's going to
[298.56] increase the rate of
[299.8] evaporation. But the ratio of inflow to
[303.6] the lake from whatever source had to
[306.479] vastly out exceed the amount of water
[310.0] lost through evaporation.
[312.4] So in order for that to happen, clearly
[314.72] the implication is you've got an
[316.24] environment that's just drastically
[318.56] different from the one that's there now.
[321.36] So what is that imp? Well, there's all
[323.44] kinds of implications for that. For one
[325.28] thing, I mean, it's just one more piece
[327.199] of this puzzle of climate change that is
[330.8] supposedly were constantly being retold
[333.84] told over and over again is settled and
[336.32] there's now a consensus about the whole
[339.44] the whole question of climate change.
[341.759] But just going out and spending a week
[344.0] looking at this and
[345.72] pondering the implications of it just
[348.639] completely undermines that false
[351.44] perspective. No, it's not settled.
[354.639] There's all kinds of questions we've got
[356.72] about climate change because clearly
[359.68] we're talking about a major climate
[361.44] change from the climate regime that
[364.08] could support a thousand foot deep lake
[367.36] to the climate regime now where that
[369.44] lake is gone and you've got I mean while
[372.24] you're there look up the lake uh
[374.639] Bonavville
[376.039] volume of water and then the surface
[379.199] here. I think the the volume of the
[380.72] water will uh be somewhere around maybe
[383.12] 5,000 cubic miles if memory serves me
[385.52] correct. Yep. Uh no 4750 cubic
[389.56] kilm. So 11 cubic kilm I said miles
[393.039] cubic kilm 1100 cubic
[395.56] miles around 1.2 quadrillion gallons.
[400.96] 1.2
[402.36] quadrillion. So say that again. About
[405.52] 1,500 cub, 1100 cubic miles. Exactly.
[410.639] Yeah, that's a lot of w I mean, just try
[412.479] to imagine one cubic mile of water.
[414.4] You're standing there and you're looking
[415.52] at an ice cube that's one cubic mile.
[418.72] Well, that means it's a mile high, a
[420.4] mile wide in both directions and you're
[422.319] standing there looking up a
[424.12] mile, right? That's a that in itself
[426.8] would be a big pretty pretty healthy
[429.039] lake. Oh, yeah. And now what' you say?
[431.4] 1,100 of those. Exactly. And that was
[434.479] the volume of Lake Bonavville.
[436.8] It's massive. And how how big is Salt
[439.84] Lake? Uh the Great Salt Lake. Let's look
[442.319] that up. I that in fact I was just going
[443.84] to ask you to look that up. The Great
[445.68] Salt Lake
[447.56] holds 18.92 kilometers compared to the
[451.84] 4750.
[453.68] Okay. So 4750 we're dividing by what was
[457.199] it? 18.92.92.
[462.0] Okay. So great. So Lake Bonavville was
[466.44] 250 times more voluminous than Great
[471.599] Salt Lake. Wow.
[474.44] So if you're going to call Great Salt
[477.68] Lake Great Salt Lake, what do you call
[481.199] Lake
[483.319] Bonavville? That's 250 times bigger.
[488.479] I don't know. I don't know. Do we have
[490.16] an Ultra Ultra Great. Ultra great, the
[494.16] greatest Lake Bonavville,
[496.879] but it was even relatively small
[498.72] compared to Lake Agaze, which is what
[501.199] you're going to be talking about.
[503.68] Is that what we're going into today? No,
[506.16] I don't think we'll have time to get to
[507.599] Lake Agaze today. And and Lake Agaze
[509.919] will deserve probably its own a whole
[513.44] episode devoted to to Lake Agazy. So,
[515.919] where are we looking today then? What
[517.68] are we looking at? Let's let's do this.
[519.68] Okay, I'm I'm I'm talking
[522.039] about the the impression that I had of
[525.2] the vastness of Lake Bonavville and the
[528.399] thoughts that I was having in connection
[530.08] with that is what basically what I've
[531.839] just shared with you and pondering what
[535.76] kind of environment would be necessary
[537.6] to support a lake like that in those dry
[541.92] desert basins of of Utah that we see
[545.44] right now. I you know so that was
[548.8] certainly one of the things that I came
[550.959] away with and I think probably the
[553.04] answer partially is that
[555.959] um it had to be a very quick phenomena
[559.68] right in other words I think what we're
[561.6] seeing there is
[563.32] precipitation over a fairly quick period
[566.0] of time temporarily completely
[569.8] overwhelmed any rate of evaporation or
[573.56] or volume loss due to evaporation and
[577.76] how long is a quick period of time would
[580.48] you say? Well, I don't know. I'm not
[584.8] thinking many many years though. I'm
[586.8] thinking probably months.
[590.24] Months, if not if not weeks.
[593.2] And this would be for Lake Vonavville to
[595.6] first appear.
[597.519] Well, no. It's almost certain that there
[600.16] had been there was a lake
[602.279] there. Okay. What I would surmise is the
[605.519] model looked like this. There was a
[607.44] lake. It was a freshwater lake. It was
[610.0] would have been um south of the glacial
[612.48] front which was you know up there in in
[615.2] Washington, northern Idaho and so on. So
[617.68] it's south of the glacial front.
[619.959] However, obviously during the late
[623.04] glacial maximum that region of the
[626.48] central region of the of America is
[631.04] going to be much cooler than now. It's
[633.6] also likely that the jetream has been
[637.76] diverted to the south. So, it makes
[640.68] sense from that standpoint that the
[643.519] southwestern deserts of the United
[645.44] States could have actually been green
[647.519] and relatively
[649.0] lush, including the basin and range
[651.44] province of Utah and Nevada. Right? So
[654.64] there was probably a lake there and it
[656.64] was
[657.32] probably significantly larger than Great
[660.88] Salt Lake because it wouldn't have been
[662.48] a desert. How deep was it? Maybe 50 to a
[666.32] couple hundred feet deep. Right. The
[670.16] question is is how much time and when
[674.16] and and again I've come back with a lot
[676.24] of new information and studies uh that
[679.04] I'm trying to digest right now. But what
[681.839] it's appearing like is that there were a
[683.76] couple of episodes of rapid filling
[686.64] followed by decline in lake levels. It
[689.76] seemed like it was a very dynamic lake
[692.48] and then there was a final stage where
[695.839] it rose up to this maximum height which
[698.88] was about just over 5,000 ft above sea
[701.88] level. And at that point, if if you look
[705.04] at the maps of the lake, there's an the
[708.16] entire basin and range of Utah and
[710.839] Nevada is an internally isolated basin.
[716.079] It doesn't have outflow to the ocean.
[719.12] However, during this Bonavville flood,
[721.04] there was a temporary largecale outflow
[724.079] to the ocean because the water rose and
[727.519] when it hit just over 5,000 ft above sea
[730.6] level on the northern rim of the lake,
[733.44] there was a a low point. Obviously, when
[736.88] the water rises up to that low point,
[738.8] that's the first place it's going to
[740.639] start spilling over. Now, there's a
[744.24] study that I've just read since uh we
[748.079] did the tour
[749.639] suggesting here's here's the model.
[752.48] Imagine a hard bedrock sill even like
[756.079] granite grrenanitic type metamorphic
[758.0] rock hard rock sill and then you've got
[760.76] 350 feet of more or less aluvial soft
[765.92] not completely lithified material that
[768.72] has been outwashed from erosion off the
[772.8] adjacent mountain ranges and it's
[775.36] relatively young compared to that bed
[778.079] hard bedrock sill. So now the question
[781.12] is the water in Lake Bonavville rises up
[784.16] and at some point it is now just just
[787.12] above 5,000 ft above sea level. It gets
[789.76] equal in elevation to that to the
[793.279] surface of this fan aluvial fan. So it
[797.839] starts flowing over. Now the question is
[801.76] how long of a time elapse between the wa
[805.12] level of the lake coming up to the sill
[809.6] or the top of that aluvial fan and the
[814.0] bursting out of that lake discharging 35
[818.72] million 40 million cubic feet per second
[821.839] because that's a hell of an event there.
[824.72] So now the in in reading the reports it
[830.079] seemed like the idea was that for some
[833.12] period of un indeterminate period of
[835.88] time it was a relatively stable
[838.48] situation with the lake level being that
[841.399] high and then a river flowing out that
[844.56] might have been a more what we would
[846.399] think of as a normalsized river. Right
[849.36] now the question
[851.399] is how do you get from there to the
[853.92] flood and how long was it that there was
[857.519] the water level up to that height a
[861.6] normal type river and the outburst of
[864.24] the flood. One of the studies was
[866.24] suggesting there was an earthquake and
[868.24] the earthquake caused the failure of the
[870.56] aluvial dam. That makes sense, right?
[874.16] Yeah. But what doesn't make sense to me
[876.0] is the assumption that there was some
[878.24] protracted period of time between the
[881.04] lake level getting that high and there
[883.92] being like a and then yeah and then
[886.32] you've got like a normal river what for
[888.48] hundreds of years or whatever. But
[890.56] again, then you have to the problem is s
[893.519] sustaining that lake level again. And
[896.8] now what if you still have that open?
[899.04] What was the surface area of Lake
[900.48] Bonavville at its I'm going to get these
[902.48] in my head so we don't have to look them
[904.16] up all the
[907.16] time. Surface area Lake Bonavville
[910.16] 20,000 cubic I mean square kilometers
[912.88] square miles. Square miles. Okay. 20,000
[916.399] square miles 51,000 square kilometers.
[920.079] Wow. 20,000 square
[922.6] miles. That is a lot of surface area.
[926.079] I'm going to just see if we turn that
[927.76] into
[928.68] 20,000. If that was a square, that would
[932.399] be a square. 140 miles on a side.
[937.44] Wow. So, that's a that was my point.
[939.839] That's what I came away with was the
[941.519] sheer magnitude of the basin, the area
[944.959] of Lake Bonavville. Right now, if
[948.24] there's an elapse of time between its
[950.48] rise to the 5,000 ft above sea level
[953.72] datam and its overflow, how do you
[957.12] maintain how much rainfall has to come
[959.839] every year to maintain that level of of
[964.56] the lake?
[967.68] See, I I I have to think through this
[969.519] because I'm trying to make sense out of
[971.04] it and it's not adding up somehow.
[974.32] This is why I'm thinking I'm I'm again
[976.959] circling back to a singular event of
[980.639] extreme rainfall that might have raised
[983.839] the lake level the last 3 4 500 ft. See
[988.079] there may have been a big impressive
[989.6] lake there and I it that would make
[992.079] perfect sense to me that you would have
[993.6] had a an impressive lake in the basin
[996.88] already right because of the the climate
[999.839] of the late ice age. Right. It would
[1002.399] just make sense that being cooler, I'm
[1005.44] thinking uh and um the fact that the a
[1010.56] mile and a half thick or maybe more than
[1013.36] that thick ice sheet is is theorized to
[1017.92] have shunted the jetream southward by I
[1022.079] don't I'm not sure how thousand miles
[1023.92] maybe, maybe more. Um which of course
[1026.72] the jetream is going to bring
[1028.16] precipitation with it, right? So we know
[1031.6] that like Enso
[1034.36] uh cycle is connected with the jetream
[1037.439] and the movement of the jetream. Um so
[1040.319] for example what is that the jetream?
[1042.88] No, no. The Enso cycle. It's the
[1046.76] uh
[1048.52] uh southern Let's see. It's a Spanish
[1051.679] word. It's a the s It's en southern
[1055.0] oscillation. Just look up enso. I I
[1058.08] mean, again, I should know that, but I
[1059.36] think the en is
[1064.799] Yeah. Yeah. El Nino. El Nino. Southern
[1067.76] Oscillation. Thank you. Yeah.
[1071.84] Okay. Okay. So, El Nino, southern
[1073.6] oscillation,
[1075.12] uh, can bring moisture. If it shifts to
[1078.24] the south, it'll bring moisture. For
[1080.4] example, like if it's going over the
[1083.0] Mediterranean level, I believe Europe
[1085.52] will be dry. If it shifts to the north,
[1088.16] Europe will get a lot of
[1090.6] precipitation. Um, yeah. And it says it
[1093.52] happens in two to sevenyear cycles.
[1100.12] Mhm. Yeah. This cycle which typically
[1102.559] occurs every two to seven years involves
[1104.88] three phases. El Nino, leninia and an
[1107.76] enzone neutral phase. El Nino is a warm
[1110.799] phase. Leninia is a cool phase and the
[1113.12] neutral phase is a transition between
[1114.88] them. Right. So that's one of Yeah,
[1117.919] that's one of the cycles that that
[1121.0] causes climate change more on on a on a
[1124.0] more micro scale. Um, so would you think
[1127.76] that the the mass pluvial uh period that
[1132.96] could potent if it it was a one event
[1135.12] that had this happen at once? Are you
[1137.679] saying that it could happened naturally
[1140.559] because of the ENSO cycle or would it be
[1144.16] something that caused No, because what
[1147.28] we're we're seeing we're the Enso cycle
[1150.0] is operational as we speak. Right.
[1152.48] Right. So, this would have to be caused
[1154.0] by something like if if there was an
[1156.16] impact and it threw a bunch of stuff
[1158.48] into the atmosphere and the the moisture
[1162.0] had to come down somewhere, the water
[1164.559] had to come back down. I'm having a hard
[1167.039] time visualizing something that's not
[1171.72] catastrophic and that you've got some
[1174.76] prolonged extreme pluvial phenomena
[1178.24] going on that would have raised the lake
[1181.08] level. But see the my problem is is the
[1184.32] assumption that that that span of time
[1187.24] between the lake topping
[1189.799] out. How much time elapsed between the
[1192.64] topping out of the lake at its highest
[1194.799] elevation and the breakout of the
[1198.679] flood say at 35 to 40 million cubic feet
[1202.08] per second. That's the thing I'm trying
[1204.559] to understand. And I I don't know. I
[1207.6] don't know. Is it going to be a matter
[1209.76] of weeks and months or is it a matter of
[1212.0] years, centuries? I don't know. Some
[1214.64] people who worked on it think it's
[1217.32] centuries. But then to me that raises
[1219.679] questions like okay, hundreds of years
[1222.64] the lake is at that level. Well, let's
[1225.6] talk about what kind of climatic regime
[1228.48] is going to be necessary to sustain a
[1231.039] lake of that
[1232.76] size. And I don't know what that would
[1234.88] be. Maybe I'm missing something here.
[1236.96] You know, I'll admit my my understanding
[1239.44] of climate change uh more than most
[1242.32] people have a lot of rainfall and or an
[1246.159] equivalent amount of rainfall or
[1248.44] inflow to the amount of evaporation that
[1251.2] there is and that would be equal to a
[1255.679] lot if I'm understanding you correctly.
[1257.84] Well, yeah. I mean the amount of eva
[1259.52] lost through evaporation has to be just
[1261.6] almost microscopic compared to the input
[1265.52] into the basin from whatever source. But
[1268.08] one study I recently read said I think
[1270.4] they were estimating that
[1273.72] 3.3% of the of the lake volume was
[1276.96] contributed by melting glaciers.
[1281.64] 3.3% or in that ballpark. Okay. So that
[1285.039] that's the case
[1287.28] uh then where did the rest of it come?
[1290.24] It had to have been
[1291.48] rainfall precipitate. I mean is it
[1293.6] snowfall? Well, I'm obviously could be
[1295.76] snowfall, but and this is this is
[1299.32] a this is the total Lake Bonavville
[1303.52] including the lake that was there
[1305.679] already that it it filled up or is this
[1308.159] what was added in volume in addition to
[1310.72] the this would been the total volume at
[1313.6] its
[1315.08] maximum. So, if I was going to create
[1317.919] just a hypothetical scenario based upon
[1320.799] what I know, which is still limited,
[1323.36] although I'm definitely learning more, I
[1325.76] mean, I've got new studies now that I'm
[1327.36] reading and having brought back, you
[1329.6] know, all the new
[1330.76] observations. Um, yeah, I'm advancing my
[1335.2] thought about like about Bonavville to
[1337.84] the next level. But um what I would
[1341.28] think would be something like this that
[1342.96] there was a lake there and it was a
[1344.24] pretty substantial impressive lake. I
[1346.559] mean if there was a lake there that was
[1347.919] 200 ft deep or 300 ft deep that would be
[1351.12] a pretty impressive lake right and that
[1353.919] would be in my mind completely realistic
[1356.88] with what a a realistic climate regime
[1360.559] might be during the late glacial
[1363.08] maximum. Right? Why? because of that the
[1367.12] the the shunting of the jetream further
[1369.76] south. So you probably got the jetream
[1372.08] moving over the whole basin uh basin and
[1376.08] range. So it's bringing weather with it.
[1378.72] It's bringing the the rainfall with it,
[1381.76] right? So uh and it's also cooler, more
[1385.919] rainfall. Um it's likely that and and we
[1389.6] know I mean for all kinds of studies I
[1391.44] mean that there were forests and there
[1392.88] were uh you know it would have been a a
[1395.36] sort of a mosaic it it looks like but it
[1398.32] was not a desert like it is now.
[1401.6] So the climate changes at the end of the
[1404.159] last ice age it seems were associated
[1408.08] with this transition from this uh former
[1411.919] environment into the desert environment
[1413.919] that we see there today that does not
[1416.159] sustain huge lakes. Um, so then I guess
[1421.28] the question in my mind that I keep
[1423.12] going over and over again and iterating
[1425.039] and reiterating
[1426.76] is what happened? Where do you get that
[1429.76] much rainfall that you can completely
[1431.84] overwhelm that ratio? Completely tip
[1435.36] that ratio so far into the uh onto the
[1440.28] accumulation side compared to the
[1442.96] evaporation side. And it it just had to
[1446.0] been an enormous amount of rainfall. So
[1448.72] again, we go back during the ice age,
[1450.799] there was probably some pretty
[1452.48] substantial lakes occupying the basins
[1455.6] of the basin and range province of of
[1458.0] Utah and
[1459.159] Nevada. Then what it would seem like to
[1461.76] me and this is a idea that that needs to
[1464.64] be thoroughly tested before it's
[1466.52] accepted. But the idea would then be is
[1468.88] that towards the end of this somewhere
[1472.08] you know in the last few thousand years
[1473.84] of the trans before the transition out
[1476.4] of the ice age somewhere within that
[1479.24] window there would have been intense
[1482.36] plui intense
[1484.36] rainfall filling that lake up to its
[1487.2] brim. And at that point, it's flowing
[1490.039] over the the aluvial dam on its northern
[1494.159] rim.
[1495.72] Right, interest, we got, you know, drone
[1498.72] footage and new uh imagery and
[1501.2] everything of that whole outlet there.
[1504.36] Um, so now the question is is how much
[1508.0] time elaps between the maximum full of
[1511.36] Lake Bonavville and the outburst of the
[1514.76] flood? And I don't know the answer to
[1517.12] that. Well, I would lean towards
[1519.44] thinking that it was a very short-lived
[1521.48] event. And now what I'm going to do is
[1524.24] I'm reading and rereading the new
[1526.559] evidence that there was an earthquake.
[1529.039] Um because it seems to me that you if
[1532.4] you have a rapid filling, I mean, look
[1535.2] at the volumes of water we're talking
[1537.279] about here. And we know from looking at
[1540.4] the shoreline, the shorelines of Lake
[1542.159] Bonavville are not level. They're
[1544.279] tilted. Why are they tilted? Well,
[1546.559] because once the lake was removed, the
[1549.039] land has risen. And it's risen more in
[1553.279] the deeper parts of the lake than in the
[1555.36] shallower parts. So just think of a
[1557.76] simple profile like
[1559.48] this, a con cave profile, deeper in the
[1564.48] middle, shallower on the rim. So now the
[1568.0] lake is in there. Then you remove the
[1570.4] lake and you start having isostatic
[1572.32] rebound. Now again, you've got a basin.
[1576.799] When the water's there, it's going to be
[1578.36] level. Remove the weight of the water.
[1580.88] It now starts coming back, rebounding.
[1583.76] What's going to happen to the water
[1585.6] level? The shoreline. Well, the
[1587.279] shoreline is going to come up and it's
[1589.76] going to be tilted higher in the middle,
[1592.159] isn't it? Makes sense, right? Yes. Well,
[1594.799] that's what we see. We can see that in
[1596.559] the shorelines of Lake Bonavville.
[1598.24] They're tilted. That's because of
[1600.64] isostatic rebound after this the
[1603.12] tremendous weight of this huge volume of
[1605.84] water was
[1607.32] removed. Right? That isostatic
[1611.12] adjustment could certainly be associated
[1614.96] with
[1616.279] seismicity and we're seeing evidence of
[1618.559] that all over the place. The other thing
[1620.64] and I think we talked about it on one of
[1622.32] the episodes was the glacial for bulge.
[1625.2] So, let's say you've got a level field
[1628.0] like this and you put a weight on it.
[1630.32] Well, it's going to depress in the
[1631.919] middle. Watch my hand when I push down
[1634.159] like on my knuckles. It'll depress in
[1636.08] the middle. But then look what happens
[1637.44] at the edges of my fingertips curve up.
[1640.88] What you're seeing there, that's your
[1642.88] glacial glacial
[1644.6] forbulge. So, that's the uplift of land
[1648.88] just beyond the rim of the the glacier,
[1652.4] okay? Of the ice. So now you got the
[1654.4] glacier for bulge and what happens when
[1656.72] you remove the weight of the ice? Look,
[1660.08] middle comes up and it relaxes and goes
[1663.2] down. The glacial forebulge
[1666.52] drops. People don't think about that
[1668.72] stuff. Yeah. That the that there's
[1670.96] actually an elasticity to the earth's
[1673.12] crust that manifests in in these isoatic
[1677.2] adjustments that take place. But they do
[1680.0] and they're well documented. So this
[1683.279] might be a a mis question, but is there
[1685.84] a threshold to the size of a glacier
[1690.44] and glacial forbulge even being
[1693.12] possible? So for example, if it's a
[1695.039] smaller
[1696.039] glacier, is the earth's
[1698.6] elasticity threshold higher? So it
[1702.08] wouldn't have any for bulge on a smaller
[1704.799] glacier and then you reach a certain
[1706.32] size. than there is. Well, now we're
[1708.96] getting into structural geology and the
[1711.679] discussion of realology, which is a
[1715.039] complicated subject and it looks at
[1717.36] exactly what you're talking about. What
[1719.12] is the what is the elasticity? Uh what
[1722.799] is the viscosity of the plates and their
[1726.24] movements relative to one another? And
[1728.159] there's a lot of variation in there. So,
[1730.799] I think you'd have to address a question
[1733.2] like that on a case-byase basis. Yeah,
[1735.6] that makes sense. Yeah. Depending on
[1738.159] what what the the earth is made out of
[1740.32] in that area.
[1742.6] Correct. Yeah. So, there's a lot of
[1745.76] unanswered questions, but they're
[1747.84] questions that need to be asked because
[1750.08] without understanding our own
[1751.679] catastrophic past, we can't understand
[1753.84] our past. Period. And if we don't
[1755.52] understand our past, we have no hope of
[1758.24] understanding our
[1759.96] future. So, there we are. We're stuck in
[1762.24] the middle, which is the present. And
[1764.159] we're not explaining anything, but the
[1765.96] present is lo loaded with the clues that
[1770.64] we need to in order to reconstruct to in
[1773.6] a sense what we're doing when we're
[1775.039] going out in the field like this and
[1777.08] documenting these these features and
[1779.84] this kind of evidence is we're sort of
[1781.919] like re-engineering. We're reverse
[1784.84] engineering these catastrophic events.
[1788.0] We're trying to work backwards. We can
[1789.84] see the evidence in the field. We can
[1791.36] see the shorelines. We can see the the
[1793.6] fan deltas. We can see the boulder bars.
[1796.399] We can see the cataracts that are there
[1798.76] now that are the the imprints, the after
[1802.48] effects of these events. So, we have to
[1805.2] start with what we've got now and then
[1807.2] begin to work backwards piece by piece
[1810.52] reconstructing these events. The problem
[1813.6] is is that you get a sense you you
[1816.799] you've got to the I would call it a
[1818.96] boundary problem. And the boundary
[1821.76] problem is to understand an event you
[1824.159] have to you have to establish some kind
[1827.2] of boundaries. Now in nature nature
[1829.919] provides us boundaries. Yeah, there's a
[1831.52] watershed divide. Okay. Uh rainfall
[1834.399] falls on the this on the divide here and
[1837.2] it goes to this watershed and over here
[1839.039] it goes to this watershed. But when
[1841.12] we're looking at like temporal uh
[1843.44] events, we have to provide boundaries
[1845.6] and we have to provide geographic
[1847.279] boundaries because if we're trying to
[1849.44] understand what's happening
[1851.32] in say the great the basin and range or
[1854.159] what's what's happening up at Red Rock
[1855.919] Pass at the time that the that the flood
[1858.24] burst out, right? Well, we have to put
[1860.32] these tempor these sort of artificial
[1862.919] boundaries, right? And that's what
[1865.2] they've like for example done with the
[1866.799] the Missoula floods. They put boundaries
[1869.12] on it. And if I pull up this graphic
[1871.919] which is showing the late glacial
[1873.52] maximum and the Missoula floods, they
[1875.84] have a nice box around it, right? And
[1880.159] what's happened is you've got this box
[1882.88] and within this box, you've got all the
[1885.399] studies, but they're pretty much
[1888.76] artificially not going outside that box.
[1892.72] And I don't think you can fully
[1894.32] understand what happened until you go
[1897.12] outside the box. Again, you know what?
[1899.279] It comes down to the big picture. Yeah,
[1903.44] you got to have the big picture. I'm
[1905.12] tempted to pull uh Yeah, pull it up.
[1908.64] I will do that right now
[1912.039] then. Okay, here we go.
[1915.6] And that's two. I think we talked about
[1917.44] isostatic rebound once before but
[1919.6] glacial forbulge I think is a new term
[1923.919] probably it
[1925.799] is well this illustrates what I was
[1928.399] talking about so sort of the standard
[1933.12] view now is you want to learn about the
[1936.24] Missoula flood well you don't need to
[1938.32] everything you need to know is in that
[1941.159] box you see I I I don't agree with that
[1944.96] I think if we want to understand what
[1946.559] happens inside the box, we also have to
[1948.799] understand what's happening outside the
[1950.679] box because that box isn't
[1954.039] real. I mean, and yes, nature does
[1957.279] provide a sort of a there's a reality
[1959.6] there. If I was to zoom in, we would see
[1962.24] that for example, this is most of the
[1964.72] Colombia watershed right here. However,
[1968.399] even during this period of time, um you
[1972.24] know, from now there's no ice. All of
[1974.96] this ice is gone. It's just limited to
[1977.44] isolated montaine glaciers or mountain
[1979.799] glaciers. But this huge vast amount of
[1983.44] ice here that's as big as Greenland ice
[1985.6] sheet and Antarctica ice sheet put
[1987.96] together. That's how much effing ice we
[1990.72] had over North America during the late
[1992.72] glacial maximum. All that ice is gone.
[1997.039] Why? Because it melted. When it melted,
[2000.24] you had huge amounts of meltwater flow.
[2003.76] ultimately wanting to get back to the
[2005.76] oceans and that's where all of this melt
[2007.44] water went was back into the oceans.
[2009.679] Sometimes I get questions and
[2011.96] people I don't know if they're you know
[2014.32] I I would if if a seven-year-old asked
[2017.039] me this question I wouldn't be shocked
[2019.12] but I know that this is coming from an
[2021.12] adult and I've gotten asked this
[2022.88] question multiple times like in in
[2025.12] online comment sections. Well, where did
[2027.84] all the water go? You had all this
[2030.64] melting. Where did the water go? Well,
[2034.36] um, where all of it goes ultimately? I
[2038.48] mean, are you I mean, what did you grow
[2041.6] up in a inside a a box? Did you never
[2044.96] get outside? Did you never I mean, where
[2047.12] do you think it went? It went into the
[2050.359] oceans. I I mean, I I've been really
[2053.52] What? Where did all the water go?
[2058.119] Well, I don't know. You know, that's a
[2061.119] mystery. We don't know where it went.
[2062.24] Well, we do know where it went. All went
[2063.76] into the oceans. And we can And one of
[2065.44] the things we're going to be looking at
[2066.48] here as we move forward is how the water
[2070.48] returned to the ocean, right? And we've
[2072.48] been looking at some of that as well,
[2074.879] some of the traces of it, looking at But
[2077.919] see, what people don't realize is the
[2079.52] the magnitude of this of the after
[2082.839] effects. We're see we're we're like
[2085.04] microbes living on top of this gigantic
[2088.2] phenomena. And it's so gigantic that we
[2091.119] as mere microbes can't we don't see it.
[2094.72] It's too big. Um and that's why it's
[2097.839] necessary. Let me let me I'll say this.
[2100.0] It it's you know it is necessary
[2102.079] sometimes to draw these artificial
[2103.839] boundaries. Mhm. Right. You have to to
[2106.24] try to understand. But then as you go
[2108.48] through it, you learn about it. I mean
[2110.72] you know I started really studying the
[2112.56] Missoula floods in the early 1980s.
[2116.56] the 90s started making my first tours of
[2119.44] that landscape and I've been back I I've
[2121.28] so I've lost count 25 30 times exploring
[2125.359] every nook and cranny of this landscape
[2127.76] and realizing on every trip that no
[2131.76] there are some huge gaping holes in this
[2134.0] box
[2135.72] here and if we're going to understand
[2138.64] what to repeat myself if we're going to
[2140.96] understand what transpired inside that
[2143.32] box we have to also understand what was
[2146.32] going on outside that box because nature
[2149.52] didn't really recognize if if you have
[2152.32] uh an enormous amount of rainfall coming
[2154.88] in moving over if the jetream is moving
[2158.079] um being shunted to the southward
[2160.0] because of the formation of this huge
[2161.68] ice sheet here. Well, that jetream isn't
[2164.48] it's ignoring this box. It doesn't
[2166.88] recognize that box. Oh, we can't go any
[2169.119] further south. There's a box there now.
[2172.56] So the first thing was is Harlon Brett
[2175.52] was looking at Washington. Let's just go
[2177.599] to a
[2179.359] uh let's go to a another
[2183.56] map. So initially here's the basalt
[2187.079] plateau. This is what Jay Harland Brett
[2190.079] was studying
[2191.24] for 2530 years, right? Discovered these
[2195.92] features called the channel scablands.
[2198.32] and he's looking at this area right
[2200.839] here and uh all of his critics are
[2204.079] saying this was what the argument boiled
[2206.32] down to. Well, you say all this stuff,
[2208.72] all of these features that you've
[2210.0] documented were produced by giant
[2211.599] catastrophic floods. Well, what was the
[2213.68] source of the floods and he just he
[2216.56] didn't know but he thought that the
[2218.24] floods were coming from melting
[2220.32] glaciers. Let's go back one.
[2223.119] If we go back to here, you'll see that
[2225.44] the southern margin of the cordier and
[2227.76] ice sheet just breaches the northernmost
[2230.96] rim of the basalt plateau. Now, and let
[2234.4] me take a little quick diversion uh
[2236.88] before we move on. So, people look over
[2239.76] here. You see my cursor? That's that's
[2241.76] Yellowstone Lake. Under Yellowstone
[2244.88] right here, there's a an active magma
[2247.92] plume rising up, right? that creates all
[2250.88] of that volcanic volatility that that's
[2253.92] so recognizable associated with um
[2258.24] Yellowstone with
[2261.0] Yellowstone.
[2262.839] Okay. If we go back and we start
[2266.2] dating, we have basaltt all in here and
[2269.76] we have
[2270.92] basaltt floor here. So down here at the
[2274.48] bottom of this, you see Lake Bonavville
[2275.92] down I mean I'm sorry uh Great Salt Lake
[2278.48] is down here. Now we can't see your
[2280.64] marker anymore. Oh, sorry. Right here it
[2283.599] is. Yeah, that's Great Salt Lake. And
[2287.359] the outflow path
[2290.079] uh was right
[2292.28] up. Let's see. It was I don't have the
[2296.079] resolution. I need was right up. Yeah,
[2298.24] it was right up here. If you can see the
[2300.8] low point is this one place that's you
[2303.28] know, Red Rock Pass it's called. the the
[2305.92] flood burst out and it flowed across the
[2308.4] south the uh Snake River plane up to
[2312.24] here. And this right here is Hell's
[2314.56] Canyon. And this is the deepest canyon
[2317.04] in North America. It's deeper than uh
[2319.76] Grand Canyon. Yes. And then the Snake
[2323.04] River flows out this way. You can see it
[2325.28] right here. And then it's a tributary to
[2328.079] the Colombia and right here at the Tri
[2330.64] Cities area just above uh just above
[2335.04] Wula Gap which we've talked about the
[2338.8] waters of the Snake
[2341.72] flowed down the Colombia through the
[2344.0] gorge across the Cascade Mountains here
[2346.56] and then discharged right here. There's
[2348.88] an eroded valley right here that was cut
[2352.72] by the huge volumes of flood water
[2356.079] gushing off the Colorado I mean the uh
[2359.839] the Columbia Plateau here coming out and
[2362.96] then out here you don't see it here. We
[2364.72] could pull up a we could pull up a
[2366.64] Google Earth image, but out here under
[2369.28] the water is a huge fan delta. That is
[2372.48] the material that was being washed off
[2374.8] washed off the the the continent, washed
[2377.599] off the the
[2378.92] plateau and carried through the gorge
[2381.68] and then dumped out into the ocean.
[2384.48] Okay, now this is what's interesting.
[2386.24] Look at this area closer right in here.
[2389.52] This is a very chaotic area and it's
[2392.24] riddled with things that are called
[2394.32] feeder dikes. These are big fractures
[2397.839] where
[2399.48] lava has come up, magma has come up and
[2404.599] discharged out. And here's what you got
[2408.4] to understand when you're looking at
[2409.839] this. Did you see the great arc of the
[2412.0] Snake River plane? Yes. Okay. I'm going
[2414.8] to use use my hand here. You can see my
[2416.72] hand, right? Yes. Okay. So, imagine
[2419.119] you've got this. Maybe I could get
[2420.72] something here uh that might serve
[2424.52] uh here. This is my
[2427.64] spoon. Excuse me. So, let's say my spoon
[2431.28] is a magma plume. And this is the
[2435.32] crust. Excuse me. This is the crust of
[2438.88] the earth, right? So, you've got this
[2441.599] hot flame like some kind of like a
[2444.0] geological
[2446.16] uh torch, a settling torch, right? You
[2449.52] got the the crust moving over it, the
[2451.44] rock moving over it, and that rock is
[2453.76] being melted by the heat. Now, as it's
[2458.16] moving over, it's not moving in a
[2460.96] straight line. It's actually moving in
[2462.56] an arc. Now the age of the basalts have
[2466.4] been uh measured to be around 16 to 17
[2472.079] million years old. And for about 10
[2475.52] million years, let's say from 16 or 17
[2479.28] million years ago down to 6 million
[2481.68] years
[2482.44] ago, there were these huge outflows of
[2486.68] magma from these feeder dikes that are
[2489.92] in this area right here.
[2492.4] Well, what you can see is if we were to
[2494.4] run if we were have if we had a cosmic
[2497.52] drone footage of the Earth and we could
[2499.359] replay it for the last 16 million years,
[2502.8] what we would see is that this area in
[2505.28] here moves back along this arc and that
[2508.56] 17 million years ago it was sitting
[2510.16] right on top of this
[2511.72] plume. Is that making sense? Can you can
[2514.319] you begin to see the phenomena here?
[2517.8] So because that that uh lava that's
[2521.2] coming out um and forming these
[2524.079] tremendous layers of of basaltt is
[2527.68] fluid. It's flowing downhill and your
[2529.76] downhill from here is this way. So and
[2534.0] then you can see that the basalt plateau
[2536.0] itself now tilts to the southwest. So
[2540.079] the low point on the basalt plateau is
[2543.76] right here at Wula Gap. So what you had
[2546.4] was this 10 million-year period of fiery
[2550.28] catastrophe where these you had these
[2552.4] huge upwellings of liquid extremely hot
[2557.04] lava coming out of the earth spilling
[2559.839] out layer upon layer upon layer over a
[2563.599] period of about 10 million years down to
[2566.319] about 6 million years ago. And
[2570.119] then there were more great earth
[2572.64] changes. And then about 2 and a half
[2574.24] million years
[2575.56] ago, the geological epoch shifted from
[2579.599] the pioene into the pleaene. And what
[2583.2] seemed to define that transition was
[2586.8] this beginning of this cyclic
[2588.72] oscillation between glacier interglacial
[2591.68] glacial interglacial.
[2593.839] Now, when you go back to here, imagine
[2596.96] that you've got this process here
[2598.96] repeating itself who knows how many
[2601.599] times, maybe 10 or 12 times over the
[2604.8] course of the entire
[2606.839] pleasy. Now, imagine the amount of
[2610.079] geomorphic work you're talking about
[2611.839] over a period of just not even just one
[2615.04] cycle, but multiple cycles. H now what
[2618.96] do you think survives
[2621.359] uh the onset of glaciers that are this
[2624.72] huge? Well, not much. The the the
[2627.68] forming of these glaciers and the growth
[2630.079] the lateral growth of these glaciers
[2632.48] basically
[2633.96] demolishes anything in its
[2636.599] path, right? It just I mean what we what
[2640.4] do we find under the glaciers? But we
[2642.96] find thick layers of glacial till which
[2645.359] is just ground up pulverized earth
[2650.28] rocks organic material that was the
[2652.8] remnant of forests that maybe once grew
[2654.96] there before the encroachment of the
[2657.4] glaciers. So under the glaciers we find
[2661.28] huge volumes of this till it's called.
[2664.96] And the till is just nothing but
[2666.72] pulverized rock. It has no structure to
[2669.359] it. has no obvious bedding or or uh
[2673.92] striations in it. Why? Well, because the
[2676.24] glaciers aren't sorting the rock. It's
[2678.16] just pulverizing it, grinding it up,
[2680.319] like putting it in a big grinder and
[2682.079] just chaotically mixing it all together.
[2685.52] Water on the other hand
[2689.0] sorts. So, it leaves two different kinds
[2691.68] of signatures that you can read in the
[2693.72] landscape, right? glacial till which is
[2696.72] the raw material that forms morings. A
[2700.079] moring is built of till. The glaciers
[2703.839] can take that chaotic till and shape it.
[2707.319] Well, so what happens? You have terminal
[2710.48] morine that forms at the snout of a
[2714.28] glacier. You have lateral morine that
[2717.359] forms along the sides of a glacier.
[2719.2] Let's say that the glacier is moving
[2720.8] through a mountain valley. As it's doing
[2723.04] this, it's grinding off the sides of the
[2726.16] mountains, pulverizing it. That material
[2728.72] then falls down and forms thick deposits
[2732.68] between the glacier and the mountain.
[2736.079] That's lateral morine. Then let's say
[2738.64] you've got two valleys, which is a
[2740.48] fairly common thing, come together and
[2742.16] they both have glaciers in them. They
[2744.16] both have lateral morine right now. And
[2746.72] that lateral morine is being carried
[2748.64] along with the movement like like these
[2750.64] they're these frozen slow moving rivers
[2754.16] is the way to think of a glacier.
[2756.16] They're not just static chunks of ice
[2758.48] just sitting there, right? They're
[2760.88] moving. They're flowing. You have a zone
[2763.28] of accumulation at the top end of the
[2765.4] glacier where the snowfall on the
[2768.72] glacier far exceeds the uh dissipation
[2772.48] of the glacier. And then you have the
[2774.64] zone of ablation which is at the bottom
[2777.04] end of the glacier where the melting and
[2779.44] the recession back of the glacier um
[2782.76] essentially is too great for the glacier
[2786.0] to continue to grow. Right? And again
[2789.52] just like the lake volume you're going
[2791.04] to have this oscillation. If you've got
[2793.68] more snowfall up in the zone of
[2796.28] accumulation the glacier will grow
[2798.72] because it's all you pick up this
[2801.359] weight. picture you you've got this
[2802.8] weight and it's bearing down. Well, what
[2804.72] that's doing is it's accelerating the
[2807.319] flow, right? Because that weight, that
[2809.76] pressure is making things move faster
[2812.359] downhill, right? Now, at the bottom end
[2814.96] of the glacier, it's melting, right? And
[2817.76] you can go and if you ever go any hikes,
[2821.119] you know, and you're at the terminus of
[2822.48] a glacier, you'll see there's great
[2824.16] vigorous streams of melt water flowing
[2826.48] off the glacier. So, let's say you have
[2828.72] a warmer than usual winter.
[2831.44] Well, now what happens? Well, it's
[2833.44] likely that the rate of recession mel
[2836.48] melt recession is melting will exceed
[2839.28] the rate of forward
[2841.48] expansion. On the other hand, increase
[2843.68] the amount of accumulation at the top
[2846.0] end of the glacier, the glacier might
[2848.079] grow. Now, what have we been seeing
[2849.52] throughout most of the 20th century is
[2851.28] glacier recession, right? Because of the
[2854.24] warming,
[2855.76] um the glacier has receded, right? So
[2859.599] now you've got this situation where you
[2861.359] have these oscillations. Picture this.
[2863.76] Now the glacier is flowing. One of the
[2866.96] things that it does is it's moving
[2868.56] along. It's almost like scooping. So
[2870.96] you've got thick till at the bottom. The
[2873.2] glacier is almost like scooping that
[2875.76] till that till now rides up into the
[2878.56] glacier itself. The term is nlacial. En
[2883.599] glacial within the glacier. super
[2886.48] glacial on top of the glacier,
[2889.599] subglacial on the bottom. Okay? So now
[2893.28] the interior of that glacier is almost
[2895.68] like a series of um conveyor belts and
[2900.079] it's carrying that material. So now the
[2902.72] the the terminal moring is going to be a
[2905.52] combination. You can think of it as the
[2907.76] result of of two very much interrelated
[2910.839] processes. The glacier itself is almost
[2913.52] doing having a bulldoz effect.
[2916.079] right? Piling stuff, but it's also
[2918.2] delivering the conveyor belt is
[2920.319] constantly delivering endlacial material
[2923.599] at the glacier snout. Now, you got two
[2926.4] valley glaciers coming down and they
[2928.8] meet. And remember, they both got
[2930.559] lateral morine because they're they're
[2933.2] scraping along the sides of the
[2934.88] mountains. That material is falling down
[2937.04] and it's being incorporated between the
[2939.2] mountain and the glacier. Two glaciers
[2942.0] meet. So, what happens now? and they
[2944.24] become one bigger glacier. But you can
[2946.8] tell just by looking at a snapshot
[2949.119] without even seeing the zone of
[2950.8] confluence. You can say, "Okay, well
[2952.8] this was two glaciers that flowed
[2954.16] together." Why? Because the lateral
[2956.4] morings join and now you've got lateral
[2960.319] moring on one side, on the other side,
[2962.8] and now you got it down the middle. And
[2964.88] that's called the medial medial moring.
[2968.88] Then when the glaciers begin to recede
[2972.119] back, well, let's say the glacier has
[2974.48] been more or less stationary at a point
[2976.88] over a period of a number of centuries,
[2979.44] it's built a terminal moring. A terminal
[2983.839] moring can be pretty sub. I mean, it can
[2986.0] be hundreds of feet thick. Right now,
[2988.96] the glacier begins to melt back and it
[2992.079] pauses.
[2993.599] So it pauses for a century or two at a
[2996.0] particular place and it builds another
[2999.079] morine. Now that moring may be smaller
[3002.24] and typically will be not as impressive
[3005.28] as the ultimate terminal moring but you
[3008.48] can now track the recession of the
[3010.8] glacier. So now you've got recessional
[3014.44] moring. So this is some interesting new
[3016.96] vocabulary to add. And if if somebody
[3019.52] listening to this is very interested has
[3022.16] learned these terms because we're going
[3024.24] to be talking about this, you know, if
[3026.24] if I'm going to be suggesting references
[3028.8] to read, you're already going to know
[3030.24] the terminology. So, let's go through it
[3032.48] again. We've got till, which is the the
[3036.079] material under the glacier produced by
[3038.319] the grinding of the glacier over the
[3041.16] land. Then we've got different types of
[3044.319] moring. We got the terminal morine that
[3047.359] forms at the snout of the glacier. We've
[3050.0] got lateral morine that forms along the
[3052.16] sides of the glacier. We've got medial
[3055.2] morine where two valley glaciers flow
[3057.72] together. And we've got recessional
[3060.16] morine where the ice is receding and
[3063.52] pausing in its recession. Pausing long
[3067.28] enough to build secondary and
[3070.839] tertiary morines. Typically a uh t a a
[3077.04] terminal moring will oftenimes have an
[3079.68] rq shape. Let's go through I think I've
[3082.559] got moringine is the description of when
[3084.559] it is deposited. Correct. Yeah. Moring
[3087.839] is the structure. Yeah. Of how hill is
[3091.599] the material composing that structure.
[3095.52] Yeah. That's the Yeah.
[3101.68] But here, uh, ge geologist David Alt
[3106.48] wrote a book, uh, which I read not long
[3110.48] after it came out. Uh, David Alt and
[3113.52] Donald Hindman, 1995. This was the
[3117.04] Mountain Press Publishing Company,
[3119.119] Northwest
[3120.68] Exposures, a geological story of the
[3123.359] Northwest.
[3125.599] So he goes into some of the background
[3127.04] which in in his some of his uh ideas I
[3130.319] find very interesting. So let's go
[3131.68] through this. Several quite different
[3134.16] things happened about 17 million years
[3136.319] ago. The entire chain of big western
[3140.0] cascades volcanoes which had been
[3142.8] erupting vigorously for at least 20
[3145.28] million years abruptly became extinct.
[3149.319] Overwhelming flood basaltt lava flows
[3152.359] began to pour across a vast region of
[3155.599] the inland Pacific Northwest. Faults
[3158.88] began to break the former plains of
[3161.28] Nevada and Utah into the swarm of broad
[3164.72] valleys and jagged mountain ranges of
[3166.64] the basin and range and the climate
[3169.359] became very wet and warm. Was it a
[3172.48] coincidence that all those changes came
[3174.48] at once? It seems far more likely that
[3177.92] they had a common
[3179.96] cause. Uh, and what do you think he
[3182.079] proposes for a common cause? Before we
[3184.16] go on, let's clarify a term up here. I
[3188.4] think what I'll do this term right here,
[3190.319] faults. Mhm. Okay. So, whose fault is
[3193.52] it?
[3196.079] It's yours, Randall. Obviously, it's my
[3198.76] fault.
[3200.52] Um, okay. So, a fault is like a big
[3203.119] fracture in the Earth's crust,
[3206.119] right? You heard of the San Andreas
[3208.48] fault, like a big big crack, right?
[3211.2] Right. It's most I mean, what I
[3212.88] understand faults to be
[3214.76] is there's a lot of seismic activity at
[3217.599] fault lines essentially. Oh, yes. Good
[3220.16] point. Now, what's the difference
[3221.68] between a fault and a fracture?
[3224.72] I don't know. Well, you're about to
[3226.96] know. And once having known, you will
[3229.44] now know this for the rest of your life.
[3233.16] Okay, a crack, a fracture is just a
[3236.4] crack. It's like a static situation. You
[3239.52] know, you go in
[3241.16] and, you know, crack anything. You know,
[3243.599] you got a piece of porcelain on your
[3246.559] countertop, smash it with a hammer, and
[3248.559] there's a crack. Mhm. Well, you know,
[3251.44] that's pretty much of a static
[3252.8] situation. Can I guess what a fault is?
[3255.76] Yes. A fault is a meeting point between
[3258.68] two different structures versus a crack.
[3262.72] Not
[3264.44] exactly. It can be. Yes. But what it is
[3268.079] is that a fracture is simply a crack.
[3271.92] It's a it's a static situation. A fault
[3275.04] is
[3276.04] dynamic. There's
[3278.599] movement. There's movement along that
[3281.359] crack.
[3283.2] And that
[3285.319] movement has interesting consequences.
[3288.92] Okay. So look look at my hands. You can
[3291.359] have movement that's this way. We won't
[3293.04] get into these terms today. Movement
[3295.04] this way. We can have movement this way.
[3297.2] And it creates what are different kinds
[3299.119] of faults. Typically an earthquake you
[3301.839] will have you can have a sudden what'll
[3304.24] happen is there's stress that builds up
[3306.4] along the fault line and then it'll
[3308.48] suddenly rupture.
[3310.48] got an earthquake can be this way. It
[3312.64] can be this way. Right? Um you can see
[3316.16] that there might be cases where there's
[3318.839] a there's an escarment actually formed
[3321.92] because you'll have a
[3323.8] downdropping or an uplift along the
[3327.04] fault line. We can get into talking
[3329.44] about that in another episode in more
[3331.52] detail. I don't want to get too far a
[3332.96] field with that. But that's the basic
[3334.319] difference. So a fault began to break
[3337.68] faults began to break the former plains
[3339.68] of Nevada and Utah into a swarm of broad
[3342.079] valleys and jagged mountain ranges of
[3343.839] the basin and range. And we saw that if
[3346.559] if I go to the
[3348.52] uh to the Bonavville flood. So there is
[3353.04] the basin and range province that we're
[3354.96] talking about. Look at this hole here.
[3357.44] And and notice that it seems it it has a
[3360.559] circular form to it.
[3363.359] I wouldn't be shocked if there was uh
[3366.0] that was some ancient multi-billiony old
[3368.4] giant crater, you know, on the scale of
[3371.119] the lunar maria, you know, hundreds of
[3373.92] miles across, but so old that only just
[3377.839] a suggestion of its original circular
[3380.92] form. But this is your whole basin and
[3383.359] range province. And almost every one of
[3385.599] these valleys or basins that you see
[3389.04] flat here's here's Bonavville Basin
[3391.599] flat, right? Those were lake bottoms. So
[3395.28] there was all kinds of lakes throughout
[3397.119] here. I did a graphic to show what it
[3399.04] would look like if all those lakes that
[3401.599] have been documented to have occurred in
[3404.799] these basins were contemporaneous. It
[3407.599] would look like this.
[3410.0] M now you can see that
[3412.68] Bonavville is just part of a much larger
[3415.359] complex of
[3416.92] lakes like we there's all pyramid lake
[3420.96] and other lakes that have been had their
[3423.04] names given to them.
[3425.24] Um we're not going to go out talk about
[3427.68] that today but um one of the things that
[3431.52] we will call attention to is these
[3433.44] rivers flowing north like this up into
[3436.72] the Snake River. See, here's the Snake
[3438.319] River plane, and we see the Bruno here
[3442.24] and the uh Oahi here, rivers that are
[3445.839] flowing north into the Snake River
[3450.52] Canyon. One of the things, my takeaways
[3453.44] from this is that I now believe that
[3457.319] possibly the waters flowing out of Lake
[3460.88] Bonavville, which you can see right
[3462.52] here. Oops. Yeah, right here. this this
[3467.28] whole big basin and range. This was the
[3470.16] lowest spillway outside out of the rim
[3472.88] right here. And so when the waters rose,
[3476.16] they started flowing over and out the
[3479.28] lowest saddle if you will within the
[3481.92] whole basin and range province flowed
[3484.44] out and then flowed across the Snake
[3487.599] River plane like this and then up Hell's
[3490.4] Canyons up here. You can't see it, but
[3492.559] you have the Bruno River and the Aahi
[3494.48] River flowing up here into the
[3497.72] Snake. I now believe or have enough
[3502.319] belief that I think it's worth testing
[3504.0] that there were catastrophic flows to
[3505.92] the north through these canyons here
[3508.319] that were contributing to the flow, the
[3510.24] maximum discharge of the Bonavville
[3512.799] flood. And that was one of the things
[3514.96] and we'll circle back to I mean we'll be
[3516.559] getting into that when we start
[3517.839] exploring all of the new uh video
[3520.24] footage and and images and drone footage
[3522.64] and the new LAR maps of this whole
[3524.559] region. Uh things that I obviously
[3526.96] didn't have access to a couple of
[3529.119] decades ago my first time I was
[3531.68] exploring this landscape. But anyways,
[3534.319] what I'd like to do is go on here with
[3537.0] um uh let's see. I'll stop share here
[3542.0] and then we'll go on with
[3545.16] um with that quote by by David Alt
[3548.24] because the it has some very interesting
[3552.4] implications to it and let me go back.
[3555.92] Let's see. Here we go. So,
[3560.64] I'll pull that mic a little bit closer
[3562.24] again. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, he says the
[3564.319] climate became very wet and
[3566.44] warm. And this is uh you know in that
[3570.0] transition you know so uh so we had
[3573.839] these great let let's recap we had these
[3575.599] great volcanoes going off vigorously you
[3578.88] know this was all those big volcanoes of
[3580.72] the Pacific Northwest somewhere 20
[3583.76] between 17 and 20 million years ago
[3586.72] those eruptions stopped but then at the
[3590.0] same time you had this overwhelming as
[3593.28] he describes it here overwhelming flood
[3595.28] basalt lava flows
[3597.44] began to pour across a vast region of
[3600.079] the inland Pacific Northwest. Faults
[3603.28] began to break the former plains of
[3605.359] Nevada and Utah into the swarm of broad
[3608.48] valleys and jagged mountain ranges of
[3611.04] the basin and range. And that's what we
[3612.559] were just looking at. And the climate
[3614.88] became very wet and warm. Well, now
[3617.359] wouldn't it make sense if the climate
[3618.88] becomes wet and warm that you're going
[3620.48] to start having the formation of lakes?
[3622.64] That would just be natural. Right.
[3624.88] Right. And that's what we were talking
[3626.16] about earlier is that it seems like at
[3628.16] that point you could have had the
[3629.359] formation of a lake in the basin that
[3631.839] later became the huge Lake Bonavville.
[3634.64] But he says the climate became very wet
[3636.88] and warm. Was it a coincidence that all
[3640.4] those changes came at once? It seems far
[3643.599] more likely that they had a common
[3645.839] cause.
[3647.68] Had anyone been here about 17 million
[3650.559] years ago, they would surely have
[3653.359] thought that the course of tectonic and
[3656.88] volcanic events in our region was
[3659.599] settled and destined to continue so
[3663.48] indefinitely. Nothing foretold a radical
[3667.119] change. Then we believe an asteroid
[3671.76] struck near the southeastern corner of
[3674.04] Oregon and set the development of our
[3676.96] region on an entirely different
[3679.799] course which continues.
[3683.599] It was a random and utterly
[3685.68] unpredictable event.
[3688.96] Astronomers can measure with great
[3690.96] accuracy the speeds of the asteroids
[3693.119] they see and they have always estimated
[3696.319] they have ways of estimating their
[3698.68] sizes. Given the speed and size of an
[3701.96] asteroid it becomes possible to enter to
[3704.96] estimate its energy of
[3707.559] motion that leads to an estimate of how
[3710.799] big a crater it will
[3713.48] make if it should strike the earth. The
[3717.04] largest craters that exist as open holes
[3720.319] are the Manacquagan crater of northern
[3722.799] Quebec Quebec and the Popagai crater of
[3726.4] northern
[3727.48] Siberia. Both are about 60 miles across.
[3732.4] And that raises a question. Some of the
[3735.44] asteroids known to exist in orbits that
[3738.079] cross that of the Earth carry enough
[3741.359] energy to open a crater much more than
[3745.76] 60 miles
[3748.839] across. Where are those very large
[3751.599] impact sites? If no craters more than
[3754.88] about 60 miles across exist, then those
[3758.48] larger impact sites must have some other
[3761.92] form.
[3763.52] It seems very likely that they develop
[3766.96] into flood basaltt
[3769.72] provinces like the decken plateau of
[3772.76] India and the flood basalt province of
[3776.72] the Pacific
[3779.88] Northwest. That to me makes a lot of
[3782.88] sense.
[3784.76] Um, so when we go back
[3788.76] to the big picture that we were looking
[3791.359] at a little earlier,
[3793.92] uh, looking at that digital map. So look
[3797.359] at this area. Now take another look at
[3799.2] this
[3803.0] area. Back this area up 17 million years
[3806.88] ago and it's sitting here.
[3810.16] Now, if Donald Alton, David Alton,
[3813.2] Donald Heindman or Hindman are correct,
[3816.24] an asteroid struck here about 17 million
[3819.52] years ago, probably was a highly high
[3823.4] velocity, high density asteroid impact
[3826.96] coming in relatively perpendicular to
[3830.559] the Earth's
[3831.559] crust. now having the requisite
[3835.4] density, velocity, and angle to punch a
[3839.76] deep hole into the Earth's
[3841.88] crust. The result we'll call pressure
[3844.88] relief melting, and you have all this
[3847.64] upwelling. Now, over the next 10 million
[3850.4] years, the plate continues moving
[3852.96] because it's being pushed from the east,
[3854.88] right? So, it's moving and it shows the
[3858.799] motion. And you can trace the motion of
[3860.48] the plate by by backing up this area
[3864.079] right here and moving it back to
[3868.119] Yellowstone. And and it's still active.
[3870.64] It's still volatile. Mhm. Right. If if
[3874.4] Donald Alt is right, and I mean David
[3876.799] Alt is right, and I think he probably
[3878.92] is, we had a major impact event, and we
[3882.16] don't really see it, right? But when you
[3884.96] look at this area up here, Yeah. It
[3888.0] begins to make sense. There's it's
[3889.599] almost circular, isn't it?
[3892.64] It is, right? Yeah. And it's all
[3895.119] fractured and broken up uh with all of
[3898.24] these what are called feeder dikes. And
[3901.44] all of this magma that formed all of
[3904.799] this up here, all of this down here, all
[3907.76] of this down here, all of this basaltic
[3909.599] lava is all flowing out of this like
[3912.0] some great wound. And it's bleeding. And
[3915.2] the and the layers of basaltt that were
[3918.559] the first discharges are the thickest.
[3921.28] And then the basalt layers get
[3922.96] successively thinner as each pulse of
[3926.799] lava is flows out in a great flood
[3929.92] drowning the previous. And given that it
[3932.72] was a 10 million-year process, there
[3934.88] might have been many centuries or
[3936.4] millennia between successive outflows.
[3939.44] Maybe it's it requires a period of time
[3942.0] for the pressure to build up. It re it
[3945.68] reaches a threshold threshold. It
[3947.76] releases there's an outpouring of
[3949.52] basaltt.
[3951.96] So, one of the things that impressed me,
[3954.72] the second thing that impressed me a lot
[3956.72] about the Bonavville flood route is
[3960.039] that we talked
[3962.68] uh I think with uh was it you and I or
[3965.92] it was me and John Arthur I believe that
[3968.2] uh or maybe we haven't done it yet.
[3971.039] Maybe I just gave a private presentation
[3973.039] about the Teton Dam disaster. Yeah, we
[3976.079] talked about Teton Dam. Okay. All right.
[3978.72] Right. We talked about the Teton. Did we
[3980.72] talk about the the fear that was
[3983.76] gripping the engineers and things the
[3986.16] about the domino effect? Yep. And what
[3990.16] happened instead was that this
[3993.039] tremendous wall of water rushed out from
[3995.599] the from the broken dam. It swept down
[3998.72] through the canyon. And wait till you
[4000.559] see the imagery that we're bringing
[4002.88] back. Um why? Because here we have an
[4005.839] event that happened back in
[4007.799] 1976 and we can see all kinds of things
[4011.52] that have their
[4013.24] counterpart in these much much bigger
[4015.76] events. Even though when you're there
[4018.079] and you're at that site of that dam,
[4021.52] it's you realize yeah this was an
[4023.44] enormous enormous catastrophic flood but
[4027.839] it's minuscule for example compared to
[4030.319] the Bonavville flood. And the Bonavville
[4033.359] flood was only onetenth the the the
[4036.64] volume of some of the peak Missou
[4039.359] Missoula flood
[4040.68] discharges which were sometimes some of
[4042.88] those were 10 times greater. But here's
[4045.599] the thing that water gushes out right
[4049.359] while it's confined to a channel. It's
[4051.28] moving fast. But if you look at the
[4053.76] topography, you'll see that then the
[4055.44] channel opens up into this wide flat
[4058.119] basin when the Teton River rises in the
[4061.76] mountains and then it flows out onto the
[4064.079] Snake River plane. So while it's
[4066.559] confined to the canyon, it's moving
[4069.119] fast. Once it moves out onto the plane,
[4072.0] the water spreads out and it becomes a
[4074.559] sheet and it begins to lose its
[4076.92] velocity. With the loss of velocity
[4079.44] comes a loss in stream power.
[4082.48] If it's carrying sediment, it'll build a
[4084.48] fan delta at the point where the water
[4087.039] spreads out and slows down.
[4089.88] Right? So, this is how you can trace the
[4092.64] the the movement. Well, what happened?
[4095.28] What averted the disaster that had
[4097.839] engineers panicking ready ready to
[4100.56] evacuate the entire population? Yeah.
[4103.839] from American Falls Reservoir to the
[4106.159] Pacific
[4107.239] Ocean was the fear that each of the the
[4110.799] the flow coming out of this Teton
[4112.92] reservoir would hit the the the American
[4116.239] Falls reservoir, the dam at American
[4118.96] Falls was old, obsolete, needed
[4121.08] upgrading. It would almost certainly
[4123.199] fail. Then the the the water volume of
[4126.0] American Falls reservoir would be added
[4128.239] to that of the Teton reservoir. Now
[4131.52] you've got double the flow coming down
[4134.239] the next one. I think was it called the
[4135.679] Walcut Lake Walcut and there was a dam
[4138.52] there and then this is going to sweep
[4141.679] away that dam and you're just going to
[4143.279] have a succession of failures,
[4145.64] right? But that didn't
[4147.88] happen. Why didn't it happen? Well, the
[4151.12] water was seeping into the ground. Two
[4154.319] things. The water Yes. It turned out
[4156.64] that the basalt was porous enough that
[4159.52] by the time that flood surge reached
[4161.52] American Falls, it had been reduced to a
[4164.04] trickle. The second thing is is the
[4166.48] water flowing over let's say a a rough
[4170.359] terrain, it loses energy the whole way.
[4175.199] I mean, so that energy is dissipated
[4178.64] through the course of the flood. All you
[4180.239] got to take a five gallallon bucket,
[4182.08] fill it up with water, go tip it over,
[4185.12] and immediately there's a big gush of
[4187.279] water out of that five gallallon bucket,
[4189.839] and it spreads out. And as it's
[4191.92] spreading out, it's slowing down, and
[4193.92] it's it's losing stream power. It's
[4196.96] losing its ability to pick up material,
[4199.92] carry that material, transport that
[4201.679] material, and dump it somewhere, right?
[4204.0] It's losing all of that, right?
[4207.4] Well, so now you've got, if we go back
[4210.48] and we look at that map from the the
[4214.64] breakout point of Lake Bonavville up to,
[4218.32] let's say, uh, Shashonne Falls, do this.
[4222.48] Look up Shashon
[4224.52] Falls on your
[4228.8] uh, okay, got it.
[4232.96] go to, you know, put large-siz images
[4236.64] and then let's look at a few images of
[4238.88] Shashonne Falls because Shashonne Falls
[4240.719] is a relic of the Bonavville
[4245.96] flood. It was a recessional cataract
[4248.719] that was produced
[4251.88] by the the sheer power of this huge mass
[4257.199] of rapidly flowing
[4260.199] water. Look at the Oh, let's see. any
[4262.64] one of those. Uh oh, that's a the third
[4265.52] one. Well, yeah. Okay, we'll look at
[4267.6] several because you can get a context
[4269.44] here. All right, so this has been called
[4272.0] the Niagara of the West. It's a hell of
[4274.88] an impressive waterfall. Now, here's the
[4278.0] thing. You see that but up on the
[4281.64] skyline? Yeah. If you go to the top, go
[4285.28] to the top of that but the surface of
[4286.96] the vat but that was the pre Bonavville
[4290.159] flood land surface
[4292.679] there everything below that line has
[4295.28] been removed through the passage of the
[4298.159] Bonavville flood. Oh wow.
[4301.56] Yeah. Oh wow is right. And wait till you
[4304.08] see you're standing there in
[4306.52] person in that environment and seeing
[4309.199] that.
[4311.84] Yeah, let's go to that panoramic view.
[4314.48] It's the same view there. Same view.
[4316.64] Same but now the entire scene in that
[4320.56] view from left to right was well look
[4324.719] you can see look up on the right you see
[4326.8] another but that's the counterpart.
[4330.08] See those have the same elevation at the
[4332.08] top and that was the original land
[4334.88] surface. Everything you see here was
[4337.76] submerged under this gigantic rapidly
[4341.6] rushing along flow of
[4345.88] water. Now, here's here's my question.
[4349.92] As I'm there for the second time looking
[4352.88] at all this and taking it all in and
[4354.8] looking at the LAR and the topography of
[4356.96] it, I realized, wait a
[4359.88] second, this is at least as much, if not
[4363.8] more
[4365.64] water than is measured at the breakout
[4368.32] point several hundred miles east of
[4371.32] here.
[4372.92] Well, here's what we know about water
[4375.199] flow. It should be dissipating energy.
[4379.76] It doesn't appear to be dissipating
[4381.44] energy. It appears to be increasing in
[4383.84] both energy and
[4387.08] volume because remember think about what
[4390.48] happened to the the Teton flood surge.
[4394.48] It's moving across the landscape and
[4396.719] there's a whole number of every as it's
[4398.88] moving over the landscape between the
[4400.719] the the water land
[4403.4] interface there's energy being
[4406.199] lost right initially you have the
[4408.88] potential energy let's say of just the
[4410.719] lake sitting there static as soon as the
[4413.52] dam breaks that potential turns into
[4416.0] kinetic energy but that kinetic energy
[4419.6] is constantly being reduced through the
[4422.96] passage. This is what happens while you
[4424.48] have your typical flood hydrograph will
[4427.199] have a very steep rising limb and then a
[4430.96] long tapered
[4433.199] uh ter terminal limb uh falling limb if
[4437.04] you will. Why? If you have a breakout
[4439.6] like a dam breakout could be art, it
[4442.4] could be Teton Dam, it could be St.
[4444.4] Francis Dam, it could be any number of
[4446.239] the the dams that have failed that we
[4448.56] know. It could be a natural like an
[4451.48] outburst, a glacier failing uh which we
[4454.96] have many examples of uh particularly in
[4458.239] places like Iceland and Alaska and the
[4460.64] Himalayas and any mountainous regions
[4463.76] right okay so now you've got this
[4466.76] outburst so initially there's a big
[4469.84] rapid powerful surge of water well that
[4474.159] water then begins to lose energy and it
[4477.04] begins to slow down the velocity
[4479.84] diminishes unless unless of course you
[4481.76] change if you change the gradient that
[4483.44] changes the equation. Right? But what
[4486.239] you're going to see for example with the
[4489.6] uh flow of the snake is you've got a
[4491.8] gentle slowly declining gradient from
[4494.96] east to west. Right?
[4497.719] However, you're still going to have a
[4500.0] lot of energy loss between the point of
[4503.96] breakout and the landscape we were just
[4507.199] looking at at Shonne Falls. Now, I
[4510.8] haven't done this. I would like to go
[4513.12] back and maybe even partner with
[4514.64] somebody on this and look at the physics
[4516.4] of the water flow here, the hydrophysics
[4519.04] of it, because of this. there would be
[4521.44] no doubt there's going to be an enormous
[4523.6] amount of energy lost in that passage
[4528.239] between the two points.
[4530.52] Um so that by the time you get my point
[4533.84] the point I'm trying to make is by the
[4535.28] time you get to show falls it should be
[4537.92] a very much
[4539.56] reduced volume of
[4542.04] flow. Yet what we see there actually
[4545.12] looks like it's greater than the volume
[4547.76] of water that would have been measured
[4550.4] at the breakout point. Well, what does
[4553.04] that lead us? It leads us to the idea,
[4554.56] well, could have the the flow from the
[4557.84] Bonavville flow been augmented by
[4560.64] additional sources of flood water. And I
[4563.36] think the answer is it seems very
[4566.199] likely. Okay. So, I hope all this is
[4570.32] making sense. It does. Yeah. I mean, we
[4571.84] we've looked
[4573.32] at Missoula and the flood area there and
[4577.36] the convergence of them in previous
[4579.679] episodes as well. So, this is kind of
[4581.84] piecing together.
[4584.239] Yes. And and it's good. I know we're
[4586.56] covering some of the same ground we've
[4588.239] covered before, but you know, it's
[4590.719] really maybe it's a fantasy of mine that
[4592.56] some of the people watching this are
[4594.08] really wanting to understand it. Yeah.
[4596.32] And not just I don't think it is a
[4597.84] fantasy. I'm It's very helpful to recap
[4601.12] and look at look at these terms and look
[4603.6] at the effects over and over again from
[4606.8] different perspectives. Exactly. That I
[4608.88] mean that's how you
[4610.28] learn that you have to have some uh
[4613.76] repetition. That's a part of the
[4615.44] learning process. It's not the whole
[4617.44] part of it obviously, but it's a big
[4619.679] part of it. And if you really want to
[4621.44] get to the bottom of something, yeah,
[4623.12] you need to do that. Um let's see. I
[4626.08] think I'm going to try something here.
[4627.84] Uh, I'd like to see Do you have Google
[4630.719] Maps available? I do. Yeah, I got it
[4632.8] open right now. Oh, cool. Open it up and
[4634.88] let's let's look at this region and then
[4636.96] and then we're going to move on to other
[4638.56] parts of of North
[4641.239] America because again All right. So, I
[4646.239] guess I see you got Bruno Canyon. Let's
[4648.4] zoom out a bit there. Okay.
[4653.44] So, we can get the big picture. Okay.
[4655.76] Let's see. We're we're we're Oops. We're
[4658.32] way down too far south. Go. Yeah. Okay.
[4661.44] Go up to the north of Great Salt Lake.
[4665.44] All right. So, there you got the Snake
[4667.12] River plane.
[4669.64] Um let's see. Zoom in and let's locate
[4673.36] Shashonne
[4677.8] Falls. Pan pan
[4681.08] south. Pan. Yeah. Okay. So, Okay. You
[4685.199] see Twin Falls? That's where Shashonne
[4687.52] Falls is near Twin Falls. Sure it is.
[4689.76] Now, if you right click, let's see. I
[4691.6] believe you for right click. Yeah, there
[4693.199] we go. Yeah. Yeah. Right there. You see
[4694.96] the that erosional complex there of how
[4698.88] comp how Yeah, there's a lot going on
[4701.52] there. And right there. Yeah. Shonne
[4703.52] Falls is just above your cursor. You see
[4706.32] where it says shown right there? There's
[4707.92] your um
[4710.4] Yeah, pretty impressive stuff. So,
[4720.6] uh, pretty amazing. Yeah. So, that's
[4723.679] where I was a couple of weeks ago. Yeah.
[4725.84] There's the falls right there.
[4730.239] So, that but has to be.
[4733.679] We probably go into Google Earth to see
[4736.08] the be. Ah, there it is. Yeah. Okay.
[4742.96] It's amazing. That was a very well-built
[4745.679] parking lot apparently because it came
[4747.679] through. I mean, look at how unscathed
[4750.8] it
[4752.679] is. It pretty impressive. Okay. So, the
[4756.8] parking lot. Yeah. You see the parking
[4759.6] lot barely got affected by the flood.
[4762.4] Oh, yeah. Look at that. And he would get
[4764.719] touched.
[4767.52] So, yeah. my my my tip of hat to the to
[4770.32] the engineers and
[4772.04] and road crew that built that parking
[4774.64] lot. But yeah, there look at there you
[4776.48] see that but up on the up on the
[4779.159] uh uh up on the horizon there. So this
[4783.679] is right here in the area of there's
[4787.12] there's Shonne Falls. Let's see if I
[4792.04] can There we
[4794.679] go. So the falls is right here. Yeah,
[4798.08] you can see the confined canyon, but
[4800.64] then you look up here and you see this
[4804.04] tributary. You see, look what what we
[4806.239] got here. What's going on here? And
[4809.199] notice this. If we scan out, look here.
[4812.159] We can see the pathway very obviously of
[4815.92] the overland flow. You see this brown
[4819.679] area? Yeah, it's brown because there's
[4821.76] no top soil. It's been washed away. So,
[4824.159] where there's top soil, there's
[4825.6] agriculture. So what you can see here is
[4828.239] that there was a flow coming from up
[4830.36] here, right? Flowing down and then it
[4834.239] meets it flows back to the Snake River
[4837.52] right here. And if we if we zoom in,
[4840.96] let's see, we can probably see several
[4843.28] areas here where we've talked about this
[4846.719] where the overland sheet flood becomes
[4850.48] confined. It becomes focused. It becomes
[4854.6] channelized. Right? So what we see here
[4857.12] is where it's it's starting to become
[4859.32] channelized. And so when you have all of
[4861.44] this when it's in the form of a sheet
[4864.4] that flow is is not concentrated. It's
[4868.6] diffused. But once it becomes
[4870.64] channelized, remember you've got a
[4871.92] what's going on here is like a
[4873.12] conservation of energy
[4875.719] problem. Whatever the energy of that is
[4878.56] when it's flowing over miles of
[4880.36] landscape, it's going to be basically
[4882.48] the same when it becomes channelized.
[4884.4] But now that much energy is focused on a
[4886.96] single limited zone of the of the land.
[4891.36] Right? So now what happens is it
[4893.76] naturally becomes much more erosive. And
[4896.32] so what do we see here? Look at this.
[4897.84] Here's your
[4899.159] cataract. So this is a receding cataract
[4903.36] and it's a fossil feature. At whatever
[4906.239] point the source of the floodwaters
[4909.48] terminated and wherever it was in its
[4912.639] stages of erosion, once the floodwaters
[4916.12] stopped, that cataract was now frozen in
[4919.32] time. You see what I mean? Yes. And
[4922.56] nothing since this catastrophic flood
[4926.4] has altered this landscape other than
[4928.8] just
[4930.04] minimally. However, the whole landscape
[4932.56] in itself was created probably in a
[4934.88] matter of a few weeks. So, when we're
[4937.199] looking there at the falls and we're
[4939.28] looking up at those but up on the top,
[4942.239] well, pre flood, there was undoubtedly,
[4944.48] I think, a pre flood snake river in a in
[4947.6] a valley that would have
[4950.28] been way way shallower than the canyon
[4955.04] produced in the aftermath of the passage
[4957.76] of the great Bonavville flood. And look
[4960.239] at up here. You see this area? Let's
[4961.92] zoom in here. You can see these cliffs
[4964.48] where the water's becoming channelized
[4966.48] and starting to cut a ca new canyon
[4968.56] here. Right? Same thing over
[4971.8] here. Look at this. You see
[4976.12] this? So
[4978.199] now hopefully people are beginning to
[4980.719] get a sense of this this whole process
[4985.199] and the sheer power of this and what
[4988.96] we're going to be looking at and
[4990.159] exploring as we go through this series
[4992.32] of episodes is we're looking at a region
[4996.159] here. We're like if we're talking about
[4997.84] Shonf we're looking at a local
[4999.76] manifestation of this. What people need
[5002.639] to understand though, thinking back to
[5005.04] that box, right? Well, one of the big
[5007.679] holes in the box is the fact that you
[5010.159] had this flood meeting the Missoula
[5012.56] flood right there at
[5014.6] Lewon, right?
[5017.719] So, how do we explain that? Well, at at
[5021.04] the current explanation, there's no
[5022.96] attempt to really correlate. They're
[5024.56] they're unrelated to each other, right?
[5029.679] Is that the case? Well, yeah. I mean,
[5032.0] they don't assume that there is a
[5034.56] connection between the two and therefore
[5037.84] a common cause is not even considered.
[5041.04] Falls outside the box. Falls outside the
[5044.44] box. But yeah, this is
[5047.239] uh this is look man I mean look at
[5051.56] this. This in order to create this you
[5054.32] had to have some extraordinary powerful
[5057.679] turbulence. And how far away is this in
[5060.639] distance from the breaking point where
[5064.639] it broke down? We we can figure that
[5066.4] out. We can do that. Let me let me uh
[5069.199] get back here. Get this back to the
[5072.76] north. We can zoom out. There's Shonne
[5075.76] Falls. Let's start by going to distance
[5077.52] from Shashon Falls to
[5081.719] Pocutello. Let's see. And zoom out here.
[5084.48] Where's Pocutello? Okay. Okay. So,
[5086.4] here's here's
[5089.56] Pocutello is here. There's American
[5092.8] Falls. So, I'm going to take my let's
[5096.32] see which one here I want to Let's see.
[5099.36] Maybe I
[5101.159] can Where is my measuring tool? There it
[5105.04] is. I think that's
[5106.92] it. Show ruler. Okay. So we're going to
[5110.56] create a pathway from Shashon Falls
[5114.52] here to Pocutello as the bird
[5118.52] flies is
[5121.04] uh I should change it here. I can
[5122.96] quickly do a calculation. It's in feet
[5125.199] right now. Uh I should put it into
[5127.679] miles. Let's see. Pounds or uh feet.
[5130.88] Let's let's let's change the change this
[5134.159] to miles. Okay. So up to Pocutello as
[5138.56] the bird flies basically 100 miles but
[5142.239] by river we're probably looking at 25 or
[5144.719] 30% more because it's obviously not
[5147.12] flowing. So we gotund say say 130 miles.
[5151.28] Now, let me X that. And then we'll go
[5153.92] from Pocutello
[5158.56] uh mile. Just
[5160.92] Pocutello down to Red Rocks
[5165.239] Pass, which
[5167.719] is right about in
[5171.159] here. And that adds about another 40
[5174.32] miles by river. Probably 50 because
[5177.12] Yeah. I mean, it goes down here and then
[5179.12] it dog legs over. So, we're let's say
[5182.8] conservatively 50 miles. And what was
[5184.96] the other number? Uh 150.
[5189.199] 150. So, yeah. So, let's say it's a
[5190.88] route 200 miles.
[5194.159] My point is that how much energy is
[5196.159] going to be lost in 200 miles? It should
[5198.56] be significant.
[5200.4] Yeah. I mean, I think if you just wanted
[5203.36] to say roughly the ballpark, one would
[5205.84] think that at least half the volume of
[5209.52] the water would have dissipated or at
[5211.76] least the energy momentum of that water
[5215.12] would have dissipated at least somewhat.
[5217.44] I mean, how much is going to be absorbed
[5219.28] into the basalt
[5221.159] itself? Look, if we go, let's do this.
[5224.639] I'm going to take this off.
[5228.56] go up here and I'm gonna put in uh into
[5232.4] the search
[5236.96] uh Teton
[5243.96] Dam.
[5247.32] Okay, here we go.
[5256.48] So, there's the remnant of the Teton
[5259.88] Dam.
[5262.52] Whoops. Now, at one point, let
[5267.48] me I need a better a better way of
[5271.84] navigating than my mouse wheel here, but
[5274.32] but that'll do the job. So, there's the
[5275.92] remnant of the dam, right? And you can
[5278.32] see it's there's a canyon that was going
[5280.239] to hold the reservoir. the re the canyon
[5283.36] at the if the had been allowed if the
[5286.719] dam hadn't failed and the reservoir had
[5289.12] been uh filled to full pool it would
[5292.0] have reached 17 miles up the canyon but
[5295.199] one of the things you can see here is
[5297.52] that as here's where the dam is as
[5299.679] you're coming downstream notice that the
[5302.48] depth of the canyon is
[5304.28] diminishing and then look what happens
[5307.719] here so and and look here here you can
[5310.639] see still effects of the water flow.
[5314.4] Look, it dumped sand as it came down
[5316.8] here. The And you see why is it dumping
[5318.8] sand? Well, it's because as the water is
[5321.52] being released from the constriction of
[5323.92] the canyon, it's spreading out. So, this
[5327.36] is like the reverse process of
[5330.199] channelization. The water's in a
[5332.159] channel. It's confined to the channel,
[5334.48] but as soon as it breaks free of that
[5336.639] channel, it starts spreading out, losing
[5338.8] velocity. as it loses a velocity, it
[5341.36] loses stream power. And then you can see
[5343.6] that down here it's it's dumping sand.
[5348.96] Because now the water has not have
[5352.0] enough power to even carry the sand, you
[5356.4] see? Yep.
[5359.6] And then the river flows down and let's
[5361.92] see where does it meet. Let's see where
[5364.96] does it I haven't really studied this
[5366.719] too much so I don't know where is the
[5370.56] confluence of the
[5373.56] Teton and the
[5376.12] snake let's see
[5382.56] that's Henry's fork Henry's fork okay
[5386.96] St. Anthony
[5389.239] so somewhere down in here the Teton
[5394.48] flows into the snake. It's not it's not
[5397.28] critical for our discussion now, but
[5401.56] um I am let's
[5405.08] see let's get back oriented north.
[5410.199] Um, yeah. And you can see that if I come
[5412.8] in
[5414.44] here, if you drive along Interstate 15,
[5418.56] Interstate 15 is following the
[5421.639] outburst of the Bonavville flood which
[5425.719] occurred right let's
[5428.52] see. Yeah, here. Here is where the
[5432.159] breakout point right in here. Uh, we can
[5436.08] actually see the remnants of the big fan
[5440.88] delta that spled out across the valley
[5443.199] right
[5444.199] here. See this stuff? Mhm. A lot of that
[5447.76] came from the carving of this channel
[5450.679] here
[5453.239] and off the uplands here. So, you've got
[5456.76] this right here. You can see that. So
[5461.36] before the breakout, this white spot
[5464.159] would have been roughly the top of the
[5468.639] the aluvial delta that's right in here.
[5472.0] So draw a line from here up to here and
[5476.32] that would have been continuous
[5477.84] basically,
[5479.44] right? The top of this coincides pretty
[5483.36] damn closely with the highest shoreline
[5485.199] of Lake
[5486.36] Bonavville called the Bonavville
[5488.28] shoreline. And when the outburst
[5490.96] occurred, all of this intervening
[5492.719] material here is washed away. This this
[5496.159] but right here is what's left of that
[5499.6] aluvial dam that filled this whole
[5501.84] valley here. See before the breakout.
[5504.8] Okay. So then right now I think if I
[5507.84] recall there's like 20 to 30 ft of
[5511.32] sediment laid on top of the bedrock in
[5514.159] the pass here. The bedrock gives us the
[5517.679] Provo shoreline. So if you can picture
[5520.0] this, look at my hands. It breaks out.
[5524.0] It cuts through 350 ft. This thing here
[5527.679] is about 350 ft high. This is the
[5530.56] thickness of the material, the aluvial
[5532.8] material.
[5534.719] the the water bursts out and it cuts it
[5537.199] and and at this level there's a
[5539.0] shoreline. You can see that shoreline on
[5541.28] the uh western flanks of the Wasach
[5543.52] Mountains very clearly. And we got some
[5545.6] great new footage and images of those
[5547.88] shorelines. It drops 350 ft and then
[5551.88] stabilizes at this bedrock sill. And now
[5556.0] a second shoreline is produced there and
[5558.239] that's called the Progo shoreline. And
[5560.4] you can see the two shorelines very
[5562.239] prominently etched into the sides of the
[5564.52] mountains. And in the Bonavville basin,
[5567.679] the the Bonavville shoreline is over a
[5570.639] thousand ft
[5572.36] above Great Salt Lake.
[5575.92] Is this making sense? It is. Yeah. I
[5578.0] have a question about a fan delta. Yeah.
[5580.56] Um because you've used the term a couple
[5582.32] times and I thought I was understanding.
[5584.719] What is the difference between an
[5585.92] aluvial fan and a fan delta? Well, a fan
[5588.8] an aluvial fan just means it was put
[5590.639] there by water. Uhhuh. A fan delta means
[5593.76] it was deposited underwater. So, let's
[5596.719] say you've got a lake. Oh, that makes
[5598.159] sense. And the water is flowing in and
[5600.719] it's carrying sediment and as it as it
[5604.08] flows into the lake, it Yes. is fanning.
[5607.199] Okay. Right. That makes sense. Well, if
[5609.04] you're talking about an aluvial delta,
[5611.44] it could be just it doesn't have to be
[5614.159] underwater necessarily. An aluvial fan.
[5616.96] Luvio fan. Yeah, sorry. The delta seems
[5619.52] to imply that it is underwater into
[5621.6] water. Yes. Okay, that makes sense.
[5625.12] That's clarifying. Good. I mean, this is
[5627.52] this is our objective, uh, Beckett, is
[5630.4] that this all makes sense to you. Yeah.
[5633.36] No, it is. And it's starting to make
[5635.12] more and more I mean, it is making
[5636.8] sense. some of the terms uh it's
[5638.96] important for clarification there but I
[5641.44] mean what we're looking at there is
[5643.36] essenti if I'm understanding it
[5645.44] correctly then we're seeing the evidence
[5648.239] of where the Bonavville flood broke out
[5651.12] and then we were tracing it all the way
[5653.28] to Shashonne Falls where it should have
[5656.08] by that point had less velocity and not
[5659.92] had as much less power less power not
[5663.36] had as much ability to tear up the
[5665.84] terrain but It seems like it had a lot
[5668.239] more power at that point, right? And
[5671.28] we're looking at the evidence of that
[5672.96] and kind of connecting pieces of the big
[5676.159] picture. What we looked at is uh in
[5679.52] previous episodes was where
[5682.76] uh the Missoula flood, the the Missoula
[5686.56] flood met with the Bonavville flood. And
[5688.88] that's at um Tam Bar. Tam Bar. Yeah.
[5693.679] Exactly. Yeah.
[5696.92] So there's a lot of unanswered questions
[5699.679] now. So we've got we've been talking
[5701.44] about the Missoula, of course. I mean,
[5702.96] there's a whole lot more we could be
[5704.32] looking at there, and at some point
[5706.239] we're going to come back to that. The
[5708.639] reason is is the Missoula floods
[5711.28] represent some of the most
[5714.199] spectacular mega flood sculpted
[5716.8] landscapes on Earth.
[5720.679] Now, what I came away with the
[5722.88] impression from the Bonavville is I'm
[5725.28] looking at that landscape by Shashon
[5727.199] Falls and I'm thinking this isn't that
[5729.92] much less than some of the incredible
[5733.04] erosional landscapes I've seen as a
[5735.36] result of the Missoula floods. So, I
[5738.0] mean, this looks to me like it should be
[5740.32] more water than the breakout point 200
[5744.239] miles east of here.
[5747.36] So, I mean, I've got some study to do.
[5749.36] I'm not claiming to have answers or
[5750.88] figured out. I I I have questions more
[5753.04] than I have answers, for sure.
[5756.76] Um, but
[5759.0] then we start looking
[5761.48] beyond the effects of these two floods
[5764.48] and what do we find is we find floods um
[5768.56] evidence of mega floods all over the
[5771.12] damn place.
[5773.12] Yeah, we talked about I don't know if
[5774.96] this is a good time to to bring the
[5778.0] Shannondoa up, but I was much I think at
[5781.92] the same time that you were in
[5783.199] Bonavville, I was driving through the
[5784.8] Shannondoa River Valley
[5787.8] and it essentially the Shannondoa River
[5791.36] flows in between uh the Blue Ridge
[5794.4] Mountain and then the Alagany Mountains
[5798.12] and it flows right in this massive what
[5802.239] seems this massive
[5805.04] um channel in between them with very
[5808.8] similar peaks on both sides of it which
[5811.119] could be okay
[5812.92] so just as I predicted now you know when
[5816.96] you brought this up to me the other day
[5818.88] I hadn't really I've looked at a couple
[5821.92] of dozen rivers I had not looked at the
[5823.76] Shannondoa and I'm looking at it right
[5825.6] now we'll take a
[5827.48] look we got all the signs of an underfit
[5830.32] river Yeah,
[5832.639] we've got the modern river which is
[5834.88] small relative to the larger channel.
[5837.84] We've got an
[5839.96] aluvial bottom to the channel. This is
[5842.56] all undoubtedly flood stuff. Let's see
[5845.199] if we as we look through
[5847.4] here. Oh yeah. I mean, look at this.
[5849.679] We've got terraces. You know, the modern
[5853.44] flood planes of a lot of rivers are
[5856.239] relics of the ancient water flows. But
[5859.04] let's see. Yeah, look at Look at Yeah.
[5861.6] Look at the here. I mean, here's your
[5864.08] here was There was once a flow of water
[5866.4] in here. This was one bank and this was
[5869.28] the
[5872.119] other. So, absolutely. Look at
[5875.32] this. No question.
[5878.239] And for everybody who doesn't know where
[5879.84] the Shannondoa River is, you want to
[5881.84] zoom out, Randall, and show where this
[5885.04] is?
[5888.48] Well, it sits right on the edge of the
[5890.0] valley and ridge province. We are in
[5892.159] Yeah. the complete other side of the
[5894.96] United States of America. Oh, yeah.
[5898.96] This is in Virginia.
[5903.4] Yeah. Yeah. And there's there's Jim's
[5906.08] Country Store that survived. It
[5909.199] survived. Yep.
[5914.8] So, this is an example. You see it? I
[5916.639] mean, I think it's a good testament to
[5918.239] your teaching and what you've been
[5920.159] saying is we want people to be able to
[5922.639] identify these things just driving
[5926.6] through. Beautiful drive first of all.
[5929.199] It's a beautiful route to drive. Just
[5931.44] driving through
[5933.6] this
[5934.92] valley. I'm curious and I'm sitting
[5937.76] there pulling over on the side of the
[5939.199] road. It's like a 5h hour drive that
[5940.88] Dora and I were on. And I'm looking up
[5943.679] and I'm looking at them. I'm looking at
[5945.6] Google Maps and just trying to find
[5947.199] evidence of this because as you're
[5949.04] driving, you can see these two peaks
[5951.04] beside you and this road that we're in.
[5953.76] And uh at at some points and sure
[5956.8] enough, there's evidence everywhere. Oh,
[5960.719] yeah. I mean, once you begin to see it,
[5963.76] you can't unsee it. And then you begin
[5965.52] to
[5966.679] realize it's
[5968.52] everywhere. It's everywhere. If we go
[5970.56] back, let's see, where was I just seeing
[5972.159] that?
[5973.4] uh some of these areas in here.
[5978.679] Uh there was one place particularly
[5981.199] where you could see the
[5984.76] uh you could see the almost scab
[5988.159] landlike features. Yeah. But of course
[5990.48] the thing is is that in Virginia a lot
[5993.36] of that you're not it's not going to be
[5995.04] as obvious,
[5997.36] right?
[5999.0] because you've got forests, you've got
[6002.48] fields, you've got all kinds of stuff
[6004.76] that it's a different post flood
[6008.639] environment,
[6010.639] which makes it much harder to recognize.
[6013.52] You start to get some very interesting
[6015.679] structures as well in the in the cave
[6019.04] systems. Like there's Oh, yeah. major
[6021.44] cave systems um all along this route.
[6026.4] So, look at this. A quarry. Now, see
[6029.199] what'll be happening now in the future.
[6031.36] You're going to be driving through there
[6032.56] and you're going to be going, "Darra,
[6034.239] oh, there's a rock. There's a quarry
[6035.84] just
[6036.679] ahead. We got to stop and check it out."
[6040.239] Why? Because this tells stories. You go
[6043.28] into these quaries and I, you know, I've
[6045.28] been in a dozen of them now. You go in
[6047.119] and you talk to the most of the time
[6049.04] they're happy if they're not in the
[6050.4] middle of something to take you out. You
[6052.48] know, you might have to wear a hard hat.
[6054.239] you go out and and you can begin to see
[6056.96] stuff. And you know, that's the next
[6059.04] step of this kind of a educational
[6061.92] process is learning now how to decipher
[6064.159] and read these deposits because often
[6067.92] times see what happens is you know those
[6069.679] deposits have been transported. They've
[6072.239] been transported a mile, 10 miles, 100
[6074.56] miles. You don't really know. But what
[6076.56] you do is you got to you look at the
[6078.199] deposits and then you look at the
[6081.159] regional bedrock lithology.
[6084.239] And that gives you the provenence. So
[6086.4] the lethology is the type of rock and
[6089.44] the provenence is where the rock came
[6092.6] from. So if you've got a rock there that
[6095.199] came from such and such a river such and
[6097.52] such distance away, well now you know
[6100.0] that the flood came through there, don't
[6101.84] you? Mhm. Because the flood is picking
[6104.159] up stuff locally which could vary from
[6107.36] place to place. It's transporting it
[6110.4] along and then it's dumping. So you can
[6112.32] say, "Oh, well this rock type of rock
[6114.32] exists, this bedrock exists. This
[6117.119] particular type of limestone rock that
[6119.119] we see here exists a 100 miles to the
[6121.84] east up in this particular river valley.
[6125.04] So the flood came through that valley
[6127.6] and it picked up that rock and carried
[6130.48] it down somewhere and then dumped it
[6133.56] downstream. And so when you go to a
[6135.76] quarry like
[6137.56] this, this is looks like a pretty major
[6140.0] rock quarry." So again, the very
[6142.08] presence of a quarry means that this is
[6144.719] probably a gigantic grally delta right
[6147.92] here. H
[6151.28] I mean look at
[6152.679] this. So it looks like you probably had
[6155.119] tributary flows coming in through this
[6158.8] area. Look at this right here. Doesn't
[6161.76] that look like a recessional cataract?
[6164.239] It does. It sure does. So you probably
[6166.88] had a major flow. There's no real river
[6169.28] flowing in here now, but at one time
[6171.199] there was a flow through this trough
[6173.36] right here. It channelized and began
[6175.76] cutting this long linear canyon here. It
[6179.76] was a receding cataract. And then when
[6181.6] the flows stop, that cataract is frozen
[6185.04] in place where it's basically been for
[6188.08] 12 to 15,000 years or whatever. Whenever
[6191.44] the uh the great flows came through
[6194.0] here, Harper's Ferry, interesting place.
[6197.96] Um, you've got a breach right through
[6200.56] the mountains here. When you look at
[6202.32] this whole valley and ridge province is
[6205.88] amazing.
[6209.32] Um, and you've got these
[6212.84] uh water gaps and wind gaps all
[6216.08] throughout here.
[6218.119] Uh, where the you'd think you've got
[6222.08] these ridges and you've got these
[6223.92] troughs. You would think that once a
[6226.56] river became
[6228.8] uh entrapped within a trough, it's going
[6232.4] to stay in that trough, right? But we
[6235.199] got places like, you know, right here.
[6238.32] Here's the gap. Let's find one where
[6240.6] uh uh while I'm doing this, why don't
[6243.6] you look up water
[6250.36] gap? a gap or pass in a mountain range
[6253.04] where a river or stream flows.
[6257.04] Do we have any? Uh yeah. Okay. I found a
[6259.679] good example of one. The PTOAC water gap
[6263.52] is one in the Shannondoa. Yeah. You got
[6266.48] a picture of it.
[6269.32] Yeah. Here's Harper's Ferry. Yeah. And
[6272.48] and what it's doing right there, right
[6274.32] where it says Harper's Ferry, the river
[6276.239] is just cutting through a mountain
[6279.04] range.
[6281.28] here or here? No. No. Go up where it's
[6285.199] Look at the H on Harper's. Uhhuh. Now
[6288.159] follow that up river to the west all
[6291.119] through there. See, it's cut that
[6292.719] channel across the mountains.
[6296.88] Oh, okay. I see. Now, now let's go to
[6300.56] some imagery. So, basically, you've got
[6303.76] that range and the water is flowing
[6306.8] through. Now, why is the water flowing
[6309.28] across what this upland area and not
[6312.719] just staying confined to the trough that
[6315.36] it's in? Well, the assumption is here's
[6318.56] here's the model. Uh there was an
[6321.52] uplift. You know, you had compression.
[6323.84] Look at my hands here. You have
[6325.28] compression east to west across that
[6327.679] valley and ridge province. So, what
[6329.92] happens? It causes Let's see. Maybe I
[6331.76] can do it with a
[6333.639] uh not I need something a little stiffer
[6336.48] than that.
[6337.92] Here, I'll just use
[6342.199] this. You have compression. What does
[6344.48] compression
[6346.6] do? Causes uplift. Right. Bulge. Now,
[6350.0] let's a bulge. Yeah. Let's say you've
[6352.08] got a river flowing over over the land
[6354.92] surface. Right now, there's it's let's
[6357.84] say the the river is flowing east to
[6360.639] west this way across the land surface.
[6363.159] Right now, I start creating a bulge. One
[6366.639] would think that as that bulge is
[6368.28] rising, the river would be deflected and
[6371.28] stay within the the
[6373.56] trough. So, I've got a trough on on on
[6376.48] this side and a trough on this side, but
[6381.04] for whatever reason, there've been this
[6383.8] compressional bulge uplift, but the
[6386.88] river cuts through it. Well, the
[6389.679] assumption is is that well uh then the
[6393.199] rate of uplift must have been almost
[6396.32] exactly the same as the rate of down
[6399.36] cutting the incision rate of the river.
[6402.48] So at the same rate that the that the
[6405.119] bulge is going up the river is because
[6408.08] remember now the river is flowing here.
[6410.4] So now the bulge starts but the the
[6413.199] ability of the river to cut down cut to
[6416.719] insize through that uplifting bulge is
[6420.08] essentially the same as the rate of the
[6422.679] uplift. And the ev the the because look
[6425.679] if the go if the uplift was too fast
[6428.88] well the river is not going to over time
[6431.44] it's not going to cut through it is it?
[6433.76] It's going to be diverted into whatever.
[6436.239] If you look at the valley and ridge,
[6439.04] you're going to see that you've got all
[6440.88] of these narrow channels, narrow troughs
[6443.76] separated. That's what it's called, the
[6445.679] valleys and a ridge. So, if you've got
[6448.639] an uplift in the creation of the ridge,
[6451.28] the river, it would seem like, should
[6453.76] then be confined to a valley. So it
[6456.719] would be it it seems like it should be
[6460.199] redirected so it runs parallel in the
[6463.28] trough beside the bulge, right? But it
[6466.96] doesn't. It cuts across the bulge. So
[6470.159] the assumption is is that the rate of
[6474.679] uplift does not exceed the rate of down
[6478.719] cutting of the river. Or even more
[6482.159] precise that they're pretty much the
[6484.4] same.
[6486.08] Right. Mhm.
[6489.04] Does that make sense? It does make
[6491.04] sense. The one thing that's unclear to
[6493.84] No, it does. It does make sense. The
[6495.6] thing that's unclear to me is if it is
[6499.239] bulging. So,
[6502.639] uh, it's bulging up like this. Mhm. Are
[6506.639] the
[6508.28] rivers, if it's bulging up like this,
[6511.119] wouldn't the rivers be running like this
[6513.199] to create that bulge? How would they
[6515.76] then like turn perpendicularly and cut?
[6518.48] I must be thinking about it incorrectly.
[6520.08] No, no, no, no. That's exactly No,
[6521.92] you're honing in on what the problem is.
[6523.76] See, now we have three scenarios. The
[6527.199] bulge is faster than the river. The
[6529.92] river is constantly eroding its its
[6533.76] channel down. Right now, if we have
[6537.04] start uplifting, if the uplifting is
[6539.96] faster than the river can cut down,
[6543.119] well, clearly the river is just going to
[6544.719] be diverted along a
[6547.159] valley. It's not going to flow up and
[6549.84] over the ridge.
[6552.719] If the river is cutting down faster than
[6556.0] the
[6557.08] uplift, well then the river is just
[6559.6] going to stay confined. So if the river
[6562.4] is down cutting faster than the
[6564.92] uplift, faster than the uplift. Well,
[6568.08] now we assume that the uplift is
[6569.84] happening and the river is able to cut
[6571.6] it
[6572.679] faster, right? So the river is going to
[6575.44] be cutting a deeper channel through that
[6579.36] ridge. Mhm. You have to think through
[6581.679] this process like how do you get see the
[6584.159] pro here's the basic problem. The river
[6587.119] is flowing in a valley. I mean we can
[6589.28] see this very clearly. I it shows up
[6591.76] very clearly if you go down to
[6593.88] Chattanooga. Okay. So take a look here
[6596.239] now. Look at you've got you've got the
[6599.679] uh Colombia the
[6602.28] uh the Cumberland Plateau here. Now look
[6605.92] at here. Here comes the Tennessee River
[6608.0] down here. Yeah. Well, you notice that
[6610.32] the valley just keeps going, doesn't it?
[6612.32] It does. You follow this valley right on
[6614.28] down, right? You cut down here to this
[6616.88] lake, but the river doesn't follow the
[6620.679] valley. It cuts right across the
[6623.119] plateau. It cuts across 2,000 ft of
[6626.32] higher elevation and then comes out on
[6628.719] the other side and then it gets caught
[6631.52] in this valley over here.
[6634.96] See that? So, now it's it's confined to
[6637.36] that valley. The problem is
[6641.8] this. Why does the water cut through
[6644.32] here and not just stay in this
[6647.159] valley? Well, the working assumption is
[6649.6] is that the uplift of the plateau is
[6651.679] occurring basically at the same rate as
[6655.119] the river is insizing its way into the
[6658.48] into the surface of the ground.
[6662.159] But still, that doesn't explain why it
[6664.159] doesn't follow the valley. Correct.
[6666.239] That's what I think as well.
[6669.28] Right. Right. Okay. Now, I'm going to
[6672.8] show you something. Uh I'm going to zoom
[6675.76] out here. Let's say I can I can zoom
[6677.52] out. Go out to the Missoula
[6680.76] flood. And I'm going to go to a place
[6684.0] called Devil's Canyon. Let's see where
[6686.639] we're at here.
[6691.159] Okay. You see this right here? Yes. Same
[6694.48] deal. Devil's camp. It crosses the
[6697.56] upland. So it's there. Here's a trough
[6700.08] and a
[6701.08] valley, right? And in fact, this is the
[6704.8] uh the valley of the Paloo River. Look
[6707.52] over here. If I pull over here and I
[6710.239] zoom
[6711.239] in, you got the Paloo River right now.
[6714.719] Clearly the Paloo River is very small
[6718.0] compared to this scoured out trough that
[6720.8] it's flowing in.
[6722.92] Well, right here 26 then to
[6727.88] 261 follows the path the original path
[6732.159] of the Paloo River. So the Paloo River
[6734.96] came down. It flowed through where Wakna
[6737.92] is now. Sperry Koose Estus Sulfur flowed
[6741.84] down
[6743.639] here right on down and somewhere right
[6747.36] in here it flowed into the Colombia. It
[6749.599] was a tributary to the Colombia. We
[6752.0] don't know exactly where. Why? Because
[6754.639] these gigantic floods that came down to
[6756.88] Colombia have
[6758.679] obscured the area of original confluence
[6762.159] of the Paloo and the Missoula. Mhm. But
[6764.719] when we go up here, go back up here
[6769.0] to this we see what does the Paloo do?
[6773.679] Comes in here and it doesn't follow its
[6775.52] original channel. It suddenly has been
[6778.159] diverted in this almost 90 degree turn
[6782.0] to the south and it now flows down and
[6785.84] enters the snake down
[6787.88] here. So we have two instances here
[6791.44] where the floor of the valley up here is
[6795.599] lower than the upland
[6798.199] ridge and which is considerably higher
[6801.76] than the valley of the snake. We go over
[6804.56] here to uh Devil's Canyon. Same thing
[6810.159] here. You're going from here, you're
[6811.679] going uphill to here, and then you're
[6814.88] going downhill to here. This is a ridge
[6817.04] in between. Now, look at Devil's Canyon.
[6819.599] Then look at this thing right
[6822.52] here. Well, you've seen many things like
[6825.04] this. Now, look, this is like a
[6826.96] recessional cataract right here. So you
[6829.76] had water flowing over this huge volumes
[6833.199] of catastrophic water. So much water
[6835.92] that it back flooded all the way down
[6840.679] here to Lewon, Idaho right
[6845.719] here. Back flooded all the way. This is
[6849.199] a huge fan right here. Look at this
[6852.639] whole thing right here that Clarkson is
[6855.04] built on. Then you get down here and
[6857.44] here's where your Tamony bar is. Here's
[6859.599] where Tam Creek is. And we can go up in
[6861.76] Tam Creek. I've done this and you can
[6864.0] find the back flood slack water silts
[6867.679] dumped up here in this in the uh uh
[6872.56] we've looked at some pretty good
[6873.679] pictures of that. Yes, we did. And so we
[6876.639] know that that we know where that silt
[6878.56] came from, right? So
[6881.88] the the cutting the water gaps are so
[6887.28] okay. So let's put this then into
[6889.679] perspective where we're going with this.
[6891.199] Where am I here? Uh Lewon, let's get
[6894.48] back to where we were
[6896.44] at. Where were we here? We're talking
[6899.36] about Devil's Gap. Yeah, here we are.
[6901.679] Okay. Devil's Canyon. Yeah. Okay. So
[6904.32] what we have here is we have a down
[6906.8] cutting right through like it's been
[6908.96] sliced right through this up up higher
[6912.0] land surface. Well, this didn't happen
[6914.639] because there was a river here and this
[6917.04] particular piece of land rose at exactly
[6920.0] the same rate that the river was down
[6922.96] cutting. No, this was cut because you
[6925.84] had this gigantic flow of water that
[6929.08] overwhelmed the pre flood watershed
[6932.4] divide which was this upland area here.
[6934.8] So you had a you had a a a two watershed
[6937.679] divides here. You had the Paloo River
[6939.36] coming here, you had the Snake River
[6941.04] coming here. They're separated by this
[6943.04] ridge. In fact, we could even uh you
[6945.76] know, we could go to Google Earth and
[6948.56] find out exactly what that change in
[6950.639] elevation is.
[6953.639] Um, and I might just do that just for
[6958.4] just for a a good laugh. So, the
[6961.679] direction of the
[6963.88] flow was the direction of the flow and
[6966.639] the power that it's moving at
[6968.679] essentially it took less
[6972.119] energy to cut through the mountain and
[6976.56] create that canyon than it would to
[6978.639] divert it.
[6980.159] Well, what happened was you had so much
[6982.28] water coming from the north. Let's go to
[6984.719] let's go to the here. You can see the
[6987.36] pathway of the water flow right here.
[6989.76] And look at it. It's coming down. You
[6991.44] see this dark area? That's where all of
[6993.76] the lust top soil has been washed away.
[6996.88] And we're basically down to bedrock
[6998.88] right here. You can see it comes down.
[7001.96] And here's here's this diversion right
[7005.56] here. Right. Well, this was entirely the
[7008.639] product of the flood. Well, for one
[7011.36] thing, what happened was if you look at
[7013.199] all of this, this is all thick layers of
[7015.28] alovvium. There was so much alovvium
[7018.56] dumped in the pre flood channel of the
[7021.76] Paloo River that once the huge water
[7024.56] flows were over, it created a dam, a
[7027.639] natural aluvial dam right here. And that
[7031.28] caused the water to divert. So this
[7034.48] diversion of the water here was the
[7036.4] result of two things. The
[7038.84] overflow cut this channel and it
[7041.44] probably is following a fracture, a
[7044.48] weakness in the bedrock. That's why it's
[7046.88] that's why it's so straight like that.
[7049.44] Right. And that's what water does. It's
[7051.199] always looking for the the least
[7053.119] resistance, the weakest point. Yes. And
[7055.84] that's would have been the same thing
[7057.76] that would have happened down here at
[7061.119] Devil's Canyon. So once it finds that
[7063.52] weakest point with uh the
[7067.8] overflow, there's too much water for it
[7070.48] to keep going in the direction that it's
[7072.56] going. So once it finds a it that weak
[7075.28] point, it's going to divert to that. And
[7078.08] that's some of the water. Yeah. Yeah. In
[7080.96] fact, most of the water here because
[7083.08] look, this is now the pathway. So the
[7086.719] Paloo River was completely diverted by
[7088.96] the after effects of the flood.
[7092.0] down here at Devil's Canyon, the
[7096.239] overflow of the water cut the canyon,
[7099.52] but because the Paloo River was
[7101.52] completely diverted to the east, there
[7104.239] was no water. There's no water flowing
[7106.159] through Devil's Canyon. So, what we have
[7109.4] here in a sense is a water gap because
[7112.8] the water is still flowing through the
[7114.56] gap. And here we have a wind gap because
[7117.679] only the wind is blowing through that
[7120.159] gap. today. But it was created by water.
[7123.199] But it was created by water. Now I would
[7126.88] argue that we should consider that the
[7129.679] water gaps and the wind gaps that we
[7131.599] find in the Valley Ridge Province were
[7133.52] produced by the same mechanism by the
[7135.92] ridges being overtopped by gigantic
[7138.88] flood water flows. Those flows then
[7141.44] cutting the channels down. And then once
[7144.159] the floods were were dissipated and
[7146.639] over, the modern rivers are following.
[7149.679] And in the case of there by Chattanooga,
[7151.84] that overflow cut that winding incision
[7155.84] into the Cumberland Plateau down to the
[7159.52] level of the the valley floors on either
[7161.92] side. And then when the floods were
[7164.88] over, the Tennessee River now flowed
[7168.0] through that catastrophically cut
[7170.719] channel. I'm saying that we should take
[7173.28] a new look, a relook at some of that
[7176.32] those phenomena that we call water gaps
[7178.239] and wind gaps throughout the um
[7181.52] throughout the valley and ridge province
[7183.119] of the east. And I will make a
[7185.04] prediction that at some point in the
[7187.28] future geologists are going to
[7188.56] acknowledge that these features were cut
[7190.639] by catastrophic water flows and not some
[7193.679] long slow process that it was so slow
[7196.88] you wouldn't have even be able to see it
[7198.56] happening. And it just so happened that
[7200.88] the uplift of the ridge was equaled by
[7204.719] the down cutting of the of the water
[7207.599] flow.
[7210.239] Hopefully that's making sense. It does.
[7212.239] Yeah, it makes a lot of sense because if
[7214.239] that's the case, then you know what
[7217.84] happens to our box that we looked at? It
[7220.56] gets smashed. It gets smashed. That's
[7223.92] right. Yeah. It doesn't even get bigger.
[7225.44] It gets completely smashed. I guess if
[7227.36] you want to look at just keep making it
[7230.0] bigger and bigger and bigger at all
[7231.44] times, then you can.
[7234.96] So, yeah. Well, if it doesn't make
[7237.04] sense, I guess to address the audience,
[7239.04] it's starting it's making more and more
[7241.28] sense to me, which is kind of the
[7243.199] vehicle that we've been presenting this
[7245.199] information to, but through. But if it's
[7248.159] not making sense to y'all, leave the
[7250.639] questions in there and and the premiere
[7253.28] if you're watching this or leave them in
[7254.96] the comments and we can pull these and
[7257.44] do Q&A episodes as well where there's
[7259.76] questions that have been built up. I
[7262.08] think that'd be awesome. I think it'd be
[7263.44] cool to get some more questions from the
[7265.36] audience as well and maybe do some live
[7267.679] Q&As's and have some more interaction
[7270.239] with people who are learning this
[7272.239] material like I am. Well, and you know,
[7275.28] I'm I don't have the final explanation.
[7277.599] Not by not by a long shot. Tell us,
[7279.76] Randall, please. But I have been I have
[7281.84] been asking questions about all of this
[7284.08] for about 40
[7285.56] years. And I think I've got some
[7289.679] answers, not all the answers, because
[7292.32] see, here's the problem I run into is
[7295.28] that you think you're starting to get a
[7297.04] handle on it. you're starting to get a
[7299.599] some kind of a of a at least a
[7302.56] hypothetical framework in which you can
[7304.8] think through it and just when you think
[7307.04] okay I think I'm making sense out of
[7309.28] this now suddenly the bigger box the
[7313.119] sides of it blow out and see now I mean
[7317.36] for me I've gone from regional to you
[7321.44] know the scale of maybe whole states
[7323.84] then to a scale of a whole continent
[7326.56] then to the scale of the whole planet.
[7329.119] And of course, just when I thought,
[7330.96] okay, now the whole planet, I'm
[7333.679] realizing, no, if we're going to be
[7335.28] thinking about this and really come to a
[7337.52] a full realistic explanation, we have to
[7341.119] expand the box even beyond the
[7343.719] planet because Earth is part of a much
[7346.159] bigger ecosystem. And I think that what
[7348.96] we're seeing, a lot of these gigantic
[7352.08] phenomena and the after effects are the
[7354.8] result of events that have transpired on
[7358.8] a, shall we say, a a transterrestrial
[7362.96] scale.
[7367.76] The big picture, it keeps expanding.
[7372.159] Yes. So, we've learned the term
[7374.96] underfit. Yep. We've been going for
[7378.639] what? Couple hours now. Almost three.
[7381.36] Almost three. So, we just probably call
[7383.119] this an episode.
[7386.239] I'm not going anywhere other than Cosmic
[7388.8] Summit, which we should probably
[7390.159] mention. The Cosmic Summit's coming up
[7392.08] in 3 weeks.
[7394.56] Just a little bit less actually in 19
[7396.88] days from the day of recording. So,
[7398.96] it'll be two weeks from the day that
[7400.56] this is released. Now is there going to
[7402.88] be uh anybody talking about the great
[7407.92] mega floods planetary? Yes, I believe
[7410.719] there will be somebody who's talking
[7412.88] about mega floods and if I'm not
[7416.679] mistaken that person is Dr. Dallas
[7420.4] Abbott from the comet research group
[7422.88] mega tsunamis. Okay, so the awesome and
[7426.719] wait she's talking about primarily
[7428.48] tsunamis, right? Mega tsunamis. Yeah,
[7430.56] mega tsunamis. Oh, yeah. I can't wait
[7432.88] for that. Yeah, she'll be on uh that
[7434.96] Saturday in the morning. Yeah, cuz I
[7437.199] thought, wait a second. You're Is George
[7439.28] getting somebody to talk about mega
[7441.04] floods that I don't know about? Who
[7443.52] supposedly Why would you get somebody to
[7445.28] talk about Hey, I like I'm the guy,
[7447.679] George. Okay. But no, Dallas Abbott is
[7451.28] Yeah, I got inspired by her work, God, I
[7454.56] don't know, 20 years ago. Uh at least.
[7456.96] Yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to
[7459.44] what her presentation is. And see, mega
[7462.159] tsunamis, that's another part of this
[7463.84] whole equation and a really important
[7466.32] one. Yeah, it's very interesting. And
[7468.56] I've heard her mention Madagascar as
[7470.48] well. We looked at that I think in the
[7472.32] second episode we ever did. I think we
[7475.199] did. Yes. Second or third. And I was
[7478.239] referencing her work. Yeah. I want to
[7481.52] make it clear that she's the one who who
[7484.4] found the evidence for the uh Berkeley
[7486.56] crater and has been mapping the mega
[7489.4] tsunamis and that is a I mean that is an
[7493.04] integral part of the whole you know the
[7495.92] whole complex of of uh data that we're
[7499.92] trying to put together to understand the
[7501.92] catastrophic history of this planet that
[7503.84] we live on. And what to me is so
[7506.32] interesting is that you know I mean I
[7508.239] find the like looking at the five great
[7510.159] mass extinctions the c Cretaceous
[7512.159] tertiary which is now the cretaceous
[7514.159] paleo gene but that's a 66 million year
[7517.04] ago event that that terminated the the
[7519.44] reign of the dinosaurs right it is of
[7522.239] tremendous interest uh to learn more
[7525.52] about that but I think you could make
[7527.92] the argument that it's primarily more of
[7529.679] academic interest because 66 million
[7532.88] years ago absolutely it it it involves
[7534.96] olved the the great pageant of life on
[7537.28] Earth and to the extent that the that
[7540.159] life on Earth and the evolution of life
[7542.48] on Earth led to the to the appearance of
[7545.36] of hominids and then of the what 15 or
[7549.04] so species of homminids that we know
[7550.96] about uh Homo sapiens sapiens came along
[7554.56] and we were able to create rocket ships
[7556.56] to go to space right I don't know of any
[7560.0] other species of homminid that has been
[7563.679] able to do that I I don't know if
[7565.56] Neanderthalss were being able to build
[7567.84] rocket ships to go to go to the moon or
[7570.8] to Mars or anywhere else. Right? So, um
[7575.04] here I guess the point I'm trying to
[7576.719] make is that it's one thing to talk
[7579.52] about something that happened 66 million
[7581.52] years ago. It's something else to talk
[7583.92] about something that happened 12 or 13
[7586.08] or 14 or 15,000 years
[7588.44] ago. Why? Because Yeah. We can let's
[7592.0] modern history. Yeah. So, the the
[7594.56] youngest date I've now seen, and I'm not
[7596.719] sure about this date, but I'm going to
[7598.159] use it anyway. 14,600 years ago, date
[7602.079] for the Bonavville flood. Some dates put
[7604.56] it older than that. M 14,600 though
[7607.92] intrigues me very much because that's
[7609.76] pretty much exactly the date of
[7612.079] meltwater pulse 1A 14 and and the
[7615.679] transition uh into and out of the
[7618.0] younger the older dry which is something
[7621.44] we want to take that whole span of time
[7623.76] and look at it in more detail at some
[7626.28] point because we're getting to know a
[7628.48] lot about the younger dus. We know
[7630.079] lesser about the older drius and then
[7632.32] what was between the older and the
[7634.239] younger dus, right? There was some very
[7637.679] interesting climate stuff going on
[7639.36] there. But meltwater pulse 1B is 1A is
[7644.159] so is dated at
[7646.04] 14,06 and some of the younger dating on
[7648.96] the younger edge of the dating spectrum
[7650.88] of the Bonavville flood puts it at about
[7653.8] 146, which would kind of make sense to
[7656.159] me. But 146, let's divide that by
[7660.199] 25 and we're looking about fi 5 580
[7664.159] generations
[7666.04] ago 580 if you want to if your
[7669.84] generation is 30 years I use 25 years
[7672.719] for a
[7673.639] generation right if if we go well if we
[7678.239] divide that by two we'd get the number
[7680.0] of presumable lifespans which is about
[7683.079] 290
[7684.679] lifespans but double that you get the
[7687.44] number of generations
[7689.28] But those people were our
[7693.239] ancestors. Now, I have not traced my I
[7695.84] don't know how far you've traced your
[7697.119] family tree back. I've not traced mine
[7699.44] back 590 generations, but I'm working on
[7703.04] it. Oh, yeah. I'm sure we all are. I
[7706.159] want to know what my great great great
[7707.44] great great great great grandparents
[7710.0] were doing during the younger dus. Well,
[7711.84] you let me know because it'll probably
[7713.599] be the same thing
[7716.04] probably. But yeah, so um we're gonna
[7719.76] continue this
[7721.079] because there's a lot of in a lot of
[7724.84] things. Let's see what knowledge
[7728.159] ultimately is is a one. It's a it's a
[7731.28] it's an integrated body. It's not oh
[7734.0] here's this thing, here's this thing,
[7735.84] here's physics, here's chemistry, here's
[7738.239] geology, here's hydraology, here's
[7741.4] archaeology. like they're not each in
[7743.679] their own separate
[7746.159] uh camp with with walls between them,
[7749.32] right? We have to be able to talk about
[7751.84] geology if we're going to talk about
[7753.28] archaeology, right? And see, the thing
[7755.599] is is when we're looking at the last
[7757.599] 12,000, 13, 14,000 years ago, what were,
[7761.44] you know, there were people then and
[7762.96] these people had lives and they were
[7764.48] doing stuff and they were presumably as
[7766.32] smart as we are today. There's no
[7768.599] anatomical evidence to indicate that
[7770.719] they didn't have the same cra you brain
[7773.119] capacity as us and the same ability to
[7775.32] think, right? However, we know something
[7778.079] is different. We know that those final
[7780.159] stage of the late glacial
[7782.92] maximum, there was some pretty
[7786.199] significant and constant extreme
[7789.36] alterations in the global environment
[7791.52] and climate that we haven't had to deal
[7794.079] with for 10,000 years. So in a way when
[7797.679] you compare the holysine the last say
[7799.52] 10,000 years to what preceded it we've
[7802.8] had some pretty you know pretty quiet
[7805.04] times pretty easy times cons compared to
[7808.159] what our ancestors would have had to uh
[7810.88] been able to survive as a result with of
[7814.48] course lots of modifications and
[7816.92] interruptions we've been able to build
[7820.84] civilization that we're enjoying now.
[7823.76] How many aborted efforts have there been
[7825.599] since 10,000 years ago to to plant the
[7828.639] seeds of civilization and build a civil
[7830.639] an enduring civilization? Probably quite
[7833.52] a few. another thing that we need to
[7836.079] talk about. Um but the point is is that
[7838.8] we see that in the holysine there are
[7842.4] uh dynamic changes not on the scale as
[7845.84] we go back to the late
[7848.76] pleaene but certainly enough that some
[7851.44] of those events the bronze age collapse
[7855.04] for example the onset of the
[7856.84] neoglaciation the 8.4
[7859.079] 4-year, 200year extreme global cooling
[7862.8] that took place right in the middle of
[7864.32] the the the the climatic optimum that
[7868.239] immediately followed the end of the ice
[7870.56] age. Any one of those events would put
[7873.119] severe stress on our own civilization
[7876.8] today.
[7878.159] And this is something we need to take
[7879.599] into account because if we're thinking
[7881.52] that carbon dioxide is the sole and
[7883.92] dominant control knob for the climate
[7886.0] change, we're missing a whole bunch of
[7889.52] variables in the equation. And if we're
[7892.239] going to understand, if we're going to
[7893.44] use that equation to try to make any
[7895.36] kind of predictions of what we might be
[7897.04] facing in the future and we leave out
[7898.96] all those variables, no, our our
[7901.28] equation is not our which then is the
[7904.639] basis of our computer models, they are
[7907.119] not going to reflect reality.
[7910.0] And I'm afraid that with the with the
[7912.56] politics invading the science of climate
[7915.199] change, which is exactly what's
[7916.84] happened, it's been hijacked. It's been
[7919.52] hijacked to the service of a political
[7921.28] agenda and we're not getting the real
[7923.599] story of climate change on Earth. But
[7925.92] everything we're talking about here when
[7928.4] we're talking about mega floods, I mean,
[7929.76] it should be obvious from anybody who's
[7931.36] listening with an open mind that we're
[7933.44] clearly talking about climatic and
[7935.36] environmental changes on a scale far
[7937.76] beyond anything we've experienced, say,
[7940.4] since the advent of modern
[7943.239] science. But they're very real. You
[7945.92] know, when we're talking about the
[7946.8] Bonavville flood or the Missoula flood
[7948.56] or the onset of an ice age, the
[7950.159] termination of an ice age, we're talking
[7952.8] about climatic changes on a scale
[7956.88] outside the range of anything we've
[7959.36] experienced in modern times. In the same
[7961.52] way, when we look at those gigantic
[7963.199] river valleys and we see the modern
[7965.44] rivers flowing in those valleys and
[7967.36] understand that no, this is not the
[7969.04] byproduct of millions of years of slow
[7971.599] erosion. No, the modern rivers are
[7973.679] occupying gigantic valleys because
[7976.239] that's the logical place in the in the
[7978.96] post flood world. Obviously, any water
[7982.4] flow that intersects these huge river
[7986.48] valleys is going to get captured by
[7988.639] those river valleys and there they're
[7991.199] going to stay until another flood with
[7995.28] the requisite capacity comes along. Then
[7998.079] you could have perhaps the filling of
[8000.159] that valley, the overcutting of the
[8002.48] watershed divides just like we were
[8004.48] talking about and the establishment of a
[8007.44] new river channel. I just showed you an
[8009.199] example of how in the course of a
[8012.239] catastrophic flood a river was diverted
[8014.88] into a new channel. But what did it take
[8018.48] that that Paloo River flow pre flood
[8021.44] probably was many millennium flowing
[8024.0] through that valley. One event probably
[8026.88] within a matter of a week, a month,
[8029.04] something in a very short range
[8030.88] completely altered the pathway of that
[8033.84] river. And now it's been occupying that
[8036.96] new channel since the flood was over 13,
[8041.599] 14, 12, 15,000 years, whatever the exact
[8044.8] date ends up being.
[8047.44] So we have to begin to understand that
[8050.56] the
[8051.96] uniform gradualistic model is only half
[8056.48] the explanation and that that slow
[8059.639] incremental changes that we see you know
[8063.119] that we can certainly see over one
[8064.639] lifetime. I mean, I've seen, you know, I
[8067.44] regularly monitor nearby creeks near
[8070.48] where I live and have been doing it for
[8072.04] decades. And yeah, there are noticeable
[8075.44] changes that occur. The channel, one of
[8078.159] the creeks that I walk by, the channel
[8080.48] has probably shifted by 50, 60, 70 ft
[8083.44] from where it was the first time I
[8085.679] walked along the edge of that creek, you
[8088.639] know, 30 years ago, right?
[8091.52] Interestingly, the changes in that
[8094.199] alterations was the result of basically
[8096.88] just two
[8097.96] events. Two events did more geomorphic
[8101.52] work on that creek channel than all the
[8103.92] rest of the 30 years of change combined.
[8107.199] And it did it within like two days for
[8109.28] each of those
[8110.599] events. And I think that's the model we
[8113.28] need to look at and understand that this
[8115.76] planet is subjected to these outsized
[8119.76] events that completely alter everything.
[8123.44] And if there happens to be a
[8124.719] civilization somewhere in the mix, we're
[8127.76] talking about reboot. We're talking
[8129.76] about we're starting over again. We're
[8132.239] back to the Stone Age. We got to start
[8134.159] over. And we pass down legends and myths
[8138.48] to preserve the memory of those events
[8141.599] that had such a profound effect on our
[8145.04] human life on planet Earth. Level one.
[8149.119] Yeah. So, I think that's maybe where we
[8151.28] should leave it for this episode, but
[8154.239] there's a lot more to cover in this and
[8155.84] I hope people stay with us. Yeah.
[8158.239] Because I can tell you this, it does not
[8160.239] get any less interesting.
[8165.36] as you go forward with
[8167.239] it. And people need to know, you know,
[8170.4] hey, this evidence, you don't have to
[8172.88] travel far to find evidence once you
[8175.44] know what you're looking for. Let's look
[8177.28] around. Let's look look around.

Title: Did Ancient Tech Harness Vibration to Move Stone?
[0.08] when we talk about these ancient
[1.52] technologies. But what kind of
[3.04] technologies are you talking about?
[4.319] Well, I just I shouldn't really get into
[6.799] that. Get into it. Get into it. We got
[8.96] to get into it. Everything vibrates.
[11.519] Everything vibrates at a frequency. And
[13.36] if you know that frequency, you can
[14.96] control things through this technology.
[17.6] They're able to move stones or cut
[20.24] stones or all the above. The question
[22.16] always is, where are the artifacts?
[23.76] Where's the pottery? Where is the the
[25.439] evidence that this civilization existed?
[27.599] And Mazda, the car manufacturer in
[30.4] Japan, is getting ready to do a $25
[32.719] million testing of some of these
[34.88] prototypes.

Title: We’re in the Path of an Ancient Catastrophe
[0.16] Going back to the torid meteor streak
[2.08] here is right now the idea that's coming
[4.24] from the new catastrophists that
[6.72] actually go back to 1980 in the British
[8.88] Isles. Victor Clue, William Napier,
[11.28] several others also some Australian
[13.44] astronomers that theorized that around
[15.839] 25 to 30,000 years ago a gigantic comet
[19.279] maybe 50 to 60 m diameter nucleus or
[22.16] even bigger came. was captured into a
[24.64] subjovian orbit meaning that it's
[26.8] traveling around in the inner solar
[28.4] system between the sun and Jupiter that
[30.96] this huge comet began to undergo
[33.6] hierarchical system of breakups forming
[36.48] ever smaller cometary nuclei pieces that
[39.52] then went under process of breaking up
[42.0] which ultimately led to the torid meteor
[44.079] stream in the early days of of a
[46.239] cometary destruction like that this was
[48.32] the comet Anky comet Anky now that's
[50.719] good that's good not comet Anky wouldn't
[53.039] have been the progenitor comet. It would
[55.6] have been one of the secondary or
[57.28] tertiary comet from the break up of the
[59.84] original. Got it. Does that make sense?
[61.52] Yes. In early times going back 10, 12,
[64.879] 15,000 years ago, this debris has not
[68.08] cleared out. It's very dense within the
[70.96] stream of the torid meteor stream. The
[73.68] earth crosses that stream twice each
[76.159] year. So picture this Jupiter, the sun,
[78.799] the stream comes around the sun. It
[80.64] makes its perihelion passage around the
[83.6] sun, goes out, goes, it it loops back in
[87.6] just inside Jupiter like this. And so
[90.64] it's streaming around like this, and
[92.96] it's lays close to the plane of the
[94.799] ecliptic. And Earth passes through that
[97.92] stream twice each year in its orbit.
[100.72] When that stuff is coming from its
[102.88] perihelion passage behind the sun,
[105.28] that's the summertime torids, which
[107.52] occur in late June and early July.
[110.399] Now the earth is moving and then it
[112.24] comes to the falltime torids that are
[114.64] coming in towards the sun but coming
[117.119] from apparently space. Now all meteor
[121.439] streams are named after the
[124.04] constellation that you would look at to
[126.56] see which direction you're emanating
[128.759] from. The Taurids obviously are named
[132.08] after the constellation Taurus and
[135.16] specifically they're almost t the
[137.52] radiant point is almost targeted right
[140.56] on the pletes which is the shoulder of
[143.28] the bull in the classical depictions. We
[145.84] are right now today, tomorrow and the
[148.879] next day in the peak of the torid meteor
[151.36] streak. That's kind of scary.

Title: Where Did the Giants Go?
[0.24] What happened to the great megapana? You
[2.159] had lions the size of horses. You had
[4.56] direwolves. I mean, the list went on and
[6.799] on and on. And with a geological
[9.519] eyeblink, they were gone. To put that in
[11.679] perspective, the number of species of
[13.28] megaponded that disappeared within this
[15.679] period of deglaciation where the ices
[18.24] disappeared during the melting. During
[19.76] the melting Yeah, exactly. You got it.
[21.68] During the melting, over 100 species
[23.76] disappeared worldwide. Big animals. Big
[26.24] animals. Megapon is defined as an animal
[29.519] that's more than 44 kilograms or 100
[32.48] pounds roughly in bo body weight. So
[35.04] we're we're all mega mammals, right? But
[37.68] the ones today, the lions and tigers and
[39.6] bears and everything else about 110 to
[42.399] 120 species right in there depending on
[44.16] how you divide it up. That was about the
[46.16] number of species that went extinct
[48.719] during this episode of delaciation. Now
[51.6] think about that. Like every big mammal
[53.28] on Earth just goes extinct. Well, half
[56.0] half of all the big because the other
[58.16] half are the ones that are on the planet
[60.0] today. The giant American bison was 6
[62.96] feet tall at the shoulder. It seemed to
[64.879] selectively affect really large animals
[67.6] and that makes sense because if you have
[70.64] a tremendous amount of habitat
[72.52] destruction, what that means is it it
[75.36] it's going to affect the food supply.
[77.6] the larger animals that require more
[80.24] food, that have a longer gestation
[82.479] period of animals of of young in the
[84.64] womb, that have a longer period of time
[86.72] of requirement of nurturing until
[89.2] they're viably independent. All of that
[92.0] is longer. So, if you have habitat
[94.68] destruction, it's going to selectively
[96.96] go to the top of the food chain. Whereas
[99.68] the smaller animals, the scavengers,
[102.24] these things, they're going to have a
[103.759] field day because there's going to be a
[105.52] lot of carrying that they're going to be
[106.96] able to eat. And uh we know like that in
[110.32] place, you may have heard, you know,
[112.0] about woolly mammoths that have been
[113.68] found quick frozen, flash frozen in the
[115.84] perafrost, which is still a mystery.
[118.32] Why? How fast would it take a six-tonon
[121.36] mammoth to freeze that the contents of
[124.32] the stomach would not even putrify?

Title: 3–5 Years Until Global Ice Age
[0.08] For measurements of annual ice layer
[1.839] thickness over the past 15,000 years,
[4.08] the authors find that Greenland's
[6.48] climate emerging from the last ice age
[9.76] twice shifted from glacial to
[12.0] interglacial conditions over an
[13.92] astonishingly quick 3 to 5 years. Can
[16.64] you imagine glacial to interglacial? Can
[18.72] you imagine that our world shifting from
[22.0] interglacial conditions now into full
[24.56] glacial mode within 3 to 5 years? What
[27.279] would that imply for the stability of
[30.08] our civilization? Well, it would imply,
[32.239] I think, that our entire civilization
[34.079] would collapse completely because
[35.68] there's so many ramifications to to what
[38.32] that means. And of course, you know, if
[40.239] we shifted into a full glacial mode now,
[42.719] I mean, we're going to experience the
[44.239] same kind of agricultural collapses that
[46.64] we saw on a lesser scale during the the
[48.879] little ice age and the the dark ages. I
[51.2] mean, I think we would see a global
[52.8] collapse of agriculture. We would see
[55.6] extreme cold that people wouldn't have
[57.44] been able to adapt.

Title: Could a Past Civilization Be Completely Erased?
[0.16] Why don't we conjecture that given that
[2.639] the the at least 150 to 200,000 years
[6.4] that we modern humans have been on this
[8.559] earth that consistent with a lot of the
[11.28] myths you know the dominance of just
[13.04] feudalism of subsistence farming that
[15.759] was up until the 17 1800s and the
[20.0] scientific enlightenment followed by the
[22.08] industrial revolution that was pretty
[25.199] much 99% of the earth's population when
[28.88] I was born with no computers. We had no
[31.599] presence in space. If you look at how
[34.64] far and fast we've come scientifically
[37.6] in the last 200 years and then if you
[40.399] were to think that well what if a
[42.719] cataclysm wiped out our modern
[44.559] civilization and we had archaeologists
[46.96] coming and digging up looking for you
[49.84] know prehistory 10,000 years prior.
[52.32] Well, would they find any evidence that
[53.92] we were we were even here? And the
[56.64] answer is well it depends on the
[59.44] severity and the intensity and magnitude
[62.399] of these events. Now if we start talking
[65.199] about the younger dus I think we can
[68.439] safely state that the younger dus was a
[71.439] global catastrophe and it involved
[74.08] multiple factors all of which would have
[76.88] done their part very effectively to
[79.36] erase any kind of civilization that
[81.68] might have existed. it.

Title: Did Plato Nail the Date of Atlantis?
[0.24] So we see that this mortality graph
[2.8] correlates very well with this graph and
[6.24] with the spikes that we saw defining the
[9.28] period from 146 to 116. I'll also
[12.24] mention that interesting Plato named
[15.04] that date for the destruction of
[17.52] Atlantis. He placed that at 9,000 years
[20.08] prior to Solon's journey to Egypt where
[23.039] he heard the tale. And interestingly,
[25.6] his journey to Egypt took place around
[27.76] around 2,600 years ago, about 600 BC.
[30.8] So, do the math. Comes right out to
[33.239] 11,600. So, how interesting. And of
[35.6] course generally if it's even noted by
[38.719] historians or or archaeologists or
[41.84] whomever uh it's just dismissed as a
[44.719] mere coincidence that places the the
[47.2] destruction of Atlantis through a an
[49.6] event of subsidance
[51.84] uh beneath sinks beneath the waves
[53.68] during an exact period of time that we
[55.76] know that sea level was rapidly rising
[58.879] even to the point where it's been called
[60.48] meltwater pulse 1b. B.

Title: Did Ancient Engineers Build the Moon?
[0.08] I am willing to consider that the moon
[2.96] has been geoengineered by a civilization
[5.839] with a technology advanced enough that
[7.919] they would be able to Do you think
[9.44] Atlantis geoengineered it? Uh it's very
[12.24] speculative. But now we get into the
[14.08] question of could there have been a
[15.36] civilization in the remote past that had
[17.84] technologies that we currently don't
[20.0] know about. And I think the answer is
[22.4] yes. That is a plausible hypothesis that
[25.199] is not warranted by just summarily
[28.4] dismissing. How would they have
[29.84] geoengineered the moon? Well, if you
[31.76] look at the schemes for building lunar
[34.96] bases, have you ever looked at any of
[36.399] NASA's ideas for building lunar bases?
[38.96] No. Basically, the main problem with
[40.8] building a colony on the moon is cosmic
[43.12] radiation. So, how do you solve the
[44.8] problem of cosmic radiation that to
[47.2] which you are going to be subject on the
[49.12] surface of the moon? You need some
[50.96] protective shielding, maybe a magnetic
[53.84] protective shielding. could you which
[55.76] means you're thinking immediately
[57.199] something like there one of the schemes
[58.559] is and if I can find it here I'll pull
[60.079] it up. One of the schemes is a a dome-l
[62.0] like structure. Yeah, something like
[63.359] that. Yes, you could do that. Or what
[66.08] would be another possibility? Go
[68.08] underground. Oh, under So there you go.
[70.56] So it could be this hollow structure.
[72.799] Interesting. Hollow is an
[74.159] oversimplification. Okay. So there maybe
[76.72] hollow parts of

[0.0] I think we're kind of in this phase
[1.52] right now where it essentially trying to
[3.2] reverse engineer what these peoples of
[5.6] long ago were up to with all of this
[7.359] stuff. If you apply the right frequency,
[10.639] that's like they spontaneously organize
[12.719] into tooidal forms. 9 + 6 + 3, that's
[17.6] 18. 1 + 8 is 9. The whole set of these
[21.68] numbers pretty much like, think of it,
[23.96] 432. 4 + 3 + 2, 9. 79 20 7 + 9 + 2 18 1
[32.239] + 8 is 9
[34.2] 369 numbers just keep intermingling and
[37.36] I ultimately think it's technological.

Title: They Built This to Catch the Moonrise
[0.08] There's a place that we'll go to at some
[2.159] point in Colorado called Chimney Rock.
[4.56] It's two natural pillars. Huge pillars
[6.799] are 1,000 ft above the valley floor and
[9.12] they're connected by a ridge and you can
[11.2] go up that ridge and where the ridge
[12.96] sort of flattens out before you get to
[15.2] these two huge pinnacles of rock.
[18.08] There's a the remnants of an ancient
[20.64] structure there in an ancient Kea that
[22.88] would have been built by the Chakan
[24.4] people. And this was one of the Chakon
[27.039] outliers, part of the whole Chakon
[29.88] civilization that was pretty much
[32.0] covered the 10,000 square miles of the
[34.48] San Juan basin in New Mexico whose hub
[38.079] was Choco Canyon. And there was a whole
[40.48] series of outliers that were places of
[43.6] uh observation, high pinnacle points
[46.32] that would have been probably used as as
[48.64] a communication system. But a chimney
[50.719] rock remains of a kar there. If you
[53.199] position yourself at the right location
[55.52] within that ka which is circular, you
[58.16] peer through those through those two
[59.76] pinnacle rocks and it marks that
[61.84] position. You will see the moon rising
[64.879] in between those two rocks.

Title: Asteroids May Be Seeding the Moon
[0.08] It is interesting to note that carbon
[2.399] and nitrogen are abundant in carbonatous
[6.16] condrite meteorites sourced from
[9.36] asteroid parent bodies. Okay, so
[12.0] asteroid parent bodies will deliver that
[15.92] carbon and nitrogen to the lunar
[17.76] surface. But the fact that they're
[20.32] sources shows us and implies in my mind
[23.92] that the asteroid belt itself must be an
[27.64] extraordinarily rich source of these
[30.96] elements because asteroids with with CC
[34.48] like or carbonacious condritike
[37.719] compositions will have impacted the
[40.079] lunar surface over geological time.

[0.08] All of which we could be doing within
[1.68] the next few generations if the motive
[3.919] there if the will is there. So one of
[6.16] the goals of Artemis is to establish a
[8.639] permanent base on the moon and from that
[10.559] permanent base that could facilitate
[12.639] human missions to Mars. Now we should of
[14.88] course be discussing why do we want to
[16.8] do this. I think that we get into sort
[19.439] of philosophical and epistemological
[22.0] realms when we're discussing ultimately
[24.24] the rationale for humans moving into
[26.72] space. But I think that if we are going
[29.039] to endure long-term as a civilization,
[33.28] if not a species, we have to do

Title: What Are The Carolina Bays?
[8.8] I would like to mention that one of our
[10.639] original sponsors at Cosmographia, CBD
[14.16] from the Gods, is following us here to
[16.64] our new podcast, Squaring the Circle. As
[19.76] many of you know, I've been using their
[21.439] products for going on four years now.
[24.24] And having tried a number of CBD brands,
[27.199] CBD from the gods seems the most
[29.599] effective for my needs, which is
[32.0] primarily as a sleep aid and as a remedy
[34.559] for inflammation and associated pain. I
[38.399] use both the oil and the sav. My wife
[41.76] also likes their products, especially
[43.6] the sav, which alleviates the pain in
[45.76] her hands, which is the result of
[47.92] working for years as an electrician. If
[50.64] you've been thinking about trying a CBD
[52.64] product and experiencing the benefits
[54.559] for yourself, give CBD from the gods a
[57.879] try. To learn more and see their product
[61.039] line, check out CBD from the
[64.84] gods.com. Any purchase of their products
[67.36] helps our efforts here at Squaring the
[69.52] Circle to realize our goal of making
[72.56] this world a better place. Thanks. Well,
[76.24] hello Chris Catrell. Randall, it's good
[78.64] to finally uh meet up in person on a
[81.28] podcast. Meet up Well, we've met up in
[83.759] person. We have. Yep. And now we're
[85.68] meeting up on a podcast. That's right.
[87.68] That's right. And I'm still kind of new
[90.08] to Streamyard. Getting my feet wet here,
[92.799] but it looks like we've pulled it off.
[95.119] It looks pretty good so far. I can see
[96.96] you. I can hear you. You can see me. You
[99.2] can hear me. So, that's a good sign.
[101.36] Check. Yeah. So, as I've I'm trying to
[105.28] think of where I first encountered your
[108.479] name. Um, it's been a few years. Yeah.
[112.24] Yeah. It could have been um through the
[114.479] state brothers. It could have been
[115.84] through all the Randall You Can Handle.
[117.759] There's There's That's pro That could be
[119.36] multiple avenues. Yep.
[122.799] That would probably be So, when did you
[124.32] start All the Randall You Can Handle?
[126.32] Well, I First of all, First of all, I
[128.08] did not start all the Randall You Can
[130.0] Handle. No. Um I uh you know you had a
[133.44] um you had a uh a business partner in
[135.92] the past and I guess things didn't work
[137.84] out. Uh and so the
[142.4] so so the uh the platform that was being
[145.04] used on on Facebook uh was really kind
[147.04] of getting run into the ground. Yeah. Uh
[149.2] and so there was a group of people that
[150.959] were part of that Facebook group that
[152.8] said, "You know what? This is we gota we
[154.879] got to start something new." You know,
[156.239] mainly because we didn't want to see
[157.84] your name getting tarnished like that.
[159.28] So, I appreciate that. Yeah. Yeah. So,
[162.239] so a gentleman by the name of Clayton
[164.56] Clayton Reese, uh, he's the one who
[166.319] started up all the you can handle. Okay.
[168.48] Um, I was one of the first people to go
[170.16] and and sign up with him. Uh, and maybe
[174.319] about two weeks went by and he totally
[176.959] dropped Facebook completely and and made
[179.04] me the admin. Oh, so that's what
[181.68] happened. So, that's how I Yep. Yep. So,
[185.04] you know, I I I um like I said, I didn't
[187.519] personally start it, but uh you know, I
[189.36] did take it upon myself to uh to kind
[191.28] of, you know, keep things going and to
[193.519] uh you know, just make sure that, you
[195.84] know, anybody that wanted to talk
[197.959] about Randall Carlson content would have
[200.64] a place to do that and then not be and
[202.64] you know, not be pestered and not be
[203.92] running to the ground. So, not have to
[205.76] like deal with um Yeah. Yeah. We've got
[209.599] we've got over 5,000 people now in that
[211.44] Facebook group and uh uh you know things
[213.92] have been running pretty smoothly. So So
[216.72] no complaints. That's great. Well, I I
[218.48] Yeah, it I it might get a bump with my
[220.959] um interview I did yesterday. Actually,
[223.76] it was yesterday, wasn't it, with um
[226.48] Patrick Beck David and he was a good
[228.959] interviewer. He asked a lot of
[230.4] questions. We didn't get around to
[232.08] Carolina Bays specifically. I had some
[235.04] on my I prepared a um a slideshow just
[239.12] for that interview and we probably
[241.92] didn't get through 10 or 15% of those
[244.239] slides. I know. Yeah. I I sent you a
[247.2] presentation that has like 80 slides and
[249.12] I I probably won't even open it up. So
[251.76] Oh, I couldn't I couldn't get it open.
[254.0] Okay. Well, I have it, but if if if we
[255.68] need to use it, I could pull some stuff
[256.88] from it. But yeah, let I mean,
[258.16] definitely. Do we want to show some a
[259.6] I've got I've got my uh PowerPoint show
[262.24] that I put together years ago when I
[265.44] just have a feeling once we get going
[266.88] that that won't come up. But we'll see.
[268.24] We'll see how it goes. Okay. Yeah. I um
[272.479] so just a just a quick funny story while
[274.4] we're talking about the all the Randall
[275.759] You Can Handle Facebook group. Um I I
[278.0] still find it very comical that I sent
[279.759] you an invite to Oh yeah. the the group
[283.36] that was, you know, that was a basically
[285.6] a fan page for Rand Carlson and one of
[288.32] the other admins. We were very strict on
[290.479] making sure that people, you know, they
[292.32] check off the the the, you know, the
[294.88] group guidelines and the rules and
[296.56] things like that, which are super
[297.68] simple. It's it's basically two things.
[299.44] Be kind and if you're going to mess with
[301.6] somebody, you better do it with some
[302.88] science. That's that's the only two
[304.0] rules that we have in that Facebook
[305.199] group, but you have to check off on it.
[307.84] That's right. You have to check off on
[309.28] it. and um and you didn't and one of the
[313.28] admins actually booted you from from
[315.52] your own Facebook group. So, I had to be
[318.32] like, "Come on, guys. What are you
[319.6] doing? What are you doing blocking?"
[320.88] Well, hey, that was my screw up. I
[323.68] should have gladly checked off those
[325.759] boxes. And if I had been attentive, uh
[329.039] there wouldn't have been a problem. So,
[330.4] don't don't be too hard on him. No, no.
[333.44] I just thought it was funny. I thought
[334.8] it was But I'm sure if I ever meet him,
[336.639] I will definitely have to give him a
[338.0] hard time about that.
[339.759] Right. Right. So, um, so I think what
[343.84] you know, I realized that you were very
[346.479] heavily into researching the Carolina
[348.24] Bays and you know, I did too. I
[351.28] mentioned you in our in our brief
[353.919] pre-recorded discussion how I had uh
[357.44] heard about the car first read about the
[359.52] Carolina bays in a book called uh the
[362.72] secret of Atlantis by a German physicist
[365.68] by the name of Otto Moo and his I his
[369.919] basic theory was now this is I think the
[373.039] book was published in 79 maybe and then
[376.24] translated into the English version in
[378.72] 80 so it was around that time and I had
[382.319] done my first ever public presentation
[385.6] on anything in 1980 and I had done a
[390.16] series of classes or lectures or
[391.84] something and the question of Atlantis
[393.6] kept coming up and at that point in my
[396.08] life I'd never read Plato and I didn't
[398.08] know much about Atlantis. I knew of it
[400.88] of course um but I thought you know what
[404.479] I'm going to research Atlantis you know
[406.72] see what that's all about. And so I read
[409.199] I don't know four or five books about it
[411.039] over a period of a year or so different
[414.08] perspectives you know I read about I
[415.919] mean by that time one of the ideas that
[419.199] Atlantis was the eruption of Santorini
[422.4] on the island of Terara or did I have it
[424.639] backwards? It was the island of
[425.84] Santorini and the volcano was Terra
[428.4] which was what was it um 900 I think it
[432.479] was around 900 BC when that occurred and
[435.52] so there was
[438.08] um you know some books and stuff that
[440.56] came out that said that's the likely
[444.4] background that's the backstory to
[446.599] Atlantis was was the eruption of of that
[450.16] so I there was one of the books I read
[451.759] was that you know and it's a very
[453.68] interesting story about that. Um, and it
[456.96] probably wiped out the um, uh, how do
[460.0] they tie Carolina Bays into that book?
[462.8] Well, okay, that's what I'm going to get
[464.24] you. So, uh, uh, how the Carolina Bays
[468.639] is. So, so now he gets into talking
[470.8] about what he believed the catastrophe
[472.96] was that destroyed Atlantis. So he has a
[477.36] chapter in there where he
[479.8] speculates that a an asteroid struck the
[483.199] Atlantic
[484.36] Ocean. Okay. And I believe if I remember
[487.199] right he was it was a six mile wide
[490.16] asteroid which I thought was rather
[492.0] interesting because the Alvarez team had
[494.639] just come out in 1980. you remember with
[497.759] with the the discovery of the aridium
[500.0] layer in Italy. Yeah. And uh had had
[504.24] done the calculations. They looked at
[506.08] the by that time I think that they had
[508.96] they had confirmed that the idium layer
[511.199] also existed in Denmark and in New
[514.0] Zealand. Yeah. It was global, right? It
[516.08] that it was global. And so they did a
[518.88] calculation about the the total amount
[521.519] of aridium dusted around the earth. And
[524.48] based upon the amounts of aridium found
[527.6] in asteroids, they had calculated that
[530.0] the asteroid was about six miles in
[531.839] diameter. So I was very familiar with
[534.72] that. I was very excited when that
[537.2] information came out because I was, you
[539.36] may have been this yourself, when I was
[541.279] a boy, I was absolutely obsessed with
[543.76] dinosaurs. Mhm. I mean, I was totally
[546.64] obsessed. Yeah. Um, you know, I built
[549.76] the the plastic models of dinosaurs. I
[552.16] had them sitting on my bookshelves and
[555.12] any dinosaur movie that came out easy. I
[558.8] still have them set up in my classroom.
[560.32] Yes. I play with And I do play with them
[562.32] sometimes. Yes. Well, you know, my kid
[564.399] now when he was little, I he he had a uh
[567.519] he still has a collection of the
[570.0] dinosaur replicas that I would have
[572.08] killed for when I was 9 10 years old,
[574.64] you know. Yeah. But anyways, so back to
[578.08] Ottomuk and The Secret of Atlantis. So
[580.24] his he conjectures that a sixmile
[583.04] asteroid crashed into the Atlantic
[585.12] Ocean, but as it's coming in, it's
[588.24] spalling off outer layers that it had
[591.48] fragmented and they splatted over the
[594.48] east coast of the United States, right?
[596.88] That was his scenario. So he was tying
[599.839] Carolina bays to an an asteroid impact
[602.88] and and this was the catastrophe that
[604.88] caused the sinking of Atlantis. Mhm. So
[608.48] when I read that, I thought, well, geez,
[610.08] these things are right in my backyard
[612.16] that he's talking about here. So, couple
[614.88] of years went by and locally here, we
[618.399] have a facility called the Fernbank
[621.36] Science Center. I'm familiar. Yep. Okay.
[624.079] Yeah. And they have a science library
[626.079] there. So, yeah. I thought, you know
[627.92] what? I think I'm going to go and do
[629.519] some research. I've been thinking about
[631.12] the bays and you know this is a few
[633.2] years later so it's maybe 83 84 and you
[637.2] know new research is coming out on the
[639.519] KT boundary impact and the discovery of
[642.88] other impact craters and things and I
[646.72] had gotten into uh exploring now around
[649.76] the same time in fact it was actually
[652.32] earlier than that that I had first heard
[654.32] about the Tungusa event of 1908. Um, so
[659.519] I just got really into reading and
[661.68] researching impacts and things like that
[664.399] and realized, okay, you've got impacts
[667.36] into the ground. You've got impacts that
[669.76] explode in the atmosphere. Mhm. Right.
[672.079] Atmospheric impacts and and detonations.
[674.24] So
[675.24] then maybe 83, 84, something like that,
[678.16] I go to um Bernbank Science Library and
[681.76] I start doing some research uh on the
[685.76] Carolina Bays and discovered the work of
[689.12] Prrowy and and um Melton and Shrivever.
[692.56] I think Melton and Shrivever were the
[694.16] first, weren't they? Yeah. Yeah. Back in
[697.279] the 30s. Yeah. Yeah. Back in the 30s.
[699.68] And there was the the aerial the fair
[701.76] was it Fairchild aerial survey
[704.56] commissioned by the Roosevelt
[706.079] administration. Yeah, I have a picture
[707.76] of that if you want to pull that up.
[709.04] Yeah. Yeah, please do. That'd be great.
[711.76] I I bet it's the same one I've gotten.
[713.68] It's a really It's a great Well, it's
[715.92] that mosaic of all the Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[718.8] Let's look at that. There we are. Have
[721.2] at it. This is This is Yeah. mosaic of
[724.079] Carolina Bays in Horry County, South
[726.16] Carolina. imaged by Fair
[728.76] Fairchild Aerial Surveys
[732.839] 1930. So this was commissioned I think
[735.92] it was part of their oh you know the the
[738.8] agricultural subsidies that they were
[740.88] doing. Yeah. Well back then that was I
[743.12] mean Great Depression time. So they were
[745.6] they were trying to do whatever they
[746.639] could to get get some crops going out
[748.399] there. So that's that's what that was
[749.68] all about. Yeah. Yeah. And uh this was
[753.279] in the New York office. It was um what
[756.72] what's his name? You know, I have right
[758.44] here. I showed you this before.
[762.079] This is um my first volume of Carolina
[766.24] Bay Research and all of this was done.
[769.36] You know, we were talking about how you
[771.68] This was back in the day when you
[773.2] actually had to go to the library. Yeah.
[775.68] To do research. But,
[779.24] um yeah, I have a lot of good stuff
[782.959] here. Um, yeah, the work of Melton and
[786.56] Shrivever. You might mention, Chris, who
[788.56] they were. Yeah, I mean, they they did a
[792.48] lot of work back in the uh uh what year
[795.04] was that? Well, let's see. The article I
[798.32] have
[799.16] here, 1933.
[801.839] Yeah. So, this this is all back in the
[803.2] early 30s, right? Yeah. you know, and
[805.279] and and you know, some of the things
[806.56] that I've mentioned in the past, too, is
[808.16] you know, that's that's really where the
[810.16] craze of the Carolina Bays came from
[812.079] because they did mention asteroid
[814.72] impacts. You know, they that's what they
[816.88] thought these were. They thought they
[817.839] were they were meteor holes. And so,
[820.24] yeah, the title of this paper, which
[822.16] appeared in the Journal of Geology, was
[824.48] the Carolina Bays, are they meteorite
[827.68] scars? Right. Right. Yeah. Yep. Um but
[832.959] there was a story. Yeah. Okay. In 18 oh
[835.44] goes back in 1895. LC Glenn described
[839.68] some peculiar elliptical depressions
[842.16] locally called bays in the vicinity of
[844.8] Darlington, South Carolina. In 1930,
[848.639] similar features near Conway were
[850.72] photographed by the Fairchild Aerial
[852.639] Surveys of New York City. And here we
[855.12] go. And were brought to Melton's
[857.16] attention by Mr. E. H. Corlet.
[862.88] So he was the guy who assembled this
[865.92] mosaic we're looking at right here,
[867.76] right? And then got there's got to be
[870.079] dozens of individual photos. Oh yeah.
[872.959] Yeah. Easily. Yeah. Yeah. And he
[875.519] assembled this and then essentially
[877.12] said, "What the hell am I looking at?"
[879.6] Yeah. And he he he surmised or
[882.24] conjectured that they could have been
[883.6] some type of meteorite impact. So then
[885.92] he called in um uh who did I say here?
[890.12] Uh Melton. He called in Melton who was a
[893.68] geologist who he who he knew um who then
[898.16] brought in I think a student I think
[899.68] Shrivever might have been a student of
[901.6] his. Melton was Yeah. They were from the
[904.16] University of Oklahoma. Mhm. Um a
[908.24] careful study of the photographs showed
[911.36] that the origin of these bays involved
[914.959] problems of extraordinary interest. The
[918.16] authors therefore visited the region
[920.079] during the summer of 1931 in order to
[923.04] confirm their deductions and to make
[924.88] additional observations beyond the area
[927.839] of the mosaic. It was discovered that
[930.48] the typical bays near Conway differ
[933.36] somewhat from those described by Glenn,
[935.92] but apparently only in non-essentials.
[938.24] In most respects, they are identical.
[941.6] The conspicuous simil similarities
[943.76] include such features as the elliptical
[946.0] plan and a peculiar elevated rim of
[949.12] light sandy soil which is almost
[951.759] invariably present at the southeastern
[954.16] end of each
[955.56] bay. On the other hand, the only
[957.6] important difference seems to be that of
[959.279] depth. The bays frequently occur near
[961.839] Darlington as pronounced topographic
[964.399] basins. While nearer the ocean, the
[966.959] depressions have been filled largely by
[969.44] the development of Pete bogs.
[973.519] Yep.
[975.519] A few years later, I discovered the book
[978.959] that they they got the book in the
[980.959] science library that it was using, the
[982.56] one by Henry Savage. Yep. Savage. Yeah.
[985.36] That was uh 81 or 82, I think. I think
[988.56] it was a little later than that. Um, we
[991.199] could easily find out. Um, but yeah,
[993.68] once I discovered that book, I then used
[996.0] his he even mentions in there that he
[997.839] was going to attempt in his his
[999.6] bibliography to assemble all of the
[1003.04] references on Carolina Bays. Yeah. So,
[1005.759] it took me about a year. I went through
[1007.6] his references and with the help of uh
[1010.399] the the librarian there at the science
[1012.48] library, she got
[1013.959] intrigued by what I was doing in the
[1016.24] research. So she helped me and I was
[1018.48] able to procure all of this stuff
[1020.48] whether it was you know in the library
[1022.079] or
[1023.48] not. We would do interl loan
[1027.439] and uh and so yeah I was able to procure
[1030.88] almost everything uh in the uh in his
[1034.959] reference. So Henry Savage it was it the
[1038.439] uh was it the mysterious Carolina Bays?
[1041.6] Uh I think that's what I think that was
[1043.28] a title something similar. Yeah. Yeah,
[1046.4] I'm sure I Let's
[1048.2] see. It The mysterious Carolina Bays.
[1052.679] Um, and let's see. It was published in
[1055.6] 1982.
[1057.2] Yeah. Yep. Yep. So, yeah, because I know
[1059.76] it was not too long after that that I
[1061.84] discovered his book and then I used
[1063.88] that, read it several times. In fact, I
[1066.4] have
[1067.0] a photo photocopied the whole book which
[1070.64] I So, is that I guess you encountered
[1073.679] that book as well. Yeah. Yeah. early on,
[1076.24] you know, but you know what I find
[1077.919] amazing too is, you know, they got these
[1079.6] pictures in the the the early 1930s and
[1083.679] technology really didn't progress that
[1086.0] much as far as aerial photography, you
[1088.32] know, for decades, right? You know, all
[1090.4] the way even even when I was taking
[1092.0] classes in um at Valdasta State
[1094.4] University, which we can bring up
[1095.52] because I know I think didn't you take
[1096.799] uh some pictures of of some Carolina
[1098.72] bays down that in that in that area? I
[1101.039] did. Yeah. Down near Valdasta. Yep.
[1103.52] That's exactly right. Yeah, that's where
[1105.679] I that was where I got my undergraduate
[1107.28] from. And um um yeah, even in the in the
[1111.679] late 90s, we were still pulling we were
[1113.28] able to pull aerial photography, but to
[1114.96] to make like a mosaic like this, we
[1116.88] would have to print them out one at a
[1118.24] time. Yeah. And and get a poster board
[1120.32] and and glue them to poster boards to
[1122.24] get a mosaic of of the area. That was in
[1124.559] the 90s. So, right.
[1127.919] So, yeah, this was pretty interesting.
[1130.0] So, you know, I was inclined to believe
[1133.44] that they were impacts. And for me, you
[1136.64] know, I thought, well, are, you know, so
[1138.96] one of the controversies became, I think
[1140.88] it was Prrowy who proposed aerial
[1143.52] detonations along the lines of Tangus, I
[1146.08] believe, where I think Melton and
[1147.28] Shrivever were still thinking actual
[1149.96] impacts into the unconsolidated sediment
[1153.12] of the coastal plane, right? Um, I was
[1156.4] going to refresh myself on all this, but
[1159.44] I figured you'd be able to get me
[1161.6] straightened out here.
[1164.6] Um, but yeah, so I wonder if Mysterious
[1167.2] Carolina Bays is still in print. Um, I
[1170.64] had to I had to dig one out somewhere.
[1173.039] It wasn't easy to find, so I had to find
[1175.679] I had I think I got it from either
[1177.44] Michael Davius or Antonio Zamora, so I
[1180.08] was able to get it. Okay. Different
[1181.76] channels. Yeah. Now, I'm Were you Let's
[1184.559] see. Were you at that round table at um
[1186.799] I was not at the round table. No. And we
[1188.96] could bring that up too because that was
[1190.559] uh probably a pivotal pivotal moment for
[1193.44] Carolina Bays, but I was not part of
[1195.28] that. No. Yeah, that was where I first
[1198.72] was it Davies. Is that who it's it's
[1201.2] Davas? Yeah. Davius. Yeah. Davius.
[1204.0] Michael Dav. I was pretty impressed by
[1205.52] his work. Yeah. Well, he's like I said,
[1208.08] you know, when we look at these aerial
[1209.52] photos, you know, he's now he's the one
[1211.919] who's responsible for taking the USGS
[1214.799] LAR data and and uploading it and and
[1218.559] now we can all I mean, everybody can go
[1220.32] on to syntos.org and and look at his
[1223.28] overlays using just Google Earth. It's
[1225.84] it's amazing the the progression of the
[1227.6] technology over the past, you know,
[1230.0] really 15 years, even less. I think I
[1232.799] think he started that in 2012.
[1235.36] Um, so it's it's just a little bit over
[1239.28] um a decade or so, but uh yeah, the the
[1241.84] progression is has really kicked off
[1243.36] over the past 10 15 years for sure.
[1247.0] Yeah. So, this is directly from a quote
[1250.4] from Savage's book. In 1930, Myrtle
[1253.6] Beach Estates, in order to facilitate
[1256.32] the sale of the timber from some of its
[1258.96] extensive land holdings in Horry County,
[1261.52] South Carolina, had engaged Fairchild
[1264.48] Surveys Incorporated to photograph from
[1266.559] the air some 500 square miles in the
[1269.679] Myrtle Beach area. Yes. When the photo
[1272.08] runs had been flown and the prints
[1274.0] developed, a Fairchild engineer in the
[1276.72] company's New York office, uh, Edwin H.
[1280.159] Coralate noted the presence of numerous
[1283.36] mystifying elliptical features, some
[1286.159] small, some very large, all possessing
[1289.12] such an amazing geometrical perfection
[1292.0] that they seemed artificial,
[1294.08] particularly some that seemed to be
[1296.24] marching in rank across the wooded plane
[1299.36] headed towards the ocean strand. I've
[1301.44] got a great and you I'm sure you've seen
[1303.679] this one. Uh yeah, I'm sure you've seen
[1306.159] this one. Mhm. And then I just added
[1309.799] some alignments
[1313.24] here. But I think that could what they
[1316.799] he might have been referring to when
[1318.24] he's talking about almost like marching
[1319.76] in rank. Mhm.
[1323.679] Yeah. I think that's now the Louiswis
[1325.2] Ocean uh Bays Heritage Preserve. Oh,
[1328.559] okay. They started preserving it since
[1330.96] then. and they took those pictures and
[1332.559] uh um like I said it was back during the
[1334.96] the Dust Bowl era and that it's Yeah.
[1337.679] Yeah. It's really it's been preserved so
[1339.28] it's really the vegetation has been
[1340.799] allowed to come back and kind of
[1342.4] preserve those Carolina bays which is
[1343.919] nice.
[1345.96] Yeah. So careful study of the photograph
[1349.84] showed that the origin of these bays
[1351.52] involve problems of extraordinary
[1353.2] interest and I don't think that I think
[1355.44] it's still just the origin problem is
[1358.48] still of extraordinary interest. Yes.
[1360.96] Yes. Yes. From 193 it's been almost 100
[1363.44] years 90 94 years since that that paper
[1366.4] came out. Yeah. And they are still it's
[1369.36] still being debated and argued about
[1371.76] still today. Yeah. Okay. So I'll tell
[1374.88] you where when I kind of set it down and
[1377.44] moved on. I got to tell you how I moved
[1378.88] on though is because I was thinking okay
[1382.08] with that orientation that we just saw.
[1385.28] Of course, we now know from further
[1387.2] research and and I certainly realized
[1389.28] this by the time I become familiar with
[1391.039] the Georgia bays was that not only the
[1394.32] eccentricity of the ellipse decreases as
[1397.679] you're shifting around, so does the axle
[1400.64] alignment. So you've got more almost
[1403.36] like the ones we just looked at are
[1405.2] almost 45 degrees northwests southeast.
[1408.08] When you get into the Georgia bays,
[1410.0] they're almost north south plus they're
[1412.64] flattened. I mean the the I'm the the
[1414.48] the ellipticity is not nearly as
[1417.96] extreme. They're much rounder in the
[1420.96] Carolina bay. I mean the Georgia version
[1423.039] of the bays. Um which struck me as
[1426.88] peculiar which led me back then to think
[1430.0] well you got an epicenter. Yeah. You
[1433.28] know that's radiating. Now I didn't know
[1434.799] about back then I didn't know about the
[1437.28] the topographic depressions out in is it
[1440.4] Nebraska? Nebraska. Yeah. Kansas and
[1442.559] Nebraska. Yeah, Kansas and Nebraska. I
[1444.559] had no idea that those existed. Um, but
[1448.88] what I Okay, so if I thought, okay,
[1451.52] let's suppose now, of course, by this
[1453.44] time I've become fairly familiar with
[1455.52] the Tangusa event. So I started
[1458.64] thinking, well, if if and this is and
[1461.679] then I discovered the work of William
[1463.2] Prowy. Prrowy pretty much had a scenario
[1467.6] that was similar to Tangusa, aerial
[1471.679] detonations rather than actual impacts.
[1474.72] Is that what you recall? Um, yeah, I I
[1477.84] remember hearing that in the uh that
[1480.72] came out in the 80s, I think, too. Yeah,
[1482.72] I think so.
[1484.4] Well, Prrowy's Proud's work was in the
[1486.96] 50s because you remember it was um maybe
[1490.48] I'm confusing him with something else,
[1491.52] but yeah, John, there was a controversy
[1494.039] between Prrowy's school of thought and
[1497.799] um Johnson, he was the like the dean of
[1502.32] was it geomorphology at Harvard
[1504.64] somewhere? He was like considered the
[1506.48] dean of geomorphology and he wrote this
[1509.279] big toe called the origin of the
[1511.039] Carolina Bays, right? And so you had the
[1514.159] terrestrials and the celestials. And so
[1517.52] that that controversy pretty much raged
[1520.4] during the 50s. Here we go. Awesome.
[1522.96] Look at this.
[1525.6] Yeah. So there was that. Yeah. I also
[1528.32] have this here that shows the alignment,
[1529.84] all that, too. But we'll we're talking
[1531.2] about this right here.
[1537.0] Okay. Why don't you Yeah. take a minute
[1540.64] to talk about this controversy between
[1543.84] because we just mentioned the you know
[1545.84] going back to the 50s when it was you
[1548.4] know you had the catastrophists who were
[1550.08] the celestials and you had the the
[1552.4] gradualists. Yeah. Well I mean really
[1554.799] since since the 1930s it has been back
[1557.2] and forth back and forth. Um, you know,
[1559.679] the big the biggest problem was when
[1561.6] when Shrivever Mountain and Shrivever
[1563.76] came out and they, you know,
[1565.799] assumed, you know, meteor impacts that
[1568.24] these were these were actually uh, you
[1570.08] know, from a cosmic impact. Um, everyone
[1573.76] went out looking for looking for meteor,
[1576.559] you know, meteorites and they didn't
[1578.96] they didn't find any, right? And so,
[1581.52] right. And so the the terrestrial
[1583.72] uniformitarianism explanation uh started
[1586.32] popping up and and since then I mean we
[1588.24] have just had dozens of different
[1590.32] hypotheses that have popped up you know
[1592.88] and and they've just gone back and forth
[1594.64] everything from spring basins to uh you
[1597.12] know fish fish nests gigantic fish nets.
[1600.72] Um but yeah there's been a lot of back
[1603.76] and forth uh over the past few decades a
[1606.08] few decades. I mean like I said it's
[1607.36] been almost a hundred years of back and
[1609.84] forth back and forth. Um, and right now
[1612.72] we they've settled on a a terrestrial
[1615.919] hypothesis, you know, at least the
[1617.6] academic community has. Uhhuh. Um,
[1622.72] well, that's okay. So, let's see. We've
[1625.2] got you've got Oh, wow. A lot of uh
[1628.799] hypotheses here. Yeah. Yeah.
[1632.88] Giant beaver ponds. I
[1636.0] that's that one is from uh a guy from
[1638.159] the University of Georgia and and I know
[1640.559] you know him.
[1643.32] Um Oh, I wish I could remember his name.
[1646.64] That's it. That's it. That's him. Yeah.
[1648.799] Yeah. That's his hypothesis. And And
[1650.72] this one actually kind of goes along
[1652.24] with with uh your idea of of um bolides
[1656.559] exploding in the sky. Uh because that's
[1658.4] where that's where his hypothesis goes
[1660.4] with it is that it was um uh bows in the
[1664.159] sky that flash steamed beaver ponds and
[1667.84] uh it was the flash steaming of the
[1669.12] beaver ponds that created the Carolina
[1670.799] bays. So yeah, like I said that that was
[1673.12] from co is cobras. Yep. Cobras. Yeah.
[1676.32] Yeah. I actually did interview went out
[1678.24] there and met him and interviewed him in
[1679.679] the 90s. Is he still with us? Do you
[1682.24] know? Yep, he is. Yeah. And he's very
[1684.399] eager to talk about beaver ponds, that's
[1686.48] for sure.
[1687.64] Well, seemed like there were an awful
[1689.919] lot of beavers.
[1691.679] Yeah, Casteries. The big beaver. Yeah,
[1695.2] the big ones. That's right. The big
[1696.88] ones. I don't know. I'm I'm not
[1699.36] convinced of that one, but No, no, he's
[1702.32] he's pretty convinced, though. And
[1703.44] that's the thing about these the
[1704.64] Carolina Bays is that, you know, there
[1706.559] are a lot of people that have their own
[1708.08] ideas and they become very focused on
[1710.559] those ideas and it's hard to change
[1711.76] minds even today. you know, even amongst
[1714.32] the the US guys that think that it was
[1716.64] impact related, you know, it's very
[1718.399] difficult to get somebody to change
[1719.84] their mind about about their ideas. So,
[1722.48] and I guess that's human nature, but
[1724.88] Well, I'm I'm definitely still leading
[1728.48] leaning in that direction. Um, but you
[1732.0] know, the variations now, what what is
[1734.039] Devias? What is let me how do you say
[1736.399] his name again? Davius. Davis. Yeah,
[1739.279] Michael Davius. Does he think that they
[1742.159] are impact related somehow. Um so yes
[1746.159] yeah he does. Um
[1748.279] so his thinking is that there was an
[1751.12] impact into the Laurentide ice sheet um
[1754.0] over Sagenov Bay. Uh but his dating goes
[1758.159] back 780,000 years. It goes back to the
[1761.52] mid plyosene. Okay. Um, and and I'll
[1765.84] have to come back to that because I kind
[1767.84] of agree with him now. And and I'll talk
[1769.52] about why I agree with him, which I kind
[1772.559] of brought up with you a little bit, you
[1773.919] know, earlier because I think it has
[1776.159] there's some emian
[1778.159] u inner title uh that that plays a part
[1781.2] in that story, but uh we'll talk we'll
[1782.799] get into that later on. Um but yeah, he
[1785.12] thinks that there was an impact into the
[1787.44] ice sheet and it sent a um what do you
[1791.12] call it? Actually have it on the slide.
[1792.76] It's a cavitated ejecta regalith
[1796.96] blanket. So it was basically the impact
[1799.12] hit the Michigan sandstones and mixed
[1802.32] with the glacial ice meltwater and it
[1805.44] wasn't chunks of ice that flew from the
[1807.6] from the impact site, but it was more of
[1810.0] a a sand flood of of water and sand that
[1813.36] flooded from that area. Kind of like a
[1814.799] blanket, you know, that covered that
[1816.48] covered the area. and that it was the
[1818.32] cavitated bubbles that created the
[1820.559] elliptical shapes that we find with
[1821.919] Carolina Bays. Um, you know, I I don't
[1826.32] know where to take all of that. Uh, you
[1829.2] know, there there's, like I said, that's
[1830.48] his idea and he's he's pretty firm. Um
[1833.44] my I guess my first question regarding
[1836.72] that is if it was that long
[1838.84] ago, you know, because some of them
[1841.24] certainly strike me as being quite
[1843.36] pristine and I would try to imagine, you
[1846.0] know, the the the the landscape changes
[1848.08] and the vegetation changes and all of
[1850.96] that over almost 800,000 years, would
[1854.0] would we still see? So, so here's the
[1857.12] thing. Here's the and again, I want to
[1858.72] talk about this a little bit later on,
[1859.919] but
[1862.159] the shorelines that were created at the
[1865.52] uh at the last interglacial period,
[1867.52] right? Which was the 125,000 years ago.
[1870.96] Right. Right. At least that was a peak.
[1873.2] And so the shoreline that was created at
[1875.12] that time, there are no Carolina bays
[1877.2] below that shoreline. So if you go to
[1879.52] the coast and and you know, we I could
[1882.48] pull up Let me go and do it. I'll pull
[1884.159] up the uh the pictures from Myrtle
[1886.64] Beach. There you go. All right.
[1892.919] So yeah. So so if we go back to the last
[1896.64] um the last interglacial which is uh MIS
[1899.76] stage 5E that's the EMA right that's the
[1902.559] emian and I think the latest dating is
[1904.96] from 116,000 to 129,000
[1909.2] years ago. Right. Right. Yeah. I thought
[1912.08] 13,000 that's interesting because
[1914.159] younger dus to now you know. Anyways.
[1918.399] Yeah. But well, well, just like now, I
[1920.159] mean, we're in the middle of an
[1921.159] interglacial. Actually, we could talk
[1923.279] about this too later on because I don't
[1924.48] think we're in the middle of an
[1925.44] interglacial. I think we're at the end
[1926.88] of an interglacial. Uh, which you
[1929.039] probably agree. I probably do agree with
[1932.0] that. Yes. Because there's only one
[1933.36] thing worse than global warming. And and
[1935.36] that's global cooling. And I think we're
[1937.2] heading there. Yeah. So, we that might
[1939.679] be a whole another podcast, but we'll
[1941.08] we'll cover that later. Um anyways that
[1944.88] you know just like now we have a
[1946.32] shoreline and that's being created right
[1947.84] now you know during this holene time
[1949.519] frame. Yeah. Uh and you go to the beach
[1951.6] today you know everyone goes and lays
[1952.799] out at the beach and you know puts their
[1954.159] toes in the sand. U but that sand is
[1956.32] being worked over by tidal forces you
[1958.399] know every single day when tides come up
[1960.159] and the the waves crash and and you know
[1962.08] it's moving sand up and down the beaches
[1963.6] through long shore drift and you know
[1965.44] that's happening right now and it's been
[1966.799] happening for around 5,000 years 6,000
[1969.0] years. Well, the same thing was
[1971.24] happening 125,000 years ago or, you
[1974.08] know, the peak of the Emian
[1975.76] interglacial.
[1977.76] And those shorelines are still there.
[1979.6] Those shorelines, you can actually go
[1981.2] and find them today. And that's that's
[1983.2] why I say, you know, if you go back
[1985.519] 125,000 years and find that shoreline,
[1988.32] you know, and it's and it's a pretty
[1989.679] stark difference uh from what's below
[1991.76] it. If if they can go back 125,000
[1994.32] years, I think we can go back 400,000
[1996.72] years. We we can we can go back 400,000
[1999.039] years and find that shoreline. If we
[2001.12] could find those shorelines, which are
[2002.96] just made of sand and and pete and
[2004.72] things like that, but if those
[2005.6] shorelines are there, then so can the
[2007.519] Carolina bays. They could have survived
[2008.88] that long, too. Um, do you do you see
[2011.44] what I'm saying?
[2013.279] Yeah. So, if when we look at So, if we
[2016.559] look at the coast, this is actually in
[2019.76] Georgia. I got this from uh from um a
[2023.039] field trip guy from Belast State
[2024.96] University. They would take their
[2026.0] students to uh different stops on their
[2028.399] way to the beach and they would look at
[2030.0] these pleaosene age shorelines. Um and
[2033.36] again the last two times that sea levels
[2036.159] were higher than today was during the
[2038.32] emian and then the last time there was
[2040.799] there was ice ages in between but the
[2042.72] last time it was higher than today uh
[2044.96] was 400,000 years ago or actually the
[2047.039] last time it was higher than it was
[2048.32] during the emian was 400,000 years ago.
[2051.28] Um and we can find that shoreline too.
[2053.28] That's the uh that's the Talbot um the
[2056.32] the Talbot formation. Um which you can
[2060.079] see I have a pin there close to where
[2061.919] that Talbot formation is. Um and so so
[2065.44] again this is the the Google Earth image
[2067.599] of that. But when we click over to the
[2069.28] uh to the you know click over to the the
[2072.96] LAR again this is LAR provided by
[2074.72] Michael Davis. Uh you can you can get it
[2076.879] on on uh centto.org and you can pull it
[2079.919] up with your Google Google Earth.
[2081.839] Everyone can. Okay. Yeah. Uh, but we see
[2084.079] a very clear difference. All those red
[2086.24] dots are are Carolina bays that Michael
[2088.0] Davis has marked. And we see a clear
[2090.48] difference of where we see Carolina bays
[2092.879] and where we don't see Carolina bays.
[2094.96] Um, and again, anything under that
[2098.4] Pamlico Terrace, anything under 30 feet
[2101.28] in elevation, which was how much higher
[2103.2] the sea levels were 125,000 years ago,
[2105.52] there are no Carolina bays there
[2107.119] anywhere in this whole area.
[2109.48] Um, so I mean I I
[2112.64] I I don't know how you take that, but
[2114.56] you know, if these were formed by some
[2116.96] form of impact, uh then we should see
[2119.599] them all the way to the coast because
[2120.96] sea levels haven't risen that high in
[2123.119] 125,000 years. So where are all of those
[2125.839] Carolina bays, you know, in in most of
[2128.88] this area if we click back? I mean, they
[2130.72] should be all over the place. All over
[2132.16] the place here, but but they're they're
[2133.839] missing from from the landscape. Where
[2137.04] you really see it is in Myrtle Beach.
[2139.119] And this is actually the area that you
[2140.56] were talking about a little while ago,
[2142.4] uh, which is now the preserve. Um, we
[2145.28] might even be able to find those. Uh, I
[2147.599] think they're right off to the to the
[2149.68] right. Are those the Carolina bays? You
[2150.88] were looking at the the what you call
[2152.56] the train.
[2154.32] Um, so this is an area that's in Myrtle
[2157.28] Beach. Um, which the reason why I use
[2159.599] this and the reason why I pull it up is
[2161.04] because we see the holysine age
[2164.16] shorelines acting on the plyene beaches
[2167.2] right now. A lot of people don't realize
[2168.88] it, but when you go to the beach, most
[2170.48] of the most of the barrier islands are
[2173.2] divided into two different category.
[2175.359] There's two different ages. You have the
[2176.96] holysine beach and then you have a
[2178.64] plyosene half of the island. Uh but here
[2181.2] in Myrtle Beach, it's such a quick drop
[2183.92] off that the
[2185.32] holysine, you know, interglacial is is
[2188.32] actually wearing away at the plyosene
[2190.4] part of the island. And um so when you
[2193.2] click on when you click on the uh the
[2195.56] LAR, you can see a stark difference of
[2198.0] where the Carolina Bays are and where
[2199.52] they're not, you know, and the higher up
[2201.52] you go in elevation, the the clearer
[2203.28] those Carolina bays become. Uh and
[2205.92] again, this whole area that's that's
[2207.52] kind of in the green and orange in the
[2209.32] middle, there's really well- definfined
[2211.359] Carolina bays there. And those are the
[2212.72] oldest terraces. Those are, you know,
[2214.72] they date back that's like a million
[2217.599] years old, actually. you know, that's
[2219.359] it's been the last time that it was uh
[2221.599] covered in ocean water was over a
[2222.88] million years ago. So, there was like
[2223.839] three stages. A million years ago,
[2225.599] 400,000 years ago, 125,000 years ago.
[2228.56] And I have that marked here to help you
[2231.599] kind of see it better. Um, but you know,
[2234.24] these
[2235.4] were past barrier islands, right? Right.
[2239.76] And so, so where we don't see the
[2241.599] Carolina Bays, you know, where are they?
[2243.04] Why aren't they there? If if they were
[2245.24] created during the late plyosine, you
[2248.4] know, if they were at, you know, if they
[2249.92] were younger dice age. Uhhuh. Yeah.
[2254.359] So, so let's So, so where is the um
[2259.52] paleo shoreline? Let's say close to, you
[2262.4] know, the late pleaene paleo shoreline.
[2264.56] Is it this? So, I have it marked in red
[2267.359] and black. And and you have to keep in
[2269.2] mind too, I guess, you know, when you're
[2271.119] looking at the LAR, it's it's colorcoded
[2273.76] by um the the colors represent
[2276.96] elevation. So, it's almost like looking
[2278.88] at a LAR and a topographic map at the
[2281.359] same time. Um but as you go up, each
[2285.44] each color is one meter and they repeat
[2288.64] every 10 meters. So, when you see red,
[2290.4] the next time you see red is 10 meters
[2291.92] up. But in this area, we're going up
[2294.079] onto an onto an old barrier island and
[2296.8] then down into the back bay into the
[2299.92] what used to be a salt marsh 400,000
[2302.88] years or 125,000 years ago. Uh and then
[2305.839] back up, you know, and then you go
[2307.839] across that really old barrier island. I
[2310.0] don't These don't have a pointer, do
[2311.599] they? Yeah, I I see your cursor. Okay.
[2315.68] So yeah, all of this right here, um,
[2318.16] that's the oldest, like that's that's
[2319.92] been around for, I mean, since a million
[2322.4] years. It was it was covered up in ocean
[2323.76] water at least a million years ago. U,
[2325.68] but it hasn't been covered underwater
[2327.92] since then. Um, everything that's in
[2330.64] between black and red, like even this
[2332.16] back end, this is the backside of a
[2334.16] barrier island. This would have been the
[2336.16] the salt marsh when sea levels were a
[2338.32] lot higher. And we do find Carolina bays
[2340.72] there. We do find Carolina bays in
[2342.48] between these two lines. Um, but they're
[2345.2] heavily eroded. If you if you start
[2346.56] looking at a bunch of these, they're
[2347.68] they're really heavily heavily eroded,
[2349.359] which makes sense if it was a salt marsh
[2351.359] when it was a barrier island. Um, and
[2354.079] one easy way to test this, and I I you
[2356.32] know, we need to get something going on
[2357.599] that, but if we just take cores in these
[2359.599] in these um, uh, Carolina bays, uh, we
[2363.2] should be able to find the layers of of
[2366.0] mud, the layers of clay, you know, the
[2368.32] gumbo clay that forms in those marshes.
[2370.8] Uh but then you drop back off, you know,
[2372.64] into the
[2374.72] uh what was under the estuary uh in the
[2378.079] in, you know, in the water and it was
[2379.76] it's all gone again. So So where did
[2382.64] those Carolina bays go? You know, were
[2384.24] they were they there and they got washed
[2386.16] away during the last
[2387.8] two interglacial cycles where sea levels
[2390.72] were higher or are they just not there?
[2393.2] I mean, I don't there's some of these if
[2394.88] if you look up here, like some of these
[2396.24] are truncated in half. Here's one that
[2398.079] was actually this one. I should
[2399.92] highlight it around because this one's
[2401.92] um truncated right in half and water was
[2404.48] flowing out of it at one time. But
[2406.64] anything but anything on the seawward
[2408.88] side or the windward side of these
[2410.4] islands, it's gone. Like there's no
[2411.68] Carolina bays there that the ocean has
[2413.52] risen and washed those washed those
[2415.76] clean. Yeah. So are you saying then that
[2419.119] there could have been bays on the
[2421.359] exposed coastal plane during late
[2423.839] glacial maximum when sea levels were
[2425.92] lower? Uh yes. Yeah, if if if they were
[2430.16] formed older, like I said, not during if
[2433.76] if they were formed as early as a
[2435.52] younger dus, we should see them all over
[2438.0] all over this whole area. Um, the fact
[2440.88] that we only see them on these higher
[2442.56] terraces, I think says that they are a
[2444.96] lot older. I think that they're a lot
[2446.8] older. I think they maybe I think
[2447.92] Michael Davis might be right with his
[2449.28] age of of mid plyosine. Have you have
[2452.32] you done any research into the mid
[2453.52] plyosine?
[2456.079] Not as much as I have. the right the the
[2459.28] end of place. It's pretty interesting. I
[2461.76] need I need to do a lot more research
[2463.44] into it as well because I you know I got
[2465.28] into this because of the younger Dryus
[2467.44] and and so I was fully on board with
[2469.359] Antonio Zamor's ideas of of Carolina
[2472.319] Bays being
[2474.24] um you know younger Dryus in age. Yeah.
[2476.96] Uh but then it was it was seeing this
[2479.44] and it was actually an argument I was
[2480.8] having with Michael Davis. We were
[2482.319] talking about how he he was trying to
[2484.319] explain to me that the the coastal plane
[2486.16] is pool table flat and and I live on the
[2488.4] coast. I live down here in in coastal
[2490.16] Georgia, not too far from, you know,
[2491.44] about five five hours away. Okay. And um
[2495.04] I was like, you know, it's not it's not.
[2497.119] He was saying it was pool table flat.
[2498.56] And I was like, it's not. We have we
[2500.0] have ancient barrier islands, you know,
[2501.52] where you're driving down the road and
[2502.8] you go up onto a sand hill and then you
[2504.72] go back down into a swampy area and then
[2506.16] back up into a sand hill. You know,
[2507.359] that's that's all over the coast. And
[2509.28] when I went to go prove him wrong about
[2511.04] these these uh ancient barrier islands,
[2514.56] that's when I saw like where all the
[2516.48] places we don't see Carolina bays. And
[2518.48] that kind of shifted my whole thinking.
[2520.16] When you start looking at where you
[2521.44] don't see Carolina bays, it's like,
[2523.359] well, where do they go? They should be
[2524.64] here and they're not here. And the only
[2526.48] explanation is that the sea levels rose
[2528.96] and washed them away.
[2531.92] So that was that's what that was a big
[2533.599] turning point for me. Now, there are a
[2534.72] few places where we um there are an
[2537.2] exception to the rule, but those have
[2539.359] very good explanations on why we see
[2541.04] them. Like for instance, the Delm Marva
[2543.0] Peninsula. Um when you you know if Do
[2546.72] you see any Carolina bays there?
[2550.16] And I know there are some, but they're
[2551.92] hard to see. So when you click out on
[2553.119] that light,
[2555.68] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, wow. Right. So
[2558.4] this whole center this whole center
[2560.4] ridge has Carolina bays all over it. But
[2562.4] they're completely missing from this
[2564.4] whole area right here. I do want to
[2566.24] point out though that this is lower than
[2567.839] 30 feet. And 30 feet is about on
[2570.0] average, you know, the um you know how
[2572.24] much higher sea levels were 125,000
[2574.319] years ago during the Yeah. Um this area
[2576.96] is actually lower than that. It's lower
[2578.64] than what we would see at Myrtle Beach.
[2581.44] But there's very well doumented sub
[2584.16] substance happening right here in all
[2586.56] all along the Delm Marva Peninsula. It's
[2588.4] sinking, right? Okay. And so if it was
[2591.76] sinking, if it was much higher in the
[2593.28] past and it's been sinking, then that
[2594.88] makes sense that you know the the the
[2596.96] sea levels rose, they wash those
[2598.4] Carolina bays away and now it has sunk
[2600.8] below that level because of the
[2603.119] subsidance. Another area is Charleston.
[2606.16] You know, South Carolina. Again, this
[2607.599] Charleston should be covered in Carolina
[2609.119] base all all up and down the coast,
[2611.359] right? Uhhuh. And when you click on that
[2614.319] and you you see that
[2615.8] LAR, everything lower than those plyina
[2619.44] shorelines, they're missing. They're
[2620.8] completely gone. A lot of this area is
[2622.88] actually higher than 30 feet, which is,
[2625.44] you know, it should been exposed at that
[2627.04] time. U but this Charleston is is well
[2630.0] known for having tectonic uplift. So
[2632.0] it's actually rising which is opposite
[2634.24] of what's happening in the Del Del Marva
[2636.96] Peninsula. So that area is sinking. This
[2639.52] area is rising and we actually see you
[2642.4] know those shorelines at different
[2643.839] elevations but you still those Carolina
[2645.92] bays are on those high terraces and
[2647.68] there's none on the lower terraces.
[2650.48] And at what elevation then do you see
[2652.88] that transition from absence of Carolina
[2656.319] bays to prolific Carolina bays? It's
[2659.28] it's so if you're looking at elevation,
[2662.079] if we go back to the Myrtle Beach area,
[2663.839] you see it at uh the 9 meters or 30
[2666.48] feet, there's none. Like if you go all
[2668.48] up and down the East Coast, the only
[2669.76] place that you find them is in the
[2671.76] Delmrava Peninsula and some places in
[2673.76] New Jersey, which are experiencing
[2676.319] subsidance. It's actually it's sinking.
[2678.0] So that's the only place that we see
[2679.28] them. And uh but there's nowhere else.
[2682.56] Anything below that 30 feet, they're
[2684.48] they're gone.
[2686.16] You do find some between 30 ft and 42
[2689.2] feet, but that's the area between the
[2691.28] Talba and the Pamelo formation, but
[2693.44] they're heavily eroded. And then if you
[2695.76] go above the Talba formation, they're
[2698.56] really well defined. Really well
[2700.64] defined. Okay, so this whole area, you
[2703.839] see lots of Carolina bays. There are
[2706.319] some in the between the black and the
[2708.0] red lines. And I know this is like
[2709.599] Microsoft
[2712.2] Paint. I need to get a better uh uh a
[2715.76] graphics team to to help out with some
[2717.599] of this. Sure. But but um yeah, there's
[2721.68] definitely a transition between these
[2723.359] different terraces as you go up and
[2724.96] down. Uh you know, comparing the the
[2728.24] seawward and the windward and the
[2729.92] leeward side of these ancient barrier
[2732.119] islands. Um and I think that's very
[2735.319] telling. You know, at least at least it
[2737.68] it tells it tells me that they have to
[2739.44] be older than the younger dus at least.
[2744.0] Otherwise, we should see Carolina bays
[2745.68] all over this area. Why do we see so
[2747.28] many of them right here, but none in
[2749.839] this area in red where that's prime?
[2751.92] It's a prime location to see a bunch of
[2753.359] them and we don't see that. So, let's
[2755.92] recapitulate the area in red where you
[2757.76] don't see them. Now, you so you've got a
[2759.119] band of them you see here. Now, this is
[2761.04] is this the Talbot formation?
[2764.0] um which okay yeah let me go back to
[2766.88] this let me go back to uh I said that's
[2768.8] not a great example because it's sinking
[2770.16] in that area but so the area in blue
[2772.4] right here is the area between the uh
[2775.44] Pamico and the Talba formation okay
[2778.64] Talba the area in green and yellow where
[2780.96] you're you're scrolling over that right
[2782.48] now yeah no no that's the um that's the
[2785.92] penal that's that's the oldest one okay
[2788.48] penal pen hollowway okay
[2790.88] and then which one is the Talbot then
[2794.079] that is that's that's the area in
[2795.92] between and then you have anything
[2797.92] that's that's surrounded in redu that's
[2800.16] the Pamlico anything surrounded in black
[2801.92] is the Talba formation so that is Tala
[2804.24] this area was exposed during a sense the
[2806.4] pen hollowway that's right uhhuh yeah so
[2809.599] this would have been a barrier island
[2811.28] 400,000 years ago this that's in red
[2815.2] would have been a barrier
[2816.92] island 125,000 years ago and that's why
[2819.599] I chose this location because again we
[2821.359] have it's a barrier well It's not even a
[2822.96] barrier island, but we have a beach
[2824.88] erosion taking place right here next to
[2826.72] where that island is. If I go back to
[2830.44] um here, you know, this you see the two
[2834.079] this is Sapo Island in Georgia. Here it
[2836.72] is actually right here. And this is the
[2838.319] mainland. This is uh this was the
[2839.92] barrier island 125,000 years ago. Um and
[2844.0] so this is actually divided into two
[2845.68] spots as well. So we have a little bit
[2848.48] of both in this one. And same thing
[2850.88] here. And you've got uh
[2853.48] the um Bearer Island Allen from 400,000
[2856.72] years ago and then the Back Marsh from
[2858.319] 400,000 years ago as well. And again, we
[2860.4] we see lacking Carolina bays. And then
[2862.319] when you go all the way back here, this
[2863.839] is that Penn. So this would have been
[2866.079] the beach a million years ago. And
[2867.92] there's Carolina bays all over the place
[2869.44] there. So yeah.
[2875.079] Now is there Okay. So the the immediate
[2880.359] area immediately windward I guess you'd
[2883.839] say of the ocean that you that you're
[2886.319] scrolling over right now that I just
[2888.24] want to get get the terminology clear in
[2890.16] my head. That's the Pamelo coat. That's
[2892.72] what you've got right against the ocean.
[2894.8] Right. Well no no no. Right against the
[2896.319] oceans now it's holine. So this is all
[2898.72] age. Yeah. Yeah. Pamote we see there is
[2902.8] 125,000. So it's emian. Yes. And and
[2906.079] that's the Pamela where the between the
[2907.92] red lines. Yeah. So So from the beach up
[2910.48] to this red line is about a 30 foot
[2912.559] dune. I mean you go up about 30 feet.
[2914.88] Yeah. And there are no bays on that. Not
[2918.0] below it. No. Not below it. There are a
[2920.4] few bays. Yeah, there are a few bays. Uh
[2923.2] there's a few truncated bays. You can
[2924.72] kind of see how heavily eroded these.
[2926.0] Like there's one right here. There's one
[2927.119] right here. There's one right here. But
[2928.72] they're I mean they are almost
[2929.76] unrecognizable at this point, right? And
[2932.16] that could be because it's it's Myrtle
[2934.319] Beach. I mean this gets hammered by
[2935.92] hurricanes and things like that over and
[2937.359] over and over again. Um but this area
[2941.44] right yeah I guess that was my where I
[2944.24] was kind of like moving towards that my
[2946.64] question about you know storm surges
[2950.079] from hurricanes and potential tsunamis.
[2953.68] Yeah I mean I hear that a lot but it's
[2955.68] the entire east coast. I I I mean I'm
[2958.4] I'm picking these a couple locations,
[2959.92] but you can go all up and down the east
[2961.76] coast and and I mean anything below 30
[2965.119] feet gone. There there's no Carolina
[2967.28] base. And this would have all had to
[2968.48] have been within the past 6,000 years
[2970.16] because sea levels have only been this
[2972.0] high, you know, at least since the
[2973.76] younger dest. They've only been this
[2975.2] high for the past 6,000 years. And
[2977.04] there's there's I mean there's Native
[2979.119] American villages all up and down the
[2980.48] east coast and they were thriving during
[2982.079] that time. you know, there's the shell
[2983.839] rings and things that that date back
[2985.44] older than the pyramids and uh you know,
[2987.76] they were doing great. It wasn't like
[2988.96] they were getting hammered by hurricanes
[2990.319] and and you know, massive mass
[2992.64] destruction and things like that. They
[2994.0] were it was habitable. So,
[2998.16] okay. I know this this makes me like the
[3000.24] most unpopular
[3004.52] person, but this this was something I
[3006.88] did present this uh in the at the cosmic
[3009.2] summit 23. Uh, it didn't go over very
[3011.52] well, but it's like I said, it is what
[3013.04] it is. And and it it was enough to cause
[3016.079] me to change my mind. I you know, I did
[3017.68] think that these were younger dus
[3019.359] related for a really long time, but this
[3021.68] was is solid enough evidence for me that
[3024.4] I had to change my mind. And I really I
[3026.559] I think that Michael Davis might be on
[3029.839] to something with his a age dating. I
[3032.319] don't know about um the formation. I
[3034.559] don't know about that cavitated regalith
[3036.24] blanket idea.
[3037.76] I really kind of think Zamora has a good
[3039.52] idea with that. Um I don't know if you
[3041.2] want to talk about that or not, but um
[3043.04] his his whole hypothesis is that there
[3044.8] was an impact into the ice sheet uh that
[3047.28] kicked huge chunks of ice and they came
[3049.839] crashing back down and formed um
[3051.599] penetration funnels. They they formed um
[3053.92] conic sections and that's where these
[3055.599] ellipses come from uh is from from the
[3058.4] ellipse I mean from the impact from
[3060.16] these chunks of ice. And I'm on board
[3062.88] with that. I actually I've been working
[3064.16] with him closely about, you know, trying
[3066.16] to find a way to quantify the quality of
[3068.8] these bays, you know, those perfect
[3070.24] ellipses. Uh we've been we've been
[3072.079] working on a way to kind of kind of
[3074.4] streamline that process a little bit and
[3076.079] just show, you know, the scientific
[3077.92] community that, you know, there's no way
[3080.319] with all of the environmental variables
[3082.24] that are out there that these can these
[3083.839] things can form form perfect ellipses
[3085.839] over and over and over again. And um
[3088.64] right. So so as far as a formation, I'm
[3091.92] I'm way more on board with Zamora's idea
[3094.8] uh than I am with Michael Davis's idea.
[3096.88] But I this right here tells me that
[3099.2] these Carolina bays have to be somewhere
[3100.96] between 400,000 years and a million
[3103.64] years. And there are there is a major
[3106.4] impact that took place right around
[3108.64] 800,000 years ago at the mid plyene
[3111.2] transition. And we find the a tectites
[3113.2] all over Australia and Asia. Uhhuh. and
[3117.839] uh you know that they they for the
[3120.16] longest time they can't figure out where
[3121.52] that impact is. Uh there's been some
[3123.68] talk about where uh I think they're
[3125.599] looking at some areas like in Indonesia
[3128.0] uh but there are some people looking
[3129.68] into this you know basic using physics
[3133.119] uh ballistic missile re-entry physics
[3134.96] and things like that. Um Tim Harris is
[3136.96] being I don't know if you met Tim I
[3138.24] don't think he was at that at that um I
[3140.48] don't believe so. No, but um yeah, so so
[3144.96] he's been using the ballistic missile
[3146.48] re-entry physics to, you know, where we
[3149.04] find a a tectite, which by the way, a
[3151.599] tectite is basically like a meteorite,
[3153.28] but it's you know, originated from from
[3156.559] Earth material, right? And so we can't
[3159.68] find where that came from, but we know
[3161.28] that they we know the timing. We know
[3162.88] that it was around 800,000 780 something
[3165.119] thousand years ago. Uh and they link it
[3168.16] to that that event in Michigan. And they
[3170.96] think that it was in the Sagena Bay
[3172.559] area. I think it was in over Michigan. I
[3175.839] think it was actually um part of the uh
[3180.4] formation of the M Michigan basin. Um I
[3184.0] don't know if you want I don't know if
[3184.8] you want to go there or not. Now that
[3186.76] you're I'm Hey, I'm willing to go pretty
[3189.76] much anywhere, but
[3191.92] uh but now you're not saying this would
[3194.4] have been what 780,000 years ago you're
[3197.359] talking about. Yeah. And now, like I
[3199.28] said, what started this conversation and
[3200.72] kind of made me jump the gun a little
[3201.92] bit was that these shorelines are there
[3204.4] and we can go back and we can find them
[3206.079] and we can date those shorelines. And if
[3208.16] we can do that with shorelines, then why
[3209.68] can't we do those with Carolina bays?
[3211.68] You know, the Carolina bays are sitting
[3213.04] right on them. You know, we see where
[3215.119] they are and where they're not and and I
[3218.0] don't why can't we use those same dates
[3219.68] for those for those shorelines to date
[3221.68] those Carolina bays? Uhhuh. Yeah. So, a
[3225.2] quote here by Prrowy, William Prrowy.
[3227.96] Um he says the similarity of development
[3230.88] and the condition of preservation of
[3233.04] bays in all parts of the bay country
[3235.599] seems to indicate that they are all
[3237.52] about the same age. Elliptical sand rim
[3240.72] bays are not being formed anywhere in
[3242.64] the world at the present time as far as
[3244.68] known. And I think that's probably still
[3247.44] accurate isn't it? I mean can we point
[3249.2] or can anybody point and say okay here's
[3252.0] an incipient bay. Here's one in the
[3254.559] early stages of formation. Here's No.
[3256.72] Yeah. No, no, no. Yeah, that's right.
[3259.28] Right. Yeah. They they can't they can't
[3260.96] show us different formation stages, you
[3263.359] know? They all form a an ellipse and
[3265.359] they were like, "Okay, we're done."
[3267.359] Yeah. And and again, as a as a science
[3270.16] teacher, we never did go into like
[3271.44] introductions, but I am a science
[3272.8] teacher. And like a really important
[3274.4] part of of teaching kids about science
[3277.04] is the scientific process and and using,
[3279.839] you know, forming hypotheses and and
[3281.68] testing your hypothesis and and and you
[3284.319] know, keeping track of your variables.
[3286.079] And that's not that's not been part of
[3288.72] of the current academic formation for
[3291.28] Kalab Bay. So, we didn't get into that
[3292.72] either. But right now,
[3294.52] the we jumped the gun big time, Randall.
[3297.76] Oh, right now the current academic
[3300.72] hypothesis for these Carolina bays is
[3302.8] that they were created by wind and
[3304.48] water. Uh basically ponds of of wind and
[3307.44] water over a long period of time. I
[3309.76] should close this and open it back up,
[3311.119] but
[3313.28] um yeah, every
[3316.0] I think I saw you had the uh um the uh
[3320.559] elliptical lakes up there on the coastal
[3323.0] plane up there on Alaska. Did I see
[3326.72] that? I did. Yeah. Yeah. My my uh
[3328.88] presentation at the Cosmic Summit this
[3330.48] year uh was titled Pseudo Carolina Bays.
[3333.44] I have to play off that word pseudo.
[3334.8] That that word that means false. Um
[3337.119] because over since I got involved with
[3339.119] Carolina Bays, I've had, you know, major
[3342.72] geologists and and and
[3345.44] For some reason, archaeologists get all
[3347.119] into this. I don't know why, but they
[3348.559] get they get very involved with Carolina
[3350.079] bays and um and and they always want to
[3353.359] call them, you know, thermocarst lakes
[3355.359] or they want to call them uh umh kettle
[3359.44] lakes or, you know, something like that.
[3360.96] And it's like, no, they're not. These
[3362.16] these are the whole purpose of my
[3364.16] presentation was to show that they are
[3366.4] so dominant in the landscape that all of
[3369.2] those other ones should be compared to
[3370.48] Carolina bays. like Carolina Bays should
[3372.4] be king as far as elliptical shaped
[3375.04] depressions and then all the other ones
[3376.48] those are pseudo Carolina bays that
[3378.0] that's they they shouldn't even count um
[3381.44] you know but right like I said right now
[3383.2] the uh the dominant hypothesis is that
[3385.28] wind and water created these
[3387.96] um and you know some some really highly
[3391.04] respected archaeologists are involved in
[3392.72] this uh they're actually members of the
[3394.559] comet research group so these are guys
[3396.079] that that are actively you know
[3398.64] researching a younger dus impact
[3401.28] Um, but they they are out of the
[3403.68] Carolina Bay business, you know, and and
[3406.0] Dr. Christopher Moore, who I I actually
[3407.599] went and participated with on a
[3409.839] archaeological uh archaeological dig.
[3412.48] Um, you see Micah Hanks there. He I
[3414.799] know. Yep. Yep. Yeah. I know Hanks well.
[3417.68] And I've been out in the field with
[3418.96] Christopher Moore visiting bays. That's
[3421.599] Well, that's right. It was part of that
[3422.799] same uh Carolina base summit that you
[3424.72] went with Davius and Zamora. And who
[3427.119] else? Who else was there? Uh, well, Dr.
[3430.72] I think was there Malcolm Lacmpt who did
[3433.68] a lot of the work on the younger Dus
[3435.599] impact. Yes.
[3438.64] So yeah I mean if if memory serves me
[3442.04] correctly Malcolm Lac was not a big fan
[3445.119] of of a cosmic impact uh creating
[3448.88] Carolina Bays. Again he's totally on
[3450.64] board with a cosmic impact causing the
[3452.88] younger Adrius. But when you bring up
[3455.04] Carolina Bays he he didn't like that.
[3457.76] Well, I know he had objections to Tony
[3460.319] Zamora's ideas for sure. I definitely
[3463.52] picked up on that. Now, I I didn't
[3465.839] necessarily pick up on that he was
[3468.24] totally opposed to an impact idea, but I
[3471.839] I wouldn't, you know, I could certainly
[3473.359] believe that. Uh I think at this point a
[3475.76] lot of them are going to be deferring to
[3478.24] Chris Moore's work, right? Yeah. You
[3480.88] know, for sure. Yeah. I mean, he's he is
[3483.04] the um uh you know, he's in charge of
[3487.28] the comet research group right now. So,
[3489.119] you know, he's he's the one who's
[3490.16] handling all that.
[3492.52] Um uh yeah, I think um I think it was um
[3496.72] Graham Hancock that called him out on
[3498.079] it, though, because I think he sent some
[3499.28] emails to Graham later after after you
[3502.0] guys met, and he wasn't very kind about
[3504.24] about him including uh Zamora's ideas in
[3507.52] his in his book. So, Oh, yeah. and and
[3510.88] and I think Graham made those public. So
[3514.24] yeah, that might have been I think that
[3515.68] was Malcolm Malcolm. That's what I mean.
[3517.52] Yeah, Malcolm Lock was there definitely
[3519.52] was some back and forth between those
[3521.119] two guys. Um right, I ran into him.
[3523.92] Where did I see him? Well, I saw him at
[3525.28] He was at the Cosmic Summit and and I
[3527.2] love the guy, you know. I know. I great
[3530.16] guy. I I do too. I you know, I wanted to
[3532.559] hang out with I was disappointed I
[3534.079] didn't get to hang out with him. I was
[3535.2] too. I didn't recognize him until it was
[3536.559] too late and I was like, "Ah, that's
[3537.92] Malcolm." and I I got to meet him at as
[3540.24] he was on his way out of the door. But
[3541.839] um yeah, we've we've we've exchanged
[3543.68] some emails since then. So that was
[3545.04] that's been good. Yeah. Um but um
[3548.0] anyways, yeah. So so you know, right now
[3549.92] we do have that the academic accepted
[3552.319] hypothesis is that every single one of
[3554.64] these Carolina bays had to have been a
[3556.48] pond and had to have been a pond long
[3559.359] enough for wind and and they call these
[3562.4] um uh catabatic winds from from the ice
[3566.24] sheet. uh you know because during the
[3568.079] peak of the ice age the the ice sheet
[3570.16] was much bigger and and the the
[3572.559] temperature the cold temperatures on the
[3574.079] top of the ice sheet would just rush off
[3575.52] the front of this this ice sheet and
[3577.04] blow across North America and and it was
[3579.2] hitting all of this is another part that
[3581.359] really kind of bothers me because
[3583.44] supposedly this this whole area would
[3585.28] have been very aid almost desert-like
[3587.28] and and when Chris Moore explains it to
[3588.96] me or explained it to me he almost
[3591.04] explained like an URG condition like a a
[3593.44] giant sand shifting sand dune field. Um,
[3596.96] and then if that's the case, then where
[3598.64] did all these ponds come from? I I just
[3600.319] I I never Well, that would be my first
[3601.839] question. Exactly. I And and that was
[3605.119] Well, you're familiar. You got I see you
[3606.72] got Cox Sarowski right there. Yeah.
[3609.52] Yeah. And they're saying he was right.
[3611.359] I'm very was very skeptical of his
[3613.52] ideas. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and I
[3615.04] actually to help explain that I I have a
[3617.52] whole slide on that as
[3619.319] well, but but yeah, I mean basically the
[3621.76] way so
[3624.72] that was
[3626.4] Go ahead. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I was
[3628.88] just seeing that diagram. I'm very
[3630.319] familiar with that diagram there. Yeah.
[3632.4] Which appeared in his work, which was
[3634.559] called the origin of the Carolina Bays,
[3636.72] right? Yeah. And Yeah. So he Yeah, you
[3641.359] just made a point there. Uh let's see. I
[3643.599] think I've got a quote from his work
[3645.44] right here. Uh yes, let's see. Um yeah,
[3649.44] here we go. This is from his
[3651.559] 1977 Carolina Bays, a comparison with
[3654.319] modern oriented lakes. That was that was
[3656.72] the year I was born, by the way. I was
[3658.72] born in 77. So this that's how long that
[3660.96] this has been. Yeah, they accept the
[3662.72] hypothesis. But go ahead. So that was a
[3664.64] special year then, huh? Yes.
[3667.839] At least as far as you're concerned.
[3671.48] Um, investigations of oriented lakes and
[3674.72] bays in these different geographic areas
[3678.24] have shown that the processes that
[3680.24] initially produced them apparently
[3682.96] differ.
[3684.28] Now, yeah, really? Okay. Well, however,
[3688.16] absolutely no evidence has been
[3690.52] encountered that would support an
[3693.16] extraterrestrial origin. Yeah. And he
[3696.559] then says incipient oriented lakes. And
[3699.119] I have this next part un underscored in
[3703.4] this. Incipient oriented lakes develop
[3706.96] in topographic
[3709.72] depressions created by coastal fluial
[3713.079] eolon solutioning glacial paraglacial
[3717.04] and perhaps some tectonic processes. So,
[3720.0] you've got everything in the kitchen
[3721.839] sink thrown in there, which to me
[3724.24] explains absolutely nothing about how
[3726.799] those topographic depressions already
[3730.079] pre-existed. They had you had to have
[3732.559] topographic depressions already there
[3735.599] according to this to this model. And to
[3738.96] test that, he started with a perfect
[3741.28] circular depression, right? He started
[3743.52] with he started with a B-shaped
[3745.04] depression, which I mean, what's that's
[3746.72] basically the definition of a crater.
[3748.799] So, I mean, he started with a a crater
[3751.52] to to recreate a Carolina and and even
[3753.92] under control conditions, he couldn't do
[3755.359] it. That's not a Carolina Bay. That's
[3756.88] not a perfect ellipse. It's more like a
[3759.359] football, right? So, I to me it baffles
[3762.16] me that this is still and and this, by
[3764.48] the way, was a uh a PhD dissertation
[3767.04] paper. This has never been peer-
[3768.319] reviewviewed, but this is the the main
[3770.88] accepted hypothesis for Carolina Bays
[3773.04] today.
[3774.559] Yeah. And I just I don't buy it. I've
[3776.559] got Yeah. Let's see. You stop share. I'm
[3779.44] gonna do a share. Yeah, sure. Yeah,
[3781.76] there you go. There you go.
[3784.72] And so for four hours, every what? Every
[3786.799] 15 minutes, he swapped the fan around
[3789.04] 180 degrees, which again, I don't know
[3791.28] what he was trying to represent by doing
[3793.52] that. Yeah. Because that's not natural.
[3797.599] No. Uh yeah. Here we go. See, I have
[3800.16] that developed right there. Cuz when I
[3802.16] read his work, that was the thing that
[3804.319] red flagged me. I go, "Okay, you're
[3807.2] already the for your theory, you're
[3809.28] already starting with topographic
[3810.88] depressions." Now, I might listen
[3813.92] credibly to an argument that says you
[3816.559] had ponds there whose shorelines were
[3819.359] modified by, you know, winds blowing
[3823.599] over a long period of time. Yes. But,
[3827.28] you know, again, I I had issues with
[3829.839] that. And and my main issue was what
[3832.24] I've underlined right here that they
[3834.64] developed in topographic depressions. So
[3836.799] then I'm like, well, where the hell did
[3838.079] the topographic depressions come from,
[3839.839] right? Well, as you can see here,
[3841.599] coastal fluial leolian solution and
[3844.0] glacial paraglacial. Well, that doesn't
[3846.72] explain anything when you when you bring
[3848.48] in every single possible geomorphic
[3851.28] force to get these things. Y how Yeah. I
[3855.039] I just I had problems with that. But
[3857.079] then to me um I didn't like this
[3860.16] attitude right here this in his summary
[3862.319] of it. You know in retrospect it is
[3864.16] rather unfortunate that the meteorite
[3866.799] theory ever made its way into the lit
[3869.48] literature since many layman and even a
[3872.319] number of geologists still subscribed to
[3874.96] it in spite of the fact that no concrete
[3877.76] supportive evidence whatsoever exists.
[3879.92] Yes. Well that's that's what got him his
[3881.44] PhD was that that last little paragraph.
[3883.839] I'm sure. Right. because I'm sure his
[3888.44] advisor Oh, don't get me started,
[3890.48] Randall. Don't get me started. You know,
[3891.68] I wanted to be a college professor at
[3893.92] one point. I want no part of that. I
[3896.079] want no part of that anymore. Yeah.
[3899.599] Yeah. But anyways, I digress. Yeah. So,
[3902.16] I I I thoroughly went through his his
[3905.119] thing. Um, at the end of it, I didn't,
[3909.359] you know, I I just And you know what? He
[3911.2] he did make a great oriented lake
[3913.52] because there are oriented lakes out
[3915.119] there, you know, they and I could see
[3917.28] why they went with this as a hypothesis,
[3919.92] especially if you if you flew over uh
[3922.4] the like the Capefir River Valley,
[3924.16] right? Yeah. Because um you know,
[3926.24] actually I have that slide pulled up too
[3927.68] if you want to give me the Sure.
[3931.119] All right. So So yeah, they've done a
[3932.88] lot of work on Hearnen Bay. Um and and
[3935.039] again, I just wanted to pull this up
[3936.16] because it shows how well defined these
[3938.24] Carolina bays are all up and down and
[3940.88] Again, they all have this this
[3942.48] elliptical geometry. And these almost
[3944.24] all of these are perfect ellipses. There
[3946.799] are a few that you know that that are
[3949.599] have probably been altered in the past,
[3951.52] you know, because wind and water does
[3953.2] its thing. But but you know, the
[3956.319] majority of the ones in this picture
[3957.76] would be a perfect ellipse. A perfect
[3959.839] ellipse. And and Hernand Bay, this is
[3961.359] the one that that Chris Moore wrote a
[3963.52] paper on. Uh it's basically saying that
[3965.68] the whole thing has moved. They they say
[3967.92] that they um they migrate. They don't
[3970.24] change shape or anything like that, but
[3971.44] they somehow they migrate from place to
[3973.119] place. And so supposedly this Carolina
[3975.599] Bay was right here and the whole thing
[3977.28] has shifted this
[3979.24] way despite what you see in the rest of
[3982.079] the topography. It's it's this one
[3984.559] decided to go ahead and shuffle itself,
[3986.799] you
[3987.559] know, you know, a few half a mile or
[3990.16] something to the uh to the northwest.
[3992.079] But anyways, so this is the Cape River
[3995.359] Valley. Uh and and it is a river valley.
[3997.76] So, or a flood valley, you know, flood
[3999.52] plane. And so, there are Carolina bays
[4003.44] with water in them, right? And and these
[4006.64] were some of the first ones that got,
[4008.24] you know, they they could see with the
[4009.839] aerial photos and things like that. Uh,
[4011.839] and you do see water in them. And again,
[4013.839] when you sw switch over the uh the the
[4016.76] LAR, you know, they they're all over
[4019.28] they're all over in areas where you
[4020.72] couldn't see them before. So, they're
[4022.16] not just in these in these river
[4025.28] valleys, you know, where water can fill
[4027.839] them, you know.
[4029.72] Um Oops. By the way, those were some
[4032.559] Nebraska rainwater ba basins. We'll get
[4034.64] into that, but yeah, if I just go back,
[4037.119] I mean,
[4039.079] um, you can see all of these depressions
[4041.599] right here. So, for their hypothesis to
[4043.359] be true, every single one of these that
[4045.119] are even up on higher, you know, higher
[4047.599] sand terraces would have all had to have
[4049.599] been ponds. and uh the the wind and
[4052.319] water would have had to shape them
[4053.599] perfectly every single time. I just I as
[4056.16] a science teacher, I can't get on board
[4057.839] with that. Again, there's way too many
[4059.2] envir environmental variables that I
[4062.0] mean, just anything a herd of packaderms
[4064.64] taking a nap on the edge of one of these
[4066.799] Carolina bays would would would cause
[4068.96] the shape to be different. I mean, any
[4070.96] that's what we teach kids, right? any
[4073.92] change to your experiment can give you
[4076.0] different, you know, different um
[4078.0] results. And and that's not what these
[4080.559] Carolina bays show us. You know,
[4082.0] whatever created them was exactly the
[4083.599] same every single time and more than
[4086.24] likely all at the same time.
[4092.359] So, yeah. Yeah. And then of course, you
[4094.4] know, we have the Nebraska rainwater
[4095.68] basins that are, you know, 300 uh 3,000
[4100.719] kilometers away, I guess. So, and yet
[4103.839] they're elliptical and they're oriented.
[4106.08] They're they're elliptical as well.
[4107.52] These are uh Yep. Yeah. This is all uh
[4109.6] this is all farmland. So then we have
[4112.159] we'd have to if if the wind and water
[4115.12] hypothesis
[4117.04] was the explanation for these then we
[4119.679] have to assume that the winds were
[4122.159] oriented blowing I mean do these are is
[4124.56] there any detectable sand rims on the
[4126.96] southwestern rim of this? No most of
[4129.839] these are uh the sand rims are on the
[4131.679] southeast but again that could be
[4132.96] because of directional winds. I mean
[4134.64] it's you know we know that we know that
[4136.96] the ice caps were there. We know that
[4138.48] they've been blowing for a long time.
[4139.679] They've been moving and shifting sands
[4141.12] around. Yeah. But the orientation of
[4143.52] these go right back to the same
[4145.279] location. They go right back to, you
[4147.12] know, the same place that all of these
[4148.4] point to. Um, yeah. I I don't know. I
[4151.92] hate to keep jumping around. It's all
[4153.759] right. But they they kind of they do
[4155.52] converge. And I think you have a great
[4158.08] slide kind of showing that convergence,
[4160.159] don't you? Between the Nebraska bays and
[4162.239] the Carolina bays. Yeah, I do. I'm
[4165.44] pulling up and Georgia bays. Yep. Yep.
[4168.159] Because what you see is this shifting
[4170.08] from southeast to northwest. Then it
[4172.64] shifts around like this. And they're all
[4175.04] essentially converging right on a
[4177.759] general area. Yeah. Go ahead. Hit the uh
[4180.319] hit that um stage share stage. Yeah. Got
[4183.359] it. Sorry.
[4187.04] Yeah. So this is this I put this
[4188.839] together right in the middle. I've got
[4191.239] Kowzorski's, you know, wind and big I
[4195.12] don't I don't think so. But yeah, you've
[4196.4] got the Carolina Bays. uh you know all
[4198.239] up and down the east coast that are
[4199.52] pointing uh to this location. Now this
[4202.32] is an image from Michael Davis uh and
[4204.239] again he does uh pinpoint Sagena Bay
[4207.92] which is right here. Personally I think
[4209.92] that this was an impact that occurred
[4211.679] over Michigan and Sagena Bay might kind
[4214.159] of kind of show directionality of the
[4216.719] impact um in one way or the other. Um
[4220.159] but I think that the Michigan basin is
[4221.92] part of the story. If if you if you push
[4224.08] this dating back, you know, nearly
[4226.32] 800,000 years, I I see no reason
[4228.92] why why the Michigan basin couldn't have
[4232.239] been depressed to to create these these
[4234.48] ringed shapes exactly where all of these
[4236.48] Carolina base and Nebraska rainwater
[4237.84] basins point to. I mean, they literally
[4239.679] cross over Michigan right here. Well, I
[4242.159] could certainly, you know, thought for a
[4245.28] long time that that could my impression
[4247.199] though was that the Michigan basin, if
[4248.88] it was impact produced, which I could
[4251.36] readily believe, is that it would have
[4253.44] to be very very old. Well, or or it's
[4257.84] been covered in ice multiple multiple
[4259.52] times, which it has been. You know, we
[4261.92] can go back to that that slide I showed
[4263.52] earlier with the uh the ice ages. And
[4266.32] so, if this thing was 800,000 years,
[4268.159] that was seven or eight ice ages ago.
[4270.48] And every single time, you know, two
[4272.0] miles of ice rolls over Michigan and
[4274.0] back and melts and, you know, it's I I
[4277.12] don't see here here's my big thing with
[4278.64] the Michigan basin. So, for a basin to
[4282.239] for if you if you read the literature on
[4284.239] the Michigan basin, supposedly um they
[4287.12] the bull the basin formed as sediment
[4290.88] layers. So, it formed as a bullshape,
[4292.64] right? That's that's what the literature
[4294.4] says about how the the Michigan basin
[4296.56] formed. They formed in these different
[4298.48] bowl shapes. But that goes completely
[4300.8] against the uh the geological law of
[4304.4] original horizontality where you know
[4307.28] sediment layers layer flat. They don't
[4310.0] layer in bowl shapes. They they layer
[4311.76] flat and then they stack up on top of
[4314.239] each other.
[4316.159] This I mean that completely goes against
[4317.92] that. It als you know I I I just
[4322.8] Do you see what I'm saying? Yeah. Uh
[4325.679] yeah. I'm going to have to consider this
[4327.12] now. the Michigan basin. If can we show
[4330.0] people where where that is in in
[4332.0] context? Oh, I Yeah, you you're kind of
[4334.8] showing that up there in that image. Um
[4337.04] yeah, right here. Yeah. Yeah. You you
[4338.8] when you actually look at Google Earth,
[4340.239] you can almost, you know, the topography
[4342.8] sort of subtly defines the circularity
[4346.719] of the topographic depression there.
[4350.36] Um I could do a share screen. Um Well, I
[4354.08] mean, it does now. Yeah. Yeah, it does
[4355.92] now. Yeah.
[4357.199] Yeah. And have there been cores taken
[4360.159] from the
[4362.159] Yeah, I'm sure there have. I I haven't I
[4364.08] haven't investigated it too much. Um I
[4366.8] haven't even actually talked about it
[4367.92] too much. The first time I talked about
[4369.12] it publicly was with Matt Bell. So Oh,
[4372.32] really? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I just I
[4373.92] again, you know, it's if every single
[4375.76] Carolina Bay I I say it's almost like
[4377.679] they're they're like a bunch of tattling
[4380.08] third graders. They're all pointing
[4381.28] right to the the impact site. And it
[4384.159] just so happens that right there at the
[4385.36] impact site, we have almost a perfect
[4387.04] bullseye. Not only that, but if you if
[4389.36] you pan out a little bit, this is this
[4390.96] this part gets me a little bit, but when
[4392.32] you pan out, that's the mitten of
[4394.239] Michigan, right? It's almost like a
[4395.679] catcher mitt. Uhhuh. It literally cut
[4398.64] that thing. Yeah. You know, well, the
[4401.199] mitten, you know, where the circular Can
[4404.08] you see this kind of circular? Yeah.
[4406.159] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's it right there.
[4411.12] Well, I also with a slight adjustment.
[4416.48] Uh, yes, so I'd love to talk about that.
[4420.56] Mhm. Because I think that that is a
[4422.159] younger drius impact. I think that that
[4424.159] did happen at the younger trias. I think
[4426.56] we're in agreement on that. Yes. I think
[4429.04] that the Carolina bays that were formed
[4431.64] happened during the mid ply scene, but I
[4434.239] think that that one um Lake Lock St.
[4436.8] John I think is an impact site. Yeah, we
[4438.88] can uh and there might be one more.
[4441.679] Right here is Lock St. John right there.
[4444.8] Yep. And there may be one more, but
[4446.88] those are the two I've focused on mostly
[4449.04] because of the fact that there was
[4450.6] catastrophic discharges of water that
[4453.84] Big Yeah, big time. Particularly Nipagon
[4457.28] right here. Um it has all the features
[4460.159] that you would look for for catastrophic
[4462.48] discharges of right probably on the
[4465.04] order of 100 million cubic feet per
[4466.88] second. And this whole all of this here
[4470.48] area is like a gigantic delta that has
[4473.44] spled out. Yeah. From the mouth. That's
[4476.32] material that was originally part of
[4478.48] this up here. Right. You actually look
[4480.48] at this and you can see what I could
[4482.0] think of as even remnants of a central
[4484.48] uplift ring. Mhm. Yep. Right here. I'm
[4486.8] I'm totally on board with that. Yeah.
[4488.88] Yeah. Yeah. And and back to uh Lock St.
[4491.44] John, I know you've mentioned this
[4493.44] before, but Woo at all has a paper where
[4497.28] they found uh young and dry impact
[4499.76] proxies down in Pennsylvania that comes
[4502.64] from the Quebeesian Providence, which is
[4504.719] exactly where this where this is at.
[4507.199] Yep. Yes. Yes. Yes. I pointed that out
[4510.96] and it's Yeah. They don't mention Lake
[4513.36] St. on there in that paper. No, but if
[4516.96] you cover that up Yeah. you cover that
[4518.96] with a uh with a Laurentide eye sheet,
[4521.199] you know, you've got a couple places
[4522.48] where that could have been peppered for
[4523.92] sure. I think. Yeah. Um scrolling. You
[4527.28] see that little brown area like right in
[4528.8] the middle between the two. And I can't
[4531.36] remember the name of this. Uh it's like
[4533.12] a brownish color lake right in the
[4534.4] middle. You Yeah. Scrolling right like
[4537.199] right between like No, no. Go down a
[4538.88] little bit. There's a lake right there.
[4540.96] Yep. Scrolling on that. Especially on
[4543.199] the left side of it. This Yes. I think
[4547.44] that was the third spot that I that I
[4548.8] was like this might be a because I you
[4551.52] were talking about the uh the central
[4552.719] impact the central uplift. Uhhuh. Yeah.
[4555.84] To me that's that's a little and it's
[4557.76] right directly between Lai Jean and uh
[4561.36] yeah and um like Lake Nagon.
[4565.44] So I do think that these could be um
[4569.199] younger destact sites. But I from from
[4573.04] the stuff that I was talking about
[4574.239] earlier with the sea levels and things
[4576.159] like that, I just don't think that the
[4577.679] Carolina bays are part of this story. I
[4579.12] don't think they're part of the younger
[4580.0] dry story. I think it's a much older
[4581.36] story, which is just as interesting. You
[4583.6] know, I I I mentioned at the cosmic
[4585.52] summit, you know, I feel bad because,
[4587.04] you know, the younger dus is it's such a
[4588.96] sexy topic. You know, it's such a neat
[4590.48] thing to talk about and I really enjoy
[4591.679] it. I enjoyed it more when I thought it
[4593.12] was part of a younger dus event. Um but
[4596.159] when I started and I still have to do a
[4597.84] lot more research on the midplexine but
[4599.6] that's it's fascinating because this is
[4601.28] also when the uh the homo sapiens and
[4604.64] the Neanderthals split as you know that
[4606.48] from a common ancestor. So there was
[4607.92] some major stuff going on there. Um we
[4610.239] see a major reduction in in DNA. So
[4612.4] there was a huge bottleneck that
[4613.52] happened at the mid plyene. Um like a
[4616.4] huge huge bottleneck that happened at
[4618.48] that time. And again this is goes way
[4620.56] way way back in time but we've got the a
[4623.04] tectites. Um there's a that was the last
[4625.12] time that we had a um magnetic pole
[4627.28] shift was at the mid plyosine. There was
[4630.719] uh extinction level events that took
[4632.159] place at the mid plyosine. So I just to
[4634.159] me I think there we're looking at a much
[4637.199] bigger event. I think that what created
[4639.28] the Carolina bays was an even bigger
[4641.28] event than the younger dus. I think it
[4643.28] was a big deal. I think again I think
[4645.52] that the Michigan basil was part of it.
[4647.96] Um they've even done uh gravitational
[4651.199] studies uh on Michigan and there's a
[4655.28] gravitational anomaly in that same area
[4657.76] right around Sagena Bay. Uh that is very
[4660.96] similar to the gravitational anomaly
[4663.04] that we find at the Cheeks Love Crater,
[4664.88] the one that took out the dinosaurs. And
[4667.04] and again, I'm you've got a big
[4669.76] audience, too, don't you?
[4672.08] But I think this event was almost on par
[4674.08] with with that 65 million year ago
[4677.04] event. But the big savior, the big thing
[4680.48] that that saved the day was the ice
[4682.0] sheet. Instead of it landing into a
[4683.28] shallow sea into what's now the Yucatan
[4685.679] Peninsula, uh, and the Gulf of Mexico, I
[4688.159] think that hit this ice sheet and the
[4690.239] energy was dispensed and that's what
[4691.679] created these Carolina bays. That's what
[4692.96] created the AACt tites and and um, all
[4695.92] of that that's involved that happened at
[4697.84] the mid ply scene. Again, a lot more
[4700.0] research has to go into that, but that's
[4701.76] that's kind of where I'm at with it
[4703.199] right now.
[4705.52] Okay, I'm gonna go ahead.
[4707.92] That's why what it's a lot. I'm sorry.
[4710.719] Yeah.
[4712.239] All right. So, I'm going to do another
[4713.679] share screen
[4715.719] and getting before we leave
[4719.159] uh Lake Nipagon. Mhm. So here what I've
[4723.36] done, I've taken spot elevations and you
[4725.44] can see that there's pretty much a
[4727.04] consistent rim raised around it.
[4731.32] Um you know those are elevation marks.
[4733.92] What what is that that are flag
[4735.6] elevation? So you know 1500 ft above sea
[4738.159] level 1505
[4740.64] 11:05 there's a little bit of variation
[4742.8] but it's all within a couple hundred
[4744.159] feet of each other. The lake level uh
[4747.04] was 851 feet above sea level. Um, and
[4751.84] then I point out here, note the
[4753.6] substantial drop in elevation on the
[4755.84] south rim of the lake forming a trough.
[4758.4] You can see right here, it drops from
[4760.84] 1365 down to, you know, here is 964,
[4763.92] 946.
[4765.88] Um, note also the consistency of
[4768.48] elevations to both the east and west of
[4770.64] the trough. So, you know, you've got
[4772.8] 1540 here and then you got 1540 right
[4775.6] here. Mhm. So I would conjecture that
[4778.719] that was a consistent topography here.
[4782.719] The impact and this would have been
[4784.719] covered in ice. the impact caused
[4787.199] catastrophic ice melting and then that
[4789.36] discharged to the south and and carved
[4792.32] out this trough and
[4795.0] um it says this is similar to if not
[4798.239] identical to a number of situations
[4799.84] within the landscape of the Missoula
[4801.679] floods where catastrophic flood water
[4804.239] breached a pre-existing divide that the
[4807.28] trough was the result of catastrophic
[4809.44] flood or floods is demonstrated by a
[4811.52] closer look at the geomorphology and
[4814.56] then I
[4816.88] show Lake Nipagon, you know, which not
[4819.84] Lake Nipagon, Lake Agazine, right? Which
[4822.719] was an extraordinary body of meltwater,
[4827.12] right? That was literally like like an
[4829.6] Indian inland freshwater sea. I mean, it
[4832.96] was so vast that sailing across it, you
[4835.6] could sail for days and not see either
[4837.28] shore. I mean, it was huge. Yeah.
[4839.96] um one of the southern outlets that I I
[4843.04] took Graeme Hancock to this discharge
[4845.12] point down here right down at the south.
[4847.52] Uh there's a lake there called Big Stone
[4850.0] Lake and you see these huge rounded
[4852.88] boulders stacked up for a couple of
[4854.96] miles right there at the discharge point
[4857.52] and
[4858.679] um
[4860.36] Nipagon is right
[4864.36] uh yeah right here. Mhm. Right. right
[4869.159] there. And
[4872.76] then this is interesting. This is the
[4874.88] work of James Teller and he's done a lot
[4878.239] of work, probably the foremost
[4880.239] researcher on Lake Agaze. And
[4884.199] um he says like Teller was the first to
[4887.04] publish that overflow from Lake Agaze
[4889.199] was periodically cata
[4891.8] catastrophic.
[4893.56] Um, yeah, the fire season was
[4895.96] serendipitously harsh that year that he
[4898.32] was doing his research and we saw acres
[4901.12] of giant boulders and deeply eroded
[4903.199] bedrock. That led me to conclude that
[4904.96] there had been a gigantic flush of water
[4907.52] across that area from glacial lake Agaze
[4910.32] into the Great Lakes, which is that area
[4913.44] southwest, right? Mhm. Um, but here's
[4916.639] here's the part that I've importantly
[4918.719] this flood coincided with the advent of
[4921.36] the younger Dus, a 1,000-year global
[4924.32] cold snap which began about 12,900 years
[4927.199] ago. Right. Right. So, yeah, in his
[4930.48] quest for answers though, he's found a
[4932.48] new avenue to explore. About the time
[4935.199] the younger driest cooling period
[4937.04] occurred, a comet seems to have con
[4940.08] collided with the place to scene ice
[4942.239] sheet, the damned lake Agazy.
[4945.6] So cool. That was that was in 2008. So
[4948.639] yeah. Yeah.
[4951.0] Um and yeah, here you can see this.
[4954.159] Yeah. The B-shaped depression right
[4956.159] here. Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah. And then
[4958.719] when we take a zoom in on it, you can
[4962.56] see the erosion between Nipagon and
[4965.199] Superior. And here's this fan delta
[4967.44] spled out from the mouth. And that's all
[4970.8] pretty much sediment from this outwash.
[4974.0] Um, right.
[4976.88] And yeah, look at this. Here's your LAR
[4980.08] version of it. And it's all deep scoured
[4984.0] channels, very much like the scablands
[4986.159] of eastern Washington. Mhm.
[4990.239] Yeah.
[4992.08] Do you do you have something like this
[4993.36] similar to uh for for Lake San Jean
[4998.0] somewhat? Yeah. I've done more work with
[5000.08] Nipagon, but yeah, I've started Yeah.
[5004.159] What convinced me about Lake St. John
[5006.32] was was the one you said, the Woo paper,
[5008.88] right, where they discovered the
[5010.08] microsphererals in uh Pennsylvania and
[5012.8] New Jersey, and they came from the
[5014.639] Keshia region, right? which is very
[5017.199] small confined region, right? And when
[5019.6] you go right there, dead center of the
[5021.76] Quebeesia region, there's Lake St. Gene,
[5023.92] right? And I'd always heard that it was
[5025.92] the flooding down the uh the St.
[5027.679] Lawrence River that that's what killed
[5029.76] the the Gulf Stream. That's what caused
[5031.52] the younger Dryus. So you know that that
[5034.32] just makes too much sense to me. That's
[5036.639] where that water came from. And let's
[5038.4] see, we can zoom look at some of the
[5040.8] stuff here. So this is Nipagon Bay as it
[5044.08] says serenely beautiful today but scene
[5046.719] of an extreme diluvial catastrophe circa
[5049.4] 12,000 that's supposed to be 12,900 not
[5052.48] 12,9990.
[5055.12] So, it's just a typo. But when you start
[5058.4] looking at some of these features,
[5061.28] uh, let's
[5063.0] see. Ma Mazukama Mazukama Falls right in
[5068.08] here. There's there's truncated hills
[5071.44] that are very similar. I mean, you can
[5073.199] see these anywhere you you you go into
[5075.679] pathways of catastrophic flood flows.
[5078.48] They show up pretty startling here. You
[5081.36] see these escarments here and the
[5084.04] channelization. I mean that's all, you
[5086.96] know, pretty much diagnostic
[5089.36] catastrophic flood flows. Yeah. So these
[5092.159] arrows represent where it looks like the
[5095.12] flows of water discharged from the
[5097.76] Nipagon Basin. Mhm.
[5101.52] And here's some Google Earth. And you
[5104.08] can see this I think that these things
[5106.48] would have been you know during the
[5108.719] latter stages of the flooding they would
[5110.8] have been like prominent islands
[5112.48] standing above the flood waters. But
[5114.96] here like Ruby Lake very similar to uh
[5118.88] Dog Lake or Rainbow Lake up in one of
[5121.04] the passes uh through in Montana that
[5124.32] the flood waters flowed. So you know the
[5126.719] flood waters are going to scour
[5128.36] depressions and then in the aftermath
[5130.719] they will retain water and and become
[5133.28] what are now the modern lakes. Mhm. Um
[5136.48] but yeah, vertical sheer walls of
[5138.6] basaltt and with wash up type gra see
[5142.0] this is not your normal
[5144.199] gravitational impliced tallets here
[5147.92] because the the cliff face hasn't
[5149.6] receded these cliff faces and and you
[5152.32] see this throughout the the channel scab
[5154.719] lands as you'll see vertical shear walls
[5156.96] and then at the bottom of it you're
[5158.719] going to see this this gravel washed up
[5161.6] against the base of the vertical cliff
[5164.719] And the above it the cliff is still
[5166.48] vertical. It hasn't receded anywhere
[5169.199] near the extent that it would have had
[5171.679] to contribute to the deposit the
[5174.08] flanking deposits. Right? But I would
[5177.12] look at these as very similar to, you
[5178.88] know, steamboat rock or many of the um
[5182.159] mea type formations that are left in
[5184.48] some of the flood channels. Yeah, I
[5186.96] agree. Shear cliffs. Look at this slot
[5189.28] canyons.
[5193.239] Um, you know, this is almost a steamboat
[5195.84] rock-like formation. Yeah. Look at look
[5198.239] at some of the slot canyons, right?
[5200.48] Yeah. Yep. So, you
[5204.199] know, we were, you know, we actually had
[5207.04] contacted John
[5209.0] Shaw and this was precoid. We were going
[5212.32] to do an expedition up here to explore
[5214.239] this. We contacted him and his response
[5216.639] was he would be delighted to join us and
[5220.0] look at this and then three weeks later
[5221.679] he passed. I know. Yeah. Yep. Sad. But
[5225.199] look look at these slot canyons now.
[5228.159] Those are not to me they're not formed
[5231.199] by gradual no right. No. No. And I don't
[5236.32] I don't think any geologist could look
[5237.84] at that and say that that was gradual
[5239.199] either. I mean it's just too pristine.
[5241.6] Right.
[5242.88] But yeah, I'm not sure how you say
[5244.92] this.Qat Canyon and Eagle Canyon. I can
[5248.88] find almost exactly the same type of
[5251.44] things up we've up in British Columbia,
[5254.0] right? Um you know where where you have
[5256.48] a you know what a recessional cataract
[5258.56] is. Yeah. So the top end of these are
[5261.92] have all the earmarks of recessional
[5263.679] cataracts, right?
[5268.12] So, and
[5271.4] uh figuring on maybe trying to get there
[5274.639] next year, maybe next summer. That'll be
[5277.12] fun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You up for that?
[5280.159] Go. Arrange it. Okay. Actually, we're
[5282.639] taking a trip out to Yellowstone next
[5284.239] summer around around Cosmic Summit time.
[5286.639] But are you It's not too far from there.
[5288.32] We'll we'll we'll uh take a detour.
[5291.84] Now, this fascinated me. Devil's Crater,
[5294.0] which is right here. Right. Look at this
[5296.56] thing.
[5299.6] That's cool. Now I my first impression
[5303.199] was this was like a giant culking, you
[5305.6] know, underwater. Yeah. I was going to
[5306.96] say it looks like a a big pothole. Yeah,
[5308.88] it does. It looks like a big pothole.
[5311.28] And uh I mean, if that's what it is,
[5313.679] then that really, like I say here,
[5315.199] Devil's Crater is a testament to the
[5316.88] incredible power and turbulence of the
[5318.96] meltwater current sweeping over the
[5320.639] western rim of Nipagon Basin. Yeah.
[5322.8] Right. This is a giant gigantic pothole
[5325.199] formed by culking and deep swiftly
[5327.12] moving flood waters in this case
[5329.36] probably
[5330.679] subglacial. Um and you can see here look
[5333.44] at the channel out which is just what
[5335.92] convinced me that this was a a turbulent
[5339.159] vortex melting causing melting. And then
[5342.32] that melting if it was in the uh ice
[5345.199] sheet that would now create a capture
[5347.6] basin for super glacial flows that could
[5350.719] flow into the into the like. So if there
[5353.84] was a secondary impact right above this
[5356.4] point perhaps right and then you had
[5358.88] almost like flushing your toilet, you
[5360.719] know, it's going like this down to the
[5362.88] bottom and then discharging subglacially
[5366.32] cutting this trough right here.
[5369.36] But yeah, I mean you can see the scale
[5370.8] of this thing. There's Did you Did you
[5372.639] ever get a chance to talk with Jerome
[5374.239] Leman about about uh like like Nipagon
[5378.08] being a possible impact? I think it may
[5379.84] have come up, but we didn't really Yeah,
[5382.0] I I don't remember any really specific
[5385.12] indepth discussions about Nipagon. Um
[5390.52] Yeah. Yeah. Because it's it's pretty
[5392.96] solid evidence in in my opinion for
[5395.04] sure. Yeah. And then I compare uh the
[5398.639] black sturgeon spillway which you've got
[5401.04] here. In this one I'm comparing it to
[5403.84] black sturgeon spillway and here's Moses
[5406.04] Koulie which all geologists are going to
[5408.84] agree resulted from you know
[5411.719] hypervelocity flows. I say here Moses
[5415.12] Culie ranks as one of the most
[5416.48] magnificent ancient mega flood spillways
[5418.719] on earth carrying at its greatest
[5420.639] discharge over 300 million cubic feet
[5422.96] per second of raging torrential flood
[5425.679] water. Black sturgeon spillway is about
[5427.679] half the capacity of Moses Koulie but is
[5430.48] still a very impressive example of a
[5432.4] relic channel cut by gigantic water
[5434.48] flows that far exceed anything on earth
[5437.36] today. And you can see the modern black
[5439.679] sturgeon river, right, moving through
[5443.199] there, right? I have this memory of
[5445.84] being I think I was nine years old. We
[5448.48] drove up to NIP, you know, I grew up in
[5450.239] Minnesota, right? And my dad used to
[5452.56] canoe these waters all that area, you
[5455.12] know, he was a spare time. He was a
[5456.96] canoe racer. And we went up to I
[5459.84] remember one year and I think it was I
[5461.679] think I was nine, could have been 59 or
[5464.639] 1960 maybe. We drove up to Nipagon and I
[5468.6] remember going to this overlook and it
[5472.639] was looking down into this massive deep
[5474.96] channel and it was I I literally I
[5478.08] remember getting vertigo looking into
[5480.0] this channel. I don't know if it was
[5482.4] this, but I speculate that there was an
[5484.96] overlook and it was this that we were
[5486.719] standing on the rim of looking into.
[5488.96] Mhm. It made a huge impression on Yeah.
[5491.92] Yeah. Yeah.
[5493.92] So,
[5495.679] Yep. Nine years old. That's one reason
[5497.36] why we plan on heading out to
[5498.639] Yellowstone, doing a cross country trip
[5500.08] this year. My daughter's nine. And
[5501.6] that's a very perfect age. That's right.
[5503.92] I remember going to the Grand Canyon
[5505.36] when I was nine. So, it's a good time to
[5507.44] go. Good time to start getting those
[5509.679] interests for sure. Well, let's see. How
[5512.08] long have we been going now? Well, an
[5514.08] hour and a half. Hour and 38. Um, maybe
[5517.84] we go five, 10 more minutes. I mean, we
[5519.84] got plenty to talk about if you're
[5521.28] willing to do this again. Absolutely. I
[5523.679] mean, because there's always new stuff
[5525.04] to talk about and it's great to have
[5526.8] somebody who's actually done some work
[5528.48] in this area. Yeah. And and and again,
[5531.36] you know, I I know that what I was
[5534.159] suggesting is very controversial. It's
[5535.92] already, you know, the Carolina Bays are
[5537.28] already controversial as it is. Um,
[5539.679] nobody agrees on anything. You know,
[5542.08] even even the impact guys, we don't
[5543.84] agree. And and for, you know, I've been
[5546.239] I've been, you know, tagging along for
[5548.239] about 10 years. I guess about eight
[5549.6] years now. And um yeah, I can't get
[5552.639] anybody to agree on any of it. Like I
[5554.239] said, I really think that Zamora's got a
[5557.159] a good concept on how these things form
[5560.239] perfect elliptical depressions. You
[5562.4] know, we know that that uh conic
[5565.44] sections are an ellipse and and a a nice
[5568.88] projectile entering unconsolidated
[5571.199] sediment would be a conic section or or
[5573.6] a penetration funnel. Uh that would form
[5576.639] an ellipse. I I like that idea. But what
[5579.44] I was saying about with the with the
[5581.36] shorelines of the midplysine
[5584.0] um you know or really the plyene
[5585.679] shorelines the last two times that we
[5587.199] had interglacials uh that was enough
[5589.679] evidence for me to remove them from a
[5592.0] younger dus impact. Um which I think may
[5595.199] be really important. I think to remove
[5597.04] them from a young dry story can only
[5599.12] help both of these hypotheses, right?
[5602.48] You know, because a lot of times and and
[5605.04] trust me, I know I was pushing this for
[5606.88] a long time. You know, I thought that
[5608.0] they were related to the younger dus and
[5609.76] it just upset a lot of people
[5612.8] and and by removing the Carolina bays
[5615.12] from that story, I think it strengthens
[5616.88] the younger dus story and and we just
[5618.8] looked at possible impact sites that
[5620.719] could be absolutely related to the
[5623.199] younger dus, right? and and it it adds
[5627.44] um a little bit more strength to the
[5629.92] Carolina bays being impact features as
[5631.679] well if we push the timeline back um
[5634.08] into the mid plyosine transition age. Um
[5637.84] again I I only see positive benefits
[5640.239] from from doing that but a lot of people
[5642.639] are going to be upset about it so sorry.
[5644.32] Well, I initially early on was, you
[5647.44] know, seen some of the studies from core
[5649.76] samples that suggested that they were
[5651.84] late placed to CNN. Really? Really? Oh,
[5654.32] yeah. And I'm Yeah. Well, I know that
[5655.92] the the problem with the core samples is
[5657.6] I I've never had a problem with the age
[5660.4] that they're getting from their core
[5662.0] samples, right? They they take a sample,
[5663.84] they they test it. That's sure. That's
[5665.84] that's that's fine. Especially if we
[5667.84] push it back and anything that's filled
[5670.239] in that that basin is going to date to
[5672.48] whatever age it filled in at. Right.
[5674.48] Yeah. Um and so again, I think and and I
[5676.96] think OSL dating only goes back how far
[5680.08] does it go back? It's like I don't think
[5681.76] it could date 800,000 years sediment. I
[5683.52] think it's it's younger than that. Um
[5685.92] you know radiocarbon dating only goes
[5689.12] back what 60,000 years or something.
[5691.04] Yeah. Uh but but I think OSL dating can
[5693.36] only go back 600,000 years I think it
[5695.6] is. Um, I'd have to look that up, but it
[5698.56] doesn't go back 800,000 years. We do
[5702.08] have the icecore data from Antarctica
[5703.679] that we can look at. Um, you know, we
[5706.239] have uh we have sediments, ocean
[5709.6] sediments that we can look at, and there
[5710.96] was a major extinction event at the
[5712.56] midflysene transition of datoms that
[5715.199] that died off. Like I think 90
[5716.96] something% of the datoms in the North
[5719.28] Atlantic completely kaput at that time.
[5721.92] Oh, really? Yeah. I'm not I'm not
[5724.159] familiar with that. I'm going to look
[5725.28] into that. Now, I you know, you
[5727.76] mentioned this and it's just only
[5729.28] recently that I've started taking a dive
[5731.28] into the emian and um find that that's a
[5734.719] very interesting time, you know, because
[5736.8] it has been often invoked as a as the
[5740.56] counterpart to the holene. Mhm. And as
[5743.28] I'm looking into it, I'm going not
[5745.44] exactly because there was actually some
[5747.679] pretty serious climatic fluctuations
[5750.48] within the emian. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I
[5754.08] think you heard me say this this quote
[5756.159] that uh, you know, the the temperatures
[5758.159] were a lot warmer then and there were no
[5760.08] soccer moms driving SUVs at that time.
[5762.32] So, you know, that's that's right. They
[5766.0] were it was considerably warm. Like you
[5768.239] said, sea levels about 30 feet higher.
[5770.719] Yes. And now I just saw a recent study
[5773.52] that during that period of the emian
[5776.159] almost half of the Greenland ice sheet
[5778.08] was gone and it had melted back so much
[5780.48] that there was a huge corridor east west
[5783.52] right across the middle of the Greenland
[5786.719] ice sheet.
[5788.56] So, you know, again, what that brings us
[5790.719] to is, you know, realizing how dynamic
[5793.44] the climate has been naturally, right?
[5795.76] And I, you know, to get off into, you
[5799.12] know, the outrageous hypothesis, I don't
[5801.36] know if you have a good paper I would
[5802.639] recommend people to read is the value of
[5804.56] outrageous hypothesis by William R.
[5807.04] Davis, the read that one, the founding
[5809.6] father of geomorphology. Okay. He's
[5812.08] really excoriating his colleagues, I
[5814.239] guess, back in the 1920s or something
[5816.239] for being so constricted in their
[5818.4] thinking. And so he opens by citing all
[5821.119] of the things that were considered
[5822.639] outrageous at that point when uh you
[5826.719] know that were were accepted by the
[5828.639] 1920s. Anyways, um in in the spirit of
[5833.119] outrageous hypothesis, um I consider
[5837.52] Okay, so you know, we know now if we if
[5841.119] we pulled this up yesterday and um I
[5843.119] cited this when I was uh interviewing
[5845.6] with Patrick David. Um he had Rob his
[5848.96] his fact checker there factchecking
[5851.04] everything I was saying. And I can say I
[5853.52] think I came through with flying colors
[5855.119] because I would spout numbers as fast as
[5857.44] he can go and they got a big flat screen
[5859.76] TV up on the opposite wall and he's
[5862.239] pulling up stuff. All my numbers are
[5864.159] coming up there almost exactly as I'm
[5866.08] citing him. So I could see that by the
[5868.08] end of it I think in in Patrick David's
[5870.719] mind I was um you know my street credit
[5873.84] had gone up a notch. you know, he I was
[5876.639] warned ahead of time, you know, he likes
[5878.4] to challenge his guests. And I said,
[5880.96] "Hey, I love to be challenged." Okay? If
[5883.92] I don't know something, maybe it will
[5885.84] lead me into a new avenue of thinking.
[5888.32] But if I if it's something I've studied,
[5890.56] yeah, let's talk about impacts. Let's
[5892.48] talk about mega floods. Let's talk about
[5894.32] mass extinctions and why I don't think
[5896.88] paleoindian hunters exterminated half
[5899.119] the great megapon on the planet. You
[5901.04] know, I had that lesson just today. Just
[5902.8] today in my classroom, we talked about
[5904.48] that. Yeah. Did you really? Yes. Yes.
[5906.8] Yeah. So, yeah. I like to I mean, how
[5910.639] many people really are aware of the fact
[5912.159] of the the the number of Probacidians
[5914.08] that inhabited Georgia during the late
[5916.48] Exactly. Y I have them do a presentation
[5919.119] where they have to pick they have to
[5920.32] find six that are from that area and
[5922.32] they can't they can't believe it, you
[5923.6] know? They're like, "What?"
[5925.44] Yeah. Giant camels walking up and down
[5927.28] through here. There's like two species
[5929.119] of llama that lived in southeast Georgia
[5931.28] and Florida. It's like Yeah. Yeah, you
[5932.719] know, they they they are very uh it's
[5935.6] eye opening, that's for sure. Hey, let's
[5938.08] not ne neglect the giant beavers. That's
[5941.36] right. You know, out of respect to uh
[5945.04] who was it? Cobras. Oh, cobras. Yes.
[5948.08] Cobras. Yep. Yep. Cobras. Yes.
[5950.48] Casteroides. That's right. Yeah. Yeah.
[5953.6] And uh were now were there gipadons in
[5956.88] Georgia? Uh I don't know if they were in
[5959.6] Georgia. No further south. I mean, we
[5961.6] definitely know they were as far north
[5963.44] as Mexico, I think. Yeah, we did have uh
[5966.56] we do we do have giant uh giant ground
[5968.56] sloth here. We find fossils of those.
[5971.52] There's a whole fossil on display at the
[5973.44] Tybee Island um state park, I think.
[5976.32] Yeah, direwolves.
[5979.04] Do we? Uh we we'll have to do a little
[5982.239] research and maybe get back and and talk
[5984.32] about that a little bit because that's
[5986.639] another area of extreme fascination to
[5989.119] me is the the the megapaa. For sure. For
[5993.119] sure. Yeah. But back to the outrageous
[5995.92] hypothesis. So if we go back and we talk
[5998.92] about, you know, the emergence of modern
[6001.92] civilization, I mean, we we we can trace
[6004.32] history back to, you know, 5,000, maybe
[6007.76] pushing it back to 6,000 years ago if we
[6009.76] define history as when writing emerged,
[6012.48] right? But I think we can push
[6014.56] civilization back. Let's let's just say
[6016.56] in round numbers 10,000 years because
[6019.199] what do we find typically traced back
[6023.119] 10,000 years is you know the a major
[6026.48] shift to sedentary lifestyles and
[6028.48] agriculture
[6030.08] um major shift from hunter gatherers and
[6032.8] and and um you know migratory
[6036.08] lifestyles, nomadic lifestyles. The
[6039.04] dispersion of languages typically is
[6041.679] going to date back 10,000 years. First
[6044.8] urban areas 8,000 9,000 years ago. What
[6048.32] else? Domestication of animals. Mhm. But
[6052.48] we just pulled up in in the in the talk
[6054.88] yesterday, I mentioned the fact that,
[6056.719] you know, the oldest modern human
[6058.56] remains are now being dated to 200,000
[6061.199] years ago, right? You know, and Rob was
[6063.44] there, you know, pulls up, you know,
[6066.48] 200,000 years. That's exactly what I
[6068.639] just said. So, but you think about
[6070.88] 200,000 years. I mean, you know, and
[6074.0] then you think that's something that I
[6075.92] think I did a calculation quickly based
[6078.4] 25 years as a generation. 7,000
[6081.28] generations.
[6082.88] Yeah. Okay. Now think about our ascent
[6086.639] to a modern industrial scientific
[6090.0] technological civilization pretty much
[6092.4] has all taken place within about three
[6094.4] maybe 400 years depending on how you
[6097.36] count it and where you put but how
[6099.52] easily would 3 to 400 years get lost in
[6102.639] the noise of two thou 200,000 years.
[6105.44] Yeah. Now, see, I think that the
[6108.0] archaeologists that are so dismissive of
[6110.719] there being any potential what we would
[6113.8] call, you know, advanced defining
[6116.719] advance. I, you know, what do we mean by
[6118.32] that? I mean, we could say, were the
[6120.48] Phoenicians advanced? Were the Egyptians
[6122.32] advanced? I could say, yeah, they were
[6124.56] advanced. Maybe not in the same way we
[6126.4] are, but they were advanced enough that
[6129.08] they, you know, they had very
[6131.76] sophisticated navigational skills, which
[6134.08] meant that they had astronomical
[6136.159] knowledge. They clearly had engineering
[6139.28] skills, ability to quarry stones of, you
[6143.04] know, dozens up to hundreds of tons and
[6146.159] transporting those stone stones. Yeah.
[6149.92] But I think that we need to be a little
[6152.32] bit more open to speculating
[6154.719] outrageously about what may or may not
[6157.76] have occurred in 200,000 years of human
[6160.44] history, you know, and and not
[6163.119] immediately jump on whatever woowoo new
[6165.92] age ideas are out there, but really
[6168.0] looking at it though scientifically, but
[6170.4] with an open mind and consider, well,
[6172.56] what archaeologists tend to have
[6174.32] overlooked, in my opinion, is how
[6177.4] catastrophically the the climate and
[6179.84] environment has changed just since the
[6182.639] the the dawning of the human species on
[6185.36] the planet. Right. Right. I mean, we
[6187.76] know just in the last 200,000 years, how
[6189.84] many times have the glacial interglacial
[6191.679] cycles occurred? What maybe four times?
[6194.719] Yeah. Anyway,
[6196.96] and and you know, you the question would
[6199.52] arise, you know, it's always, well,
[6200.88] where's the pottery and where's the
[6202.719] evidence? And you know, having looked at
[6205.52] that kind of stuff, I go, "Well, you
[6207.199] know, lands the landscapes of 200,000
[6209.92] years ago basically don't exist
[6211.92] anymore." Right. Right. You know,
[6214.239] they've been eroded away. They've been
[6216.719] they're buried under hundreds of feet of
[6218.639] sediment and and you know, I mean, let's
[6222.32] assume you had a settlement settlements
[6224.96] in Canada, you know, ine times. What
[6229.679] would you see left of those? Also when I
[6232.159] I study, you know, if you look at the
[6233.84] emergence of modern cities where they
[6237.44] recur over and over again, coastlines,
[6239.92] river valleys. Yep. Every river valley
[6242.96] you can pretty much look at is has been
[6246.48] had at some time or another carried
[6249.199] enormously augmented flows. Yeah. I you
[6252.8] know, some of the LAR stuff we can get
[6254.639] into that in our next conversation. And
[6256.8] I've done some interesting LAR stuff
[6259.04] showing where you can see the modern
[6260.96] river and then you can see the the
[6263.92] valley it's flowing in. Yeah, for sure.
[6266.08] Which is gigantic. Yeah. Right.
[6269.159] Um so if there was even a major
[6272.8] settlement, you know, inhabitants of
[6275.199] 50,000 people living along a river
[6277.52] valley and you got 50 million cubic feet
[6280.639] per second coming through there, there's
[6283.04] not going to be anything left. No. it's
[6284.96] going to be completely obliterated. Now,
[6287.04] as I was looking back over the last
[6288.719] couple hundred thousand years, again,
[6291.36] the parallels are not exact, but if you
[6294.32] had a period of time, the emian where
[6296.239] it's warmer than now, I presume you
[6299.04] would have abundant rainfall because the
[6302.639] additional thermal energy, you're going
[6304.239] to be uh evaporating ocean water. It's
[6307.679] going to have to precipitate back out.
[6311.04] So my question is okay we should look
[6313.92] and consider what could have been going
[6315.84] on in terms of of human social or
[6320.0] cultural development during that time.
[6322.48] Now when we get to the to the full
[6325.04] glacial maximum now we're talking about
[6328.4] you know for one thing you know during
[6330.08] the late glacial maximum carbon dioxide
[6332.719] levels in the atmosphere dropped to 180
[6334.8] parts per
[6336.6] million. It's been speculated and
[6339.199] perhaps
[6340.719] um legitimately that 180 parts per
[6343.84] million is really not even enough carbon
[6345.76] dioxide in the atmosphere to practice
[6348.04] viable agriculture. Mhm. What were the
[6353.36] carbon dioxide concentrations during the
[6355.6] emianium?
[6357.28] It's a good question. Yeah. Yeah. I mean
[6359.28] because were they similar today? Were
[6361.52] they lower? I mean again glacial 180
[6365.52] parts per million. If that was the case
[6368.4] during the emian, then we certainly can
[6371.119] surmise from that that carbon dioxide
[6372.96] had nothing to do with the emian
[6374.56] warming. Right. Right. Correct. Yeah.
[6377.36] Yeah. Um or were they higher? Now, we do
[6380.639] know this. We know that when temperature
[6383.639] drops, let's say, and I and to me the
[6386.239] most likely candidate is going to be
[6389.119] solar
[6390.119] variability aided and emedded by for
[6392.96] example volcanism because we know that
[6396.08] you know you remember the year without a
[6397.6] summer 1816
[6399.679] came on the heels of four closely spaced
[6402.08] volcanic eruptions between 1809 and 1815
[6406.239] right and that caused a depression of
[6409.119] global temperature for at least 5 years,
[6411.199] six
[6412.119] years spawned what has been referred to
[6414.4] as the last great subsistence crisis of
[6416.8] western civilization because of the uh
[6419.52] agricultural failures and so on.
[6422.719] But we do know now that increased carbon
[6425.6] dioxide fuels photosynthesis. For sure.
[6428.8] Yeah.
[6430.719] They pipe it in. Yeah. Exactly. So this
[6434.4] is why I've gotten so interested in the
[6436.0] emian because I'm thinking okay you had
[6438.239] 10 to 13,000 years of there
[6443.6] how would there have not been because if
[6446.48] we if if we
[6448.04] consider holysine what happened? Well,
[6451.04] we had a warming. We had the climatic
[6453.52] optimum. We had the emergence of
[6455.4] agriculture. People were getting a lot
[6457.36] of food to eat. Uh people were living
[6459.76] longer. And we had more um leisure time.
[6465.04] And in order to create
[6467.159] advanced science and philosophy and
[6470.08] knowledge, you have to have leisure
[6472.159] time, right? Think about architecture,
[6474.88] all of that. So now going back to the
[6478.36] emian, if the emian was a fair parallel
[6481.84] to the
[6485.32] holysine, why do we not see any evidence
[6488.159] of any kind of advancement during the
[6490.56] emian? We know modern people were living
[6492.719] at that point.
[6494.719] And maybe we should reframe the question
[6497.199] and to read like this.
[6499.239] Um the challenge would be to explain why
[6503.04] there was not major cultural advancement
[6505.84] during the emian and if we're looking
[6508.4] for a parallel to the holosene in terms
[6511.76] of the climate and the environment well
[6513.52] we can see I think we can make the
[6515.04] argument that holysine climate and
[6516.639] environment was a prerequisite for the
[6519.199] emergence of advanced civilization as we
[6521.76] define it.
[6524.159] Yeah. Now, let's turn that back in in in
[6527.36] in uh uh honor of the outrageous
[6531.4] hypothesis. And so, well, could there
[6533.6] have been an advanced culture during the
[6537.719] emium? Now, considering we know what has
[6540.639] transpired between the emian and the
[6542.719] holysine. I mean, it certainly is Yeah.
[6545.6] plausible that whatever was going on
[6547.84] could have been at least at least
[6550.32] navigation or something. Yeah. Yeah.
[6553.199] Well, we know that many islands were
[6555.76] colonized as far back as 50,000 years
[6558.08] ago. Right. Right. What about the
[6559.92] Aborigines? Don't they go back farther
[6561.6] further than that? Well, I the last
[6563.6] studies I've read would suggest at least
[6565.6] 50,000 years. Yeah. And and of course
[6568.52] during, you know, glacial maximum
[6570.96] periods of time, you know, you didn't
[6572.88] you wouldn't have to you could have
[6574.48] island hopped to Australia much easier
[6577.199] than, you know, postglacial after
[6579.52] postglacial sea level rates. I I that's
[6581.84] what's gotten me interested in the emian
[6583.84] and why I'm taking a closer look at it.
[6586.239] If it is a parallel for the holysine and
[6590.0] if we surmise that the holysine climatic
[6592.96] and environmental conditions were at
[6596.239] least conducive if not a prerequisite
[6598.639] for the emergence of advanced
[6602.28] civilizations. Why not the h? Why not
[6604.56] the emian? Yeah. Should for sure.
[6608.639] Yeah. Yeah. Yep. And like I like I
[6611.44] showed you, we can I mean the LAR shows
[6613.6] us exactly where that shoreline is, so
[6615.119] we should be able to find something
[6616.639] there. Ah, well, maybe we could pick
[6620.159] that up in our next conversation. We've
[6623.04] been going almost two hours and Yeah.
[6625.119] Yeah. Yeah. So, I think we'll I know you
[6626.96] you've been traveling, too, so I know
[6628.48] you're a little roadw weary. I am roadw
[6630.48] weary. I did manage to get a nap in a
[6632.719] little earlier. Nice. which if I hadn't
[6634.96] done that, you would have been talking
[6636.719] and I would have been.
[6639.44] But we didn't want that. So, anyways,
[6642.88] it's been fun and I think we should do
[6644.4] it again. Absolutely, Randall. I'm going
[6646.56] to be going out to um I wish I was going
[6649.36] with you in a few. I wish you were too,
[6651.04] man. I I would love to spend a week with
[6653.28] you out in these landscapes. We got your
[6655.44] impressions. That's right. We got to
[6657.52] factor in some Carolina Bay talk in
[6659.28] there and I'll I'll make the trip. So,
[6661.199] Okay. Absolutely. We can do that. And
[6662.88] and there was a lot more we actually
[6664.4] could have talked about. Yes. Relative
[6666.56] to the Carolina Bays. One of the things
[6668.719] that we didn't do that I was going to
[6670.159] pull up is show you some of the images
[6671.84] of the Tangusa area. Maybe Oh, I've got
[6675.28] some of those, too. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
[6677.28] let's Okay, we'll save that for our next
[6679.52] conversation. Yeah. Because it's it's
[6681.36] pretty fascinating. Yeah. Yeah, it is.
[6683.44] It is. and and whether it happened, you
[6686.8] know, at the younger dus, which I'm now
[6689.52] leaning towards not believing. Well,
[6691.92] just just look at it. I mean, that's I'm
[6693.679] going to tell your entire audience, just
[6695.679] look at it. It was enough evidence to
[6697.28] sway my vote, which again, I was I was
[6700.88] just totally distraught. I was I was I
[6703.76] was all on board with the Younger Dryas.
[6705.52] And for like two months, I was just
[6706.96] moping. I was like, how am I going to go
[6708.719] back on onto my YouTube channel? Well,
[6710.48] that does. So, well, I I think that's to
[6714.48] your credit, um, Chris, because that's
[6717.52] how science works. You know, you promote
[6719.76] an idea and you get you get married to
[6721.84] the idea, but in the end, it has to be
[6723.599] the evidence that that and really I'm
[6727.199] looking at it is that, okay, I'm not
[6730.239] ready to abandon an impact idea.
[6733.119] Regardless of whether it was younger Dus
[6734.88] or 700,000 years ago or 400, whatever it
[6738.0] might be, right? But what strikes me
[6740.56] because because I originally wanted to
[6742.639] keep, you know, when I first started
[6744.4] looking at the at the at the mega
[6746.199] floods, I just wanted it to be simple. I
[6748.8] wanted to be just one or two big floods.
[6751.199] But it's more complicated than that. It
[6753.199] is. and and um but where I'm at now is
[6757.84] thinking, well, geez, now what the
[6759.76] evidence is suggesting is that rather
[6762.04] than a a a gradualistic scenario
[6765.119] punctuated by one big event, we have to
[6767.36] now take into account that there are
[6769.04] multiple events, far more events at a
[6771.76] much greater frequency than we might
[6773.44] have imagined, you know, a few few
[6776.08] decades ago. Yeah. Yep. And that's Yep.
[6779.599] And and interestingly enough, I think um
[6782.8] Jerome and um what's the guy over at
[6785.52] Washington University? Washington State
[6787.119] University.
[6789.28] Um
[6791.199] Nick Nick Zner Zetner. Yeah. Yeah. They
[6794.32] he's been looking at possibly older
[6796.719] events that have taken place and uh I
[6798.719] wouldn't be surprised if if a mid ply
[6800.96] scene event pops up in their in their
[6804.0] Oh, I think I think so. I think that
[6806.159] there was but then then you presents a
[6810.08] challenge because if you had mega floods
[6812.159] mid plea to scene, now you have to
[6813.96] explain why you had those mega floods.
[6817.44] Yeah. And I still want to tie mega
[6821.04] floods to impacts, right? Especially
[6824.32] over Yeah. over North America and the
[6826.4] lower tide and the Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
[6829.84] what's the other explanation other than
[6832.08] perhaps the sun? That's what Robert
[6833.92] Shock believes. Yeah. We uh we shared
[6836.239] the stage with him a couple weeks ago.
[6838.08] He did. Yeah. Yeah. And and based on
[6841.76] what he was saying, he seems like he's
[6843.28] warmed up slightly. He was completely
[6846.08] rejecting the impact hypothesis when uh
[6849.28] I think it was the company that that
[6850.719] caused him to warm up a little a little
[6852.639] bit, but uh I I didn't get him budging
[6854.8] very much. Not much. No. No. I got some
[6858.08] good I got some good pictures of the
[6860.0] both of us because we were on either
[6861.36] side of them. I got some good pictures
[6862.96] of us eye rolling like, "Oh my gosh."
[6866.96] Well, I have a lot of respect for
[6868.4] Robert. I I do too. I do too. He was
[6870.4] actually one of the highlights of the
[6871.52] weekend. So, yeah, absolutely. And, you
[6874.08] know, I he's inspired me to look deeper
[6877.199] into this the solar factor. Yeah. Which
[6880.48] I was already leaning towards, you know,
[6882.08] because the studies are out there
[6883.52] showing, you know, a much greater solar
[6885.679] variability than had been assumed a
[6887.599] couple of decades ago. Here's my here's
[6889.199] my thing with the sun, though. And this
[6890.8] is this is a a lab that I do with my
[6893.119] students where we try to make a scale
[6895.36] model of the solar system. And and you
[6897.92] know, we take a sun that's about this
[6899.44] big, but Earth, if you if you do it to
[6902.159] scale, Earth is like this big. It's like
[6904.8] it's so so tiny. And so if the sun were
[6907.199] to belch plasma towards us, I I don't
[6910.8] see how it could how it can miss. Like
[6913.04] it would hit the whole half of the
[6914.32] planet and and like scorch it to
[6916.56] nothing.
[6918.239] That's that's my whole thing about solar
[6919.679] events. I don't Again, I'm already
[6921.199] taking people off with uh with removing
[6923.36] Carolina base. Let's just stop. We'll
[6925.04] end there. Well, we can have that
[6926.96] conversation for sure. Um yeah.

Title: The Moon Might Be Our Only Fallback
[0.08] What if I told you that the lunar space
[2.56] program could ultimately act to preserve
[4.96] human civilization
[6.759] itself? Let me ask you a question. If
[10.08] the residents of Earth are currently
[12.32] subject to the whims of the cosmos, what
[15.92] happens if another Tangus-sized impact
[19.68] were to occur over a densely populated
[22.56] place like Los Angeles or Rome or London
[26.48] or Washington DC? What if the next
[29.199] impact isn't taggus sized, but several
[32.8] times
[33.8] larger? What if it wasn't a single
[36.68] bolide, but multiple celestial objects?
[40.8] If we are informed, and we are, that
[43.52] numerous impacts within recent memory
[46.079] have wiped out life over vast regions of
[49.44] terrairma.
[51.28] Isn't it incumbent upon the government
[53.68] and scientific community to develop
[56.64] measures to mitigate such events over
[59.6] our population centers? How does
[61.68] humanity's expansion towards the lunar
[64.96] surface relate to this? And what could
[67.439] our space fairing endeavors look like in
[70.64] 20

Title: From Pop Culture to Policy: NASA’s Return
[0.08] the early 2000s, it seemed to me that we
[2.399] had a huge pop culture presence for
[6.839] NASA. It was something that every time
[9.84] the shuttle launched, everyone was kind
[12.16] of look watching the TV, everyone was
[14.639] looking, every public place, every
[16.56] airport or doctor's office, the channel
[19.52] was turned to the the space shuttle
[21.199] launch. There's a lot to unpack there.
[23.119] Maybe we should start with the origins
[24.48] of the program which was the space
[26.16] policy uh directive that uh was issued
[29.679] in 2017. And I think that is kind of
[32.239] where the whole mission statement was
[34.719] initially codified around which the
[37.76] technology would be organized in order
[40.239] to affect this mission. Since when was
[43.28] the last time? 1972. Even though the
[45.76] lapse of many decades has occurred,
[48.239] we're actually in a better position now.
[50.0] Our technology has invol evolved to the
[52.559] point where returning to the lunar
[54.64] surface is going to be really more
[56.719] doable than it would have been back

Title: The Moon Is More Than Rocks
[0.16] The surface of the moon will be the next
[2.639] step in human space exploration with an
[6.72] emphasis on developing approaches for
[9.8] NC2 or onsite resource utilization. The
[15.04] moon contains a wide range of raw
[17.6] materials that could support a human
[20.279] presence. But some key volatile
[23.519] substances in crucially including water,
[27.119] carbon and nitrogen are scarce on the
[29.599] lunar surface. However, despite their
[32.719] scarcity, carbon and nitrogen will be
[35.92] important for supporting long duration
[39.12] human missions to the lunar surface. For
[41.76] example, both elements will be required
[44.559] for lunar food production. Carbon
[46.96] combined with hydrogen may also be
[48.879] important for carboh reduction of iron
[51.96] oxides to yield oxygen from lunar rocks
[55.6] cuz we know that in some lunar rocks
[58.0] there's up to 40% is oxygen. Carbo
[62.28] reduction uh is a method by which oxygen
[65.84] can be extracted from the rubble that's
[68.96] found in the lunar uh regulith. And the
[72.4] other thing that this that it would be
[74.159] useful for is refueling what is called
[77.799] methyloxbased spacecraft such as the
[80.799] space x starship. I don't think we need
[83.2] to go into the background on what that
[85.92] is, but the point is that there are
[88.479] there would be multiple valuable uses if
[91.439] it was possible to somehow extract or
[94.159] obtain carbon and nitrogen from the moon
[97.439] itself without having to import

Title: The Moon Is Our Backup Plan
[0.16] I'm very keenly supportive of the Aremis
[3.919] mission and going back to the moon
[5.92] because in a sense what we're going to
[8.559] be doing along with just creating a a
[11.44] permanent man presence on the moon
[13.28] creating the potential to establish the
[15.44] moon as an arc that can serve as a
[19.56] repository of our technology, of our
[22.48] knowledge, of our science, of our art,
[24.64] of everything in the case of cosmic
[27.76] disaster. and give us the means to
[30.32] reboot civilization, you know, as
[32.64] efficiently and as quickly as possible
[34.64] without having to reinvent the wheel. To
[36.559] a lot of people listening, yeah, this is
[37.92] just going to sound like science fiction
[39.52] until the next Tangusa comes along and
[42.32] wipes out a city. We've got to face that
[44.96] reality. And I think we're overdue. What
[47.52] happens if we go into a what's been
[49.6] referred to by astronomers as a
[51.68] bombardment epoch where you have this
[55.28] fragmenting object whether it's
[56.96] asteroidal or comet or one a hybrid in
[60.079] between them. This fragmenting creating
[62.64] multiple impactors and then those are
[66.159] littering the inner solar system and
[68.72] particularly uh the plane of the
[70.64] ecliptic that the orbit of the earth is
[73.2] is found in. we go through a period like
[76.32] what appears to have occurred throughout
[78.0] the history of this planet is that the
[81.28] impacts record does not appear to be
[84.08] uniformly distributed through time. It
[86.159] seems to be clustered which again
[87.92] supports this model that there are times
[89.84] when there's more stuff orbiting the sun
[92.56] and in the earth's orbit and more
[94.56] potential for the earth to collide with
[96.56] this stuff. And not only that, but it's
[98.96] also potentially a resource base that we
[101.759] could be

Title: Ice, Not Rivers, Carved This Land
[0.16] Numerous researchers continue to support
[2.24] these explanations despite recent work
[4.72] in northern Saskatchewan, Ontario,
[7.2] Quebec, and the Northwest Territories.
[9.599] This work has shown that enormous
[12.12] turbulent subglacial water flows better
[15.28] account for a variety of erosional bed
[17.92] forms, including giant flutings, ice
[21.439] cavity fill depositional forms, and some
[24.88] types of drumlet. So here's here near
[27.119] the headarters of the Missouri River and
[29.119] you see the river, modern river down
[30.96] here. But the channel that was cut by
[32.96] the water flows that deposited the
[36.0] erratics. The modern Missouri River will
[38.32] never go out of this channel unless it
[40.48] gets deep enough to overflow the divide,
[42.719] which it probably will not anytime in
[45.6] the near future because what's missing
[48.0] is 4 or 5 million cubic miles of ice
[50.559] immediately to the north and it's
[52.399] captured what is now the modern Missouri
[54.559] Twist.

Title: Humans Didn’t Kill 12 Million Mammoths
[0.08] Yeah, very interesting conundrum.
[1.76] There's a lot of those conundrums that
[3.36] are not readily explained through
[6.839] gradualistic scenarios. Have you had a
[9.599] conversation with someone who's a Blitz
[11.12] Creek hypothesis who is of the opinion
[13.28] that the the vast number of these Native
[15.92] American animals, North American? I have
[18.72] not, but I'm pretty much familiar with
[20.24] most of the papers that they've written
[22.48] and obviously I think perhaps in the
[25.24] aftermath there was a role for humans.
[28.48] However, when you see the assumption
[31.8] is again that see what we know now about
[35.2] the lifeways of those late ice age
[38.719] peoples was that they hunted small game,
[41.2] they fished, they foraged. Mammoths
[43.68] would have been the largest most
[45.28] dangerous animal to hunt. And when you
[49.44] think about the fact that if you look at
[51.12] the estimates for total global
[53.96] population back during the late plea
[56.399] scene ranged from 5 to 10 million. The
[58.719] estimates that I've seen for the number
[60.32] of
[61.64] mammoths inhabiting the earth was about
[65.119] 12 million. So you've got at least one
[67.84] mammoth for every man, woman, and child.
[70.159] At least within the conventional
[72.08] interpretations
[73.68] on Earth. Now, how do you exterminate
[77.04] not only the woolly mammoths, but the
[80.56] woolly rhinos, the mastadons, on and on
[83.6] and on and on? Lion. Yeah, exactly. I
[86.799] just don't think it makes sense. Now,
[89.2] what's that based upon? It's based upon
[91.119] the fact that there have been a few
[92.72] sites that were assumed to be kill
[94.4] sites. Like, for example, at the
[96.32] Blackwater draw, Clovis, New Mexico,
[98.479] they found a mammoth skeleton with a
[100.72] Clovis point between the ribs in the rib
[103.759] cage. Well, there we go. There's the
[105.68] explanation. Well, what that tells us is
[107.68] that probably, you know, you don't have
[110.0] a catastrophe that's going to wipe out
[112.399] 12 million woolly mammoths and and then
[114.72] leave humans completely unscathed. M we
[117.439] see the Clovis culture basically
[119.04] disappearing at the younger dus
[121.119] boundary.

Title: A Canyon Cut in Catastrophic Time
[0.08] This is Aftton Canyon, 150 m deep
[3.28] canyon. That's almost 500 ft that formed
[6.16] as a result of overflowing drainage of
[9.36] Lake Manx, an approximately 215 square
[13.519] km Lake Wisconsin Puvia Lake in the
[16.96] central Mojave Desert. Stratographic and
[19.76] geomorphic evidence suggests that Aftton
[21.84] Canyon was cut rapidly sometime after
[26.439] 14,230 plus or minus
[29.48] 1,325 years before present. The rapid
[32.48] draining of Lake Manx and subsequent
[34.559] basin dissection have important
[36.44] implications for lake quitary lake
[39.84] fluctuations in Death Valley. This could
[42.16] have been as recent based on this
[44.0] dating. If I put in
[46.76] 14,230 and I minus 1325, you'll notice
[50.8] how close that comes to the younger
[52.48] dryest. 12,95.
[54.8] Yeah, there we go. So, we have the
[56.64] sudden formation of this huge lake, Lake
[59.399] Manx. It overflows. It then cuts a
[62.84] canyon 150 m deep. It says then the
[65.92] canyon was cut rapidly, rapidly. Not
[69.6] something lasting hundreds of thousands
[71.92] of years or even tens of thousands of
[74.08] years, but rapidly it was associated
[76.64] with the rapid draining of Lake Manic.
[78.799] It appears that what we have is the
[80.4] rapid filling, the overflow, and then
[82.88] the rapid cutting of the canyon. And
[84.799] where was this water all ultimately
[86.64] headed?

Title: They Didn’t Migrate — They Vanished
[0.08] The planet lost about half of all
[3.84] megaponal species during that younger
[6.52] dus. Now there was already animals
[10.0] disappearing leading up to it because I
[12.08] think could be attributed to whatever
[14.16] happened at 14,600 years ago where I
[16.64] talked about earlier meltwater pulse 1A.
[18.88] That's when the the [ __ ] really started
[20.64] to seem like it started coming down and
[22.8] then it peaked younger dus
[25.96] 12,850 and then we had the impact winter
[29.679] for 1300 years and at the end of that it
[32.239] wasn't a gradual warming it was a
[33.76] catastrophic warming by that time I
[35.92] think whatever species had managed to
[37.6] survive some of the earlier events may
[39.44] have succumbed at that point you know
[41.04] the controversies come down to was it
[42.879] nature was it climate was it human
[44.879] hunters I think it was all of that but I
[47.2] think hunters was probably a minor
[49.84] contributor to it because for one thing
[51.76] it now appears that the human population
[54.399] took a major crash at the same time. We
[56.8] see that there's evidence that the
[58.64] Clovis culture in North America pretty
[60.8] much completely disappeared right at
[62.32] that boundary. Well, they weren't the
[64.159] only ones around the planet. Now, if you
[66.72] go and you look at some of the
[68.479] archaeological evidence, one of the
[70.72] things you see over and over again is,
[72.24] well, there was this cultural group in
[73.84] Japan or wherever. I just read a paper
[77.2] on that recently and apparently there
[80.0] was some kind of social disruption and
[81.759] they got up and they migrated and moved
[83.52] away. Well, maybe they did, but maybe
[85.28] they didn't move away. Maybe they didn't
[87.2] survive. And there was a tendency to
[89.28] think, well, you have this evidence of
[91.04] cultural habitation of this area for
[93.92] centuries or millennium and then
[95.52] suddenly you don't. Well, people must
[97.28] have picked up and moved. But maybe
[99.04] that's not the explanation. Maybe it's
[100.96] more a case of they got wiped

Title: DNA, Symbols, and Ancient Intervention
[0.0] It's so fascinating to me when you look
[1.839] at like the kaducius which very clearly
[5.04] resembles the double helix of DNA and
[7.68] how it's closely associated with some of
[9.679] these images of larger beings holding
[12.48] little smaller people with tails. Like
[15.839] what the is that? Like this idea of
[18.0] genetic engineering of taking lower
[20.48] primates and introducing human or alien
[24.16] DNA into these lower primates to create
[27.039] modern humans. I don't know what to
[28.64] think about that. It sounds ridiculous,
[31.599] but how about a scenario like this?
[33.399] Okay. Well, from our superior
[35.68] perspective, we know that you guys down
[37.44] there are living on a vulnerable planet
[39.28] that's going to be have its ass kicked
[41.36] every so often, right? So, we're going
[43.36] to do something to accelerate your
[45.04] evolution a bit so that perhaps you can
[47.44] uh become a little bit more intelligent
[49.28] and figure this out. We're going to
[51.039] leave some clues behind for you and you
[54.559] know then we're going to leave it in
[55.76] your hands to basically redeem the
[58.559] redeem the planet. It's amazing how
[60.239] often people just like will completely
[61.92] dismiss any ideas like

Title: Did Tonga Skew the Climate Narrative?
[0.08] Hunga Tonga, the largest underwater
[2.32] explosion ever recorded by modern
[4.24] instruments and had a number of effects.
[6.16] One of those effects is that it
[7.919] increased the density of the water vapor
[10.32] canopy which captured heat and I think
[12.88] that that's what really made that summer
[15.519] exceptionally warm of 2023. In fact,
[18.4] that water vapor is still clearing out.
[20.8] So, there's a lot of those things that
[22.8] people just don't know and you have to
[24.64] like follow the whole controversy to
[26.88] know that kind of stuff. climate change
[29.16] establishment is trying to downplay the
[31.76] effects of it. There is independent
[33.92] research that pretty much confirms that
[37.12] yes that enormous injection of water
[40.079] vapor would have had the whole climate
[42.239] change narrative is about ultimately
[44.399] using climate change towards social
[46.399] control because again I think the the
[48.64] the strategy now is to focus exclusively
[51.6] on
[52.84] anthropogenicdriven climate

Title: Asteroids Don’t Give Much Warning
[0.16] Ah, there we go. NASA plans for a
[1.839] doomsday scenario of asteroid with 72%
[4.08] chance of hitting Earth in 14 years. And
[6.08] by the way, that's 4 days before the
[8.559] asteroid. June 29, 2024. They discovered
[11.759] it 13 days before, not sooner. They only
[14.639] discovered it 13 days before. Yes. Named
[17.279] 2024 MK passed within 180,000 mi of
[20.08] Earth's surface. 75% the distance
[21.84] between Earth and the Moon. Size of
[23.6] Eiffel Tower came between Earth and the
[25.6] Moon.
[26.4] 180,000 mi. Just for context, is that a
[28.96] big deal or is that not like it was
[30.96] almost a missed in astronomical sense?
[33.52] That's like a whisker. You got to
[35.92] picture these things are out there
[37.68] orbiting the sun. A lot of these things
[39.6] like comets and asteroids that are
[41.76] circling in an orbit that takes them out
[44.079] to Jupiter and back to the sun again. Do
[46.239] you remember 1994, summer of 1994, July,
[49.84] when 21 objects of a fragmented comet
[53.28] plunged into Jupiter? Well, this was at
[55.12] the time the most watched astronomical
[56.879] event in history. It's circling going
[59.199] into the sun, going back out, going
[62.16] behind Jupiter, and coming back in. It's
[64.239] a big elliptical orbit. And that's what
[66.24] you're seeing here, the so-called string
[67.92] of pearls. And so, it took 3 months of
[70.0] observations. You've got enough of the
[72.64] ellipse, the orbital ellipse to
[75.28] reconstruct the whole ellipse. You've
[77.04] also got data on the velocity. So when
[80.08] you put that together into your models
[82.08] with the other orbital elements, you can
[84.159] now make predictions. And so after they
[86.72] discovered this thing just after it's
[88.4] coming around behind Jupiter and in the
[90.4] early stages of breaking apart. And so
[92.4] they were able to predict that in the
[94.88] second week of July 1994, these 21
[97.92] pieces were going to fall into Jupiter.

Title: The Moon Could Save Civilization
[1.199] What if I told you that the lunar space
[3.76] program could ultimately act to preserve
[6.08] human civilization
[7.88] itself? Let me ask you a question. If
[11.28] the residents of Earth are currently
[13.519] subject to the whims of the cosmos, what
[17.119] happens if another Tangus-sized impact
[20.88] were to occur over a densely populated
[23.76] place like Los Angeles or Rome or London
[27.68] or Washington DC? What if the next
[30.4] impact isn't tungusa- sized, but several
[34.0] times
[35.0] larger? What if it wasn't a single
[37.879] bolide, but multiple celestial objects?
[42.0] If we are informed, and we are, that
[44.719] numerous impacts within recent memory
[47.28] have wiped out life over vast regions of
[50.64] terrairma.
[52.48] Isn't it incumbent upon the government
[54.879] and scientific community to develop
[57.84] measures to mitigate such events over
[60.8] our population centers? How does
[62.879] humanity's expansion towards the lunar
[66.159] surface relate to this? And what could
[68.64] our space fairing endeavors look like in
[71.84] 20 years? Join us on this episode of
[74.799] Squaring the Circle to find out.
[88.4] Well, welcome to another episode of
[91.28] Squaring the Circle. I am joined uh at
[95.439] this time by my colleague and producer
[98.32] and several other multiple hats that he
[100.96] wears, John Arthur Fiala. So, it's good
[104.32] to see you again, John. Good to be here,
[106.479] sir. Maybe we'll quickly mention that
[108.72] you and I just spent a week together
[110.399] exploring the route of the great
[112.479] Bonavville flood, Snake River plane, uh
[116.56] the Snake River Canyon. Uh we saw a lot
[119.2] of very interesting things, I would say,
[121.28] in retrospect. What was your impression?
[123.92] Although you were behind the camera the
[125.759] whole time, you were obviously tuned
[128.08] into it as much as anybody on the tour.
[130.479] So, what's your takeaway? Gorgeous
[133.879] landscapes. Big things happened there
[136.8] and we had a great set of tour guides.
[139.12] You, Bradley Young, contact at the
[141.52] cabin, Darren, all good people. Good
[144.64] people. It was really that was as to me
[147.04] that's as valuable and as enjoyable as
[150.48] the landscapes and the evidence that
[152.56] we're examining. So, yeah, it was very
[154.8] special. We'll have to do uh as you get
[156.72] some of that uh footage edited that you
[159.92] take that amazing footage of what I've
[161.84] seen just a little of so far. We'll have
[164.56] to do an episode. Um I know you got
[167.599] stuff coming. Yeah. So, uh, I wanted to
[171.84] talk to you and I know we've been
[173.12] discussing, uh, talking about, uh, this
[176.48] the the the shall we say the
[178.4] reactivation of a lunar program, uh, uh,
[180.959] and, uh, the finally the in the impetus
[185.44] to return humans to the moon after many,
[187.84] many years of neglect. So, I'm excited
[191.36] about that. I know you're excited about
[193.2] that. So, I think we should maybe talk
[195.519] about that a little bit. Um, absolutely.
[197.76] cuz I I I remember I don't know about
[199.84] you, but the early 2000s, it seemed to
[201.84] me that we had a huge pop culture
[206.08] presence for NASA. It was something that
[210.239] every time the shuttle launched,
[211.92] everyone was kind of look watching the
[214.319] TV, everyone was looking, every public
[216.56] place, every airport or doctor's office,
[219.76] the channel was turned to the the space
[221.68] shuttle launch. and and it especially
[224.48] since the 2008 uh you know Barack
[227.76] Obama's presidency it 2009 that whole
[230.64] time frame it feels like uh after NASA
[233.36] got
[234.28] canned is just it's falling out of pop
[236.64] culture. So, we were kind of looking at
[239.28] the Aremis program, which really is the
[241.519] the spiritual successor, I believe, to
[244.08] the shuttle as far as our next great
[247.439] step into the cosmos, because the
[249.92] shuttle was kind of as, as you've said,
[251.84] a a stop gap or or an in between the
[255.28] Apollo. It was a makework project as
[257.919] much as anything. So now we have now we
[261.759] have this this Artemis pro program and I
[264.4] think it's really really neat but not a
[266.32] lot of people have heard about it and so
[269.199] uh I I figure now is as good as time as
[271.6] any to go ahead and real quick discuss
[273.44] it. Mhm. I'd love to uh because I'm
[276.639] trying to understand the intricacies of
[278.4] the whole uh the whole project. Uh
[281.28] there's a lot to unpack there, but maybe
[283.52] we should start with the origins of the
[284.96] program, which was the space policy uh
[287.68] directive that uh was issued in 2017.
[291.28] And I think that is kind of where the
[293.36] whole mission statement was initially
[295.72] codified around which the technology
[298.72] would be organized in order to affect
[301.52] this mission.
[303.56] um purpose of the Aremis program to
[306.16] reestablish a uh a human presence on the
[309.639] moon. And uh since when was the last
[314.0] time? 1972. 1972 was the last time we
[317.199] had a a human presence on the moon. And
[321.199] even though the lapse of many decades
[323.28] has occurred, we're actually in a better
[325.52] position now. our technology has invol
[327.919] evolved to the point where uh returning
[331.12] to the lunar surface is going to be
[333.28] really more doable than it would have
[335.039] been back then. Now I mentioned that the
[337.84] shuttle program that you uh that you
[340.8] referenced you know we yes I was very
[342.88] much interested in that. Um, I thought,
[345.919] yeah, here's here's a a good uh attempt
[350.0] to to get the human presence back in
[352.16] space. But the problem was it just it
[354.4] was it didn't have the funding necessary
[357.52] for uh mission accomplishment. And that
[360.56] was reflected in the two disasters of
[363.039] Challenger and and Discovery, which
[366.319] really sidelined the US space program
[369.52] for years as a result of that. But now
[373.44] we're coming back around full circle and
[376.96] you know Discovery was the last big
[379.199] major disaster. It's fading in the past
[382.0] now. And I think that there is a renewed
[385.16] incentive and interest in re
[388.84] reactivating revitalizing the US space
[391.52] program. And one of the things that I'm
[393.84] very keenly uh uh wanting to accomplish
[396.8] through these uh through these podcasts
[399.52] and through conferences and lectures and
[402.16] all of that together is to try to
[404.56] inspire the upcoming generations
[407.84] uh to to really support and endorse uh a
[411.919] vigorous space program trying to get
[414.319] back to the moon, ultimately get to
[416.8] Mars, ultimately get to the asteroid
[419.12] belt. um all of which we could be doing
[421.52] within the next few generations if the
[424.16] motive there if the will is there. Uh so
[428.319] one of the goals of Artemis is to
[430.4] establish a permanent base on the moon.
[433.039] Uh and from that permanent base that
[435.12] could facilitate human missions to Mars.
[437.919] Now we should of course be discussing
[439.68] why do we want to do this. I think that
[443.039] uh we get into sort of philosophical and
[445.639] epistemological realms when we're
[447.52] discussing ultimately uh the rationale
[450.88] for humans moving into space. But I
[453.919] think that if we are going to endure
[456.599] long-term as a civilization if not a
[460.24] species, we have to do that.
[463.44] We have to because two things are coming
[465.599] together here now. Along with our uh
[469.039] increased and improved ability to access
[471.52] the higher cosmic frontier, we're also
[474.319] learning that life here below on the
[477.28] surface of this planet is extremely
[479.84] dangerous, extremely vulnerable, and has
[482.639] been affected repeatedly by incursions
[486.56] from things outside. And this brings us,
[489.84] I think, back to something else we need
[491.52] to kind of discuss is the Dart mission.
[494.56] And the idea that if we don't expand
[498.24] into space, we continue to be
[501.319] vulnerable. And at first, that may sound
[504.72] like a very uh strained argument to say,
[508.16] "Oh, we're vulnerable." uh and and
[510.4] people who are unaware of what's been
[513.039] going on in near earth space over the
[516.159] last half century say uh it's easy to be
[519.2] oblivious to the fact that yeah there is
[521.76] a bigger issue and we are susceptible to
[525.6] impacts and interestingly when you look
[528.48] at the record of increased of the number
[532.16] of impacts it almost seems that we've
[534.8] been in sort of a lull for the last
[536.48] century or
[537.88] two. Uh if that's the case, uh we've got
[541.2] to reckon with the the idea that there
[543.44] may be episodes or time periods where
[547.44] Earth is more susceptible to impacts and
[550.76] therefore as a consequence and a result,
[553.92] human civilization would be more um sub
[558.56] susceptible to the to impacts. And
[561.92] there's a growing body of information
[563.68] and knowledge that suggests that some of
[566.88] the uh great uh failures of civilization
[571.839] that we see in the past whether it's
[573.6] from you know the indis valley whether
[575.6] it's Mesopotamia whether it's the the
[578.08] the the
[579.16] the dark ages that we that are now
[582.08] showing up in the record of civilization
[584.8] on earth. uh we see there are many
[587.279] examples now of civilizations that were
[590.56] uh prospering relatively and then
[593.2] suddenly they're gone. Well, we could
[596.0] say drought. Yes, we could say vcanism.
[598.959] We could say uh climate change. We can
[602.0] say all of that and it's probably true.
[604.72] However, the question that's wide open
[607.32] is how much of that is being influenced
[611.12] by the larger environment. And I think
[613.68] the answer is going to turn out to be
[615.519] quite a bit of it, right? Especially
[618.0] when we start talking about impacts.
[620.48] Now, an impact going turning back to the
[623.04] Dart mission, um, which is about
[625.76] deflection or deflection of of a
[628.72] celestial object that would otherwise
[630.48] strike the Earth. That's a good start.
[633.6] It does not, however, cover the gamut of
[636.24] celestial threats. It doesn't
[637.839] necessarily uh it's not going to for
[640.32] example
[642.24] uh prevent cosmic dust in the in the
[645.519] event of a major incursion of a of a uh
[649.959] fryable cometary nucleus that that
[653.839] rapidly disintegrates into dust. Uh a
[657.36] shorter short period comet comes in and
[659.92] litters the plane of the ecliptic with
[662.0] cosmic dust. Well then earth passes
[664.88] through that. That dust accretes to the
[667.2] earth. It increases the opacity of the
[669.6] atmosphere and the reflectivity of the
[671.519] sun and it brings on a literal dark age.
[675.12] Right now, how do we cope with something
[676.64] like that? Well, at present, we don't
[678.64] have an ability to cope with something
[680.32] like that. We're taking a little bit of
[682.399] a detour here to uh tell a story that I
[685.519] think is going to be valuable. I was
[687.76] coming down the stairs and I think
[689.76] somebody just ahead of me had spilled a
[691.839] little bit. My foot hit it, slid out
[693.839] from under me, and I tumbled down three
[696.32] or four stairs to the bottom. I sure
[699.04] banged up my left knee. It was painful,
[702.24] but uh I was very relieved to remember
[706.64] that I had brought I happened to pack my
[709.6] CBD from the god sav. And I was really
[714.72] grateful that I had remembered to do
[716.399] that. So, I that night I put some of the
[720.32] SAV on, went to bed, though. I've I've,
[723.519] you know, being in the construction and
[725.44] building industry, I've had many falls
[727.36] and in uh injuries and stuff, and I
[729.56] figured I'm going to be laid up with
[731.92] this for a month. We drove home, I think
[734.399] it was 3 to 4 days later. I continued
[736.959] applying the SAV, and I would say within
[739.04] a week, I was getting around pretty
[741.12] good. I always bring the oil uh when I
[743.6] travel and I I'm now after this episode,
[746.639] I'm like, "Okay, I'm always going to
[748.079] have the SAB with me, too." We don't
[750.399] have the ability to cope with a uh a
[753.76] major coronal mass ejection that targets
[756.8] the Earth. Uh we're vulnerable to that.
[759.68] Now, all of these things are are are
[761.68] it's feasible to technologically address
[764.399] them, scientifically address these
[766.44] threats. Um for the immediate though I
[770.079] think that the most uh potential likely
[773.36] threat though isn't is an impact along
[776.16] the lines of Tunguska Chela or you know
[780.079] an order of magnitude bigger and we've
[782.8] seen I would like to reference the one
[784.72] that passed Earth last June within the
[787.279] orbit of the moon. We've talked about
[788.8] that but 2024
[790.92] YR4
[792.839] 250,000 miles within Earth's orbit.
[796.959] Yeah. Yeah. I think it was actually at
[798.959] its closest it was it was closer than
[801.2] that I believe. But anyways, the point
[803.68] is a slightly different trajectory or a
[807.2] deflection by Earth's gravity field. Uh
[810.48] what can happen is that objects that are
[813.76] orbiting between Earth and Jupiter, they
[816.079] can get deflected and over a succession
[820.56] of orbits, they can close in on Earth,
[823.2] just as we saw Shoemaker Levy 9 doing as
[826.32] it closed in on Jupiter. And in July of
[829.32] 1994, 21 impacts occurred in Jupiter of
[833.279] of a fragmented comet nuclei that had at
[836.24] one point been a single object. This is
[838.32] what comet nuclei do. They come into
[840.24] their earth's orbit and they fragment
[842.24] and they create multiple offspring which
[845.12] then increases the vulnerability of the
[847.68] earth. Uh and then those offspring can
[851.04] in turn degrade into uh another level of
[856.12] disintegration and so on until you end
[858.639] up with just a stream of cosmic dusk
[861.92] dust around in the orbit. So this is why
[866.72] I'm very keenly supportive of the Aremis
[870.56] mission and going back to the moon,
[872.8] right? Because in a sense what we're
[875.6] going to be doing
[878.04] uh along with just present creating a a
[882.399] permanent man mission uh man presence on
[884.639] the moon is we're going to be
[886.48] establishing uh it's creating the
[888.399] potential let me put it that creating
[889.76] the potential to establish the moon as
[892.16] an arc that can can uh serve as a
[897.24] repository of our technology of our
[900.24] knowledge of our science of our art of
[902.839] everything in the case of a cosmic
[907.0] disaster and give us the means to reboot
[910.76] civilization as uh you know as
[913.6] efficiently and as quickly as possible
[916.079] without having to reinvent the wheel.
[918.639] Now to a lot of people listening, yeah,
[920.48] this is just going to sound like science
[921.959] fiction until the next Tuska comes along
[925.279] and wipes out a city. And we've got to
[929.12] face that reality. And I think we're
[931.76] overdue. I think we're overdue. I I
[933.92] really do. Having now assessed the
[937.279] probabilities over say the last few
[939.68] millennia or over the holene I think
[943.0] yeah what happens if we go into a what's
[946.24] been referred to by astronomers as a
[948.639] bombardment epoch where you have this
[953.12] fragment fragmenting object whether it's
[955.6] asteroidal or comet or one a hybrid in
[958.72] between them this fragmenting creating
[961.279] multiple uh
[964.56] uh impactors and then those are
[967.519] littering the inner solar system and
[970.88] particularly uh the plane of the
[972.8] ecliptic that the orbit of the earth is
[975.44] is found in and we go through a period
[979.04] like what appears to have occurred
[980.639] throughout the history of this planet is
[983.279] that the impacts record does not appear
[987.12] to be uniformly distributed through
[989.12] time. it seems to be clustered which
[992.24] again supports this model that there are
[994.24] times when there's more stuff orbiting
[996.959] the sun and in the earth's orbit and
[999.36] more potential for the earth to uh
[1001.759] collide with this stuff. So getting uh
[1005.12] back to the moon I think is of
[1006.72] preeminent importance. And not only
[1009.519] that, but it's also potentially a uh a
[1013.759] resource base that we could be using.
[1016.8] And I know there's going to be
[1018.0] environmentalists that are probably
[1019.279] going to throw up their hands uh and
[1021.12] say, "Oh, no, we can't do that. We have
[1022.88] to have hands off. We can't touch the
[1024.559] moon." But I would say in response to
[1027.199] that that for about 4 billion years the
[1029.52] moon surface has been pulverized by
[1032.079] gigantic impacts that has created this
[1034.48] thick layer of regulith which is just
[1036.72] this rubble that covers the surface of
[1039.12] the moon. Uh large vast areas of the
[1042.64] moon's surface are covered with this
[1044.36] rubble. But it turns out this rubble is
[1047.36] rich in resources. And the amount of
[1050.0] this rubble is so vast that for us to go
[1055.28] there and begin harvesting some of this
[1057.84] resource, utilizing some of this
[1060.2] resource, it would be a long long long
[1063.84] time before it had any discernable
[1066.559] impact on the moon in any way. Right.
[1070.08] So, one of the things I don't know if
[1071.76] you caught this uh last summer, John, it
[1074.08] was in a study that was published in in
[1076.64] June of
[1078.6] 2024. All right. Um, and there was five
[1083.2] scientists who who uh wrote the paper.
[1086.96] uh and the title of the paper is
[1090.2] assessing the survival of carbonatous
[1094.28] condrites impacting the lunar surface as
[1097.6] a potential resource was published in
[1100.24] the journal uh planetary and space
[1103.12] science in uh July on July 1st of
[1108.2] 2024. Anyways, uh the team of five
[1112.24] scientists had this to say and I'm going
[1114.64] to quote from the paper if that's all
[1116.4] right with you. Well, then I'm going to
[1118.88] go right ahead. The moon offers a wide
[1122.16] range of potential resources that may
[1125.679] help sustain a future human
[1128.6] presence, but it lacks indigenous carbon
[1132.64] and nitrogen.
[1135.16] Fortunately, these elements have been
[1137.36] delivered to the moon's surface by
[1139.72] carbonatous condondrite asteroid
[1142.24] impactors. I'll come back to explain a
[1144.88] little bit more detail what a CC or a
[1146.72] carbonacious condrite asteroid impactor
[1149.679] is. But to continue with the quote here,
[1152.88] we employ numerical modeling to assess
[1155.76] the extent to which these materials may
[1159.12] have sufficiently survived impact with
[1161.44] the lunar surface to be viable sources
[1164.88] of raw materials for future exploration.
[1170.96] So carbon carbonatous condrites just to
[1174.919] uh clarify that a little bit is um their
[1179.039] class of meteor that contains water
[1181.84] carbon up to about 3% carbon carbonates
[1186.08] organic compounds and minerals that have
[1188.72] been altered by water. They're
[1190.64] considered to be among some of the most
[1193.36] primitive of meteorites uh most
[1196.88] primitive class of meteorites. So the
[1199.36] authors uh go on to discuss the
[1201.84] prospects for lunar resource
[1205.08] potential and I'll quote again the
[1208.08] surface of the moon will be the next
[1210.32] step in human space exploration with an
[1214.4] emphasis on developing approaches for
[1217.559] inc2 or onsite resource utilization.
[1222.48] The moon contains a wide range of raw
[1225.28] materials that could support a human
[1228.039] presence. But some key volatile
[1231.2] substances in crucially including water,
[1234.88] carbon and nitrogen are scarce on the
[1237.36] lunar
[1238.28] surface. However, despite their
[1241.28] scarcity, carbon and nitrogen
[1244.52] uh will be important for supporting long
[1248.64] duration human missions to the lunar
[1251.039] surface.
[1252.32] For example, uh most both elements will
[1256.08] be required for lunar food production.
[1259.2] Uh carbon combined with hydrogen may
[1261.52] also be important for
[1263.88] carbo thermal reduction of iron oxides
[1267.44] to yield oxygen from lunar rocks because
[1270.32] we know that in some lunar rocks there's
[1273.12] up to 40% is oxygen. So carbon
[1277.44] carboothermal reduction uh is a method
[1280.559] by which uh that uh oxygen can be
[1284.039] extracted from the rubble that's found
[1287.039] in the lunar uh
[1289.48] regulith. Uh and the other thing that
[1292.96] this that it would be useful for is
[1295.039] refueling uh what is called
[1298.28] methyloxbased spacecraft such as the
[1301.36] space x starship. I don't think we need
[1303.76] to go into the background on what that
[1306.48] is, but the point is that there are
[1309.039] there would be multiple valuable uses if
[1312.0] it was possible to somehow extract or
[1314.72] obtain carbon and nitrogen from the moon
[1318.0] itself without having to import it. Does
[1321.039] that make sense? Absolutely. Fuel,
[1324.0] building material, and uh potentially
[1327.52] oxygen and water are what they're
[1329.679] looking at extracting here. It's good
[1331.6] stuff. Yes. So, so this is what they go
[1335.52] on to say. This is what they realize
[1337.12] that quote, "Some of the desired
[1339.28] volatile resources lacking in indigenous
[1343.039] lunar materials are likely to have been
[1346.08] delivered to the moon from external
[1349.159] sources. These sources include the solar
[1352.799] wind,
[1354.36] micrometeorites, and delivery through
[1356.64] comet and asteroid impacts.
[1359.84] The first two sources, however, will
[1362.159] yield very low
[1364.12] concentrations, making processes
[1366.76] processing
[1368.36] expensive. It has been proposed, though,
[1370.88] that carbon and nitrogen would likely be
[1373.28] found in polar ice deposits. But as to
[1377.12] the existence and quantity of polar
[1379.679] water, more research needs to be done.
[1383.679] And I will end of quote. So I will
[1385.52] mention here of course that this is one
[1386.96] of the objectives of the Aremis mission
[1389.52] is to do a survey uh of the polar
[1392.88] regions for water and try to really get
[1394.799] a better handle on just how much water
[1397.6] there is available on the moon.
[1401.32] Um however then the authors go on to say
[1404.96] it is interesting to note that carbon
[1407.2] and nitrogen are abundant in
[1410.0] carbonacious condrite meteorites sourced
[1413.679] from asteroid parent bodies. Now okay so
[1418.559] asteroid parent bodies will deliver that
[1422.48] carbon and nitrogen to the lunar
[1424.24] surface. But the fact that they're that
[1427.52] they're sources shows us and implies in
[1430.48] my mind that the asteroid belt itself
[1434.32] must be an extraordinarily rich source
[1438.559] of these
[1440.039] elements. Uh the the authors go on to
[1442.72] say that because asteroids with the with
[1445.679] CC like or carbonatous condritike
[1449.799] compositions will have impacted the
[1452.159] lunar surface over geological time.
[1455.2] these could be a useful source of these
[1458.88] key elements on the moon. Uh but there's
[1463.279] a problem. We're lacking enough samples
[1465.919] from which to draw firm conclusions. So
[1469.96] um the authors then suggest that unlike
[1473.36] unless or and until significant
[1476.88] quantities of surviving meteorite
[1479.36] materials are retrieved from the lunar
[1481.799] surface, experimental and numerical
[1484.799] modeling are the best tools to probe the
[1487.12] fate of projectiles during and
[1490.159] immediately after impact.
[1493.36] So they then go on to explain that there
[1495.6] are multiple uh factors influencing the
[1498.32] survivability of CC impactors. Uh and
[1502.64] these include things like composition,
[1504.64] density, strength, cohesion and and so
[1508.32] on. The paracity of the projectile, the
[1511.52] paracity and properties of the target
[1514.0] material and the angle of impact. So
[1516.799] there's a bunch of factors that have to
[1518.559] be integrated here to try to understand
[1521.52] what would be the potential of
[1523.039] extracting carbon and nitrogen from the
[1526.159] lunar
[1527.24] surface. So drawing on previously
[1529.919] numerically simulated hypervelocity
[1532.559] impact studies that show that volatiles
[1535.44] and organic material could survive an
[1539.039] impact under the right
[1541.32] conditions. Here's the conditions. The
[1543.6] material would have to uh be removed
[1546.64] from the surface to the degree of
[1549.72] degradation from micrometeorite
[1552.76] bombardment. Uh let's see, let me go
[1554.799] back again here. The material would have
[1557.12] to be removed from the surface to the
[1560.24] degree that degradation from
[1561.919] micrometeorite bombardment could not
[1564.08] occur afterwards. In other words, once
[1566.32] it's delivered to the lunar surface,
[1568.0] somehow it needs to be insulated uh from
[1570.88] further degradation that would occur
[1572.88] through micromedorite
[1574.72] uh bombardment. This time is estimated
[1577.919] to be between 40 and 80 million years.
[1581.36] So then the implication is that you have
[1584.08] to have rapid burial, a process that
[1586.64] could occur through the deposition of
[1590.4] crater
[1591.64] ejecta originating from nearby impacts.
[1595.84] This would imply development of
[1598.0] effective extraction
[1599.96] technologies and the establishment of a
[1602.799] lunar mining industry. Uh so the the
[1606.72] results of this modeling that the team
[1608.559] did showed that a 1 kilometer which is
[1612.64] uh 3,280 ft about uh 2/3 of a mile
[1617.36] roughly in diameter um if you had a 1
[1620.88] kilometer diameter CC type meteorite it
[1624.559] could survive impact if the closing
[1626.799] velocity was relatively low that is
[1629.679] around 5 km per second or roughly three
[1633.6] three uh miles per second, right? 3
[1636.799] miles per second, which actually,
[1638.559] relatively speaking, is very fast. But
[1640.88] for hypervelocity objects moving at at
[1644.48] uh cosmic trajectories, that's not very
[1647.12] fast because we could be looking at
[1648.64] objects 15 to five times moving four to
[1652.08] five times faster than that. Okay? So if
[1654.4] you have around uh 3 m/s or 5 km/s and
[1658.799] the angle of approach is 15° let's see
[1662.72] 15° or less
[1665.76] uh and under these
[1667.32] circumstances temperatures would be in
[1669.44] the range of about 800° Fahrenheit uh or
[1673.279] less and this would allow for the
[1675.36] survival of most carbon species and
[1678.399] organic materials along with some amino
[1680.799] acids.
[1682.32] So after the impact some of the
[1684.64] surviving projectile material would
[1686.72] remain in the crater but most of it is
[1689.36] going to be ejected beyond the crater.
[1691.6] So as long as the temperatures generated
[1693.52] during impact stayed below the
[1695.76] vaporization temperatures uh of nitrogen
[1699.12] and carbon it is probable that these
[1701.76] elements could survive. So in their
[1704.08] conclusion uh the authors state this
[1706.72] quote we have presented the results of
[1709.52] impact simulations investigating the
[1712.159] survival of CC material after impact
[1716.64] with the lunar surface. In this case
[1719.52] survival is defined as material
[1721.52] experiencing temperatures under a
[1723.919] specific threshold most importantly the
[1727.12] material melt temperature. The only
[1730.24] scenario in which significant
[1732.559] significant amounts about 16% of the
[1735.72] original projectile mass of nitrogen
[1739.44] bearing compounds survive is at the
[1741.44] lowest impact velocity and angle. Highly
[1744.88] oblique impacts are expected to lead to
[1748.24] concentrations of wellpreserved
[1750.24] projectile material downrange of the
[1753.279] crater. This material may be the most
[1756.399] useful from a resource perspective as it
[1760.799] is likely to contain abundant carbon and
[1763.919] nitrogen bearing compounds within a
[1766.32] small
[1767.48] area away from the impact site. So that
[1770.72] becomes a potential resource and this is
[1773.12] very interesting.
[1775.48] Um then in reference to this I commented
[1779.039] that in the meantime we look forward to
[1782.0] the results of NASA's ice mining
[1785.72] experiment-1 supposedly to launch late
[1788.88] 2024 or to early 2025. When I wrote that
[1792.88] um a year ago that was had had not you
[1796.64] know this was still projected for the
[1798.24] future. It hasn't happened yet. Early
[1800.559] 2025. Come on guys. Let's get our butts
[1802.96] in gear. All right. The results of this
[1805.36] mission are intended to answer
[1807.24] definitively definitively whether or not
[1810.32] water is present on the moon in usable
[1813.08] quantities in the south polear region.
[1815.84] The evidence in hand from the time of
[1817.679] the Clementine mission in 1994 suggests
[1821.919] the probability of water ice at the
[1824.08] South Pole and the lunar prospector
[1826.64] mission of 1998 yielded more evidence
[1829.44] for ice in the permanently shallowed
[1832.2] craters shadowed sorry shadowed craters.
[1835.679] Then we had the Indian spacecraft, the
[1837.799] Chan
[1839.32] Chandryan one release its moon impact
[1842.399] probe if you remember that which crashed
[1844.88] into the Shackleton crater near the
[1847.679] lunar south pole and it apparently
[1849.76] detected water in the moon's surface.
[1852.72] Only further research is going to
[1854.64] confirm this. Some estimates have put
[1856.799] the volume of water near the lunar
[1858.64] surface as much as 3 cubic kilm. if
[1863.0] retrievable, that could supply plenty of
[1865.6] water for a lunar base and our colonies,
[1869.12] which then brings us back to the uh to
[1872.64] the Aremis
[1874.76] mission. So, uh, if we're going to be
[1878.72] able to
[1880.44] harvest the, uh, uh, regilith
[1884.039] for building materials, fuel, oxygen,
[1888.559] and
[1889.399] water, we're going to have to first do a
[1892.32] little bit of research. And like we
[1894.159] talked about last time, the Chang uh,
[1896.399] missions, the Japanese probes, the uh,
[1899.6] Indian probes, those are all giving us
[1902.0] great strides and great hope. But uh
[1904.72] later on this year is the next first
[1907.519] attempt of the Aremis program. But
[1909.919] Randall, what is the Aremis program?
[1912.64] Like we talked about, it's an outgrowth
[1914.32] of the space policy directive, which is
[1917.36] sort of here's the game plan for the
[1920.96] next phase of space development, space
[1924.2] exploration, space utilization, and so
[1926.64] on. If we break the com the the program
[1929.519] Artemis program down to its components
[1932.519] uh what do we got? We've got the uh well
[1936.88] we could look to an earlier the earlier
[1939.519] program the constellation program and
[1942.399] the development of the Orion spacecraft.
[1945.2] So there the this served as sort of the
[1948.159] launching the pre- Artemis policies that
[1951.6] out of which the Aremis program grew.
[1955.64] Um so one of the things that uh in the
[1960.48] uh Orion spacecraft is the European
[1963.84] service module. Well, it's a component
[1965.84] of the Orion spacecraft and it's p it's
[1969.039] a primary uh power and propulsion
[1971.919] component. That's essentially what the
[1974.32] European service module is. And the
[1976.72] Europeans contributed their version of
[1979.039] it to the uh to the Orion spacecraft.
[1984.24] uh and there were you know this was a
[1986.0] product of the uh of the European Space
[1989.44] Agency which is Europe's counterpart to
[1992.48] NASA. The lunar gateway space station
[1995.6] that's an interesting interesting
[1997.679] component. The lunar gateway space
[1999.6] station uh it's a it's going to be a new
[2003.039] space station which is to be assembled
[2004.88] in orbit around the moon. Right. The
[2007.679] gateway is intended to serve as a
[2009.519] communication hub, science laboratory,
[2012.48] and habitation module for astronauts as
[2015.76] part of the Aremis program. So, that to
[2017.919] me is one of the most interesting
[2019.84] components of it is the uh the lunar
[2023.279] gateway. The lunar gateway. I like that.
[2026.159] And it's called the gateway because it's
[2028.88] going to be the gateway
[2030.679] to Mars. At least that's the plan,
[2035.6] right? Yes. And it'll it'll also be the
[2038.159] the service hub for the hls, the human
[2040.88] landing system that's going to go
[2044.159] between the the lunar surface and the
[2046.64] gateway.
[2048.24] And you said the gateway to Mars
[2050.159] initially. Yes. But I would look at that
[2051.919] as the gateway to the whole solar system
[2054.159] ultimately. The belt next. Mars first.
[2057.359] The belt next. And the belt. Yes. Even
[2060.079] further. Even further. Even more
[2062.72] missions to Europa, etc. I was just
[2064.72] going to say Europa. Just you got the
[2067.119] word out of my mouth before I could open
[2069.52] my mouth and articulate it.
[2072.04] Um, yeah. So, uh, and who's
[2075.359] collaborating? Okay, so we've got NASA,
[2077.359] the European Space Agency, the Japan
[2080.159] Aerospace A Exploration Agency, the
[2083.52] Canadian Space Agency, and the Muhammad
[2087.2] bin Rashid Space Center.
[2090.48] Now, this is what I've been advocating
[2092.159] for years is we need international
[2095.28] cooperative efforts because this
[2098.599] endeavor of of moving civilization into
[2101.839] space is so huge, is so vast in its
[2106.599] undertaking that it's it's completely
[2109.599] the opposite of the Malthusian world
[2112.44] view and that we're all in this grim
[2116.24] struggle for ever diminishing resources
[2119.359] whether whether as individuals, whether
[2121.52] as communities, or whether as nations.
[2124.079] And that's kind of where all of our
[2125.52] foreign policy is based upon right now
[2127.839] is this idea of finite resources, zero
[2131.52] someum worldview, and whoever has the
[2135.359] biggest military can control the
[2137.44] planetary resources uh until they
[2140.24] eventually run out. I mean, essentially,
[2142.64] that's the mindset. When all we have to
[2144.88] do is turn our attention to the larger
[2147.119] environment of which we are a part and
[2149.839] we realize the infinite potential and at
[2153.44] that point the competition for finite
[2157.2] for limited and finite resources becomes
[2160.72] uh obsolete. it becomes
[2162.92] irrelevant because the it's as if it's
[2167.76] as if there's I think about um uh the
[2172.079] lord of the no it was in the
[2174.92] hobbit remember in the hobbit when they
[2177.359] finally got to the cave and uh what was
[2180.48] the name of the big dragon smog
[2184.079] well you remember the amount of gold
[2186.32] that was in there was so vast that what
[2191.04] sense would it make for different
[2193.52] factions to be fighting and killing each
[2195.68] other when there's no even conceivable
[2198.64] way that any any one of those isolated
[2201.76] parties could ever even Yeah. Exactly.
[2206.56] That's kind of we're faced with that.
[2209.119] And now with this new research showing
[2211.839] over and over and over again that space
[2214.72] is such an incredibly rich source of
[2219.72] resources. You know, it seems to me that
[2222.079] it's just obvious that yeah, of course
[2224.96] it's going to be challenging. Of course
[2227.28] it's going to be risky. Of course it's
[2230.16] going to be dangerous. But what have we
[2232.88] ever done as a human species on this
[2235.2] planet that was worth doing that have
[2237.76] led to a betterment of the species that
[2240.64] haven't been those things? I mean,
[2243.28] everything we've undertaken to do, even
[2245.68] just trying to sit passively under the
[2247.76] the the banyan tree has its own risks
[2251.28] and dangers to it. You know, when the
[2253.68] next uh leopard comes along and decides,
[2256.4] oh, look at that uh guy sitting
[2258.88] peacefully under the tree meditating.
[2260.88] what a good meal he'd make, right? I
[2263.839] mean, there there's no way getting
[2265.119] around dangers. There's no way of
[2266.48] getting around risks. No way getting
[2268.32] around challenges. And I think somehow
[2270.64] nature has actually designed challenges
[2274.0] and risks and danger intrinsically into
[2277.2] our species because this is what brings
[2279.839] out the best in I think our species is
[2283.04] this. You know, I've said all along, you
[2285.599] know, to the uh, you know, to the
[2287.92] antagonists of free market
[2290.44] capitalism that look, there's never
[2293.68] going to be any great accomplishments if
[2296.64] there's not the potential of great
[2298.599] reward. If you're going to deprive those
[2301.839] who decide to go not just the extra
[2304.56] mile, the extra 10, the extra hundred
[2306.32] miles to create something, to take those
[2309.839] risks, to to create something that
[2313.52] benefits all of their fellow humans, but
[2317.119] they're now deprived of any reward for
[2319.76] their
[2320.76] efforts. Who's going to
[2323.079] bother? And now what do you get as a
[2326.0] result? Stagnation.
[2328.32] But stagnation is not a sustainable
[2331.24] system. It's a system that is ultimately
[2335.28] going to fail, right? Because just like
[2339.28] in a free market, how do you survive if
[2341.599] you have a business in a free market
[2343.119] with all the vagaries and
[2346.2] unpredictabilities and so forth, you've
[2348.88] got to be diver by divers. You have to
[2352.079] diversify. You have to be adaptable. You
[2354.8] have to be resilient. Right? Well, if
[2357.359] you're stagnating under a a a
[2361.24] totalitarian type system, a a Marxist
[2364.8] type system, you you don't have that
[2367.4] anymore. You don't have that. You're
[2369.92] turning over your entire fate to the
[2372.56] control of a bureaucracy. And that will
[2375.52] not work. It maybe is sustainable for a
[2377.839] generation or two. Beyond that, forget
[2380.24] it. It's going to collapse. And if it
[2383.119] doesn't collapse because of its own
[2384.8] intrinsic or internal uh systems, it's
[2388.32] going to uh collapse because it's
[2390.32] affected from the outside and it is not
[2393.359] adaptable. Changing circumstances
[2395.839] outside the system impose altered
[2398.44] conditions because of the topheavy
[2401.2] bureaucratic nature of the system. Uh it
[2404.72] can't adapt. It has no resilience and
[2407.16] therefore it is not sustainable in a
[2409.92] changing naturally changing an
[2411.8] environment. So in my mind all of this
[2414.88] leads us that we should be moving up and
[2418.4] out. So if people am I to the right or
[2421.76] to the left? Well neither one really
[2424.079] because I'm to the up. You know I'm
[2426.8] looking not to the left or to the right.
[2429.2] I'm looking up. And I think once we move
[2432.599] out and we undertake this incredibly
[2436.24] bold
[2437.48] adventure, all these petty things that
[2439.839] are dividing us right now will
[2442.48] eventually fade into historical
[2444.56] irrelevance.
[2447.359] And you're absolutely correct. There is
[2449.119] a danger right now of stagnation. And
[2452.16] that's something that you and I have
[2453.44] both talked about off camera that the
[2456.72] the stagnation of the space program,
[2458.8] especially, you know, programs like
[2460.4] Dart, you know, the double uh asteroid
[2463.079] redirect program that that is something
[2466.319] that, you know, for for those of you who
[2468.24] who are having a hard time imagining,
[2470.079] I'm going to try to find an animation to
[2472.16] put up here, but we're basically talking
[2474.56] about slingshotting, you know, something
[2477.04] to correct the course of an incoming
[2479.76] bully or comet.
[2482.4] We've been within a nat's hair a few
[2484.8] times in in the last 20 years of these
[2488.079] impacts and and in the meantime we're
[2490.72] we're focused
[2492.119] on just the silliest political
[2495.119] idiosyncrasies when we could be pulling
[2496.88] together and saving lives. Again, if you
[2499.76] haven't been following Randall's uh you
[2502.0] know, work for a long period of time,
[2503.72] Tangusa leveled what was it? Uh 500,000
[2509.04] uh uh square acres of forest. Could have
[2512.0] been, let's say, it was about 800. It
[2514.319] was over 800 square miles. So 800 square
[2517.76] miles times 640 acres.
[2521.44] Yeah, that's that's over well over half
[2523.68] a million acres. So, uh utterly
[2526.359] obliterated. Flatten flattened.
[2528.8] and and they they they took pictures and
[2531.44] I'm going to put these up here. We're
[2533.599] talking about something that happened in
[2535.359] 1908. It was recent memory. Thankfully,
[2538.64] I think one or two people died from the
[2541.359] aftermath, but no one from the impact.
[2544.16] Directly, correct? Directly. Uh it was a
[2546.4] small number passed away due to I mean,
[2549.28] we're talking fireball just nuked a
[2553.44] bunch of the Siberian uh landscape. So
[2556.319] it's something that is real and having
[2558.8] having this this
[2561.079] lunar exploration that not only is self
[2565.119] sustainable hopefully eventually to some
[2567.44] extent but also is prepared to defend
[2570.72] the planet from incoming
[2573.28] uh Tangusized events which are very
[2576.8] common. I mean they're they're
[2579.52] again more of Randall's work if you're
[2581.599] new to this. This is what Randall does
[2583.839] and what he talks about. You look at a
[2586.319] lot of the the
[2587.8] famines that we've had in in our recent
[2591.44] memory in the last millennia are very
[2593.76] possibly from
[2596.079] cosmic dust or cosmic impacts and the
[2598.64] dust and the nuclear winter that came
[2600.0] out from that. So it it is something
[2602.0] that we should be looking at and not
[2603.52] stagnating on. We've got the materials.
[2606.4] Mhm. We should and we've got the tools
[2608.56] at hand. We've got the tools at hand.
[2610.56] We've got the materials. We have the
[2612.079] techn technological knowhow. We have the
[2614.319] industrial base. What seems to be
[2616.24] missing? The will. The mot. We've got
[2619.04] the motive. We need the will. We need
[2621.44] the will. People need to say, look, life
[2624.88] is either going to go forward or it's
[2627.359] going to go backwards. Stagnation is
[2629.599] only a temporary condition uh that
[2633.2] ultimately precedes going backwards. I
[2635.92] for one don't want to see civilization.
[2638.0] I don't want us to go back to the stone
[2639.839] age. I don't want that to happen and it
[2642.96] doesn't need to happen. When you
[2644.56] mentioned a dart mission, you know, one
[2646.079] of the things is right now at this stage
[2648.24] we realize we've got within our
[2651.0] capabilities now with a little bit of
[2653.52] further development and and research,
[2657.119] we're going to be able to divert
[2658.48] asteroids. And and one of the things, of
[2661.119] course, the first and priority is yes,
[2663.359] we need to know how to divert an
[2664.64] asteroid that's otherwise going to
[2666.319] strike the Earth. But the same
[2668.24] technology that will allow us to
[2669.839] basically just bump the asteroid into a
[2672.8] different orbit will with a little bit
[2674.8] of higher level of technological
[2676.319] development. we will be able to actually
[2678.56] now move asteroids and park them where
[2681.839] it will be economically convenient to
[2684.0] then begin harvesting them uh and and
[2687.2] and then uh utilizing those resources
[2691.28] both potentially for the earth but even
[2693.44] more so for the uh establishing the
[2696.96] cornerstone of a cosmic
[2699.8] civilization. Uh so that's just that
[2702.72] would be followed the next phase of a of
[2705.52] an enhanced dart mission uh
[2709.48] capability. So should we look at a
[2712.16] graphic there's uh absolutely so this is
[2715.68] a a a a
[2718.119] NASA graphic here
[2722.119] um we will provide in the in the uh
[2725.2] notes we can provide a link so people
[2727.04] can go to this themselves. Uh this is
[2729.599] worth looking at because um here if we
[2733.44] go back to here here's the uh here's the
[2736.88] uh first mission that has already been
[2739.319] accomplished. So this is the first human
[2742.16] spacecraft to the moon in the 21st
[2744.76] century. Then Artemis 2 will be the
[2747.76] first humans to orbit the moon. Right?
[2751.119] And then Artemis 3 or there will be an
[2754.839] Artemis support mission. uh the first
[2758.72] high- power solar electric propulsion
[2761.72] system then another Artemis support
[2764.319] mission the first pressurized module
[2767.52] delivered to
[2769.0] Gateway I will mention though that gate
[2772.0] that Trump
[2774.28] uh has decided or he's suggested that
[2778.079] the gateway be
[2781.24] uh emitted from the 2026 budget. So, I
[2785.92] don't want to see that happen. I want I
[2789.359] Donald, in case you're listening, dude,
[2791.119] we need you on board with this. Okay, if
[2793.92] you want to have a legacy, let's move
[2796.64] this uh cosmic civilization program
[2799.44] forward. Okay, under your watch. Come
[2802.52] on. Get your space force up there. Want
[2805.839] the gateway?
[2808.079] Yes. It sounds so weird saying Space
[2811.2] Force. I know. I know. you know, we met
[2814.64] uh the young gentleman uh on the tour
[2817.52] who's going into Space Force. Um I'm
[2820.16] very interested in that. And he was
[2823.44] before I knew he was going into Space
[2825.119] Force in my discussions with him, I
[2827.52] concluded that he was probably one of
[2829.839] the had the one of the highest IQs of
[2832.16] the entire group. And he immediat I mean
[2834.88] he knew I started mentioning things he
[2837.04] knew everything I was talking about. He
[2839.359] was right with it. So I was quite
[2842.319] impressed with his intelligence. Then he
[2844.079] tells me, "Yeah, I'm when I leave the
[2846.4] tour here, I'm going to be going into uh
[2848.8] becoming a member of Space Force."
[2851.76] So, I'm even thinking maybe at some
[2853.52] point we should
[2854.92] uh help Space Force recruit, offer our
[2858.64] services and our audience to
[2861.92] uh you know, whatever we can do to move
[2864.64] this program forward, which in my mind,
[2868.48] hey, you want to make America great
[2870.24] again? All right. Why don't we Americans
[2873.28] lead the human species into the cosmic
[2876.0] frontier and build the the great
[2879.599] civilization that that prospectively
[2882.319] lies in our future. All right. So
[2885.92] anyhow, back to our graphic here. Then
[2888.64] another Artemis support mission which is
[2891.119] the human landing system delivered to
[2894.76] gateway. Uh and then finally Artemis 3
[2898.319] will be the crude mission to gateway. uh
[2901.52] and the lunar surface. And for those who
[2903.599] are not seeing the visual the video, I
[2906.319] when I say crude, I mean
[2911.96] cr. Okay, just to be clear on that. Um
[2916.96] down here, oh look at here, the lunar
[2918.88] commercial lunar payload services. This
[2921.04] is interesting. We should maybe talk
[2922.64] about this because this is uh
[2925.72] significant of the important role that
[2928.64] the private sector has. This is not
[2931.359] coming down all on government by any
[2933.2] means. In fact, government may end up
[2936.0] being one of the one of the lesser
[2938.16] players in this because so much of this
[2940.64] is coming from the private sector. Um
[2944.64] let's see the largecale cargo. Let's
[2947.04] zoom in on that a little bit. large
[2948.64] scale cargo lander, increased
[2951.28] capabilities for science and technology
[2954.68] payloads. And then we've got uh ah there
[2958.96] we go. Humans on the moon 21st century.
[2961.92] The first crew leverages infrastructure
[2964.64] left behind by previous missions. Well,
[2967.52] there we go. And then, oh, this this is
[2970.24] important. The early South Pole
[2972.44] missions, first robotic landing on
[2975.8] eventual human lunar return and NC2
[2979.599] resource utilization site, first ground
[2982.88] truth of polar crater volatiles. Yeah,
[2987.359] looking forward to that. But first
[2989.92] robotic landing. And so this is the
[2992.48] thing. We didn't have this kind of
[2994.319] capability back in the early 70s that
[2996.48] we've got now. robotics is light years
[2999.44] ahead of where it was 40 years ago, 50
[3002.48] years ago. So
[3004.359] um which makes this all the more
[3006.559] feasible now. Um and several things that
[3009.839] have happened historically since then
[3011.52] you know the collap for one thing you
[3013.839] know the initial Mercury Gemini Apollo
[3016.72] programs were uh instigated through the
[3020.96] uh geopolitical competition between the
[3023.76] United States and the Soviet
[3025.64] Union. Right. So all even though uh dant
[3030.96] still sort of prevailed after the 70s
[3034.4] nonetheless there were heightened
[3035.68] tensions in the 80s uh that sometime
[3038.16] might be interesting to talk about but
[3040.0] ultimately those uh heightened tensions
[3042.64] preceded the collapse of the Soviet
[3044.559] Union and the assumed uh you know
[3048.839] competition militarily and
[3051.04] geopolitically between the United States
[3053.52] and the Soviet Union uh got demoted. in
[3057.359] uh terms of priorities. Uh at the same
[3060.28] time, the contribution of that
[3063.359] competition to invigorating the space
[3066.319] program also
[3067.96] disappeared. So there was not that
[3070.16] motive anymore. Of course, what is
[3072.319] happening is that we're beginning to
[3074.72] realize in the 80s and the '9s and
[3077.28] accelerating through the 2000s is just
[3080.0] what we were talking about, the the
[3082.2] realization of our own cosmic
[3084.839] vulnerability. And that, you know, maybe
[3087.359] we're not talking about an event that
[3090.0] could wipe out civilization in the next
[3091.839] 5 or 10 years. Doesn't matter if it's
[3095.119] the next 50 or 100 or 200 years. The
[3097.76] problem is we don't know at this point.
[3100.559] So we have to assume worst case going
[3104.24] forward. I think that oh it could happen
[3106.48] sooner rather than later. We hope it's
[3109.76] later to give us plenty of time to to
[3112.24] create and build and implement the
[3114.359] infrastructure but at the same time we
[3116.88] don't know. So in my mind there's no
[3119.52] time to waste. It just, you know, again,
[3121.92] maybe the analogy is, you know, you're a
[3123.76] community living on the uh coastline of
[3126.88] Florida and you go, well, we haven't
[3128.72] seen a hurricane come through here in 50
[3130.76] years, so therefore, we can just take it
[3134.16] easy. We don't need to try to implement
[3136.8] uh, you know, measures for rapid
[3139.68] evacuation or to secure our
[3142.4] infrastructure. We don't need to do any
[3144.0] of that because it's been 50 years. What
[3146.079] kind of psychology would that be? would
[3147.68] be there anybody who would say no that's
[3149.76] not a sane or prudent approach. No, you
[3152.72] don't know. Maybe it'll be another 50
[3154.16] years. Maybe it'll be a hundred years,
[3155.52] but it could be next year. You don't
[3157.76] know. So, you can't just sit there on
[3160.48] your fat dubs and think everything's
[3163.119] going to be okay. You need to get your
[3164.8] ass in gear and do what you need to do
[3167.599] to to enhance and optimize the
[3170.0] survivability of your community. Well,
[3172.48] we are a global emerging global
[3174.4] community and that is what we need to
[3176.4] do. And we can't assume that we've got
[3179.119] millennia or centuries. We have to
[3181.76] assume that it could happen at any time.
[3185.44] This is what this is what the the one
[3187.68] last summer. What was it again? Um uh Y
[3191.28] R4 2024. Y R4 2024. I mean that is not
[3197.04] going to wipe out
[3198.76] civilization. However, it's going to be
[3201.599] a would be a major setback. I mean, in
[3204.24] terms of the global economy, it could be
[3206.559] a decade or two recovering from
[3208.24] something like that when you consider
[3210.319] that New Orleans has never fully
[3212.48] recovered from Katrina, right? Correct.
[3214.64] Neither is Houston where we took all the
[3217.2] refugees in. Yeah. Right. It it changes
[3220.8] everything. And it definitely changes it
[3223.92] for the lives of the, you know, the
[3226.52] 80,000, 2 million, 5 million, wherever
[3229.28] it hits that are wiped out in an instant
[3231.76] if it hits a population center. Yeah.
[3234.8] And what we're looking at with the June
[3237.48] 2024 could be a thousand times worse
[3241.359] than Katrina. Yeah. Literally, that's
[3243.76] not an exaggeration. Easily a hundred
[3246.079] times worse. But even try to imagine a
[3247.92] hundred times worse. H how long would it
[3250.72] take her to to to fully recover? It
[3252.64] would take decades. Mhm. Right. Um so
[3256.319] this is real. This isn't not science
[3258.559] fiction, folks. This is real. And it
[3261.119] needs to be incorporated into our
[3264.16] largescale planning, our long-term
[3266.24] planning. It needs to become an integral
[3268.24] part of our psychology as the dominant
[3270.24] species on this planet. Because right
[3272.8] now, I mean, what do we now know when we
[3274.72] look at the the the record of life on
[3278.079] Earth? N this is not an exaggeration to
[3281.76] say that
[3284.04] 99.99% of all species estimated to have
[3287.599] ever
[3288.599] existed throughout the span of life on
[3291.68] Earth which we call the
[3293.96] Phantooic that
[3295.8] 99.99% of those species have have gone
[3299.559] extinct. Now in the old obsolete
[3303.119] Darwinian models and I'm not rejecting
[3306.24] evolution here, okay? They don't I don't
[3307.839] want somebody coming and saying that I'm
[3309.599] rejecting that. Um but in the old
[3313.599] Darwinian
[3314.839] models you have this incremental almost
[3319.72] indicable mutation of species over a
[3322.64] long continuum and it's the end points
[3324.559] of those continuum of that continuum
[3326.88] that represent distinct species. Right?
[3330.119] Well the pro problem with the
[3332.72] evolutionary record is the missing
[3334.88] transitional species.
[3337.92] Well, the model has changed since I was
[3340.96] growing up and educated in this. the
[3342.8] model has changed is that now see in the
[3345.359] old model species and this is kind of
[3348.0] somewhat arbitrary but I've seen this
[3349.52] this percentage used in the old model at
[3352.24] any given time 10% of the species are
[3355.839] undergoing a slow extinction process and
[3359.28] 10% of new species are now uh being
[3363.52] introduced into the into the biosphere.
[3366.24] Right? So basically what you've got is
[3368.96] this
[3369.88] incremental almost incarnable process
[3373.68] going on. At any given time x number of
[3376.319] species are going extinct and they're
[3378.64] being replaced by x number of species
[3380.88] being replenished by it. Well, what's
[3383.2] what's changed since the uh say the
[3387.04] 1980s is that we now know boom mass
[3390.4] extinctions occur repeatedly and the the
[3393.92] majority of extinct species on Earth did
[3397.2] not go extinct slowly incrementally. A
[3400.48] few species every you know 100,000 every
[3403.68] million years but boom wholesale mass
[3407.799] extinctions. This is followed by
[3411.079] a hiatus, a period where you can look at
[3414.24] the fossil record and boom, abundant
[3416.559] species and then
[3418.599] suddenly 80% of them are gone, 3/4 of
[3421.52] them are gone, 90% of them are gone. And
[3424.24] then you have this hiatus, this time
[3426.079] span, and then boom, you have this what
[3429.28] are called rapid speciation events,
[3432.16] which to me is almost miraculous.
[3434.44] Suddenly all these new species
[3437.64] proliferate right now you have a whole
[3441.04] new
[3441.96] order a whole new system planetary
[3445.04] system in place.
[3447.599] What if that model serves uh for for
[3451.52] human
[3452.52] civilizations? And see, we knew we
[3456.0] became we begin to accept the fact that
[3458.4] in the 80s and and into the '9s, yeah,
[3461.52] that that cosmic impacts have profoundly
[3464.079] affected life on Earth. Well, now we're
[3467.359] kind of in the follow-up mode where
[3468.96] we're realizing the the unappreciated or
[3472.68] underappreciated role that impacts have
[3475.28] played in the rise and fall of
[3479.559] civilizations. So, anyhow, that is kind
[3483.119] of a uh a digression there, but I think
[3486.4] no, but it's it's the logical conclusion
[3488.92] of getting a dart system up on the moon
[3493.2] is a great idea. And it's long long and
[3498.4] coming. Yes. And so the HLS, the gateway
[3502.559] platform, please, President Donald
[3504.96] Trump, please put that back on the
[3507.64] budget. It It's been put off so many
[3510.24] times.
[3511.839] Yeah. Yep. Yeah. That's exactly right.
[3514.559] It has been put off to the point where
[3516.799] uh some of us some of us have lost hope
[3519.92] at times. So hopefully it comes back.
[3524.24] Well, you know, I tell you what could
[3526.2] trigger an a virtually instantaneous
[3529.28] change of mind would be a repeat of June
[3532.48] 30th, 1908. Yeah, I I hope that doesn't
[3536.64] happen. If it did, it would get people
[3539.52] thinking. It sure would. It sure would.
[3543.079] Um, so did you know there's an Artemis 4
[3546.16] that's planned?
[3548.4] U 2030 or 2028? I'm trying to remember
[3552.0] the date. 2028, but 28 knowing the way
[3554.799] things go with government I you know
[3557.04] good luck on 2028 correct um but it is
[3560.319] intended to be the second landing with
[3564.0] with crews aboard um and it will have a
[3568.559] Starship
[3570.599] HLS Starship human landing system
[3573.44] upgraded uh that's in development right
[3575.52] now. Um, and so it'll be an Orion
[3581.52] uh spaceship with an upgraded Starship
[3584.559] human landing system and it will dock
[3588.0] with the lunar
[3589.64] gateway. Come on. This is all part of
[3592.079] the plan. We got to have it. The gateway
[3595.599] only makes perfect sense because it is
[3598.88] so much more efficient and economical to
[3601.599] go and dock with a gateway than it is to
[3604.72] go direct to the lunar surface as far as
[3607.359] I can tell. Um, so the the only
[3610.799] detractor from that is Buzz Aldrin and
[3613.599] he and and he he kind of has that
[3616.24] opinion, but I I don't know. There's a
[3618.079] lot of really intelligent people who
[3619.68] disagree with him because his thought is
[3622.079] is that then again I I I think he's
[3624.799] biased because this is exactly how he
[3626.96] did it is you carry your landing module
[3629.52] with you every time. But it seems to me
[3632.16] that you're right that having having a a
[3635.76] near rectal linear orbit station, the
[3639.079] gateway kind of doing this this little
[3641.44] hula hoop through through the air with
[3643.76] minimal station keeping fuel hopefully
[3645.599] provided by mining the regulith on the
[3649.16] moon that could potentially reduce the
[3653.52] amount of mass that's sent up every
[3656.079] single time and the amount of
[3658.96] complications cuz you throw away each of
[3661.2] these modules. If you had a module that
[3663.68] was purposebuilt for in lunar atmosphere
[3667.76] up and down to the hls platform to the g
[3670.64] the rather excuse me the hls platform
[3673.28] being built for the gateway down to the
[3675.359] lunar surface to me that seems like that
[3678.319] makes a lot of sense to me as well. It
[3682.64] just seems to me that it does make
[3684.319] sense.
[3686.2] Uh but again uh I would like to hear
[3689.359] what he has to say. I haven't I haven't
[3691.44] heard his objections. So and you know
[3694.64] certainly I would uh respect his
[3697.0] expertise. I mean more so than my own up
[3701.68] to a point. Uh but I would also listen
[3704.64] to other voices that correct favor the
[3707.92] lunar gateway before I made up my mind.
[3711.2] my own, it seems that my own instincts,
[3713.28] my own common sense and what I seem to
[3715.2] know about, you know, supply chains and
[3718.88] and how systems function, it would would
[3721.28] only make sense to have a rendevous
[3724.559] because literally, I mean, fuel costs
[3726.799] have got to be substantially lower
[3730.2] docking with a with the lunar gateway in
[3733.68] orbit around the moon than, you know,
[3736.24] going down to the lunar surface itself.
[3738.799] Now, of course, obviously, if we're
[3740.799] building a lunar base on the moon, yeah,
[3743.04] we've got to have that functionality.
[3746.4] We've got to be able to, you know, and
[3748.4] of course, the moon is much much more
[3751.68] economically efficient in terms of
[3753.52] energy consumption to to uh you know to
[3757.28] to for landers to land on the moon and
[3760.48] launch from the moon than it would be
[3762.48] say on earth. And that is why the l the
[3766.319] moon is you know essentially uh what was
[3770.4] it craft eriki said that uh if god had
[3774.16] not intended man to uh become cosmic he
[3777.599] wouldn't have given us the moon uh
[3780.079] paraphrasing it of course but that was
[3781.839] the idea so then oh sorry go ahead no
[3786.48] okay well I was going to say that then
[3787.839] then there's also an artmus 5 mission
[3789.839] planned for 2030 and uh it would be the
[3794.119] third landing of of a crude mission.
[3799.64] Um it's
[3801.72] uh it's um projected to deliver four
[3805.68] astronauts to the lunar gateway station
[3809.76] and it will deliver the European space
[3813.119] ay's espit refueling and communications
[3817.839] module.
[3819.599] Ah, so a refueling and comm using the
[3822.4] the lunar gateway multi-functional
[3824.92] refueling communications
[3827.76] and the Canada arm 3 which is a
[3831.96] Canadianbuilt robotic arm system uh for
[3835.76] the gateway. I'm I'm not sure what
[3838.559] actual uh functions that would be
[3841.039] engaged in, but I'm sure we could
[3843.52] research that and find out. I'm sure
[3845.359] it's going to be very similar to what
[3846.48] they built for the shuttle. So, here's
[3849.52] here's Aldren's Aldron's point, and I
[3852.4] think that you just made the best point
[3855.119] on the board against what uh against
[3858.559] Aldron's paradigm, but here's his
[3860.48] paradigm. The SLS cannot get Orion into
[3864.799] lunar orbit uh with any particular
[3868.839] maneuver capability. And that's why we
[3871.359] need to go into orbit. And that's not
[3872.72] quite close enough. And now we have to
[3874.96] build a big spacecraft. It takes three
[3877.92] spacecraft to make a landing is what is
[3880.88] what Aldron is saying. All of that to
[3883.2] say, if I understand his his point
[3885.839] articulately is that we're putting a lot
[3887.839] of resources out there, whereas a
[3889.76] purpose-built to and from much more
[3891.76] similar to Apollo would be simple, but
[3894.4] the purpose is not to just get to the
[3898.559] moon. Correct. It's to establish a base
[3902.079] on the moon to be able to have refueling
[3905.44] uh capabilities, hopefully mine from the
[3907.599] regalith, and to be able to have a dart
[3910.16] mission uh uh uh available ready to go
[3914.24] on the lunar surface. It's not just to
[3916.72] go to the moon. We want to colonize,
[3920.4] right? And in a future episode, you and
[3923.039] I talked about this. I don't think I'm
[3924.24] speaking out of turn. We'll have to talk
[3925.68] a little bit about some of the some of
[3928.0] the planned structures. Probably not
[3930.96] today cuz we're we're coming up on time,
[3933.599] but we'll have to talk about the planned
[3935.2] structures and how sacred geometry kind
[3937.44] of relates to some of that. And uh well,
[3941.119] it does kind of. And interestingly some
[3943.52] studies have come out in the last year
[3944.96] or two looking at the optimum geometric
[3947.52] forms for uh for free free form for
[3952.16] orbital themselves not necessarily on
[3954.88] the surface although that too but uh in
[3959.68] free space either orbiting well it would
[3962.559] have to orbit something but maybe
[3964.319] initially it would be orbiting the moon
[3966.4] but there are some relatively
[3968.079] interesting geometries that have are are
[3970.88] have emerged emerged through as optimum
[3973.76] for enclosing space and being able to um
[3979.28] uh being able to extend that geometry uh
[3983.2] what would be the word uh to uh uh like
[3986.48] a
[3987.48] modularization modularization that
[3990.0] wasn't the word I had in mind but I
[3991.92] think that that covers the meaning yes
[3995.799] um it'll come to me in a second but yeah
[3998.559] the idea is that you can uh
[4001.76] You can uh connect, you can grow, you
[4004.799] can use the initial geometry and by
[4007.28] integrating components you can
[4010.16] modularize it. Uh-huh. So let's see the
[4013.76] final thing the lunar terrain vehicle uh
[4016.96] which is NASA that would be part of
[4018.88] Artemis 5 and it's a rover uh which is
[4023.119] under current development that
[4024.96] astronauts can drive on the moon while
[4027.76] wearing their space suits.
[4030.119] So,
[4031.88] uh, let's see. The LTV, I like this
[4034.96] because they always have acronyms. The
[4036.559] LTV, which is the lunar terrain vehicle.
[4040.68] Uh, so it re involves returning
[4044.0] astronauts to the moon, which is the
[4045.92] Aremis program, specifically the lunar
[4048.96] south pole. Uh, however, the LTV will
[4053.68] not fly until Artemis 5 in 2030 at the
[4057.839] earliest. Hey, don't give me that crap
[4060.48] at the earliest. Look, I may only have
[4063.2] another half century here on this
[4064.88] planet. So, I want to see this happen
[4067.359] sooner rather than later. So, let's use
[4070.48] this platform to try to, you know,
[4072.319] invigorate some interest in this. Get
[4075.039] some of the younger generation excited
[4077.68] uh that there's a bigger world out
[4079.359] there. There's a bigger adventure
[4080.88] awaiting us. Let's get to it. Right. Um
[4087.2] Amen. Yes, sir. Yeah. So, let's see
[4091.119] who's making that. So, Loheed Martin and
[4093.2] General Motors. Now, in my mind, I would
[4096.319] rather have Loheed Martin building lunar
[4098.96] terrain vehicles than, you know, nuclear
[4101.92] capable delivery systems to be used in
[4104.239] war.
[4107.44] And here's the thing. Look, all of the
[4109.92] the the the military-industrial complex
[4113.199] has created an an industrial
[4116.199] infrastructure has created a technology
[4119.279] that would not be that difficult to
[4123.04] readapt to to uh just as think about how
[4127.319] quickly we were able to convert our
[4132.08] private peaceime industrial capabilities
[4136.56] at the onset of World War to literally
[4139.12] within a year it was converted from
[4141.44] peace time to to to militarization.
[4144.319] We're turning out tanks. We're turning
[4145.92] out bombers. We're turning out this inc
[4148.48] this incredible amount of equipment.
[4151.44] Well, it could go the other way.
[4154.239] all of the the companies that are now
[4156.08] engaged in uh part of the
[4158.359] military-industrial complex. Hey, you
[4160.719] guys actually I think in the long run
[4162.239] will make more money, more profit by
[4166.0] shifting over to peaceime
[4169.12] uh development and exploration,
[4171.44] colonization of space because again the
[4173.679] idea that I want to keep hammering is
[4175.279] that this is such a massive such a vast
[4178.48] undertaking. Um, you know, I think I've
[4181.52] I've I've used this analogy before, but
[4183.839] you know, during um some of the great
[4185.96] epic uh engineering feats of the early
[4189.279] 20th century, and I'm thinking
[4191.12] specifically about the Bureau of
[4193.6] Reclamation building, Hoover Dam and
[4196.4] Grand Kulie Dam. Grand Koulie Dam at the
[4199.28] time was probably the most epic uh
[4201.719] engineering undertaking in in human
[4204.64] history, aside from something like the
[4206.56] pyramids or whatever. I mean, it was on
[4208.88] a an enormous scale. Well, when the
[4212.48] Roosevelt administration was letting out
[4214.64] the contracts for bids on building the
[4218.4] Grand Coulie Dam,
[4220.679] uh there was no single company capable
[4223.92] of undertaking a project of that
[4226.64] magnitude. So what happened is you had
[4229.28] three previous competitor
[4231.64] companies forming a joint venture and
[4235.52] only through that cooperative effort
[4237.44] each company bringing its own unique and
[4240.0] ex uh skills and experiences to the
[4242.8] project were they able to pull it off in
[4245.199] record time. there's there I think
[4246.96] there's an important and uh metaphor
[4248.96] there for maybe an approach or uh to you
[4252.8] know moving forward with um the
[4255.12] industrialization of the cosmos and uh
[4259.199] that may be an interesting thing to to
[4261.28] do a uh a podcast on. And you know what
[4264.239] else, John? We'll just mention this
[4266.48] because on our tour, we visited the
[4268.8] remains, the remnants of of uh Teton
[4271.76] Dam, which was one of the great probably
[4274.4] the greatest recent disam dam disaster
[4278.0] in American history. We need to do a
[4281.6] podcast because there's a so many
[4283.36] important lessons to be derived from
[4286.0] what happened there. And so, uh, this
[4289.28] should be an upcoming, uh, episode that
[4292.0] we record sometime in the near future
[4294.56] while our memories of of that place and
[4297.52] that event are still fresh. And you, I
[4300.32] know you've got some awesome footage
[4302.56] that I haven't seen yet that I just
[4305.36] can't wait to see. Some of the drone
[4308.159] stuff and Oh, man. Yeah. some of the
[4310.239] stuff you've gotten. I know it's going
[4311.84] to be
[4312.76] incredible. So, that I think would could
[4315.04] be a really a good episode.
[4317.52] uh for multiple
[4319.0] reasons. Uh so there's a lot more. I
[4322.239] mean, we need to continue this
[4323.679] conversation because it's so important
[4325.199] and there's a lot more to talk about,
[4327.52] but we have been going for a a while
[4329.84] now. We're what uh an hour and a half
[4332.08] in. So maybe we should
[4334.92] uh recuse ourselves for the moment. Plan
[4338.88] on following up very soon, like within
[4342.08] the maybe even the next episode of
[4344.4] Squaring the Circle. we could continue
[4346.0] this conversation. I've got I've got
[4348.8] more compelling, interesting, juicy
[4351.44] stuff to get into to talk about. Um, I
[4354.8] would like to thank everybody who's been
[4356.32] listening in and and uh engaging in this
[4359.04] learning process with us and staying up
[4361.679] to speed on what is actually developing
[4364.48] on a frontier of our own future that I
[4367.6] think is just incredibly important, but
[4370.0] also just so interesting. So, I think
[4372.32] we'll bid everyone ado for this episode
[4374.48] of Squaring the Circle. Thanks for
[4376.159] joining me, John. And as always, I have
[4379.28] thoroughly enjoyed this conversation.
[4381.6] Um, and we will continue this
[4384.159] conversation uh very soon.
[4388.719] See you then. All right. So long, John.
[4391.28] So long, everybody, wherever you happen
[4393.28] to be around the world listening in or
[4395.52] watching.

Title: Freemasonry, Floods, and the Acacia
[0.0] Here's an example of a Masonic apron.
[2.399] What do you see right at the very center
[4.56] of this symbolical array? What is that?
[7.359] I think it's a barn. It's the ark. It's
[9.599] a Masonic symbol for rebirth,
[11.84] regeneration, rejuvenation. So, the idea
[14.719] here is that in that ark is preserved
[17.68] all of the seeds, the biological
[19.76] diversity of the world that is now being
[21.92] erased from the planet by the waters of
[23.76] the flood. The acacia, is it related to
[26.0] the acacia tree or the acacia bush? Is
[28.16] it the same sort of thing? And you know
[30.0] that's the same bush that they believe
[31.679] is responsible for Moses having the
[33.84] visions of God giving him the Ten
[37.28] Commandments because the Acacia bush is
[39.52] rich in dimethylryptamine. Do you think
[41.6] it's any coincidence that the Freemasons
[43.92] have venerated the Acacia for hundreds
[46.239] of years? Makes a lot of sense. makes a
[48.16] lot of sense, doesn't

Title: Alaska’s Riverbed Tells a Bigger Story
[0.08] This is the muddy river in Alaska above
[1.92] its junction with the McKinley River.
[3.76] Note the small size of the modern riflow
[6.72] compared to the massive sediment load.
[8.48] So basically what you had here was a
[10.0] gigantic meltwater flood that dumped
[12.0] huge amounts of sediment and then now
[13.84] the modern river is just you know
[15.4] meandering casually back and forth over
[18.16] this. The old assumption is that all of
[20.32] this sediment would have been deposited
[22.4] slowly over long periods of time and it
[24.96] was probably one or a few major
[27.519] depositional events that left that
[29.439] behind and undoubtedly I think it would
[31.599] have been melt bomb.

Title: Debris Flows, Not Stream Sediment
[0.24] Aluvial fans of the White Mountains and
[2.639] by analogy those of other great basin
[5.839] ranges appear not to have been built by
[8.8] the ordinary processes of stream
[11.16] deposition. Instead, spectacular
[14.559] episodes of debris flow deposition have
[16.96] been irregularly interspersed with
[20.0] periods of quiescence. During intervals
[22.4] between major rubble flows,
[24.32] morphological changes on the fans have
[26.32] been minor. Back in 1963, this author
[28.8] Charles Bey is constructing a model in
[31.039] his head of where you've got the normal,
[33.6] you know, observed rate of change and
[35.52] not much is happening. Yet then that is
[38.079] interrupted by these what he's calling
[40.52] spectacular episodes of debris flow
[43.12] deposition. Well, how do you have a
[45.2] spectacular episode like that? You have
[46.8] to have here without you don't have the
[48.96] great ice sheets. Now you got some
[50.399] mountain glaciers, but I recently read
[52.64] that the contribution of mountain
[55.68] glaciers to the formation of of Lake
[57.92] Monavville was about 3.3%. So the vast
[61.6] volume most of that volume of water was
[64.4] rainfall.

Title: Erosion Bigger Than Lake Superior
[0.08] This is mega scale streamlined erosion
[2.56] mid-continental North America. And you
[5.44] can really begin to see that you're
[6.96] looking at an erosion here that's dwarfs
[10.559] Lake Superior. All of this is headed for
[12.559] the Gulf of Mexico. Here you can see
[14.24] what would have been streamlined islands
[16.8] within the flood flow. And if you look
[19.439] at these features here, just like what
[21.68] we were talking about in the scablands,
[24.56] the intermediate material has been
[28.0] removed. to see if this flow had
[30.519] continued these islands would have been
[33.68] arranged away.

Title: Something Big Is Coming…
[0.64] I'm hanging in there by my fingernails.
[5.2] Yeah. Literally off the edge of uh
[9.28] off the edge of some Bonavville flood
[12.24] area.
[13.84] Yeah. Well, that was all last week. We
[16.16] were exploring the Snake River Canyon
[18.64] and in Vyron uh accumulating more
[21.52] evidence for the Great Bonavville flood
[24.0] that occurred at the end of the last ice
[25.6] age. And some of the more recent dating
[28.48] suggests that it's coincides almost
[30.72] precisely with meltwater pulse 1A which
[33.76] I found
[34.84] interesting. The dating of that flood
[37.28] did does not really coincide with the
[39.52] younger dus lower younger dest
[42.04] boundary but it does coincide with the
[44.32] older dus and uh the shift from older
[47.92] dus cold into uh baling warmth which
[52.8] occurred around 14,600 14,500 years ago.
[57.52] So you know that so new discoveries were
[60.0] found on this trip. Uh yes and some new
[62.96] insights. Uh, I came away convinced that
[65.6] there were other sources of water
[67.28] contributing to the maximum discharge of
[70.64] the flood other than the overflow of
[73.119] Lake Bonavville,
[74.96] which was one of the things that I kind
[76.72] of suspected but didn't really have any
[79.759] concrete uh evidence. Whereas now, I
[84.08] think that I'm on to a possible source
[87.439] for an a augmentation of the flood peak.
[92.159] Well, that's perfect news because we're
[95.119] here
[96.119] today talking about something that might
[98.479] just be as big as the Younger Dry impact
[100.88] that happened. That's going to be
[103.2] happening. That's impossible. There
[104.56] couldn't be. Well, it's going to be
[105.92] happening in June and it's going to be
[107.84] happening from June 20th to 23rd and
[111.439] we're bringing a lot of people together
[114.079] at CosmicSummit. So, today we're going
[116.64] to be talking about CosmicSummit. We're
[118.479] going to have a bunch of speakers coming
[121.2] into this live stream talking about
[123.439] their presentations, what they're
[125.439] excited about. Randle's going to be
[127.2] asking them questions. They're going to
[128.399] be asking him questions and we're just
[130.879] bringing the gang together about a month
[133.0] before and we'll be running through
[136.16] exactly what's going to happen. So
[138.8] Randall, before we start to let any
[140.64] other speakers in, anything that you
[142.959] want to you want to kick us off with
[144.64] about Cosmic Summit or about what you'll
[146.56] be talking about there?
[148.959] Well, I'm still putting together my
[150.64] talk. I'm integrating some stuff from
[152.8] the last two expeditions slashtours that
[156.48] we did.
[157.8] Um, one of the things in uh earlier uh
[162.4] when we went on the uh Washington tour,
[165.76] when we did the uh Columbia Gorge, uh we
[169.76] visited a large gravel pit and
[173.48] I got some documentation suggesting that
[176.64] the Bonavville flood and the Missoula
[178.319] flood were concurrent. And that is
[183.04] perhaps significant because at this
[184.8] point there's cons not considered to be
[187.2] any real connection between the two
[189.599] events. Randall, we're getting a little
[191.84] bit of feedback from the chat that your
[194.08] mic is a little bit low. Can you turn
[195.92] that up? Yeah.
[199.2] And while you're doing that, I'm going
[200.319] to let the man himself, the promoter,
[203.599] the creator of the Cosmic Summit in, Mr.
[207.2] George Howard, aka the Cosmic Tusk.
[210.319] While Randle's getting his mic sorted.
[212.64] Yeah, man. Does this sound any better?
[215.2] Chat, how does how does Randle's mic
[217.12] sound? Give us some thumbs up if it
[219.28] sounds better.
[223.12] Let's
[226.04] see. Hey, Randall. Hello, George. How
[229.599] you doing, buddy? I'm doing fine. Can't
[232.319] wait to see you in a few days. Yeah,
[234.159] it's going to happen. It's It's looking
[236.64] good, man. I'm feeling really really
[239.439] good about the cosmic summit this year.
[240.879] I think we upped our game. I think
[243.28] you're right. Yeah. And we got lucky on
[245.84] some things with the Coffrey pyramid
[247.599] thing breaking in March. Just enough
[249.2] time to get the researchers here for the
[250.959] next big reveal.
[253.28] And about the same time, I finally
[255.599] answered emails from this great Spanish
[257.28] team that said they had a documentary
[259.12] and made quick, good, and fruitful
[261.84] friends with Michael Donnell and and and
[264.32] Geneo Films who are producing Atlantica
[266.32] and are going to premiere it Saturday
[267.68] night. So on the 21st, we're going to
[271.32] um figure out what's under the pyramids
[273.84] and we found
[275.32] Atlantis. Check and check. And then we
[277.84] got the vases coming. Triple check. and
[281.52] that none of those are speakers. You
[283.04] know what I mean? Speakers are great.
[284.24] God knows that's why we're getting
[285.28] together. But that's three things other
[286.96] than speakers. Two big reveals and a
[289.6] display of antiquity that is not
[292.32] normally expected in Greensboro, North
[294.32] Carolina. No, I mean Greensboro, North
[297.44] Carolina. Who would have thought? Who
[299.6] who would think, dare I say, the largest
[302.639] collection of ancient pre-dynastic
[305.44] Egyptian voses to be gathered together
[307.759] in one location since Aman
[310.28] Hotep was stashing them under Sakara.
[314.24] Okay. Greensboro, number two place now.
[317.28] Number two, George.
[320.0] Well, Sarasota. Sarasota. Yeah.
[322.56] Although, I need you to I need you to
[325.36] turn the mic down just a little bit,
[327.28] George. And then Randall, can you crank
[329.52] yours up just a little bit?
[332.4] Okay, let's see. On my input, I've got
[334.479] my microphone all the way up to 100%
[336.72] now. That sounds pretty good. That
[338.4] sounds pretty good. And y'all just chat
[340.32] just keep letting us know if it's it's
[342.0] off. Let me know if mine's too high or
[344.479] low. I like live streams nice and
[346.479] informal. Oh, yeah. So, you mentioned
[350.0] the Atlantica documentary and the
[352.96] gentleman Michael Donan who we have
[354.96] waiting backstage. So, we're going to
[356.72] let Michael come up here now. And as
[360.08] other speakers drip in, we'll let them
[362.08] up as well. But how's it going, Michael?
[366.96] Good day to you all. Hey, Randall. Hey,
[370.0] Michael. Hey, Becket. Doing well. Nice
[372.479] to be here. How are you all doing? We're
[375.12] doing good. We're doing good. What a
[377.759] pleasure. Pleasure to be here with you
[379.6] guys. Yeah, it's a pleasure to be here
[381.759] with you. and George
[384.0] teased your documentary a little bit and
[386.639] we've had it on the website. It's on the
[388.72] schedule as well, but I mean tell us
[391.52] tell us a little bit about it. Give us
[393.919] the brief snapshot of it. Get people
[396.24] excited about the premiere that's going
[398.319] to happen on Saturday at Cosmic Summit.
[401.52] Sure.
[403.199] So on Saturday at the Cosmic Summit,
[406.4] we're going to show a condensed version
[408.8] of the first three episodes of
[411.36] Atlantica, which is basically our
[413.759] documentary series, which has been
[415.68] following every step of our process for
[418.16] the last eight years. Um, and long story
[421.12] short, uh, I never I did study
[423.639] archaeology, uh, by total coincidence in
[426.56] university in Athens, never thinking I
[428.88] would be an archaeologist. And years
[431.84] after becoming a filmmaker, I I then by
[434.88] coincidence got reinvolved with
[436.8] archaeological groups and
[440.36] uh and what what uh what subject is more
[443.84] fun than discovering old things, you
[446.319] know? It's it's incredible. And so I
[449.12] started working with our team uh of uh
[452.639] of uh interesting characters. And uh it
[456.08] seemed like every month we were
[457.759] traveling to a new location. One month
[460.56] diving a Gallian site, another another
[463.759] month in Egypt in Hawara, another month
[466.88] uh recovering fragments from the era
[471.72] of King John, sort of 1200ish.
[476.479] And uh one day um our head of research
[479.919] Tim Acres said to me, "Do you like
[483.0] southern I've been researching something
[486.319] there for for quite a while and I really
[488.8] think we're on to something." And that's
[490.8] how this whole subject began for me. Um,
[494.639] and basically over the course of the
[496.8] last eight years, we've been finding an
[499.599] enormous quantity of structure both in
[502.72] land and in water scattered throughout
[505.28] the Andaluthian Spanish coastline. And
[508.0] these are brand new
[510.479] urban ruins that are that are
[513.68] geologically from a prehistoric era,
[517.2] making them coincide with the stories of
[521.36] Plato's texts on Atlantis. the
[524.68] Timosias in which he describes in great
[527.519] detail this
[529.72] mythical ancient civilization that
[533.279] predated the Greeks by 9,000 years and
[537.24] was destroyed by this cataclysmic event
[543.0] which effectively coincides with many of
[546.88] the cataclysmic events I think uh
[549.92] described thoroughly by Randall in in
[552.399] the younger drives period. Um and and so
[558.08] we started to find these I mean a real
[561.08] incredible amount of of material that we
[563.839] amassed over the course of eight years.
[565.519] But it wasn't until 2022,
[568.08] just a couple years
[569.8] ago, that we found a submerged city
[574.0] about five kilometers off the coast of
[577.48] Kadith, about 20 meters in depth, which
[580.64] is approximately 65 ft or so. And uh
[585.839] these waters are very complicated to
[587.44] dive. They're very, very murky. Uh and
[590.0] the currents are not your best friend.
[592.88] And it's also been part of the thing, I
[594.64] think, that kept these ruins from having
[596.959] been discovered earlier is the fact that
[599.68] they're so hard to to to see. Um, and
[604.04] that's majorly due to the mouth of the
[608.959] river Guadir, which like the river Nile,
[612.72] like the Yangze, like the Indus Valley
[615.839] is is um in and out for sediment. And so
[620.16] this entire
[621.56] region when viewed from above is
[625.079] is very um murky
[628.519] water. And uh we started to scan these
[632.399] structures and dive at these structures
[634.88] that were clearly man-made. At first we
[637.04] weren't sure. We went to rule out that
[639.68] they were possibly the outcome of
[643.04] geological activity since there we we
[646.399] lay on two fault lines here. where you
[648.959] lay on top of well there's the African
[651.36] geolog tectonic plate which pushes down
[654.079] on the European tectonic plate. So you
[656.88] do get these natural striations that can
[658.8] occur along this coastline and we ruled
[662.0] out
[663.0] that natural
[665.0] striations. Um and uh after about a
[669.36] hundred dives, we went back and scanned
[671.6] the entire site with a
[675.16] um multiaxis echo sounder, which is
[679.279] basically a machine that you dingle off
[681.36] the back of your boat and you have to
[683.44] troll up and down, up and down, and you
[686.079] start to see this topography image in 3D
[689.839] relief being formed on your
[692.6] screen. And what we saw after about
[695.6] seven hours of scanning this particular
[698.079] area blew my mind. It was it was
[700.24] completely
[701.56] unexpected. I did expect to see little
[704.32] rectangular ruins because I'd seen them
[706.88] in the water. I'd seen buildings toppled
[710.399] over. So I I had this expectation of
[712.959] seeing sort of these these
[715.8] u urban structures, but I didn't expect
[719.44] what we saw with these massive walls
[721.76] that are 7 and 1/2 mters tall by 2 m
[724.8] wide, which I thought perhaps would have
[727.279] been the walls of a of a larger building
[731.2] of some sort. And when when we saw the
[734.0] scan, the scan revealed that they
[736.6] were circular
[739.16] concentric
[740.839] walls. And so that's where we are now.
[743.68] And uh the subject is massive. I think
[746.88] that what we've started to discover
[750.519] are some of the clues left by Plato
[755.519] about this incredible place.
[758.68] Um but the subject is vast and uh
[762.56] earlier Randall we were all talking
[765.0] about different different proposed
[767.44] locations over the centuries for the
[769.279] location of Atlantis like the Azours
[771.92] like the Canary Islands like Sardinia
[773.92] like Santorini like Malta.
[778.36] But the one thing to keep in mind is all
[782.48] of those are essentially wonderful
[785.04] places with wonderful ancient mysteries
[787.92] and without any doubt connected to this
[791.04] story. What we were talking about, what
[793.519] we are finding here is
[796.12] specifically following Plato's exact
[799.12] details of where he positioned the
[801.68] capital.
[803.68] So there you have my long spiel. Well, I
[805.839] hope I didn't warn him.
[808.32] No. No. What do you think about that,
[810.079] Randall? And Michael, pull that mic a
[812.079] little bit closer to your mouth as well.
[815.76] Well, um, how's it? Is that better? So,
[817.839] clearly if there's 60 Did I didn't catch
[820.079] that, Michael? Was it 65 ft or 65 m
[823.519] below the surface?
[826.0] The main finger. 65 ft. So, it's about
[828.32] 20.
[829.839] It's about 20 m. But to keep in mind one
[834.32] thing and when you see Randall when you
[836.399] see
[838.079] um at least the the the
[840.6] the you also will notice that there are
[844.32] clear canals where this also changes all
[847.92] sorts of ideologies that we've held true
[851.199] for for too long. Um but this this city
[856.6] um you look at the
[858.68] canals you can tell that they've been
[860.959] filled in with sediment. That's
[862.36] absolutely and when you're in the water,
[865.12] you see all the rubble falling inwards
[867.519] from the north. So, it's obviously a
[870.399] seaborn impact. Um, but we have to
[873.839] consider how much sediment is on top. In
[876.32] other words, there might be another 10 m
[879.36] of sediment, maybe 12 meters, meaning
[883.36] the real depth of the
[885.48] original could be 30 m. Okay. Uh but
[890.16] regarding geological records of this
[892.839] area, it's generally recognized that
[898.079] right around 3 m below sea level, you
[901.36] get to sort of Phoenician
[903.68] ruins, so we're talking about 2500 3,000
[907.279] years ago.
[909.12] And uh so at this depth and at that
[913.079] distance, we're talking far older. Sure.
[918.16] Well, clearly it had to preede the rise
[920.88] of sea level to
[922.519] that to that elevation. So that puts it
[927.12] it puts at least back at least back to
[930.48] the early holene and possibly much
[933.44] older.
[937.279] In other words, when that infrastructure
[938.959] was being built, sea levels were
[940.959] obviously below
[943.12] uh 30 meters or more.
[947.839] So absolutely true. Yeah.
[951.0] Um it's um the the thing that's so it's
[954.8] so difficult. It's such a difficult
[956.72] complex place to study because and you
[960.32] get to one bay just down the road where
[962.48] the ocean is eating away at the bay. You
[965.12] get you you go down a couple kilometers
[967.279] from there and you get an area where
[969.519] it's being built up. um you get one area
[973.279] where you have the subsidance from from
[976.079] the the geological plate and then
[978.0] another where it isn't. So you have it's
[979.68] a very very complex
[982.839] uh place to study geologically. However,
[986.639] the thing that is as a diver and as an
[990.56] archaeologist in that
[993.48] perspective we've been even before
[996.32] finding this place we would be diving
[998.959] almost blind.
[1001.04] um and getting to the bottom of of the
[1003.68] entrance to the river and we would
[1006.519] find slabs the size of a small car
[1011.04] completely rectangular completely cut.
[1013.44] Mhm. And you're wondering what the heck
[1015.199] is
[1016.759] this very very very uh very interesting
[1021.12] series of discoveries. Yeah. So it's
[1025.24] uh and I you like I I I can't wait for
[1029.36] you guys to see it. really because it I
[1031.28] think the the
[1033.24] finds that we we show are are really
[1037.6] remarkable. Most the remarkable thing is
[1040.079] how they coincide with just about
[1042.6] everything Plato discusses about this
[1046.72] mythical ancient land. I bet. So it's
[1050.16] that part of it is
[1052.36] is it's unbelievable. Yeah. I mean it's
[1055.76] amazing stuff. I mean I had the
[1057.36] privilege of getting a quick preview of
[1059.12] it. It's a great great film and we'll
[1062.32] we'll kind of move through this too
[1064.08] because I want to show I want to show a
[1066.32] preview for it as well for people to be
[1068.559] able to look at. But here's a comment.
[1070.559] Somebody left a nice super chat for us.
[1073.039] Um San Cho
[1076.84] 1718 left this really more of a comment
[1079.44] to share with Randall and Michael. He
[1082.16] said Plato said Atlantis was beyond the
[1084.559] pillars of Hercules which are the
[1086.24] Straits of Gibralar. They don't look
[1087.76] like pillars now. they did during the
[1089.36] last ice age. Please look up underwater
[1091.919] underwater baometric maps of the
[1094.76] straits. So, some research or something
[1098.32] to look into. That's a great That's a
[1100.08] great
[1102.72] Well, that's what we do. We do
[1104.36] bathometric uh scans and we have the
[1107.6] entire coastline scanned. And uh it's
[1110.72] funny, this person's name is Jojo,
[1113.36] which is a a funny word in Spanish. But
[1115.36] anyway, uh
[1117.4] um there's something interesting about
[1119.679] the about the concept of the pillars.
[1123.6] Now throughout history
[1126.64] um certain recent history the pillars of
[1130.88] the pillars of Hercules have often been
[1133.52] referred to as what we know as the
[1135.52] straits of Gibralters the straits of
[1138.6] Heracles but there is evidence multiple
[1142.24] pieces of evidence that actually as soon
[1146.4] as you passed through the straits in
[1149.36] like Plato says in the province of Kadif
[1153.12] you would actually reach two physical
[1156.919] columns, two towers. Now, in in the
[1162.24] thing that's curious about Kadith, the
[1164.72] capital city of Kadith is the in the
[1166.96] province of Kadith.
[1169.64] Um, it's an island city. It's an ancient
[1172.96] island city. It's often regarded as the
[1175.039] oldest in in accidental Europe. And the
[1179.84] city that connects it to the mainland is
[1182.48] called San
[1183.799] Fernando. And San Fernando has two
[1188.52] ruins of
[1190.84] prehistoric columns. And any ancient
[1193.76] map, I've got old numbers of them. I
[1196.16] have about nine or 10 ancient maps that
[1199.52] show
[1201.039] um two structures which were named
[1204.559] Columnus de Eerles
[1207.2] pillars of Hercules. Now one of those
[1209.6] structures is completely gone. The other
[1212.32] one well you can see it via satellite.
[1214.48] You can see the
[1215.96] base. The other structure the uh the um
[1221.2] Spanish military built a newer tower on
[1224.24] top of it. knowing and they have it they
[1227.039] know it perfectly well. They have a
[1228.32] little museum that that was built on top
[1230.96] of a
[1232.44] prehistoric tower. So what that means is
[1236.679] that when Plato wrote his texts about
[1240.679] Atlantis 2400 years ago in Greek times
[1244.96] there actually existed still these two
[1248.799] physical towers. So when he was talking
[1251.84] about the the straits of Hercules, he
[1254.4] was talking about the straits. When he
[1256.72] was talking about the columns, the
[1258.799] pillars of
[1259.96] Heracles, he actually meant not far past
[1263.679] the straits, you would have to go
[1265.36] through these pillars, which I
[1268.28] assumed was sort of some sort of a, you
[1271.2] know, like a checkpoint where you pay
[1273.2] your taxes. Yeah. If you have shipping
[1275.52] and commerce, right? Yeah. Another thing
[1278.159] which is curious speaking of shipping.
[1282.159] Speaking of speaking of shipping um the
[1285.36] whole paradigm has changed here. We know
[1288.08] so we can deduce so many things from the
[1290.559] city that we discovered underwater.
[1292.4] First thing is it was obviously built
[1294.0] around shipping. Clearly it was built
[1296.159] with canals. Um it was also it shows
[1300.08] signs of of I this term is used all the
[1303.12] time advanced engineering but advanced
[1306.159] astronomy as well. The central structure
[1309.2] that we found in the acropolis area what
[1312.559] we call it is oriented perfectly to the
[1315.12] cardinal
[1316.84] points. And this all at a time when when
[1320.64] we have this very different idea planted
[1324.4] about what man was doing, mankind was
[1327.039] doing. Yeah. Well, well, Michael, you
[1330.24] are a wealth of knowledge and your film
[1331.84] is is awesome. I think you're going to
[1333.84] blow a lot of people's minds with it and
[1335.679] you're going to have a lot of people
[1337.039] asking questions. So, I'm going to I'm
[1339.52] going to play the trailer here and uh
[1343.2] let people watch the trailer, get
[1344.799] excited for it. This is going to be
[1346.48] premiering for the first time in the
[1348.48] United States. Is that correct?
[1352.799] That's correct. Because we uh we've done
[1355.52] a ton of work in Spain. We've been on
[1358.88] every conference and every show podcast,
[1361.84] but this is the first time we're we're
[1364.4] showing it in the States. First time
[1366.32] showing it in the States. And this will
[1367.679] be Saturday night on Cosmic Summit. Got
[1370.88] to be there to see it. So, I'm going to
[1372.88] play this and then we'll uh we'll start
[1375.12] letting some of the other speakers come
[1376.88] in and jump you backstage, Michael, and
[1379.28] then we'll all come together at the end.
[1380.799] So, without further ado, here is the
[1383.84] preview for Atlantica.
[1478.0] Awesome stuff. Awesome stuff. And it
[1480.559] looks like we lost Michael there at the
[1482.48] end, but that's perfect because that'll
[1484.24] be Saturday night at Cosmic Summit. All
[1488.48] right. Did we lose him for good? I don't
[1491.44] think so. I think he'll come back in
[1492.96] here when we bring everybody back
[1494.559] together at the end. His internet was a
[1496.4] little bit shaky
[1497.96] though. We're going to bring in a Cosmic
[1500.88] Summit OG, a good friend of Randall's
[1505.6] George's Comet Research Group, Mr. Chris
[1508.4] Catrell. How's it going, Chris? Hey
[1510.48] guys. Hey. How's it going? Hey, Chris.
[1514.08] Hello, Chris.
[1516.159] Hey. Looking forward to catching back up
[1518.48] with everybody next month.
[1520.799] Oh yeah, it's gonna be awesome. So
[1524.24] yeah, three times. So Chris, people know
[1528.0] you, they know you're into Carolina
[1530.36] Bays. Give us a little taste of what's
[1534.48] going to be happening this year, what
[1535.919] you're going to be talking about, and uh
[1537.84] what you're excited to see at Cosmic
[1539.919] Summit as well. Yeah. Well, so so year
[1542.799] one was a huge overview of like
[1545.36] everything Carolina Bay related, and it
[1547.679] was a little bit too much. like it was a
[1549.44] lot to fit into an hour. Um, last year I
[1552.72] kind of took a step back a little bit
[1554.4] and focused on some of the geological
[1556.799] features that often get compared to the
[1559.36] Carolina base. Um, and this year I plan
[1562.4] on passing the mic over to uh Antonio
[1565.2] Zamora for a bit and uh let him talk
[1568.32] about the mathematics and the physics
[1570.08] behind, you know, the Carolina Bays and
[1571.919] how how similar they are to one one
[1573.76] another, which is I think is a a key
[1576.159] feature for these Carolina Bays being
[1578.4] impact features. Um, so that's that's
[1582.0] the plan. This time we have a huge
[1583.52] announcement we want to make uh at the
[1586.08] Cosmic Summit. Um it's we've been
[1589.039] working on this joint project for for
[1591.039] quite a while now. Pretty much since the
[1593.12] last cosmic summit and uh we're going to
[1596.0] make that announcement uh there. So
[1597.919] that'll be good. That's awesome, man.
[1599.84] Looking forward to it. Give us a little
[1601.6] bit more. I mean, what is this? You and
[1603.52] Antonio been working on it or what?
[1606.159] Yeah. Yeah, we've been working on it
[1607.52] together uh for months and months. You
[1609.279] you know about it, George. Uh but um
[1611.36] it's it's it's it's pretty much a done
[1614.24] deal now. And so, uh, we, um, you know,
[1617.44] hopefully early June we should for sure
[1620.32] and we'll be able to announce it
[1621.679] publicly. So, haven't wanted to do that.
[1624.88] You know how these things are. You know,
[1626.24] you don't want to say something too much
[1627.6] to jinx it, but uh, but yeah, we've got
[1630.24] some big news to share.
[1633.679] That's awesome. We're excited, man. It's
[1635.919] fantastic. It's what got me into all
[1637.6] this. It had a lot of effect with
[1639.12] Randall early on. He was into the
[1640.64] Carolina Bays. And you know, it's still
[1643.52] a mystery. I don't know what the hell
[1645.36] caused them, but I sure as know they
[1647.44] happened at once. Yeah. And if they
[1650.159] happened at once, then we've got some
[1652.559] explaining to do. Yeah. Who doesn't like
[1655.2] a good mystery? Chris, do you look at
[1657.2] all at the
[1658.52] Atlanta the
[1660.52] um the Alaska oriented lakes?
[1664.799] Yeah. Well, I I focused on some of those
[1666.799] last year with the um the thermocarst
[1669.2] lakes. Oh, yeah. And we made the
[1671.279] comparisons between, you know, the the
[1674.24] actual oriented lakes that we find in
[1676.0] Alaska to what they're saying is the
[1678.88] oriented lakes in in uh you know, the
[1681.36] coastal plane of Georgia, South
[1682.799] Carolina, North Carolina. And there's
[1684.0] really no comparison, right? uh you know
[1686.48] and it's there wasn't perafrost in in
[1689.36] any of that location you know during the
[1691.44] last ice age for for those thermocarst
[1694.32] lakes to form um and they're just
[1696.64] they're just not identical at all
[1698.559] they're not even close um and and you
[1700.799] know last year I also got into kettle
[1702.32] lakes and and a whole bunch of other
[1703.84] oriented lakes that's again and I know
[1706.88] George has said this before but you know
[1709.36] if if you accept that hypothesis you
[1712.799] also have to accept that this was a land
[1715.36] of thousands and thousands of lakes
[1717.12] during the during the um plex scene and
[1720.559] and yeah, every child should be raised
[1722.48] at least some part of the story should
[1723.919] be that oh this was the land of many
[1725.76] lakes down here everything was a lake
[1728.08] the whole of North Carolina I'm down in
[1730.08] the eastern part now it was all these
[1732.64] circular lakes any depictions of mammoth
[1735.12] walking around they should always have a
[1736.96] circular lake behind
[1739.76] and they had to have been lakes long
[1741.279] enough for them to swirl around to form
[1744.24] perfect ellipses
[1745.76] Uh, and that's just it's it's just
[1748.32] ridiculous and it's preposterous. Yeah.
[1751.279] Yeah. And so what Antonio and I plan on
[1753.2] doing is is kind of focusing on you know
[1755.36] that elliptical shape that we find over
[1757.679] and over and over again. And um, you
[1760.559] know, showing how that's that's part of
[1762.64] an incin plane that that that's, you
[1764.559] know, if if an object you know lands
[1767.76] into a flat plane, it's going to form an
[1770.159] ellipse like that. And uh, that's what
[1772.0] we're going to focus on this time. So
[1774.84] awesome. Randall, when did you come
[1776.96] across Carolina Bays for the first time?
[1781.76] 1979.
[1784.399] How'd you come across it? Uh, in a
[1789.08] book coincidentally, on Atlantis,
[1793.44] uh, the secret of Atlantis by German
[1795.919] physicist Otto Moo mentioned the
[1798.96] Carolina bays.
[1801.12] And uh I thought at the time, well
[1803.44] that's right in my backyard. So I got
[1806.24] interested in them and then in the 80s I
[1810.64] started doing a bunch of research into
[1812.799] the Carolina Bays
[1814.84] and came across the book that I'm sure
[1817.76] that I know Chris is well aware of the
[1820.0] book by Henry Savage which I think what
[1823.679] was that 86 maybe? No, it was like 81.
[1827.44] 81. Yeah. Okay. Earlier. Yeah. because
[1829.52] that would fit the time. Yeah. So when
[1831.76] that book came out, they got a copy of
[1833.919] it in the Fernbank Science Library here
[1837.52] in Dicab County and uh I went over there
[1840.64] and I got that book and read it several
[1842.64] times and then I decided this is
[1844.96] interesting. So when it's right in my
[1846.48] backyard, I'm going to explore this
[1848.159] further. And uh I said about uh Henry
[1852.0] Savage gives a very good uh bibliography
[1855.6] in the back of uh I think the the
[1858.08] mysterious what is it the mysterious
[1859.84] Carolina bay Carolina bays. Yeah. Yeah.
[1862.399] So, I set about procuring most of his
[1865.919] references and reading those and then I
[1868.08] think made my first trip to a Carolina
[1871.84] Bay in
[1873.08] Georgia maybe around n mid 1980s around
[1877.96] 8586 maybe the second time I think it
[1880.64] was I went down there with a friend and
[1882.399] we went to a local airport hired a pilot
[1885.279] to fly us up over and uh
[1888.96] I got some problems we just got up there
[1892.24] and then it started raining so it
[1895.12] compromised the quality of my my
[1897.679] imagery. But I got some good stuff and
[1900.08] it really I mean they when you look at
[1902.64] them from a couple of thousand feet up
[1904.32] they really do look very much like
[1906.88] impact produced.
[1909.0] Um you know part of it is yeah there are
[1911.76] complications with the impact hypothesis
[1914.76] but not nearly the kind of complications
[1917.519] would you run into when you try to look
[1919.039] at the alternative ideas. Um, you know,
[1922.08] there were several books that that that
[1924.24] Chris knows well. The um Douglas
[1927.2] Johnson, the original debunking of the
[1930.799] cosmic impact hypothesis called the
[1934.0] origin of the Carolina base. He was with
[1936.44] um oh, who was he with? Columbia
[1938.96] University, I believe. Um he was
[1942.32] considered the dean of geomorphology
[1945.6] uh back during I guess was it have been
[1947.919] the 50s? I'm a little vague on the dates
[1949.84] now because it's been a while. But he
[1951.519] said about to debunk the impact
[1954.159] hypothesis that was um you know as Chris
[1957.519] has explained there's were two camps the
[1959.679] celestials and the
[1961.32] terrestrials and uh Douglas Johnson was
[1964.399] the leader of the terrestrials and he
[1967.36] wrote this massive tome and uh he called
[1970.88] it uh you might remember this Chris the
[1973.799] um what was it called? The complex
[1976.679] hypothesis. Uh and I can't remember I
[1979.519] can't remember at all. This is there's
[1981.12] so many I think I think it went like
[1982.64] this. No, no, no. It's the the solution
[1985.559] alien solution lustran hypothesis. The
[1988.799] artisian I think that was the first
[1990.799] artisian of it. You had an artisian
[1993.519] aquifer under pressure then solution and
[1996.799] in effect what he was describing was
[1998.48] like an upside down waterfall almost. So
[2001.6] you had artisian solution and then you
[2004.32] had lustrine which was the lake and then
[2006.799] you had eolon which was the wind. So it
[2009.2] was kind of like every force of nature
[2011.519] all working in tan together and the end
[2014.399] result was Carolina bays. And somehow I
[2018.48] just thought, okay, well the parimony
[2022.32] would suggest that we look for something
[2025.2] a little simpler first rather than
[2027.44] bringing in every conceivable geological
[2030.799] force and combining them.
[2033.32] Um, and then that was followed up maybe
[2035.76] was it 77 by was it Cox Sarowski who
[2039.36] also wrote a book Eric and his what did
[2043.039] he do? He had a maybe dietimmacous earth
[2045.84] and he put a fan on it or something and
[2048.56] it produced a pseudo ellipse kind of a
[2052.24] thing. A non-per reviewed publication I
[2054.96] may add. Okay. It was just it was just
[2057.28] his doctoral dissertation. That's all
[2059.72] non-perviewed publication that
[2061.52] supposedly closed the door on it and all
[2063.119] he did was take a fan and blow it in a
[2064.879] sandbox. Yeah. And computational no
[2067.919] computational modeling. No one's gone
[2069.839] and taken a big computer now and modeled
[2072.24] hydronamics, all that [ __ ] You could do
[2074.399] so much to figure this stuff out. But
[2076.24] we're still relying on a guy at South
[2078.159] Carolina with a fan one summer in
[2080.159] Colombia. Well, you know, one of to me
[2082.159] one of his his his glaring omissions was
[2085.599] that he started with a depression in the
[2088.72] sand. Exactly. Before he before he
[2091.2] turned his fan on. So what caused the
[2093.28] depression? Yeah. Where did the
[2095.679] depression come
[2096.92] from? So I thought, okay, well, the
[2100.599] uniformitarians, the gradualists think
[2103.04] they've won this argument, but they've
[2105.599] got a day of reckoning coming and we
[2107.44] we've got alternative explanations. They
[2110.16] still from it. They still run this the
[2112.56] crazy ant in the attic. They they hate
[2114.48] to address it. And then if they do, they
[2117.839] Randall, you remember when we did the
[2119.28] little symposia with Graham Hancock and
[2121.119] some others? We'll leave some names out,
[2123.04] you know. Yeah. Yeah. Out in and uh
[2125.28] Yeah. And we we actually went out with
[2127.04] with Chris. Well, I'll throw his name
[2129.119] in. Mark Demitro. Remember, he gave his
[2131.44] little presentation. This is just a
[2132.88] little private eight. Yeah. Yeah. It was
[2135.2] a It was a round table. That's right.
[2137.92] And I put it together for Graham because
[2140.24] Graham was coming through North
[2141.28] Carolina. And I had some terrestrialists
[2144.32] and some extraterrestrialists, which has
[2146.48] nothing to do with aliens, just means it
[2147.92] came from above. And one of the
[2150.24] terrestrial terrestrialists was guy
[2151.839] named Demetriov Deitroth, you know,
[2155.04] accomplished uh scientist and whatnot.
[2157.28] And he sat there with a straight face
[2159.119] and showed pictures of these ice age
[2161.839] depressions that clearly were plea
[2164.4] driven wind features. I didn't know they
[2166.64] call them sponges, you know, and whatnot
[2169.04] on the Mid-Atlantic and said, "Oh, those
[2171.04] are Carolina bays, and I know these came
[2173.04] from winds in the ice age, and they're
[2174.88] Carolina bays." And you looked at them
[2176.32] and said, "No, they're not. No, they're
[2179.359] not. I mean, they're not Carolina bays.
[2181.04] I don't have to be a scientist to know
[2183.2] my eyes aren't lying to me. you you have
[2186.92] contorted things so badly to cram the
[2190.88] square peg in the round hole in this
[2192.64] case almost literally it just really it
[2196.4] surprises me with some of these guys and
[2198.32] some of them are pretty good friends too
[2199.92] so I should be careful but I hope they
[2201.76] take that respectfully. Yeah. Yeah. So
[2205.359] this is you're talking on Saturday or is
[2208.4] this Yeah. Sat Saturday morning with
[2211.72] Antonio Samora. So, uh, if you guys want
[2215.28] to see this, priceless information,
[2218.16] priceless. And now's a good time to do
[2221.04] our promotions because that's part of
[2222.72] the reason why we're here chat. I think
[2224.16] we have like 2500 people on right now.
[2227.04] We're doing something a little bit
[2228.4] differently for our virtual pass this
[2231.52] year. Just so you all know, because
[2233.96] Greensboro and North Carolina, not
[2236.079] everybody can make it there. So,
[2237.599] something that we're doing so you guys
[2239.04] can get an authentic experience of what
[2241.44] Cosmic Summit is like is we have three
[2243.76] different cams. We have a live stream
[2247.88] cam which is on these meta glasses right
[2252.96] here which is walking around firsterson
[2256.56] immersive perspective. See what attendee
[2259.359] sees. Maybe Random Randall will put them
[2262.0] on and you can see Randall walking
[2264.56] around talking with people. I know Pine
[2267.04] Mohan's going to put them on first
[2268.88] person. See what they say. Randle cam.
[2271.359] Randle cam. Oh my god.
[2275.52] The good part is you can't see you,
[2277.359] right? Yeah. It's just Yeah. It's not
[2279.04] like a cam on you. It's your cam on the
[2281.359] world. Yeah. Yeah. So, it's very
[2284.0] important that everybody is aware that
[2285.52] they have these glasses on while they're
[2288.48] going to get drinks. And if they got to
[2290.64] use the can, then they take the cam off.
[2293.119] But we've got that we've got that camera
[2296.72] and then we've also got pretty much the
[2299.76] live stream hub which is the cosmic
[2302.839] newsroom. And this is going to be
[2304.8] something that is only for live
[2307.44] streamers for people who are on the
[2309.359] virtual pass. And we're going to have
[2312.4] hosts including Jay Anderson, George
[2315.2] going to host all host. We'll have
[2316.72] people sitting in there doing exclusive
[2319.16] interviews, postgame talks. So, after
[2322.48] Chris and Antonio get off stage, they
[2324.96] may go in the newsroom, talk about what
[2327.04] they just revealed. It's going to be
[2329.04] casual. It's going to be fun. This is
[2331.119] where everybody in the virtual pass with
[2333.359] a virtual pass will be able to ask
[2334.72] tickets. I nominate Julie Car Carlson,
[2337.839] like Randall's wife. Sit down with Julie
[2340.079] and she'll do it. You know, that kind of
[2341.52] fun stuff. Stuff you're just not going
[2343.04] to see elsewhere. Exactly. Would she do
[2345.68] that, Randall? Would Julie get on and
[2347.119] just chat for a minute with Becket?
[2349.44] Uh, she probably would. Depending
[2352.24] really. Okay. I didn't mean to
[2353.04] overpromise your Well, depending on her
[2354.88] mood.
[2356.64] She's in a good mood. She probably
[2358.4] would. Those kinds of things, folks.
[2361.2] Those kinds of things that you're not
[2362.64] going to see anywhere else. Exactly. And
[2365.92] that's So, we got the Cosmic Newsroom.
[2367.839] We got the Cosmic Summit first person
[2369.52] cam. And then we've also got all of the
[2371.92] presentations that you'll be able to
[2373.599] watch there. So, you can get that ticket
[2376.96] right now until June 1st. We've got the
[2379.92] only discount that we're really doing
[2381.68] for it, which is if you use code three
[2384.16] cams, the number three cams at checkout
[2389.4] cosmixsummit.com, you're able to get $25
[2391.68] off the live stream. So, that's $50 for
[2394.0] all three days of live stream with those
[2396.64] three different cameras. And it's it's a
[2399.359] great deal. We think it's like nothing
[2401.839] else you're going to see with an event.
[2403.52] So, but I got to rant on behalf of the
[2406.4] of the virtual pass for a second. When
[2408.8] you go look at these things as a
[2410.24] promoter and you look around at what
[2412.079] other people sell things for because
[2414.32] frankly it doesn't it costs a fortune to
[2416.64] live stream but each each additional
[2418.16] live streamer doesn't cost you anything.
[2419.599] So, it's an interesting kind of model.
[2421.599] Okay. But people nonetheless will charge
[2424.48] $3 and
[2425.8] $400 to watch six or seven speakers on
[2429.119] pure purely interesting
[2431.079] topics. certainly for business things,
[2433.28] but spiritual conference, health
[2435.0] conferences, similar conferences, three
[2437.119] and three and $400. And that's fine. I
[2439.28] got no problem with that. But we wanted
[2441.2] to democratize it. Get it as low as you
[2444.16] can so darn near anybody in the world
[2446.16] could pull together the money to join
[2447.76] us, you know, all weekend. And 50 bucks
[2450.8] is a pretty good deal for getting 45
[2452.8] hours of content, 27 speakers, three
[2455.319] cameras, and to be a part of the
[2457.359] community, too. And it helps, man. That
[2459.44] money is extremely helpful to keep this
[2461.52] thing going. So, thank you. Keep it
[2462.8] going. I mean, where where are you going
[2464.319] to get this kind of stuff for a little
[2465.839] bit more than a buck an hour? There you
[2468.319] go, man. There you go. And I don't have
[2470.96] my little thing here, but what I say if
[2472.48] one of these people is right, if just
[2474.48] one speaker is right, then vast swaths
[2476.88] of what we think we know of the past are
[2478.64] wrong. Mhm. So, that means just one
[2481.52] person right, you go sit there in person
[2483.28] or you watch it, you're truly on the
[2485.599] cutting edge. thing is probably a lot
[2488.24] more than one of them are right.
[2490.88] That's true. And yeah, and that just
[2493.119] means that it's a special kind of
[2494.56] conference. You're not going to go to
[2495.52] any business conference or about
[2496.96] anything else I can imagine and get
[2498.88] information that may be so important.
[2502.0] Well, I mean, right here, obviously me
[2503.76] and Chris are right. So, we've got And
[2507.44] let's get somebody else right. Let's see
[2510.4] who else might be right. We're going to
[2511.76] get somebody else who's probably right
[2513.839] in here as well. Hey, look at this. See
[2516.16] if Hey, sweet dog. Sweet.
[2521.359] See if I can get Scott Walter in here.
[2523.68] He's trying to join right now. There we
[2526.48] go. Not Scott. Not Scott. Oh, Scott is
[2530.48] the disappearing man. Whenever I click
[2532.16] let in, he disappears.
[2534.64] Well, that's okay. I had a joke I could
[2538.96] have made, but I I ref I
[2542.319] It's uh contended. Now, now what?
[2544.64] Contested. Contested. That's what
[2545.76] Malcolm Contested. Contested. That's
[2547.599] what Malcolm Bendall says. Mate, hey,
[2549.76] let's hear from the chat. Who Who is
[2552.8] going to miss Malcolm Bendall at Cosmic
[2555.359] Summit this year? I'm not going to miss
[2557.44] him, but I think he's interested. I'm
[2558.8] glad I had him.
[2561.24] Well, I mean, there is, you know, I've
[2563.599] been staying a little bit in the loop
[2564.96] and there are some definite updates
[2566.64] going on. Oh, yeah. Really, Randall? Oh,
[2568.96] yeah. Well, I mean, you you knew that
[2570.44] Elements did a Yeah. Yeah. and you've
[2573.599] seen I've seen the reports of that. Um
[2576.4] I'm a little bit behind six to eight
[2578.64] weeks. So I I I do want to catch up. I
[2582.319] look forward after the It's kind of
[2583.68] strange. After the summit, I plan to
[2585.04] catch up with Malcolm. It's just that it
[2587.119] it and I'm not a huge energy talker, but
[2590.24] if ifQi is a thing, he sucks his myqi
[2593.28] from me.
[2595.52] And nothing wrong with that, but it just
[2597.52] he just, you know, just an energetic
[2599.44] person. And to do anything with Malcolm
[2601.359] just requires a hell of a lot of energy.
[2604.24] Oh yeah. And that was last year's
[2606.319] energy. And speaking of
[2609.68] I I see a familiar face. Mr. Scott
[2613.359] Walter. Are you driving down the road
[2614.96] right now,
[2618.28] Scott? Oh, we can't hear
[2620.839] you. I think your your phone might be
[2623.359] connected to your car phone or something
[2625.119] like that.
[2628.24] this. He is the disappearing man. It
[2630.079] happened again. God, I'm getting a ton
[2632.319] of Dan Akroyd as usual. And you know,
[2634.4] I'll take it. I will take it. He's
[2636.48] supposed to be a great guy, you know,
[2638.8] and he's kind of into weird subjects. I
[2640.64] think that's kind of fortunate if you
[2641.92] got to look at just Dan Akroyd. Dan
[2644.0] Akroyd.
[2646.0] Oh, here we go. Dan Akroyd and Santa
[2649.119] Claus.
[2652.96] Scott, we can't hear you. Oh man.
[2658.44] Oh. Oh, Michael's back as well.
[2663.72] Hey, Michael.
[2666.4] I got cut off for a while.
[2669.119] Scott, we still can't hear you, man. So,
[2672.24] I'm not sure. You might need to
[2674.839] uh you might need to I don't know,
[2677.839] disconnect car phone potentially. But
[2680.56] while while we're getting this figured
[2682.079] out, we had some Somebody in the chat.
[2685.68] Oh, I'm getting a bunch of
[2688.359] feedback. We had somebody in the chat
[2690.64] donate 50 memberships to Rando's YouTube
[2693.68] channel. A Mr. Peter Shell. Oh, Peter.
[2697.359] Yeah, my good buddy. Good guy. Yeah. I
[2700.319] mean, Peter and I have shared a lot of
[2702.0] adventures over the last few years. He's
[2704.0] been with us. A big supporter. Um, we
[2707.68] missed him on the recent Bonavville
[2710.16] tour. Everybody uh was like, "Where's
[2712.96] Peter? It's Peter. And um I think Peter
[2716.92] just tied the knot. I think he
[2720.52] and it had something to do with that. Um
[2723.839] but yeah, we held a you know, we all
[2725.839] gathered in a in a circle and and held
[2728.24] hands and and um you know, observed a
[2731.92] moment of silence to uh memorialize
[2735.04] Peter's
[2736.599] absence. No, that actually Peter, if
[2738.96] you're listening in, that didn't
[2741.0] happen. I think it was proposed perhaps,
[2744.0] but it didn't happen. But you were
[2746.4] missed, Peter. You really were. You were
[2748.24] missed, man. And it was fun. I got to
[2750.48] catch you up on some of the things that
[2752.16] we uh that we learned and saw and
[2755.119] discovered.
[2756.88] Well, huge thanks to Peter. It's super
[2758.88] generous and it helps. It helps the
[2761.68] whole cause, helps push the research
[2763.359] forward. And uh it's kind of a good
[2765.68] segue
[2766.92] into looking at what we're doing as a
[2770.079] whole at the Cosmic Summit. So, I'm I'm
[2772.56] going to go ahead and share the agenda
[2775.44] here for you to look at, Randall, for
[2777.359] everybody on this call to look at and we
[2780.16] can kind of talk about some of the the
[2782.319] special events going on, some of the
[2784.079] other speakers who are going to be
[2785.52] there, and just Yeah, I got an overview
[2788.0] of the program. Yeah, George, why don't
[2790.56] you take us through this? Talk to us
[2792.24] about what's happening.
[2794.56] Okay. Well, well, you know, starts
[2796.4] Friday night. you know, you don't have
[2797.839] any speakers on Friday, but obviously
[2799.359] people be checking in and registering
[2800.72] and stuff. So, last year we had a party,
[2803.28] which is fun, and we'll have a party
[2804.72] after this field trip, but I just got
[2806.96] the idea in my head that we had to go
[2808.88] see the most interesting sacred local
[2811.56] landmark, which is generally ignored in
[2814.079] the area, like most sacred things are,
[2816.56] whatnot. Uh, ignored in a sense. It's
[2819.04] well known, but it's not considered a
[2820.88] spiritual thing. And that's Pilot
[2822.4] Mountain. So people can look up Pilot
[2824.319] Mountain, North Carolina. And it's a
[2826.8] Mannock and um that's a a granite uh
[2830.92] intrusion and it pops 1,900 ft twice as
[2835.119] tall as the tallest skyscrapers right
[2836.88] out of the Piedmont out of nowhere. And
[2840.8] it was revered by the Native Americans.
[2844.319] But the special announcement is we have
[2846.72] now confirmed that Yona French Hawk of
[2849.44] the Cherokee Nation is going to be
[2851.68] coming into the Piedmont to see us from
[2853.359] the mountains that day.
[2855.72] And he's a I don't know how to put it
[2859.2] and it sounds patronizing, however you
[2861.04] put it, but he is a leading Cherokee. I
[2864.0] hate the real deal, but I got to say it.
[2866.16] He's the real deal. I think that
[2867.599] cheapens people, but but but he is a
[2870.44] 100% pure blood. That sounds weird, too.
[2873.839] Cherokee. But he's also has received his
[2876.8] stories from his elders. That is all
[2878.96] legit. I I've come to know Yona on the
[2882.0] internet through other people now gotten
[2883.52] to know him personally. And I'm proud as
[2885.839] hell that he's going to be up on the
[2887.04] mountain because the
[2888.359] Cherokee, this is interesting to me,
[2890.4] perhaps to others, but they didn't live
[2892.4] around Pilot Mountain. They lived deep
[2894.8] in the Appalachia Mountains. You can see
[2896.72] the Appalachian Mountains 60 miles away
[2898.8] or so from Pilot Mountain, but they
[2901.599] didn't even live in that part of the
[2902.8] damn mountains. They lived way back and
[2905.839] uh on to Georgia and Tennessee, but
[2909.319] they came out historically of, you know,
[2913.599] prehistorically before we were there,
[2915.68] they would visit Pilot Mountain yearly
[2917.76] for a corn festival.
[2920.079] So they revered this place enough to
[2922.079] leave their home mountains and join
[2924.16] other tribes as a very distinct tribe
[2926.88] themselves. And surely you know they had
[2928.48] plenty of communication with other
[2929.52] tribes. I talked with Yona about that.
[2931.68] But but they hiked out of there. And
[2933.76] just being from North Carolina I never
[2935.44] pictured a Cherokee in the day before
[2938.96] before we got
[2940.2] there going into the Piedmont going into
[2942.96] the other parts of the state and meeting
[2944.72] with the other tribes. But they did that
[2947.04] because of this landmark, this 2,000
[2949.839] foot high granite dome out of nowhere.
[2952.24] And here's the apocryphal thing. Who
[2954.16] knows whether it's true, but you had to
[2956.64] any of the native people approaching the
[2958.88] mountain during the corn festival had to
[2960.24] take their moccasins off 20 miles out.
[2962.64] Yeah, they took it seriously. So knowing
[2966.319] this stuff and having learned of it from
[2967.839] Jim McKelby, who presented his book last
[2969.92] year, was a vendor and had become a
[2972.96] friend, I said, "Man, we got to go. We
[2975.599] we got to go up there. So, we're going
[2976.96] to get a couple of buses. Get your
[2979.28] reservations now because first of all,
[2980.96] you're going to have all the speakers or
[2982.24] many of them on there, right? Randall's
[2984.319] going to join us. Randall, I don't think
[2986.8] we've talked about it in detail, but you
[2988.4] have to give a short Manodnock lecture.
[2991.92] Can you do that? I can do that. Yes.
[2995.119] Okay. Granite Dome. Okay. I I have been
[2997.28] um reading Jim's book and Oh, have you?
[2999.76] Have you? I have been. Yeah. I got a He
[3001.599] gave me a copy last year. He did? and
[3004.4] I'm getting around to reading it uh just
[3007.44] to be more prepared for this outing. Oh,
[3010.72] great, buddy. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. And
[3012.68] it's damn interesting. It is. It's good
[3016.16] local history. It's that kind of book,
[3018.24] first of all, that if you live in a
[3019.68] state, you're like, "Hey, here are all
[3020.8] the little bits and pieces about this
[3022.4] interesting place, you know, all through
[3024.079] the old newspapers and colonial accounts
[3026.96] and the whole thing." And then he throws
[3028.8] in some good woo, you know, a little
[3031.28] bit. I won't call it woo. I hate that
[3033.28] term, but I mean, well, it's it's a very
[3035.28] eclectic collection of information about
[3038.72] it, you know. Um, it covers the gamut.
[3041.839] So, I'm I will have probably read the
[3044.4] entire book by the time we get to the
[3046.0] summit. Um, so Yona is going to give a
[3048.48] talk, Randall will give a talk, and Jim
[3051.2] will give a talk, and then we're going
[3053.04] to see the sunset up there on the
[3054.559] solstice on June 20th, which is when the
[3056.88] tribes gathered. Yeah. Well, what have
[3060.0] you found interesting, Randall? thing
[3062.319] casts a perfect pyramidal shadow that
[3064.24] you can privately hike to go see because
[3066.4] you got to walk all the way around the
[3067.839] thing which I ain't going to take a
[3069.04] responsibility for. But um yeah, you can
[3072.079] go see it and it p casts a pyramidal
[3076.079] perfect pyramid shadow a mountain out of
[3078.319] nowhere. It actually kind of looks like
[3080.0] a Mayan pyramid because the granite dome
[3082.16] at the top of the mountain puts a little
[3084.48] cupa on top of it. It's it's just
[3086.4] stunning, you know. So we had to do it.
[3088.72] It was ain't much that cool around
[3091.359] there, but it's a pretty cool place and
[3093.68] I think people have a fun time up there.
[3095.44] Yeah. Brand, you said you were reading
[3097.76] you found some interesting stuff. I I
[3099.52] haven't had the chance to to read Jim
[3101.28] Mckelby's book. What What What are you
[3104.8] finding interesting? What do you want to
[3106.079] see when we go up there? Well, you know,
[3108.8] I'm I'm only partway into the book and
[3111.28] I've actually been skipping around. uh
[3113.119] but the the orientation the
[3115.88] archastronomy aspect of it really
[3117.92] intrigues me uh the fact that uh that
[3120.72] there is this uh solstitial alignment
[3124.119] and you know in my mind I'm not decisive
[3128.4] one way or another whether these
[3130.0] alignments are natural or artificial or
[3133.28] some
[3134.28] combination in between. Uh, and I'm sure
[3138.4] that, you know, and I basically just
[3139.92] started reading the book before I left
[3141.599] for, uh, the Snake River uh, two weeks
[3145.04] ago. So, I'm not far into it yet, but
[3147.359] um, it's sitting on my nightstand right
[3149.44] next to my where I sleep. I fell asleep
[3152.4] last night reading the book. There was
[3154.319] several references in there to the
[3156.2] Nahhai, which is the Cherokee legend of
[3159.28] these ancient peoples that uh
[3162.4] essentially the uh the reference uh the
[3166.96] the definition rather um of the word the
[3170.4] translation of the word means the people
[3173.28] who could travel anywhere. And I first
[3176.4] encountered them years and years ago,
[3178.8] decades ago, hiking up in North Georgia.
[3182.0] There's a mountain up there called Blood
[3183.76] Mountain, which I always thought was
[3185.52] interesting. Apparently, it was a got
[3188.0] that name because of some battle or
[3190.48] something that occurred on the mountain.
[3192.24] I forgotten the specifics, but I always
[3194.16] felt the the blood correlation perhaps
[3198.0] implied some kind of an alchemical
[3200.64] underlying meaning or something.
[3202.92] But anyhow, I used to hike up that
[3206.0] mountain. It's been years since I've
[3207.52] hiked up the mountain, but I remember
[3208.8] the first time I went up there, right at
[3210.4] the trail head was a a a sign which over
[3214.24] the years fell into uh disrepair. I
[3217.28] would be surprised if the original sign
[3219.839] is still there. I'm sure it's not. I
[3222.88] don't even know if they've replaced it
[3224.24] because it's probably been 15 years or
[3226.4] longer since I've hiked the up that
[3228.88] mountain, but it gave a little bit a
[3231.28] little synopsis of the Cherokee legend
[3233.359] of the uh the Nunahigh. And part of the
[3237.44] deal was that they would go to this
[3239.28] mountain and hike up this mountain to
[3241.92] communicate with the Nunahigh, the
[3243.68] people who could travel
[3245.24] anywhere. And so like I'm always like,
[3248.079] well, who are these people? And then of
[3250.8] course that was around the time I was
[3252.559] first really immersing myself into a lot
[3255.28] of the legends that seem to have
[3256.72] correlations to that. Uh the idea of
[3259.52] these outsiders who came in with some
[3261.839] kind of advanced knowledge uh and were
[3265.28] teachers
[3267.319] or instructors in various things from
[3270.72] astronomy to architecture to geometry to
[3273.68] agriculture. I mean this these kinds of
[3277.119] legends are so ubiquitous around the
[3279.44] world that I believe there has to be
[3282.8] some underlying basis to it. Uh what is
[3287.119] that basis? I don't know. Now, of
[3288.64] course, one thing that would first come
[3290.96] to mind would be, well, perhaps an
[3293.04] Atlantean culture and and Michael will
[3297.04] confirm this that in Plato's account,
[3299.119] apparently they had uh advanced
[3301.839] navigational skills and were probably
[3304.24] interacting over large swaths of the of
[3307.44] the globe with various cultures and
[3309.76] various peoples. I mean he describes a
[3311.52] very vigorous trade network uh with
[3314.48] ships coming and going uh you know at
[3318.88] all hours of the day. So uh it always
[3321.599] seemed to me that well we go back into
[3324.079] the ice age uh going back to 12 13
[3328.48] 14,000 years ago and
[3330.52] longer. Uh you know who knows what was
[3333.28] going on. And and the argument I've been
[3335.2] making for years now is that it's so
[3338.079] easy to dismiss the idea of a
[3340.72] prehistoric lost civilization when you
[3343.68] have no concept of the geological forces
[3346.24] that have been unleashed over this
[3347.76] planet in the last 20,000 years. And
[3350.72] just like what I saw oh last week
[3353.04] following you know what 8 900 miles
[3355.839] along the Snake River was the evidence
[3358.4] of enormous events and you know
[3362.799] traveling throughout spending a couple
[3364.16] of days traveling throughout the basin
[3365.839] of Lake Bonavville you realize well here
[3367.92] is here is a basin in Utah you know
[3372.4] where the great salt lake now is a
[3374.48] remnant of it. Great salt lake varies 20
[3376.799] to 30 feet deep. When you go back to the
[3379.92] late glacial maximum, 14, 15, 16,000
[3383.359] years ago, you had a body of water there
[3386.079] that was that was covered 20,000 square
[3388.72] miles and was over 1,000 ft deep. And
[3391.92] you go now, you're driving on desert.
[3393.599] You're driving on the desert floor and
[3395.04] you can see the shorelines, thousand
[3396.88] feet up on the sides of the mountains.
[3399.28] And you're going, my god, how how you
[3401.68] it's almost impossible to grasp how much
[3404.16] things have changed. Now, if that was an
[3406.64] isolated region, you could say, "Yeah,
[3408.319] here's something idiosyncratic happened
[3410.16] here." But it it's not isolated. We find
[3412.96] that kind of evidence over the entire
[3414.96] planet. There is no doubt that some type
[3417.76] or series I'm more inclined now to to
[3420.799] towards the idea of a series of
[3423.72] catastrophes rather than one great
[3426.88] overriding catastrophe. Uh uh in fact I
[3429.92] think where I'm at now with it and of
[3432.079] course this is subject to modification
[3433.52] as I learn more but there was three
[3435.64] primary episodes that's that that dated
[3439.359] 146 12 9 plus or minus a century and
[3443.44] then about 116 which of course is
[3445.839] totally consistent with Plato's
[3447.64] chronology.
[3449.16] Um, and how how coincidental is it that
[3452.079] Plato precisely defines almost to the
[3454.64] year the date that we now know uh is
[3457.599] associated with meltwater pulse 1b and
[3460.079] the very rapid rise of sea level. Uh,
[3462.799] which of course then implies directly a
[3466.96] catastrophic melting of the great ice
[3468.88] sheets. And so that was essentially what
[3471.119] I was spending uh last week doing was
[3475.04] gathering more evidence for the evidence
[3477.2] for the uh reality of this great uh call
[3481.52] it a a a melt uh a meltdown. And I think
[3485.68] where I'm at now with it, and again,
[3488.16] subject to to modification as I learn
[3490.079] more, but what it looks to me like now,
[3491.76] there was essentially three episodes of
[3495.28] catastrophic melting.
[3497.96] And it so it occurred to me that in the
[3501.119] story of Atlantis, you know, how Plato
[3503.76] describes the the fall of Atlantis prior
[3506.88] to the actual physical destruction the
[3509.68] of the civilization, the the moral fall
[3512.64] of Atlantis, the moral decline of
[3514.599] Atlantis and this the shift from to an
[3519.68] imperialistic culture that was now
[3521.599] enslaving people inside the
[3523.599] Mediterranean.
[3525.52] If you were an island culture or a
[3527.599] coastal culture and you're faced with
[3530.4] rapidly rising sea levels, perhaps one
[3533.599] of your uh responses to that would be to
[3536.559] attempt to do what we now know that
[3539.68] civilizations have done uh is to try to
[3542.799] hold the sea back, the rising sea back.
[3545.76] um you know by building seaw walls and
[3548.24] it would make sense that uh maybe in the
[3551.52] final stages of Atlantis they're trying
[3554.319] to preserve their their civilization
[3556.599] through enslaving people because hey at
[3559.839] that time it sounds like they've become
[3561.52] an elite they they don't have people who
[3563.68] would be uh out there you know laboring
[3568.0] in the trenches so it would make sense I
[3571.04] mean why did we you know what was the
[3573.68] basis of the transatlantic slave slave
[3575.44] trade. Well, to to bring over laborers
[3577.599] that the elite elites didn't want to
[3579.359] work in the cotton fields or the
[3580.64] sugarcane fields, so they brought
[3582.079] laborers over. Anyways, that's a whole
[3584.48] another side of the Atlantean story, and
[3586.319] I can't wait to talk to you more about
[3588.48] that aspect of of Plato's tale, uh,
[3591.599] Michael, because I mean, there is a
[3593.839] whole there's a whole backstory there, I
[3596.079] think. Uh but if you're there is there
[3599.119] is whether it's a coastal civilization,
[3601.599] an island civilization, you're being
[3604.24] faced now with over a few thousand years
[3606.96] a 400 to 450 foot rise in sea level.
[3611.359] What's your response going to be to
[3612.88] that? Um yeah, well, you can move in,
[3615.119] but if you're an island civilization,
[3616.799] you you know, yeah, you you would you
[3619.76] probably send out colonies. And I've got
[3621.68] some things I can't wait to show you,
[3623.359] Michael, that I think will expand this
[3625.599] vision. Awesome. Um, so we'll we'll get
[3628.72] into that. I'm sure we'll be able to
[3630.24] find a a moment or two um next month. I
[3634.88] can't
[3635.96] wait. There there's so many levels to
[3638.88] this story. Yes. and and uh you know it
[3641.839] reminds me a couple years ago I was
[3645.079] reading an article with the different
[3648.24] little scientific discoveries that are
[3650.72] being made now and again and um I read
[3653.76] this fascinating article and it
[3657.079] was if I remember correctly don't quote
[3659.599] me on this entirely but they had found
[3662.72] uh as they usually do a few teeth of a
[3666.319] type of primate that they've They
[3669.599] previously only existed in Africa and
[3672.319] yet they found it in South
[3674.52] America. And paleontologists theorized
[3678.319] that these early
[3681.48] prehominant had
[3683.559] somehow found themselves floating on
[3686.52] some twigs and and managed to make their
[3690.319] way across the Atlantic Ocean. Ahu. And
[3693.119] I thought to myself, this is funny. It's
[3695.44] funny how academia we what we try to do
[3699.52] is we try to categorize things to make
[3703.119] make it understandable in terms of put
[3705.52] everything in a structure so we have a
[3706.96] general idea of things that we otherwise
[3709.28] wouldn't really understand and when I
[3711.44] first read this article I thought to
[3713.4] myself isn't it perhaps
[3716.92] likelier they weren't just
[3720.2] some some ignorant uh
[3723.88] uh stupid primates, but in fact prime
[3728.799] homminids that we're capable of
[3730.4] navigating. Sure.
[3733.68] Maybe. And so I have this, if there's
[3736.96] anything that I've learned from all of
[3738.559] the work that we've been doing is that
[3741.16] humanity as we know it, laws, music, uh,
[3746.599] writing, navigation, science, all the
[3749.2] things which
[3752.0] uh, humanity, uh, civilization have
[3755.2] occurred for eons and eons in one form
[3758.64] or another. And I think that the earth
[3761.04] the one thing that I found almost
[3763.04] fascinating when I started to fly I was
[3765.52] flying drones before in terms of for
[3769.799] cinematography. But when I started to
[3771.839] fly my drones actually for surveying it
[3775.28] was a very different mindset. You're
[3776.88] flying up there and you're looking in a
[3778.319] field for instance. You're trying to um
[3781.2] locate let's say a an old structure
[3783.52] that's somehow in ruins. And I found it
[3786.88] very interesting that I would look down
[3789.119] and and I would say, "Oh, hey, look,
[3791.76] there it is in the field. I could see
[3793.359] the faint outline of this rectangular
[3795.839] structure, but it's so faint." And I
[3798.16] remember thinking to myself, "Isn't it
[3800.64] curious how the the surface of the earth
[3802.48] is almost like the skin on a on a human
[3804.559] being? They have we have scars when we
[3806.96] cut ourselves." And I realized, you
[3808.799] know, the the earth in its cosmic wonder
[3811.52] is some sort of a living being. And it
[3815.2] has after a certain amount of time
[3818.4] absorbing itself. And part of the
[3821.28] struggle that we face in terms of trying
[3824.079] to keep track of our past is that the
[3827.76] earth at one point or another just too
[3830.319] much time goes by and the only things
[3832.64] that remain are those very very very big
[3836.24] structures or things that somehow have
[3839.52] weathered the the the um the elements.
[3843.68] Um, the first things to go are always
[3846.48] the the smallest bits of uh of tools
[3850.559] because, you know, somebody finds a
[3851.92] piece of metal, they're going to recycle
[3854.359] it. But but yet I am convinced that the
[3858.64] people that built the structures that
[3860.0] we've been finding certainly had
[3863.28] advanced uh or industry period. They had
[3866.319] industry regarding shipping. They had
[3868.559] industry regarding
[3870.799] um science. And this is this
[3875.16] is the struggle that we have. But the
[3878.559] good thing is that we live in an era
[3880.72] where combining all of the different
[3883.68] plethora of of sciences and tech techy
[3887.28] stuff that we have. I've got all my
[3889.039] drones and all my scanning stuff here
[3891.92] mixed with good oldfashioned research.
[3894.799] We're at we're at a breaking point.
[3896.72] We're at a not a breaking point. Sorry.
[3898.24] We're at a turning point inflection
[3899.92] point. Yes. and being able to put these
[3902.4] things in flection point. Yes, it really
[3905.76] is fantastic. I never, like I said this
[3908.64] earlier, I never woke up one day
[3910.319] thinking I want to go look for Atlantis.
[3912.28] Um, but now I don't think Beyond thought
[3916.079] he was going to look under the pyramids.
[3919.52] Probably not. But now I get it. I get
[3922.24] why it's
[3924.2] soensive. It's a wonderful It's
[3927.039] something people get hooked to. Yeah.
[3929.44] Yeah. How can you not? If you have a
[3930.96] brain and you have a curious mind, these
[3933.359] are things that uh that we want to get
[3936.4] to know what's going on over here.
[3938.559] Something's going on. Can I talk little
[3941.2] pyramids, please? Yeah. I think it's a
[3943.599] great great segue for that because
[3945.92] you're talking about technologies that
[3947.599] are allowing us to ask different
[3949.92] questions and come to new
[3952.16] understandings. Michael and George is
[3954.64] about to tell us about the special
[3957.359] coffray project crew that we have coming
[3961.839] and it matches what Michael's doing in a
[3963.839] lot of ways and it matches what Matt
[3965.28] Bell is doing because there kind of
[3966.64] three additional things going on with
[3968.0] the summit this year. There are three
[3969.92] reveals. Uh, one's been going on a
[3972.4] while, but the first reveal is the
[3975.119] second trunch of information regarding
[3977.839] the scans under the pyramids being given
[3979.839] at 1:30 p.m. on Saturday the 21st on the
[3983.039] main stage by Filippo Bondi and Armando
[3986.72] May, the two gentlemen who first
[3988.72] revealed it in March and kind of stunned
[3990.319] everybody and caught a lot of grief. I
[3992.48] thought a little too much grief, but
[3993.839] that's fine. Um, uh, can't take the
[3996.64] heat, get out of the kitchen. But but a
[3999.039] lot of it I would think the one thing
[4001.2] that everyone agreed on about the
[4004.4] subject and the information and the
[4006.0] technology the one thing is that they
[4008.24] wanted to know more right everybody even
[4011.119] the harshest critic saying give me more
[4012.96] give me more that's not enough the
[4014.799] wildest believer you know the most
[4016.48] gullible person is like give me more
[4018.24] give me
[4019.16] more and we're going to give more right
[4022.4] they're coming with a new data sets and
[4025.839] and new information I don't know
[4027.359] specifically what I'm not sure if I
[4028.88] really want to know. I want to get
[4029.839] surprised, too. But the the computers
[4032.48] are literally crunching it as we speak
[4034.319] and they're bringing it to Greensboro.
[4036.16] So, you got that reveal at
[4038.119] 1:30 and then Michael his the premiere
[4042.079] of his documentary Atlantica, a special
[4044.559] cut of it for the Cosmic Summit is going
[4046.48] to be at 9:00 that night. So, the first
[4048.64] day of summer on the solstice, is the
[4051.76] solstice the day before or after? I
[4053.68] mean, what do they do? If it's one
[4054.96] moment, how do you pick which day it is?
[4056.48] cuz I don't quite get it. But but but
[4058.48] whatever. On the 21st, the longest day
[4060.48] of the year or the day after longest day
[4062.16] of the year, whatever. Um at 9:00 p.m.
[4065.76] then we're going to break another thing
[4067.599] and that's where the hell Atlantis is.
[4069.2] And I hadn't said it yet and this is an
[4071.72] IMH, right? In my humble opinion, not
[4075.119] terribly humble, but in my humble
[4078.119] opinion, Michael's nailed it. I think he
[4081.44] found
[4082.28] Atlantis, you know, and I just mean that
[4084.64] as a personal thing. I don't think that
[4086.559] our marketing material should go we
[4088.24] found Atlantis even though I've already
[4089.52] done some of that you know is that no I
[4092.319] think the guy found it and and I think
[4094.4] it absolutely is congruent with what
[4096.48] Randle's been saying about the Azors for
[4098.239] years you just got to move the capital
[4100.239] because that was clearly an outpost of
[4102.0] theirs there's no way that if you set
[4104.0] the capital of the Mediterranean at
[4106.0] Kadis you would not have the Azor as
[4108.799] your very first Atlantic outpost and
[4111.279] there's no question that whatever caused
[4113.12] the collapse of the Kadis city would
[4115.92] have had dramatic effects on the Azors,
[4118.719] could have well been sinking islands as
[4120.719] we have pictured. But I don't think, as
[4123.279] it turns out, the capital city, the
[4126.159] story of the capital city as dramatic as
[4128.799] maybe we had thought with giant tidal
[4130.48] waves rushing across North Africa or the
[4133.04] capital city sank thousands of feet
[4134.719] underwater, I think is a little bit more
[4136.48] subtle and it's 65 feet down and pretty
[4138.96] much right where the hell you'd put it
[4140.319] if you wanted to have a capital of the
[4141.679] Mediterranean.
[4143.52] Now, I think you found it, man. And I'm
[4145.199] proud to have you. I gotta I I gotta I
[4147.6] gotta Thank you, brother. I really I It
[4150.799] brings me back to something that Randall
[4152.88] had had brought about earlier. Um, if
[4156.48] you go back to the very
[4159.4] first pages of the Michael, pull that
[4162.239] mic a little closer to your mouth if you
[4163.839] can.
[4165.44] Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that. How you
[4167.279] doing? Everything. I put on my movie
[4169.279] voice. Yeah. Speak into it. the the um
[4173.759] Plato
[4174.839] Plato describes
[4177.48] that according to the mythological story
[4180.319] that he tells that Poseidon and his wife
[4183.48] Clato had had five sets of twins and he
[4188.88] goes into the naming naming each one of
[4190.799] the twins. Emulus and Atlas were the
[4194.159] oldest the eldest twins. Emilus was also
[4197.36] known as Gaderus in the local language.
[4200.48] Gaderus is the name of this whole area.
[4203.04] Gad Gades Gadith.
[4206.76] Um but he also discusses clearly that
[4210.08] they could they they they uh controlled
[4212.48] the majority of the Mediterranean. And
[4214.64] we have to consider the entire
[4216.96] topography the entire um makeup of the
[4220.719] people of the early Mediterranean back
[4222.64] then is is completely different. they
[4224.719] would have controlled North Africa, all
[4226.64] of the Mediterranean toward all the way
[4229.28] to the E,
[4231.28] um, Greece and but also in the other
[4234.52] direction, which means as towards the
[4237.44] Azors and the Canary Islands. Now,
[4239.84] what's interesting about the Azors and
[4241.679] the Canary Islands, George and I talked
[4244.32] about this uh the other day on our
[4246.96] podcast, but one fascinate, it's one
[4251.04] crazy coincidence on top of the other.
[4252.8] Of course, we all know there's no
[4254.32] coincidences, but
[4257.0] um a lot of people don't know the the
[4259.92] very town I live in is the town that
[4262.8] Muel Mellin and Christopher Columbus
[4266.0] sailed out of. Now, why is that
[4268.48] important? That's no coincidence. The
[4270.8] oldest archives in Europe
[4274.44] belong to the
[4276.36] families the family of the Dukes of
[4278.48] Medina, Sedonia. Those contain some of
[4282.0] the oldest maps in history. And what are
[4285.28] maps? Maps were the ancient technology.
[4288.0] This is how if you knew a good map
[4291.12] route, it meant you knew how to
[4293.44] navigate, how to trade, how to uh how to
[4296.719] make money. And
[4300.04] um Columbus knew he knew that on the way
[4305.199] to America there's a
[4307.719] subatlantic the river a current that
[4311.04] goes via the Canary Islands and on the
[4315.12] way
[4316.199] back is past the Azors.
[4320.04] So whether the were the Azors and the
[4322.96] Canary Islands part of this trade route
[4325.28] I have no doubt about it whatsoever.
[4327.52] There's
[4329.6] about and madiraa and and the the and
[4335.08] madiraa absolutely madiraa smack dab in
[4338.64] the middle and in fact Columbus had a
[4340.96] house in MadiRaa
[4343.32] um all of these clues all of the
[4346.08] plethora of clues from South from Meso
[4348.96] America of Alan Mazatlan all
[4352.84] pre-Colombian
[4354.84] names belonging to these places. I have
[4358.08] no doubt that there was transatlantic
[4362.0] global trade with no question. No doubt
[4365.6] back then. Yeah. If you can build a city
[4368.719] like we found, which is is effectively a
[4371.6] Venice of the prehistoric world, uh you
[4376.32] could definitely navigate with all with
[4380.159] all seriousness. Yeah. You would you
[4382.48] would have been as good as any any
[4384.4] navigator today. No question. more
[4386.88] advanced understanding in technology
[4389.12] than they're given credit for. And uh I
[4393.12] mean I I I'm trying to use that all the
[4394.96] work that I'm trying to use that
[4397.12] statement as a segue here because we got
[4399.6] somebody else who's a speaker at the
[4401.199] cosmic summit that I'm going to let in
[4404.28] here who's all
[4406.6] about objective all about advanced
[4410.239] technology. Mr. Ashton Forbes.
[4414.56] Ashton Forbes Forbes, how are you?
[4417.44] Ashton, this guy looks very familiar for
[4420.32] some reason.
[4421.65] [Music]
[4424.32] I don't
[4425.32] know. He can't hear. Can you hear us?
[4428.239] Oh, no. You can't hear? Oh, he's gone.
[4431.199] That's the only time no one's been able
[4432.64] to hear Ashton ever.
[4435.28] in the context of what uh Michael was
[4437.52] just saying, I I I I would love to do a
[4440.4] share screen at some point. Yeah,
[4442.96] please. Right at this moment. Fantastic.
[4445.12] Yeah, go ahead. And Ashton can switch up
[4447.199] his uh also I got to just add one
[4450.88] detail. I am so excited to talk to you,
[4453.6] Randall, about these things. and and
[4456.32] everything that I've seen you ever
[4458.239] talking about is
[4460.36] effectively simply adding this
[4463.52] extraordinary value to the same exact
[4466.719] argument.
[4468.239] Yes. I in fact what I my final version
[4471.28] of it is that Macarinesia as a whole
[4473.76] represented the Atlantean Empire.
[4476.32] There's a there's a very interesting uh
[4479.52] article that I came out oh years ago but
[4482.719] it's still relevant. It hasn't it hasn't
[4484.88] changed.
[4485.96] Uh and basically it says uh this was
[4489.199] published uh oh way back I think in the
[4491.84] late 80s but uh in the present day North
[4494.56] Atlantic Ocean the boundary between the
[4496.48] subtropical and subpolar gyres runs
[4499.52] southwest to northeast from Hatteris to
[4501.92] the Norwegian Sea. The warm Gulf Stream
[4504.48] and its extension the North Atlantic
[4506.8] current system coincides with this
[4509.52] boundary. In contrast, during the last
[4512.159] glacial maximum approximately 18,000
[4514.8] years ago, the gy boundary and
[4516.88] dissociated currents were more zonal and
[4519.92] located further to the south. So then
[4523.199] I'm going to do share screen to show you
[4525.76] where the the the path of the Gulf
[4528.719] Stream during the late glacial maximum.
[4531.36] Look at that. And welcome back, Ash.
[4533.12] Exactly. Look at this. You see it
[4534.96] wrapped right around the Azor plateau
[4537.52] and then next to Madiraa the Canaries.
[4541.679] So it is bringing all of this equatorial
[4544.239] warmth to this whole region which in my
[4547.199] mind would suggest well where if we
[4549.679] suddenly found ourselves transported
[4551.28] back to the late glacial maximum where
[4553.36] might we want to put down a cornerstone
[4555.6] to establish some type of a
[4558.32] civilization? And here we go. Here it is
[4560.56] right here.
[4563.64] Exactly. Exactly. So just on that note
[4567.28] sense and um yes I was just commenting
[4570.88] that
[4571.96] this Ashton Forbes very familiar face
[4576.32] and name. I know this man from
[4578.159] somewhere.
[4579.76] I can't quite put my finger on it. You
[4582.08] might you might have met him on a plane
[4584.08] around 2015. Oh that's probably it. Oh
[4588.08] we found out we both are from Minnesota
[4589.76] though. Yeah we both from Minnesota.
[4592.32] Yeah. Oh, don't you know?
[4594.96] Yeah, you betcha.
[4597.76] Uh, how are you guys doing?
[4600.64] We're doing good, man. How are you?
[4602.4] Great. Yeah, relaxing. Long weekend
[4605.199] ahead. Uh, was working, you know, pretty
[4608.0] late for a Friday on a in a summer, you
[4610.08] know, but um yeah, I wanted to just jump
[4612.56] on for a few minutes, chat with you
[4614.239] guys, uh, you know, get everybody hyped
[4616.159] up for Cosmic Summit in a few weeks.
[4619.199] Awesome. Well, thanks for jumping on,
[4620.719] man. man, you're a great friend of it.
[4622.8] Thank you so much for coming again this
[4624.239] year, Ashton. You're going to be with
[4625.76] Bob Grer in a classroom on Monday. Yeah,
[4629.12] we're gonna be talking about science
[4631.679] stuff. Uh, so I think the plan for me is
[4634.4] I'm going to talk about some of the
[4635.6] durs, the defense intelligence reference
[4637.36] documents. Uh, specifically the ones
[4639.44] that lean in to plasmoids and what and
[4642.4] low energy nuclear reactions, the stuff
[4643.76] that Bob Greener is talking about
[4645.36] because I just think those papers are so
[4647.12] important. I think that those are the
[4649.04] papers that the government put out there
[4651.44] as like plausible deniability for when
[4654.159] like all the secret advanced technology
[4656.239] comes out and they're like, "Oh, we
[4657.52] weren't lying about it. It was all out
[4659.04] there." So, I want to help people
[4661.04] understand what they mean and and get
[4663.12] people excited about it. What do you
[4664.64] call those papers again? What I'm
[4667.64] sorry, but they're called the Defense
[4669.84] Intelligence Reference Documents. How
[4672.4] Pudof talks about them because he's the
[4673.92] one that commissioned them. like he's a
[4676.48] spook, but he's also knows all the black
[4678.64] project engineers. So, the Defense
[4680.8] Intelligence Agency commissioned him to
[4683.76] commission these 38 papers from like all
[4686.0] his best buddy spook friends, which
[4687.92] include people like uh Friedwart
[4690.0] Winterberg, who was a Nazi, all right,
[4692.8] not Nazi, but Project Paperclip
[4694.64] scientist that came over from Germany
[4696.08] when he was young and became like this
[4698.96] fusion scientist that all his stuff is
[4701.199] still classified to this day. He like
[4702.48] never is going to get the recognition he
[4704.32] deserves. So, wow. Pretty cool. Ashley,
[4706.239] can we get a little more volume on your
[4707.44] mic? Are you able to turn the mic volume
[4709.04] up? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hold on. Is that
[4710.96] better? Yeah. Yeah, that's way better.
[4712.96] So, yeah. Riverside. So, anyway, um that
[4715.6] we're going to be talking about that and
[4717.12] you know, if then we're going just
[4718.48] hanging around the classroom and answer
[4721.04] questions, things like that. So, I think
[4722.56] it's on Monday that we'll be doing that,
[4723.84] but I'll be hanging out the rest of the
[4725.36] time listening. Randall will have a
[4727.28] classroom at the same time.
[4728.32] Unfortunately, y'all can't watch each
[4729.679] other's stuff. That's okay. Well,
[4731.199] actually, no. I forget whether they're
[4732.96] morning, afternoon, but um but yeah,
[4735.84] separate day. Separate. Yeah. No,
[4737.52] they're actually uh two different times.
[4739.199] So Ashton, you and Bob are going to be
[4740.96] in the morning in the in room. And then
[4743.52] Randall, you're going to be at 1:30 on
[4747.52] Mainstage Room. So you guys can see both
[4750.64] of the classrooms and also we'll have
[4753.52] them available in the app online if you
[4756.239] want to view them through the
[4758.04] CosmicSummit event app. Eventually,
[4760.56] they'll be available on the internet so
[4762.159] you can see them, but it'll be a good
[4763.92] time. So, what what are you gonna be uh
[4766.88] what are you gonna be revealing, Ash? I
[4768.719] know you always got something something
[4770.719] new, new discoveries coming out. You
[4772.719] have anything you're holding on to until
[4774.32] the summit? Uh, this is what I'll say.
[4776.4] I've been thinking about this in terms
[4777.679] of like what am I going to put out there
[4779.199] to spice up? What I'll tell people is
[4780.8] this is that from what I've learned from
[4783.84] the MH370 videos, from researching the
[4786.36] science, I've learned this is like a re
[4788.64] this is the real deal. And it's really
[4790.56] really serious. It's national security.
[4792.64] Like the reason why they're hiding this
[4793.76] is all national security reasons. And I
[4795.76] don't even feel that comfortable talking
[4797.12] about how all this stuff works that
[4798.64] level because you know it's technically
[4800.8] helping our adversaries out. Like
[4802.239] imagine a scenario like the
[4805.199] teleportation. Let's say we didn't
[4806.56] figure out teleportation in the 70s.
[4808.239] Let's say we figured out in like 2009.
[4811.44] That's not that long ago. So like, you
[4814.0] know, figuring that out publicly really
[4815.6] helps out countries that are much
[4817.52] further behind, you know. So for me, I
[4819.6] don't want to be doing I I want to be
[4821.199] kind of careful about how far I'm going
[4822.4] on this cuz I feel like I understand it
[4823.52] really well. So in the Cosmic Summit
[4825.12] though, we're just going to let it all
[4826.4] fly. You know, we're just going to go
[4827.6] in, look at all the Air Force Research
[4829.199] Lab papers, explain how and why and
[4831.6] exactly when and who figured it all out
[4833.84] so everybody there understands, you
[4835.52] know, the secret sauce of like who the
[4837.12] people we should be pointing at are um
[4839.12] for the people that know, you know, who
[4840.8] are the people that know out there. And
[4842.64] the reason why I think that's important
[4844.159] is that there's a lot of people that are
[4845.76] going to be there. People in the UFO
[4847.12] community and in these kind of
[4848.32] conspiratorial communities that think
[4849.6] the government's hide stuff. And by the
[4850.96] way, you're right. And they want to know
[4853.04] who are the people I can trust. Who are
[4854.48] the people I can't trust. Well, I don't
[4856.08] know who necessarily you can trust, but
[4857.679] I can at least tell you who are the
[4858.719] people who have the answers. So then you
[4860.4] can judge for yourself when you know
[4862.08] they tell you information what if you
[4863.679] should, you know, listen or not.
[4866.719] Man. Well, it's going to be exciting.
[4868.88] It's going to be awesome. Blow your
[4870.159] doors off. I mean, Bob is my guru.
[4872.32] Ashton's kind of my subguru.
[4874.64] I don't know. I don't know. He ain't
[4875.92] quite subguru yet, but but but he's in
[4878.159] the right room, man. Bob Griner is just
[4881.199] an absolute priceless human. So are you,
[4883.6] Ashton. Yeah. You and Bob together in
[4885.84] that class. Damn. Interesting three.
[4887.44] Yeah. So that's why I talked to Bob
[4888.56] right after I talked to Randall as well
[4890.32] because I wanted to have another
[4891.76] conversation with him kind of about
[4893.36] those papers and his ideas around them.
[4896.4] And if you guys haven't listened to
[4897.679] that, that's kind of a sneak peek on
[4899.12] what to expect in the Cosmic Summit in a
[4900.88] few weeks, which, you know, if people
[4902.56] have been following my work for a while,
[4904.0] it's pretty mind-blowing. If you haven't
[4905.76] been, it's probably a little bit out,
[4907.12] you know, out there, but you can kind of
[4908.64] catch up watching some of the other
[4910.0] stuff. And, um, some of the other work
[4912.08] that I've done in the past. So,
[4914.8] I'm sorry, where are you pointing us,
[4916.08] Ashton? I'm sorry. Where where what
[4918.0] should we go watch as a preview? Oh, um,
[4921.04] watch my Bob Greener uh, Hard Truths
[4923.52] podcast, but also watch the the Randall
[4925.199] Carlson one. Actually, I don't know
[4926.239] where I'm I'm located on the screens
[4928.239] when people are watching here. But yeah,
[4930.159] both of those are very good because I
[4931.92] think that they explain the context of
[4934.239] why plasmoids are so important, why
[4936.56] sacred geometry uh is so important in
[4939.28] math and in the universe and um how this
[4942.639] can lead to or potentially could be the
[4945.12] secret of how the government has been
[4947.6] able to figure out gravity manipulation.
[4949.36] We would call it gravity manipulation,
[4950.639] but they would just call it clever use
[4952.0] of physics probably. Mhm. And um and how
[4955.6] it's been hiding in plain sight this
[4957.52] whole time. And so then when we get to
[4959.76] the cosmic summit, I will go through the
[4961.76] scientific papers, explain from my
[4963.679] perspective what they mean and encourage
[4965.44] everybody else to explore them for their
[4967.52] own and then how that leads into like uh
[4970.96] Bob's uh work and then I also want to
[4973.76] talk about you know the broader
[4975.52] implications of that technology. So one
[4978.48] thing that if you listen to the Bob
[4979.52] Green interview he and I spoke about is
[4981.199] like what's happening with fusion
[4983.36] research publicly the public fusion
[4985.12] research like at the same time all these
[4987.199] companies are just re like releasing
[4989.36] their papers simultaneously about their
[4991.12] like next generation reactors and
[4992.719] they're all pretty much identical and
[4994.4] you're wondering is there collusion
[4995.84] going on like do they have something
[4997.6] better than this why do they release
[4998.88] this publicly and uh I think the answer
[5001.679] there you know is yes they they do know
[5003.84] they have something much better and all
[5005.76] all this energy advancement this very
[5008.4] little that we've gotten has basically
[5010.239] been planned out for us and because they
[5014.08] have they know this technology is so
[5015.6] advanced we have to like slowly work our
[5017.36] way kind of up towards it. Becca, can I
[5020.159] ask um Ashton his take on something?
[5023.679] Yeah, please. Yeah, Ashton, uh, you may
[5026.719] or may not know, we're trying to
[5027.92] publicize the fact that these fellas
[5029.6] that that kind of shocked the world and
[5031.84] took a lot of blowback in March, having
[5033.76] said that they have a new technology
[5035.12] that's able to scan beneath the pyramids
[5037.04] or other places on Earth, the Coffrey
[5040.0] Pyramid Researchers, they're coming to
[5041.84] Greensboro and they're going to do a
[5042.96] mind-blowing presentation 1:30 on
[5044.8] Saturday the 21st. Okay. One of the
[5047.12] things as we've done Did you know that?
[5049.52] No, I didn't know that. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[5051.28] Yeah. That's even publicized. It shows
[5053.52] how bad our we are at publicizing
[5055.44] things. Even our own speakers don't
[5056.56] know. But um no, that's fine. That's
[5058.719] what this last month has. That'll be
[5060.239] Saturday. That'll be Saturday the 21st.
[5062.8] Saturday the 21st at 1:30. Um Filipo
[5065.76] Beondi and Armando May are going to come
[5067.76] and give what has the further crunched
[5070.88] data on the pyramids. And I don't know
[5073.199] exactly what they're bringing, but it's
[5074.4] going to be incredible. Here's my
[5075.6] question. Or here my take on it. One of
[5078.239] my takes as I've interviewed them and
[5079.92] talked about it and whatnot um on social
[5082.84] media is that people in our community at
[5086.44] large believe in a lot of very very
[5089.36] astounding things you know that that are
[5091.52] possible and a lot of that's wellfounded
[5093.28] belief even though it'd be surprising to
[5095.04] most people who had done their homework.
[5096.96] Okay. But they're having trouble
[5098.8] believing that there's a technology that
[5100.96] can look beneath the ground. Yeah. Okay.
[5104.48] If we've got what I'm saying is in my
[5107.12] lifetime, I've said this other things in
[5109.04] my lifetime I would say the most
[5111.76] important
[5113.48] geostrategic remote sensing question in
[5116.0] the world is what is under the nuclear
[5118.56] mountain in Iran where they're putting
[5120.48] together the bombs. That's been going on
[5122.0] for 30 years. Same thing in North Korea.
[5125.28] Don't you think, Ashton, that the US
[5128.08] government is already able to look
[5130.639] deeper in the earth than we may know?
[5134.6] So, do I Let's start with do I think
[5137.6] that there's a mega structure under the
[5139.679] pyramid? I I don't know. I didn't really
[5142.32] look too much into it, but you know,
[5144.639] it's a giant pyramid and I think there's
[5146.159] something else going on there like with
[5147.44] I think a lot of you guys think probably
[5149.12] it's more like a a power plant than it
[5151.36] is likely to be a tomb or some other
[5153.44] thing. So, could there be something on
[5154.719] there? Would I be surprised? No. No, I
[5156.159] wouldn't be surprised to the question of
[5157.92] can they is there technology that can
[5160.8] look under the earth further than is
[5162.639] conventionally understood? Yes,
[5164.159] absolutely. I have no doubt whatsoever.
[5167.04] Thousands of people working on that.
[5168.32] They'd have to put billions of dollars
[5169.76] into trying to peer into Iran's
[5171.52] underground nuclear facilities. I mean,
[5173.36] either they failed or we spent billions
[5175.44] of dollars. They might have failed. So,
[5177.679] the way it's possible is the same way
[5180.239] where teleportation is possible, same
[5181.84] way everything I'm talking about is
[5182.719] possible is that spaceime is not empty.
[5184.639] Spacetime is a medium itself. So how is
[5187.84] it possible that quantum tunneling
[5189.44] works? Quantum tunneling, we take a
[5190.719] semiconductor and then we have a wall,
[5192.159] an insulator, and we have another
[5193.96] semiconductor. Conventional physics say
[5196.159] there's not enough kinetic energy for
[5197.6] the electrons to jump through this wall
[5199.679] to make it through the wall. But quantum
[5201.36] tunneling still occurs. Why? How? How
[5204.4] can that be physically possible? The
[5206.56] answer because if you think about it
[5207.92] like you're you're twisting a wire and
[5211.12] you hit that wall. Well, yes, a lot of
[5212.88] the twist might stop, but some of that
[5214.4] twist is going to penetrate through the
[5216.08] medium. It's penetrating through the
[5218.0] medium. So, if you can do that just
[5220.92] theoretically, and that's what quantum
[5222.719] tunneling proves, then you should be
[5224.56] able to create a quantum sensor that can
[5227.6] just sense like distortions in the mass
[5231.76] of Earth and in theory use this to
[5233.76] detect cavities in the Earth. And so, to
[5236.639] your point, what do you when you're
[5237.52] trying to find something buried
[5238.32] underground, that's what you're trying
[5239.12] to find. you're trying to find like
[5240.239] different density between rock and
[5242.4] something else that might be structure
[5243.6] underneath there. So, do I think they
[5244.96] can do that? Absolutely. And I think
[5246.56] they've had those kind of quantum
[5247.76] sensing technologies for probably a long
[5249.92] time. And now I think they probably have
[5251.12] them in satellites where like the whole
[5252.96] earth is like they know where everything
[5254.639] is. You can't hide in a building. Yeah.
[5257.44] And to be clear, I'm not saying that
[5259.28] Filippo is exploiting those kinds of
[5261.639] technologies. I'm saying that's not
[5263.76] beyond the kin of man to do such a
[5266.08] thing. that if we believe they're
[5267.84] anti-gravity machines and UFOs and time
[5270.8] travel and all that stuff, by God, it's
[5273.44] not impossible to look underneath the
[5275.92] ground. And Filipo may have found a
[5277.52] different path than the US government
[5279.36] surely did. But the tools are out there.
[5281.36] He just to put together tools and AI
[5285.12] that that managed to do this. So that's
[5286.88] just I just want to get your thought.
[5288.32] And so what I would say on that front
[5289.36] too is yeah it's um and I'm not you know
[5292.08] I haven't looked at his methodology even
[5293.76] if he's not he doesn't have to be using
[5295.199] quantum sensing to figure out that
[5296.56] there's something underneath the
[5297.36] pyramids too. It might just be a
[5298.56] combination of you know intelligence
[5300.56] talking to the right people using good
[5302.56] research and you know using normal like
[5305.199] S. I think they use a synthetic aperture
[5307.12] radar I think is what they use for which
[5309.04] is the similar idea but it just can't
[5310.4] penetrate a certain depth because you
[5312.159] know the the wavelengths uh fall off by
[5314.48] I think yeah they have another data set
[5316.32] they mix it up with with AI and it got
[5318.239] misunderstood right away. It was like oh
[5320.239] they're saying S. I mean obviously why
[5322.159] would they do a big announcement that
[5323.44] we've used a technology everyone knows
[5324.96] the limitations of it and now we've it's
[5326.88] seated it just people missed kind of for
[5329.04] me here's here's the big point on it and
[5330.88] this applies to my stuff or anyone
[5332.719] else's stuff is that when you're looking
[5334.4] into these topics I think the question
[5336.159] is why is it significant okay you
[5338.0] discovered this thing you're making this
[5339.36] big claim but why why is this
[5340.56] significant why should this be important
[5342.8] when it comes to the pyramid you know
[5344.32] it's like oh this might be a power plant
[5346.0] well that's important because it really
[5347.28] gives a completely different perspective
[5349.44] on what ancient civilization might have
[5351.6] been capable of from the perspective of
[5353.76] MH370 videos. Why are those videos
[5355.6] important? Well, we might have
[5356.8] teleportation and free energy
[5358.0] technology. You know, some pretty big
[5359.92] important reasons. That's just a couple.
[5361.28] And then now the problem I struggle with
[5362.88] the thing, okay, why is there this thing
[5364.4] buried underneath the pyramid? And are
[5367.44] we saying that that is, you know, a
[5369.44] natural structure, an artificial
[5371.04] structure? If so, is it related to the
[5373.6] use of the pyramid? We just don't know.
[5376.0] That's why you got to come to Greensboro
[5377.28] to find out more information. The only
[5378.56] thing everybody agreed on is we want to
[5380.0] hear more information. You know, set you
[5381.92] up.
[5383.52] The way I look at it, and I'll shut up,
[5385.44] is that we should welcome our community,
[5388.159] should welcome people who want to help
[5390.88] out. Maybe they're wrong, but unless you
[5393.44] just think they're frauds, you should
[5394.96] welcome Filippo. Maybe he's
[5396.639] misinterpreted something, but he's got a
[5398.48] new tool, and we don't have any tools at
[5400.32] our disposal. And anybody that claims to
[5402.48] bring a new tool to bear on these issues
[5405.6] should be welcomed provisionally as
[5407.6] someone who may eventually be a
[5409.199] significant contributor. And if in the
[5412.32] meantime you turn it turns out that he's
[5414.719] thrown away a 30-year career so he could
[5416.639] get in the New York Post, okay, we'll
[5419.04] toss him overboard, you know, but in the
[5420.96] meantime, everybody should be treated
[5422.32] with respect. And I didn't find a whole
[5424.0] lot, but I'll I'll I'll Yeah, it's well
[5426.239] said. I mean, we're coming together to
[5428.159] help understand humanity, our history,
[5430.88] and raise human consciousness as a
[5433.12] whole. That's the purpose of this.
[5434.96] Everybody comes with a different pursuit
[5436.719] and a different endeavor. But we're not
[5438.8] here to just fight over nothing. It's
[5441.12] not about being right. It's about
[5442.639] exploring the truth, trying to figure
[5444.48] out something that helps us take steps
[5446.8] forward. So, what do you think about all
[5449.28] this, Randall? What do you think about
[5450.719] the the Coffrey project? you did a video
[5454.239] talking about the initial scans that
[5456.4] came out and I mean probably everybody
[5458.88] on this live stream has seen it. You
[5461.199] said some interesting stuff. What are
[5463.199] you what questions do you have that are
[5465.199] still open that you're open to have
[5466.4] answered?
[5468.08] Well, I think as I made clear in the uh
[5471.28] in the conversation that I had with
[5472.88] George and with the with um Filipe
[5475.52] Anamando is that the one thing I
[5479.199] immediately assumed plausible was that
[5481.679] they were detecting underground
[5483.84] cavities. And I pointed out that the
[5485.679] Giza plateau is primarily limestone. And
[5488.96] I also have showed that you know there
[5490.639] have been tremendously different
[5492.88] hydraulic regimes in the past that could
[5495.28] have been responsible for creating a lot
[5498.0] of uh subterranean erosion carsted
[5501.52] formations cavities caves and so on. I
[5504.32] mean, it's well known, you know, that
[5506.159] wherever you have a limestone terrain,
[5508.32] you add water to the mix, you're going
[5509.92] to get erosion of a variety of kinds
[5512.48] like uh north of where I live and
[5515.12] probably down well down there where
[5516.56] you're where you're at too in the
[5517.76] Yucatan, it's mostly limestone. And you
[5520.32] know, the cenotes are huge. Some of them
[5522.639] are huge labyrinthine
[5524.8] uh cavity structures that are beneath
[5526.8] the surface. Likewise, Tennessee,
[5529.44] Kentucky, a lot of limestone. You have
[5531.199] Mammoth Cave. you have. So I have you
[5534.32] know realized years ago uh you know that
[5537.52] there were enormous uh amounts of water.
[5540.239] You go back to even the early holysine
[5542.719] optimum you had a lush Sahara with heavy
[5545.76] rainfall large lakes huge lakes where it
[5548.56] is now desert. Well so and and then that
[5552.239] you consider the Nile canyon itself. The
[5554.8] Nile River flows on top of a 8,000 ft
[5560.28] thick sedimentary column right there
[5563.12] next door to the Giza Plateau. So you've
[5566.0] got this erosional element that's a mile
[5568.719] and a half deep into the ter into the
[5571.639] bedrock. It's right there immediately to
[5574.0] the east of the of the Giza plateau. So,
[5577.52] in my mind, it wasn't a huge stretch to
[5580.48] to conceive of the possibility of there
[5583.28] being large apertures uh beneath down
[5587.44] deep into the bedrock. Yeah. So, from
[5589.679] that
[5590.52] standpoint, I, you know, I was not
[5593.44] skeptical. I thought, well, this
[5595.199] certainly is plausible. Now, to go from
[5598.159] there to the next step is where it gets
[5600.6] conjectural, and I don't know. I don't
[5602.719] have an opinion until I know more. I
[5604.88] mean, I'm like everybody else. So, I'm
[5606.56] sitting on the fence and I thought,
[5608.96] well, what are a couple of scenarios?
[5610.719] Well, there's a completely natural
[5612.56] system of subterranean cavities under
[5614.719] there that's been detected. Although,
[5616.96] looking at the initial uh data that's
[5620.239] come out, it does look like there is
[5622.08] some type of structural elements to it
[5624.8] that would be perhaps uh beyond what you
[5628.96] would expect from normal uh you know,
[5632.159] erosion, natural erosion. Uh, but it's
[5634.96] still a huge stretch. Uh, you know, as
[5637.52] as a builder and I think about the the
[5639.36] the distribution of structural forces,
[5641.84] I'm thinking, well, you know, I mean,
[5643.52] you put some of the heaviest structures
[5645.04] on Earth on top of gigantic cavities.
[5648.96] Does that make sense? That doesn't seem
[5650.88] to make sense to me. However, is there
[5653.04] something else going
[5654.76] on? Maybe. I, you know, I'm just I'm I'm
[5659.199] not going to commit to one way or the
[5661.04] other. I'm not going to immediately
[5662.4] dismiss it.
[5663.84] Now, one possibility I thought was,
[5666.32] well, my first impression was, well, if
[5669.76] humans went and actually had to carve
[5672.0] out these chambers, these exceptionally
[5675.12] large cylindrical chambers, my god, what
[5677.679] amount of work that would be. On the
[5679.84] other hand, if they could access caves,
[5682.639] I mean, we know that ancient peoples did
[5685.679] modify existing natural structures. And
[5689.12] there are one of the things that uh that
[5690.96] that Michael brought up is questions
[5692.88] that he had at the very
[5694.76] beginning. You know, are these natural?
[5697.28] Are they artificial meaning
[5699.36] anthropogenic? Or are they some
[5701.32] combination? Uh and I think that that's
[5704.239] a likely uh scenario for many of these
[5707.199] things that there were natural even with
[5709.199] Pilot Mountain. Was Pilot Mountain art
[5712.159] uh anthropogenically modified?
[5715.12] perhaps uh you know the the great sphinx
[5718.239] was probably originally a yardang that
[5720.56] was then anthropogenically modified and
[5723.199] sculpted into the so if you could gain
[5726.48] access to subterranean cavities and then
[5729.28] went in there and subsequently modified
[5731.36] them but again I don't know that's just
[5733.76] pure speculation on my part more and
[5736.48] we'll be speculating less come June 21st
[5738.96] no more speculate less okay question do
[5741.679] you guys know about Leuri Leuria have
[5744.4] you ever heard of that. Oh, yeah. Oh,
[5746.88] well, can you tell me anything cool
[5748.4] about it? Well, you know, I kind of I
[5752.32] would go with Graeme Hancock's version
[5754.159] of that is that it's, you know, the area
[5756.239] of down there in Indochina, the area
[5758.56] that we now know is under very much like
[5761.28] Bangia. Bangia is a true submerged land
[5765.52] uh thousands of square miles that were
[5768.239] part of the coastal plane that connected
[5770.08] Alaska to eastern Siberia and it's
[5772.719] underwater. Well, so is the area in
[5774.92] Indonesia, large areas, thousands of
[5777.44] square miles of Indonesia is now
[5780.12] submerged. And it's likely, not at all
[5783.52] unlikely, that that area could have or
[5785.92] was inhabited during glacial times. And
[5789.92] that hypothesis will be addressed
[5791.92] directly by Dr. Danny Hillman of Gdon
[5794.32] Badang, the archaeologist featured in
[5796.48] Ancient Apocalypse, who's coming from
[5798.639] Indonesia, and he is going to be
[5800.32] addressing directly the submergence of
[5802.88] Sunderland. Yeah, Sunderland. So, there
[5805.679] could actually be like a large land mass
[5808.0] in the like Indian Ocean that sank or
[5810.159] something like that pretty much.
[5812.96] Certainly, you know, when you say sank,
[5815.52] that that brings to my mind subsidance.
[5819.04] Okay, subside. But but but here's the
[5820.88] thing, Ashton. You can certainly have
[5822.96] the combination because rising sea level
[5825.92] creates weight that can cause vertical
[5828.239] tectonism and that could cause
[5829.92] subsidance and that's what I'm going to
[5832.4] be discussing more with Michael about is
[5834.88] the role of vertical tectonism at the
[5837.679] end of the last ice age. But it
[5839.92] certainly could have played a role in uh
[5842.32] in Indonesia. Um and and that subsidance
[5846.32] of course could be also a trigger for
[5849.92] accelerated volcanism. We do know now
[5852.96] that during this transition period of
[5855.52] about 3,000 years, there was some
[5858.159] extraordinary volcanic eruptions around
[5860.32] the world, which I think the consensus
[5862.48] is emerging that a lot of this volcanism
[5866.239] may have been triggered by this
[5868.76] inconceivable mass transfer of weight
[5871.679] that occurred on the uh to the geoid
[5874.4] with the transfer of the glacial masses
[5877.6] back into the ocean basins. And
[5880.0] primarily the the mass of of of the uh
[5883.04] late uh Wisconsin in the north in the
[5886.159] late uh Vashellian in the uh European
[5889.92] the majority of that water first fed
[5893.199] into the North Atlantic before it
[5897.239] uh distributed around the planet. Look
[5899.84] at there. Yeah, there we go. So the
[5901.44] yellow area would have been area that
[5903.6] was above sea level during the late
[5906.48] glacial maximum. So in other words, you
[5908.8] could have walked from Borneo to Sum
[5910.719] Sumatra to the Malay Peninsula.
[5914.159] Now could that have been the origin of
[5916.159] stories about Lamuria? I have not
[5919.119] studied into that to the extent that I
[5921.119] have looked into Atlantis. Uh I don't
[5924.48] know, you know, I mean to to the in my
[5926.88] mind Plato is a credible source.
[5929.44] Therefore, Atlantis has a credible
[5932.48] source. Uh Lamoreia, I don't know. I I
[5935.679] just don't know. I haven't looked into
[5936.96] it as much. We could certainly argue
[5939.679] from this right here that there are lost
[5941.6] lands, submerged lands in part of the
[5944.199] Pacific. Um, yeah, let me add some
[5947.52] interesting uh angle onto this. So, I
[5950.159] just weirdly was just re looking it up
[5952.239] and I found uh this post from a couple
[5953.92] days ago where somebody was talking
[5955.04] about La Muria saying it's it's a hidden
[5957.44] under in the ocean says that they uh
[5960.8] there's a stretch of ocean in the Indian
[5962.239] Ocean where commercial airlines avoid
[5963.92] flying routes that should be direct uh
[5966.32] such as from Eastern Africa to Western
[5968.32] Australia are instead rerouted thousands
[5970.56] of miles out of the way sometimes to the
[5972.159] Middle East or even Europe. A journey
[5974.0] should take 13 hours off and becomes 30.
[5975.679] Airlines never explain why. They don't
[5977.36] fly through this zone. I don't know if
[5978.56] that's true or not. Somebody fact check
[5979.92] that. They say at the center of this
[5982.32] no-fly zone lies Diego Garcia, a remote
[5985.119] at Atoll in the Indian Ocean owned by
[5986.719] the United Kingdom and leased to the
[5988.0] United States since 1960s. It houses one
[5990.32] of the most secretive military
[5991.36] installations in the entire world. No
[5993.199] civilian population is allowed. Even
[5995.199] military personnel stationed there are
[5996.56] forbidden from bringing their families.
[5998.239] The entire island is heavily guarded.
[5999.92] Independent access is impossible. So,
[6002.56] there's more about the lore of this
[6004.08] place, but like the the Chazo Chagosian
[6007.6] people, we basically like kicked them
[6009.76] out, like killed all their like pets and
[6012.32] just displaced them. It became this huge
[6014.08] humanitarian thing. And that's why now
[6016.8] we're apparently like giving it back,
[6018.719] but we're not really. We're still
[6020.32] keeping the base or something like that.
[6022.08] So, you guys can actually go look in the
[6023.44] news. This has been recent. So, this is
[6026.0] the reason why I wanted to ask you guys
[6028.159] about it because it says, here's the
[6029.199] lore. It was once believed to be a lost
[6031.28] continent that connected India,
[6032.8] Madagascar, and Australia. So, Indonesia
[6035.04] would be right there, right? Early
[6036.719] geologists hypothesized its existence
[6038.56] after finding similar fossils along
[6040.48] those different regions. So, they were
[6042.32] finding fossils that look the same in
[6043.679] these continents that shouldn't be
[6044.719] connected. You know, they're super far
[6046.36] apart. Um, so they uh ancient Tamil's
[6050.719] tests text suggested the Camuri Candom,
[6053.76] a vast southern land mass that sank
[6055.6] beneath the ocean. So, some records uh
[6058.159] describe the people as highly advanced
[6059.679] with knowledge of electromagnetism,
[6061.04] telepathy, and ocean oceanic energy. Um,
[6064.08] others say that they were partially
[6065.28] amphibious. So, anyway, that's just some
[6067.84] lore to go along with it. I just think
[6069.119] it's a fun little Diego Garcia. I mean,
[6071.36] there's some people in the chat bringing
[6072.56] this up, but they're talking about the
[6074.4] weather manipulation that uh I guess
[6076.719] that's part of the lore conspiracy about
[6078.639] Diego Garcia. You've done some some
[6081.36] research on this, Ashton. I mean, give
[6083.52] us some hints as what's going on there.
[6085.28] What do you think? Oh man, they have to
[6088.4] have something underground. That's what
[6089.679] freaks me out about this cuz I'm like
[6091.52] they literally have to have an
[6092.639] underground base there. If you go look
[6094.0] at the surface of it, it's just there's
[6095.6] no big buildings. So where is
[6097.36] everything? It's like they have a funny
[6101.04] little thing. My family had an
[6102.48] international construction company for
[6104.159] decades, right? My father traveled all
[6106.0] around the world. Grew up going to the
[6107.199] Middle East and stuff and they bid
[6109.04] Howard Construction bid on Diego Garcia
[6112.32] and lost. But they didn't build anything
[6115.44] above ground. And I found it was all
[6119.04] underground infrastructure early in the
[6121.119] investigation. Whatever they were
[6122.159] bidding out then it was underground from
[6125.119] the horse's mouth. The first and
[6127.679] Katherine Fitz was saying too to uh
[6130.239] Tucker Carlson recently that they this
[6132.159] is where some of that black money that
[6134.0] or the unaccounted money from the audits
[6136.48] has been going is these underground
[6138.159] bases. And I'm just sitting there going
[6139.92] Diego Garcia is the perfect thing for
[6141.6] it. And it would be cheap, too, because
[6143.76] they're just going to pull in labor from
[6145.52] Philippines and and India and stuff like
[6147.28] that that's super cheap. And none of
[6149.76] those people like the value of life on
[6151.92] sadly is super low. So none of those
[6154.0] people would ever talk again about what
[6155.199] they saw and what they built. Um yeah,
[6158.36] probably Philippine laborers and the
[6161.199] that company had a thousand Philippine
[6162.719] laborers in Cairo building the water
[6165.04] treatment plant in Cairo. They would go
[6166.88] get Filipino
[6169.04] I don't still don't get it. Filipino
[6171.92] move them to Cairo.
[6174.4] Some people who are watching wouldn't
[6175.76] believe the the the humanitarian
[6178.239] situation in Southeast Asia. But uh
[6180.159] aside the point in terms of what they
[6181.679] have in Diego Garcia, it's a great place
[6183.76] to test stuff. I think that anything
[6185.44] they had in Area 51 in the '9s, they
[6187.679] just moved Diego Garcia. I mean, there's
[6189.36] in the middle of nowhere. Why worry
[6191.52] about people seeing it? You can test
[6193.44] anything. Dig, you'd have to dig coral
[6195.52] and then seal off, right? You don't have
[6198.88] I don't know. Maybe there's some bedrock
[6200.48] there below the coral. Whatever. I'm
[6202.159] sure they could figure it out if all
[6203.36] that's going on. That's the big question
[6205.199] is what is under there? Is it just rock?
[6207.119] Is there something else? But the other
[6208.719] thing too is they definitely have a lot
[6210.32] of uh like you know telescope sensors.
[6213.28] They have these special I think it's
[6215.199] some kind of electrol optical type uh
[6217.36] sensor. It's in part of some kind of
[6218.88] relay that they have that's um
[6220.96] worldwide. This is why I was so
[6222.56] surprised that we were allowing the UK
[6225.44] to give the land back. This location is
[6228.4] like super important. If you look at it
[6230.32] on a map, it's just ocean everywhere
[6232.0] else. And this is like our link to to
[6233.84] like keep an eye on China from that
[6235.92] angle. So, the fact we were willing to
[6237.92] give it back says something's a foot.
[6240.159] And I'm going to throw one last thing
[6241.52] out here and I'm going to have to drop
[6242.48] in a minute, which is I think we've
[6244.48] moved everything to space. We don't care
[6246.88] about groundbased bases anymore for the
[6248.639] same reasons we used to. We used to care
[6250.32] about all these groundbased bases to
[6251.52] keep radar on everybody, but now we're
[6253.04] just doing it from satellites in space.
[6256.08] Interesting. Interesting. Interesting
[6258.159] take. You are one interesting dude,
[6259.679] Ashton. Heck yeah, Ashton. Heck yeah.
[6262.32] Would you want any right
[6265.679] number 27 or 30? That's right. Man, we
[6268.159] got a lot to account for. Keep in mind,
[6270.56] George, that Ashton is from Minnesota.
[6273.199] So, Oh, he has to be right. Real and I
[6277.199] represent North Carolina. Okay. I don't
[6280.56] know what that means, but yeah, you can
[6283.44] have good security at this. Uh, Right,
[6285.44] George.
[6287.36] I don't know. You look under your car
[6288.96] before you leave for work. Yeah, please
[6291.04] don't endanger everybody else. I have
[6292.8] one of those mirror things, you know.
[6294.08] You just look under your car. Just It's
[6295.84] just a big safety precaution. Do that in
[6297.52] the center. I did that. I've done some
[6298.88] of that. We're staying in different
[6301.119] hotels, right? Yeah. We cash it in the
[6304.4] mall across the street. Right. I'm going
[6307.04] to switch hotel room. Malcolm Bendall
[6308.719] wanted a room high enough that you
[6310.48] couldn't get a shot in that you'd have
[6312.159] to point too far up, you know, like the
[6314.48] higher you are, the less likely you are
[6316.239] to Unless you're on Pilot Mountain.
[6319.04] Yeah, that's right. That's right. Well,
[6321.84] Ashen, thanks so much, man. Thanks for
[6323.679] jumping on. I'm looking forward to
[6324.8] seeing you guys in a few weeks. All
[6326.4] right, man. I'm joining you
[6328.84] shortly. Oh, you're still here? Yeah.
[6331.6] Whenever you uh we can you can join
[6333.6] whenever you want. We can talk. I I'm
[6334.96] just gonna be doing science stuff
[6336.48] tonight. What time do you start? Uh 7
[6339.679] o'clock central, 8 o'clock Eastern. So,
[6341.36] okay. Send me a link and I'll jump in.
[6342.639] Here you go. Little shout out for Ashton
[6344.4] here. He's going on live on X and
[6347.04] YouTube here in a couple hours. Yeah.
[6350.88] Cool. Thanks, guys. Bye. Awesome. See
[6352.96] you, Ashton. Thank you. You know, it's
[6355.119] so funny how not funny, but it's
[6356.96] peculiar how all of these things connect
[6358.96] so naturally, right? We're talking about
[6361.239] Atlantis and then we're talking about
[6363.36] the pyramids and the Giza Plateau and
[6365.679] then we're talking about I guess plasma
[6368.48] technology to Diego Garcia to everything
[6372.28] happen to Laamria. Exactly. That's why I
[6374.96] call it a constellation of subjects.
[6376.8] It's like a bunch of little dot separate
[6378.639] dots but when you look at them at the
[6380.32] same time you're like these things seem
[6382.88] to fit. You know what do you think they
[6385.119] fit into George? I know that's what
[6386.96] we're trying to figure out.
[6389.119] We're going to know a lot more June
[6390.4] 21st. At least we know where Atlantis
[6392.159] is. Atlantis. And then we'll know a lot
[6394.88] more about the pyramids, too. We'll know
[6396.239] a lot more about it. And then we got the
[6397.44] vases coming up. We got the largest
[6398.96] collection of pre-dynastic Egyptian
[6400.48] vases outside of Sakara since Aman
[6402.4] Hotep. Stuck them in the basement. Yeah.
[6405.04] Yeah. So, we probably we haven't talked
[6406.56] about that much. Randall, you've seen
[6408.639] the vases. You've been down to see Matt
[6411.04] Bell in in Florida and you've seen a
[6413.84] large amount of the vases. I mean, what
[6415.36] do you make of these peculiar objects?
[6417.36] We're going to have 65 of them there or
[6419.119] something like that. Well, they are
[6421.44] elegant and obviously they're very
[6424.159] precisionely crafted. Uh I'm not an
[6428.08] expert to to conclusively rule out that
[6431.28] they were not made by human hands, but
[6434.159] it seems
[6435.32] unlikely. Uh you know, my my first
[6438.639] introduction to the vases was Ben Van
[6440.56] Kirkwick, who will be at the summit,
[6443.199] right? He's going to be there, right?
[6445.52] Uh, is he gonna be talking with Matt?
[6448.4] Are they doing a co-presentation or
[6450.56] they're doing separate presentations?
[6452.56] So, Matt is going to be talking
[6455.88] on Saturday morning. He's going to be on
[6458.719] the main stage and then Ben is going to
[6460.719] be talking on Sunday afternoon around
[6464.239] 3:30 there. So, they have two separate
[6466.08] presentations. But after Matt finishes
[6469.52] his talk, he's going to go into a
[6473.199] separate room and have a breakout
[6474.719] session with a a load of pre-dynastic
[6478.08] vases and people can talk with him, take
[6480.239] pictures with them. I believe Ben will
[6482.32] be in that room as well. People can ask
[6484.239] him questions. So, there'll be a
[6486.239] community of experts on these on these
[6488.639] objects.
[6491.199] Okay. I'm also very much looking forward
[6494.08] to the presentation by Dallas Abbott.
[6497.119] Yeah, man. I've been following her work
[6499.119] for for decades now. Mega tsunamis kind
[6502.08] of kind of matches up with Michael a
[6504.08] little. There you go again. Yeah. Big
[6506.4] waves. And that's something, you know,
[6509.199] it's trying to get a comprehensive model
[6511.36] of, you know,
[6513.08] catastrophism. I've been last few years
[6515.6] really looking at evidence for enormous
[6518.719] tsunamis. And I love the subject, man.
[6521.84] And in Dallas, you know, she is a PhD
[6524.32] from Columbia University at the Lamont
[6526.4] Dory Earth Observatory Laboratory or
[6529.6] whatever. It's one of the number one
[6531.119] geology labs in the world in Colombia. I
[6534.159] mean, this is not a nothing woo going on
[6537.04] here.
[6538.56] From big waves in the old days. Oh,
[6541.28] yeah. I mean her her work on Madagascar
[6543.44] wave shows that um that looks like that
[6546.32] one of the tsunamis that made landfall
[6549.04] on uh southern Madagascar was minimum of
[6552.639] 600 foot. Yeah, it's chilling. Yeah. And
[6556.159] it's obvious as hell when you look. I
[6558.4] mean it's a great subject. Thanks for
[6560.32] bringing it up. Dallas is terrific, man.
[6563.28] Yeah.
[6565.239] Yeah. Okay, guys. You know, it reminds
[6568.159] me a little bit of a I I
[6571.119] Sorry. No, no. I just uh reminded um I'd
[6575.76] seen an interview one time and it was
[6578.36] with a uh an anthropologist who has
[6581.6] since passed away, a Belgian lady, and
[6584.719] the talk was very fascinating. It was
[6587.36] one of those TED talks. Um, and her
[6592.0] whole study throughout her career had
[6593.92] been to try to find to to to understand
[6598.0] the origins of humans connection with
[6601.32] water. And her argument was that our
[6604.639] very
[6605.8] physiology is a result of our
[6608.4] relationship with water. And this one of
[6611.76] the biggest differences between other
[6613.36] primates and ourselves is that we we
[6617.679] live 95% of us live next to a body of
[6620.639] water, whether that's the ocean front or
[6622.8] rivers or lakes. And and her arguments
[6626.0] were fascinating. everything from our
[6627.92] lack of hair and some of us um and uh
[6631.92] and the fact that we walk straight up uh
[6635.719] because one of her arguments was that
[6638.32] primates only stand upright when they're
[6640.639] carrying their young or when they're
[6643.119] waiting waist deep through water. Um,
[6646.8] and all of these bring us back to this
[6650.08] realization that we are close to water.
[6652.32] And if there's ever a serious inbound
[6654.96] catastrophe like a tsunami, we're
[6657.679] screwed.
[6659.92] Yeah. Over and over and over again, this
[6661.679] has been happening. Well, and then you
[6663.6] you bear in mind that if we if we just
[6665.28] look at the rise of modern civilization,
[6667.04] where did the first great cities emerge?
[6669.119] They merged uh in river valleys and
[6671.4] coastlines. and and we can now
[6674.0] demonstrate that well hey I mean so if
[6675.92] you're going back to lake glacial
[6677.199] maximum every coastline in the world is
[6679.119] at least 400 ft underwater uh and almost
[6683.28] every river valley that I've
[6684.84] investigated has uh is consistent with
[6687.84] there being enormously augmented
[6691.0] discharges during this transition phase.
[6693.76] So, anything, you know, what I was
[6695.6] looking at out out there, uh, following
[6698.639] the snake last week, um, you know, you
[6701.119] see the modern Snake River is a small
[6702.96] little ribbon, uh, but it flows in a in
[6706.08] a gigantic channel that's that carried
[6709.679] discharges that were at least 700 times
[6712.4] greater than the modern snake. Uh, my
[6715.679] early epiphany of all of this way back
[6718.159] when I was a dumb teenager in
[6721.48] 1969 was seeing the modern Minnesota
[6724.159] River flowing in a gigantic cavernous
[6726.639] valley uh that just seems so out of out
[6729.76] of size outsized compared to the modern
[6732.56] river. Only later, probably two decades
[6735.36] later, did I learn that there was now an
[6737.639] accepted explanation for that and it was
[6740.48] the uh southern outlet of uh glacial
[6742.96] lake Agaze and that discharge point.
[6745.679] Interestingly, I brought Graham Hancock
[6747.52] to that discharge point. Um if you look
[6750.48] on a map of the United States and look
[6752.639] at uh Minnesota where it abuts North and
[6756.159] South Dakota, you'll see this bump right
[6758.4] there that even as a kid, I remember
[6760.0] looking at maps and going, "What? Why is
[6761.599] that? Why is there a bump there? Why
[6763.44] wouldn't you just Wouldn't it be easier
[6764.639] just to make a straight line? Well, it
[6766.0] turns out that bump is precisely the
[6768.159] southern outlet of this gigantic glacial
[6770.8] meltwater lake. Um and it flowed out and
[6773.92] it carved the valley that is a
[6776.639] tributary. Yeah, there it is right
[6778.239] there. Um it that created a tributary to
[6781.92] the uh Minne to the M excuse me,
[6784.639] Mississippi River. Uh and and you can
[6787.679] actually see look zoom in there. Is that
[6789.84] you Becket? That's me. Yeah. Okay. Now,
[6792.719] pan down a little bit and you'll see the
[6795.76] There it is. You can see the valley. You
[6797.679] see, uh, Monteidio. You see? So, that's
[6800.56] the valley of the of the modern
[6802.4] Minnesota River. But if you zoom in on
[6804.56] that, go ahead and zoom in. Uh, and then
[6808.4] switch over to zoom in a little more.
[6811.599] And then zoom into terrain view down
[6815.119] there. Lower left. Not
[6817.4] not Yeah, there we go. Okay. So, now
[6820.4] Yes. pan down slightly and you can see a
[6822.719] beautiful example of what's called an
[6824.48] underfit river. You see the modern m
[6827.119] Minnesota river is just a small little
[6829.44] ribbon flowing in a much bigger valley.
[6832.239] Well, that was not created millions of
[6834.56] years of erosion. That was created in a
[6836.8] geological instant by this outburst.
[6840.32] Yeah. By the outburst of glacial uh lake
[6842.84] Agaze. And uh that river that volume of
[6847.119] flow peaked was 4,000 times greater than
[6850.639] the modern Minnesota river that flows in
[6853.36] that valley. Well, here's the thing.
[6855.76] Virtually every river on Earth has this
[6858.88] kind of evidence of enormously augmented
[6861.8] discharges. So if you had a community, a
[6864.32] village, a settlement, even a city along
[6866.88] an ancient river valley, it's probably
[6870.4] completely erased out of existence. as
[6873.52] would be any urban complex, any
[6875.92] settlement, any village along a late
[6878.599] glacial coastline of the
[6881.639] world. So, that's something that needs
[6884.32] to be kept in mind. And I I'm afraid
[6886.159] that a lot of archaeologists just don't
[6888.639] have a concept of how extreme this
[6891.84] geomorphic remodeling of the earth's
[6893.84] surface was between, say, 11,000 and 14
[6897.52] or 15,000 years ago. And that's not even
[6900.32] counting earlier like the the expansion
[6904.08] of the glaciers between 20 and 25,000
[6906.88] years ago or the previous interglacial
[6909.76] and the previous glacial etc. So I mean
[6913.199] the surface of the earth Michael said it
[6915.52] earlier he made the he made the
[6917.28] reference to scars. Well, once you
[6920.239] recognize it and you understand the the
[6923.159] geomorphic evidence, you realize that
[6925.36] the whole planetary surface is covered
[6927.92] in scars of ancient catastrophes. And
[6931.44] this is has to be factored in when we
[6933.28] start thinking about ancient
[6934.96] civilizations and what our our ancestors
[6937.679] may have been doing, you know, 15, 20,
[6940.0] 30,000 years ago. If we don't take that,
[6942.48] if we don't put it within that context,
[6944.88] there's no way we're going to come to
[6946.32] any kind of a realistic understanding of
[6948.32] what may or may not have been possible.
[6952.32] And you said it earlier. You talked
[6954.159] about different scars. You talked about
[6956.159] mega tsunamis. You talked about a whole
[6959.199] lot of other geological and geographical
[6962.159] features that we should be looking out
[6963.76] for. What were you saying, Michael?
[6968.48] Well, it's like everything Randall says
[6971.28] is so is so um connected with what we're
[6975.44] finding here. One such example is
[6978.639] there's um a sedimentary layer that has
[6983.04] been deposited within since the last ice
[6986.0] age along this coastline of a very rich
[6990.08] orange soil. Soil analysis reveals that
[6994.56] that soil actually comes from several
[6998.32] kilometers inland. Um actually more than
[7001.599] several kilometers inland. You have to
[7003.28] know the geography, but basically it's
[7005.44] called the Riotento River. The Riotento
[7008.08] means the colored river because it it's
[7010.48] where the Rioento mines are. And so
[7013.52] there are deposits of all sorts of
[7015.679] minerals and whatnot making that sand
[7017.679] extremely red. What it shows that the
[7021.04] fact that we have deposits chaotic
[7023.199] deposit not stratified deposit. So
[7026.639] something deposited this soil in a
[7029.36] massive sudden way.
[7032.4] So what had happened is it appears the
[7034.48] water came in in masses that we can only
[7037.52] imagine from the ocean made its way all
[7041.04] the way inland
[7043.04] collected into in inland lakes of of uh
[7048.08] of stationary water which would have
[7050.48] then broken back the opposite way
[7054.0] bringing back all of this other
[7055.599] sediment. And the the strange the the
[7058.8] amazing element that we found is
[7061.199] embedded in this orange soil are
[7065.239] man-made structures.
[7067.76] So when are those
[7069.639] from? That's the question. It's like uh
[7072.88] a recurring theme throughout this
[7074.719] coastline.
[7076.119] Devastation, society collapses, comes
[7079.199] back around again. Another devastating
[7082.08] event occurs.
[7083.92] There's an amazing story because you
[7085.76] have tsunamis. We're in the front line
[7088.0] for tsunami impact on the Atlantic
[7090.48] coastline of Iberia and the last serious
[7095.119] earthquake was in 1755, the uh Lisbon
[7098.639] earthquake um which caused an enormous
[7101.92] amount of tsunamis to make their way to
[7104.48] this
[7105.32] coastline. And this is 1755. So just a
[7110.48] couple hundred years ago. A few hundred
[7112.96] years ago, the people from Chipiona,
[7116.32] from this town, said that when they
[7119.679] witnessed the waters retrie retrieving,
[7122.56] retreating
[7124.199] retreating, they saw peering a city out
[7127.679] in the middle of the ocean. And I'm
[7129.599] certain that's the same structures that
[7131.28] we've been finding. But it just goes to
[7133.84] show it's regularly occurring problem
[7136.4] that we as a as a
[7138.36] species need to face if we hope to. I
[7141.44] don't think it's a survivable problem.
[7143.76] It's a problem that seems to have have
[7146.719] caused us a reset every single time.
[7151.52] Well, if there's any crowd that's going
[7153.04] to ring the bells and sound the alarms
[7155.44] to get us to do something to survive it,
[7158.08] it's going to be this one and hopefully
[7160.4] it starts in June. Past is prologue.
[7163.84] Well said. So, we're we're at we've been
[7165.92] on for almost exactly two hours here. If
[7169.76] we can get a few questions in the chat
[7172.56] over the next five minutes about Cosmic
[7175.28] Summit, about any of the presentations,
[7177.199] any questions you guys have for George,
[7178.96] Michael, or Randall, I'll fire those
[7182.4] off, but we're going to start winding
[7184.0] this Yeah, we're going to start winding
[7186.08] this thing down. So, uh, I mean, George,
[7188.719] something that I think is important to
[7191.28] to talk about here that people might not
[7193.76] know about about you is cosmic summit
[7197.76] did not start your cosmic journey and
[7201.04] you've been doing this research for a
[7202.8] very very long time and you've had
[7204.88] cosmic tusk and I think people often
[7208.04] overlook the amount of knowledge that
[7210.639] the amount of wisdom that you have on
[7212.08] these subjects. So given that I was
[7214.719] eclipsed by Randall Carlson early in my
[7218.0] science communication. Well, maybe if
[7219.52] you had a beard like that. That's right,
[7221.76] George. Just blame me. Go ahead. Just
[7224.08] blame me for took up the head space and
[7226.48] then I had to figure out another way to
[7228.32] grift.
[7231.199] Well, I'm trying to remember when George
[7233.04] I encountered you. It had to have been
[7234.96] when I was researching for the
[7237.119] documentary that I consulted in called
[7239.76] Fire from the Sky. And that's where I
[7242.159] first encountered your name. And that
[7243.92] had to have been like as early as 1996.
[7246.639] Is that possible? 9697. 9697. Yeah. And
[7250.159] I thought, okay, who is this guy? That's
[7252.88] right. I was like, is this guy down in
[7255.04] Georgia? He's kind of stepping on my
[7257.04] toes here. Yeah. And then it boom, he
[7260.48] goes on Roan. It's like, holy [ __ ]
[7262.48] Well, somebody damn rung the bell, you
[7264.32] know? And I love it. You're a better
[7266.0] communicator than I am. And you actually
[7267.679] know a good deal more. So whatever. I
[7270.0] ain't even trying to play peer, but we
[7272.239] have both been in it a long time. And I
[7274.56] published with the Comet Research Group.
[7276.08] That was kind of my lane for a long time
[7277.599] going on podcasts is that I was kind of
[7279.76] the the pajama scientist with these real
[7281.96] PhDs. And then the Cosmic Summit became,
[7284.56] you know, did this. So, you know, now I
[7286.88] got a couple lanes and they're crossing
[7288.56] and Well, you know, it seems like the
[7290.4] cosmic summit is a natural outgrowth of
[7293.04] your 20 multiple decades of work and
[7296.32] research in this area. It is. But
[7298.4] thanks, Becket. Yeah. I'm not purely a
[7300.0] pitchman, you know that I I But you know
[7302.96] what happens though? The cosmic summit,
[7305.119] it literally takes up my brain space to
[7307.119] go research all the stuff I love. Like
[7309.199] the Tartesians, Michael's talking about
[7311.199] am I going to go do three hours of work
[7312.96] on the Tartessians tomorrow? No, I'm
[7315.28] going to go do Cosmic Summit stuff. But
[7317.44] that's fine. You know, that's just given
[7319.119] to the cause and I don't need to know
[7320.96] any more [ __ ] you know, whatever. So
[7323.36] why already figured out the Tartessians?
[7325.76] Why is it so important that you are
[7327.92] you've decided to take your focus away
[7329.84] from that for this cause?
[7332.639] Oh, it's just it it kind of matches the
[7335.84] original um I guess life goal was to
[7339.199] just make this stuff more publicized to
[7340.8] make it public and fun and a part of
[7342.88] people's understanding of the past,
[7344.639] right? And that started with a blog, you
[7346.96] know, just little steps. And then now
[7348.639] it's grown into something where we're
[7349.84] trying to actually get people together,
[7351.84] which I think is important because it is
[7354.08] such an internet centric community. A
[7357.04] lot of things on the internet grew from
[7359.52] Meatspace and then they become a thing
[7361.199] and you keep keep in touch with me
[7362.88] people on the internet. This is one of
[7364.32] those where you're taking a community
[7365.599] that built itself on the internet and
[7367.679] trying to give it a physical hold
[7369.599] somewhere in a temporal point during the
[7372.0] year, which is going to be the solstice.
[7375.04] So, you know, you know, it's just spread
[7377.44] the word stuff and and thank goodness
[7379.679] for Joe Rogan and Brandle Carlson and
[7382.08] Graham Hancock and people who have have
[7384.4] done such a good job in the last 10
[7385.76] years of popularizing it. Um, because
[7388.159] you could fit us all in a minibus that
[7389.92] knew about the ice age comet in 2005 and
[7392.96] now there are millions of people that
[7394.159] do. So, that's just a wonderful thing to
[7396.159] watch and glad to have a part in it.
[7398.8] Yeah. And I mean I I made the comment
[7400.48] that you know probably you could count
[7402.56] the the number of people on on your
[7405.599] fingers and toes 15 years ago that knew
[7408.719] the term younger dus. Oh yeah. Yeah.
[7411.679] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. And um
[7413.92] and now it's showing up. I'm seeing it
[7415.44] in internet chats and you know Facebook
[7417.76] people are talking about it and all of
[7419.44] that. Um and you get a kind of a a
[7422.96] feeling that it's a little unstoppable
[7424.48] now which is nice. Back in the old days
[7426.48] it was like ah I got to keep running my
[7427.92] mouth and Randle's got to keep running
[7429.119] his mouth and I hope Graham writes
[7430.32] another book you know whatever you you
[7433.28] think it could blink out and that's
[7434.719] still a little bit true for the science
[7436.08] side we've got a we need a stronger
[7437.84] bench we got a great bench but we need
[7439.52] more people that are doing the you know
[7441.84] the forensic research but that'll come
[7444.48] particularly if the public is interested
[7446.639] at some point the massive amount of
[7448.719] public interest is going to result in
[7450.8] say a unconventional new president
[7453.28] saying hey let's put some money in this
[7455.119] thing or someone down the chain saying,
[7457.28] "Hey, let's put 10 million out." Could
[7458.639] you rule the whole damn thing in or out
[7460.48] the younger dice event for with a
[7462.239] properly constrained and planned and
[7465.44] whatever study of shallow archaeological
[7468.48] argrading soils around the world and you
[7470.88] go test for the proxies is tedious as
[7472.719] hell, but for 10 million you could rule
[7474.239] the whole thing in or out. Well, I I've
[7476.239] often, you know, in the last decade or
[7478.159] so thought, you know, in terms of, you
[7480.56] know, the the literal
[7482.52] shoestring of of finances that this
[7485.28] whole thing has been conducted on is so
[7488.0] out of proportion to its long-term
[7490.08] importance and significance to our
[7491.92] future that it's it's it's just crazy.
[7494.96] They'll never get over it. And the
[7496.639] attention that it's getting now is a
[7498.639] little bit of a substitute for bemoning
[7500.48] the lack of money and serious academic
[7503.52] and research interest.
[7505.28] So, at least you got the attention.
[7507.04] Maybe that somewhere then connects to
[7510.239] the beast out there, big science, you
[7512.4] know. Um, it'll it'll get there. It's
[7515.52] all very promising. There are a lot of
[7517.119] people that labor in obscure science
[7519.28] subjects, Randall, that they want to
[7520.88] publicize that don't get the attention
[7522.719] that our favorite subjects have gotten.
[7524.639] Yeah. So, we're very lucky within our
[7526.599] lifetimes, not to be too dramatic, but
[7529.28] to see the thing start to take off. Love
[7532.239] it. Yeah, man. It's taking off. It's
[7534.8] taking off. Okay. And hopefully it's
[7537.199] cool. Old friend and new friend, Michael
[7539.119] Donalan and um Randall Carlson. Man,
[7541.36] it's great. Awesome. And there'll be a
[7543.36] lot of old friends and I got to tell
[7545.599] you, it's it's a it's a real pleasure to
[7548.8] be be talking to you guys. Randall, I've

[7576.32] that we could go on about. Y there's so
[7578.88] much to talk about. There's so much to

[7853.679] until the summit. Really? Hey, I got one
[7856.0] more program note. got to do it or Steph
[7857.76] would kill me. That
[7860.679] the hotel rooms are running out. The
[7863.44] cheap hotel rooms, it's just a fact.
[7865.599] This hotel is sold out. It's heading for
[7867.679] a sellout between our event and two
[7869.679] other events that are there. And we
[7871.76] can't guarantee a discount beyond the
[7875.28] the 29th of this month. So that's about
[7877.76] a week away, a little bit less, right?
[7880.239] So So secure your hotel room now. Tell
[7883.599] them you're with Cosmic Summit. It's 179
[7885.92] bucks. And if you don't get one, please
[7889.199] still tell them we're with Cosmic Summit
[7891.36] or, you know, um because it it takes off
[7893.92] of the number of hotel rooms I got to
[7895.36] buy, which is 860. Okay? And uh yeah, so
[7900.32] pay attention to your hotel room, make
[7902.079] your reservation, tell them you're with
[7903.52] Cosmo Summit. It's 179 bucks. It's a
[7905.76] luxury hotel. It's going to be a great
[7907.36] experience. So that's and that's that's
[7909.36] a we had a bunch of questions on our
[7912.96] social media about the venue. Corey
[7916.0] Convention Center is a part of the Four
[7919.44] Season Sheridan or whatever way you want
[7921.52] to say that. The hotel is a part of
[7923.84] where the event is. So you can go into
[7926.239] the Sheridan and get your room. You'll
[7928.88] never have to leave. You'll be able to
[7930.159] walk around the corner. It's a huge
[7932.48] hotel and go into all the special events
[7935.52] except for the Pilot Mountain. Then you
[7936.96] got to get a vir 72 hours and you'd
[7939.44] never know. Exactly. Yeah, that was one
[7942.0] I was commenting recently at some of the
[7943.84] conferences I've done lately in the last
[7946.079] year besides Cosmic Summit where the
[7949.079] accommodations and the venue are in two
[7951.599] different locations and I was commenting
[7954.56] how much more convenient it was to have
[7957.92] it all under one roof. Thank you. I
[7960.48] thought that in business conventions
[7962.48] throughout my career, you got to if you
[7964.239] get it under one roof, that's part of
[7965.599] why we're doing this. the largest hotel
[7966.96] in North Carolina. It's the largest
[7969.04] conference center between DC and
[7970.56] Atlanta. Large may turn people off, but
[7972.719] you and the owner, what what's our
[7974.56] friend's name? I forgot. Um Kelly Kelly
[7976.88] Harold. Kelly. Yeah, I I really liked
[7979.44] Kelly. Oh, he they were thrilled to meet
[7982.0] you. Him him and his wife, Kelly Corey
[7983.84] Harold, who you know owns the hotel. And
[7987.36] um they they are super fans of this
[7989.84] stuff. I'll just say it again. People
[7991.04] may have heard me say it, but it's very
[7992.8] weird. Out of all the people I know in
[7994.4] North Carolina stuff, my number one
[7996.32] friend that's the biggest into this
[7999.119] stuff more than any other personal
[8000.719] friend I have happened to own the
[8003.84] largest hotel in the state. Wow. Yeah.
[8006.48] And that that's a blessing right there
[8008.719] off the bat because that makes the
[8010.239] negotiating for the contract and all
[8011.84] that you're doing it with a dude that
[8013.04] you've known for 40 years, you know, not
[8015.76] wife. Yeah. One of the differences again
[8018.159] that I've noticed is in other
[8019.679] conferences in other hotels, you know,
[8021.36] you, you know, they, you know, the
[8023.76] owners and managers of the hotels, it's
[8026.639] just, you know, it's just another event.
[8029.04] It's nothing special. They don't really
[8031.28] care about the content. It's just, you
[8033.28] know, let's do some business. But I get
[8035.199] a completely different uh feeling with
[8037.28] Kelly that, you know, hey, he's really
[8040.88] into this. and and everybody from the
[8043.04] door man to the fry cook to the head of
[8045.28] sales is fired up at the Sheridan for
[8048.32] the Cosmic Summit and they do a lot of
[8050.239] hosting around that hotel. Yeah, they
[8052.719] really cool to have us. My my feeling
[8054.96] was Yeah, I I really like do you know
[8058.079] giving our business to these people? I
[8061.04] do too. It's got a good vibe to it.
[8062.88] Thanks. It does. Good people, good
[8065.36] place, and a hell of a crowd.
[8068.56] All right, everyone. Get your tickets.
[8070.239] See you there. Thanks, Randall. Thanks,
[8071.92] Michael. All right. Good to talk to you,
[8073.92] Michael. Look forward to meeting you in
[8075.599] person in in about a month.
[8078.8] Really looking forward. I really, really
[8081.04] look forward to it. Thank you, guys. And
[8083.199] George,
[8084.88] like I said, if your daughter's if your
[8089.199] if your daughter is here with her
[8090.719] friends, my my my wife and I'll be super
[8093.84] happy to show her Kadith. Thanks for
[8095.44] reminding me, Michael. Absolutely.
[8096.56] She'll be there in Kadis next week.
[8098.079] Quite a weird coincidence. That is the
[8099.599] week before the summit and she will be
[8100.88] at the summit. So we're going to steep
[8102.4] her deeper
[8104.239] and
[8106.719] right then when she's arriving begins
[8108.96] the fia of San Lucer which is the big
[8112.0] fair. They take it real serious. That
[8113.28] may be while the the young Spanish like
[8115.28] to party. So okay we we'll touch base.
[8118.079] Oh well they're gonna they came to the
[8119.599] right time. Okay. Okay. Randall can't
[8122.159] wait to see you. Becket. Thank you.
[8123.92] Georgei.
[8126.56] All right, guys.
[8128.96] I'll talk to you soon, Becket, over the
[8131.599] weekend. Talk to you all soon.

Title: How Icebergs Shaped the Prairie
[0.08] the icebergs melting. When the flood
[2.399] waters finally relax, the iceberg comes
[5.839] to ground. The launching of this process
[8.32] would have been catastrophic, almost
[10.16] beyond imagination, because you've got
[12.08] to simultaneously rip gigantic boulders
[15.599] off the shoulders of these mountains,
[18.16] megalo them onto the ice sheet while the
[21.199] ice sheet is being fractured into a
[23.199] million icebergs, and melt the water
[25.84] that's now going to float those
[27.119] icebergs. All of that's happening
[29.76] simultaneous virtually. Wow. The end
[32.559] process great rushing flood is sweeping
[35.079] along in this case to the south. Iceberg
[38.239] comes to ground. Flood finally drains
[41.04] off. Now that iceberg, huge iceberg
[44.0] probably is going to take years to melt
[46.32] away. So the final stage of this process
[49.6] as it's melting away this big cargo of
[51.92] this giant rock is just slowly sinking
[54.32] down and then it sits onto the landscape
[57.12] which is basically soft because it's
[59.84] saturated with water. Right? So now it
[62.559] sinks and now it transforms into the
[65.28] modern plary.

Title: Was the Pyramid a Power Device?
[0.0] I don't know. Maybe it's a coincidence.
[1.52] What does that mean? I don't know. Other
[4.0] than the fact that is there a hint that
[6.96] there may be some kind of a function
[9.519] there to the Great Pyramid that involves
[12.96] There's many theories that the pyramid
[14.559] was a power plant. I'm sure you're
[15.839] definitely Yeah. Yeah. But this might
[18.16] support that. I don't know because I
[20.4] learned that and I thought, well, wait a
[21.76] second,
[23.88] 51.84, I've seen that before. Right.
[27.279] What do you make of the theories like
[29.439] the the Giza power plant theory? I
[31.599] haven't really studied it. You know, I I
[33.52] don't like to present opinions on things
[35.44] that I haven't really studied into. But
[38.0] is it possible that somehow this was
[39.92] involved in the utilization of plasma
[42.0] energy?

Title: Why the Missouri River Is Trapped
[0.0] The modern Missouri River will never go
[2.159] out of this channel unless it gets deep
[4.319] enough to overflow the divide, which it
[6.72] probably will not anytime in the near
[9.12] future because what's missing is 4 or 5
[12.32] million cubic miles of ice immediately
[14.24] to the north. But yeah, this gives you a
[16.0] sense of the scale of and so not far
[18.64] north of here is where the giant ripples
[20.72] were. So you can follow the train of the
[22.56] erratics. You got the ripples and then
[24.96] you head into this giant valley and it's
[27.279] captured what is now the modern Missouri

Title: The Younger Dryas: A Civilization Reset Event
[0.08] We know we had a global catastrophe 12
[2.32] to 13,000 years ago. And we know from
[5.52] this extreme nature of that global
[8.679] catastrophe was that if it were to recur
[11.2] again today, civilization, everything we
[13.92] built in the last 10,000 years is pretty
[15.839] much erased. That would be the
[17.76] consequence of it. And I think that
[19.84] might be one reason why the younger dus
[21.92] impact idea has gotten so much
[24.0] resistance because the implications of
[26.32] it are profound. that in our recent
[28.32] geological history there were events
[30.24] which would be planetary civilization
[34.0] killer if it were to recur again. And
[37.2] then that raises the idea of well what
[39.36] was lost during the the younger dus.

Title: JFK, LSD, and the Control of Energy
[0.0] Well, we did have one president who a
[1.76] lot of evidence that he did in fact take
[3.52] several acid trips. You know who that
[5.44] was? Who's that? John Kennedy. Aha.
[8.4] Really? Oh, yeah. You know, he was
[10.0] having multiple affairs in the White
[11.92] House, right? I knew about that. Okay.
[13.92] So, one of his affairs was was with a
[16.32] woman who was an associate of Timothy
[18.48] Liry. That's well estab. There's basis
[20.8] to the rumor. That's another reason why
[22.64] they killed him. Could be. Well, it
[25.279] could be that because of, you know, his,
[27.76] you know, cuz he did really go through a
[29.359] pretty much a change of attitude during
[31.599] that last year. But, you know, what it
[33.2] comes down to is, you know, right now
[35.28] everything is going on in the world is
[37.12] basically about the control of energy
[39.28] and resources. And if there was a way of
[42.96] technology or energy that could do an
[45.84] end run around this idea that we live in
[48.64] a Malthusian reality and we have to have
[51.92] this, you know, fight to the end over
[54.239] who's going to control the energy and
[56.16] who's going to control the resources. It
[58.239] would render our entire foreign policy,
[60.16] our military policy, all of that
[62.719] irrelevant. M from what I've seen, my
[66.32] evolving opinion about the possibility
[68.32] of there being ancient technology. If
[70.72] there was an ancient technology, it
[72.96] should be possible to recover it. Yeah.

Title: We Could’ve Been Spacefaring by Now
[0.199] When ideas of further space exploration
[3.6] and economic development, colonization
[6.0] were first proposed back in the mid70s
[8.96] when it dawned on engineers and
[11.599] physicists and thinkers and futurists
[13.84] and so on that hey the momentum that
[16.96] we've demonstrated is plausible within
[20.08] the last 10 to 15 years. If we continued
[22.96] that, yeah, we could become a space
[25.439] fairing civilization within a
[27.439] generation. Green operations clear
[30.88] capsule go. Colonel Edward White was the
[33.52] first American to walk in space. Four
[36.32] others also floated outside their Jeminy
[38.399] craft or poke their bodies through an
[40.16] open hatch. Some things about space can
[42.8] only be learned in
[44.6] space. Astronauts built on experience,
[47.36] the process never
[49.079] stopping. The skills of
[51.8] maneuvering. A tested worldwide recovery
[54.48] force and tracking network.
[57.52] making precise landings from orbit,
[60.079] proving man could live and work in space
[62.0] in weightlessness for as long as two
[63.76] weeks. Well, we didn't go that route,
[65.92] but a lot of the objections and first
[68.56] learning about it, I became 100% an
[70.88] advocate for space, continuing our
[74.08] journeys into face.

Title: The Global Disaster of 536 A.D. – Randall Carlson Exposes a Forgotten Cataclysm
[0.16] Greetings. I'm Randall Carlson and I
[2.399] would like to welcome you to another
[4.88] episode of Squaring the Circle podcast
[7.759] where we dive into all kinds of areas of
[12.16] interest that I think could be important
[15.28] in uh plotting out a successful future.
[31.119] One of the things that I think is a very
[34.16] important part in the history of the
[36.96] last couple thousand years is this uh
[40.48] so-called dark ages or dark age that
[43.84] occurred uh just prior to the rise of
[46.84] classical medieval civilization
[49.92] uh the uh the Persian Empire so on. It
[53.44] lasted from about five uh the mid 500s
[57.199] to about the mid 900s and then it was
[60.239] replaced by a warming of the world
[63.6] called the medieval warming period. Now
[66.0] many people think that the dark ages is
[69.119] just a metaphor referring to the fact
[72.08] that uh there was a massive scarcity if
[76.56] you will of written records and cultural
[80.4] activity uh economic trade uh many of
[84.4] the things that would uh be uh
[86.72] undertaken that would show the show
[88.96] evidence of a of a very vigorous economy
[92.079] and society.
[94.24] So we have the post Roman days and the
[98.159] pre-medieval days which is this kind of
[100.24] in between area that has been referred
[101.92] to as the dark age. So was it just
[105.2] merely a metaphor or was there a actual
[108.96] period of darkness? That's what I want
[110.72] to explore in a couple of episodes of
[113.52] Squaring the Circle because I think the
[115.32] lessons that we have to uh derive from
[119.439] that particular extraordinary event um
[123.84] are numerous. So let's just get right
[126.96] into it. Um, since the 1960s and the
[131.48] 1970s, awareness has been growing about
[134.8] major climate shifts occurring during
[137.36] the time that we humans have occupied
[139.92] this planet. More specifically, the
[142.56] realization is dawning that climate
[145.12] change, natural climate change,
[147.28] pre-industrial climate change has been a
[150.319] major factor in shaping and affecting
[152.56] human history for thousands of years.
[155.84] One example of a profound climate shift
[158.959] in relatively recent times historically
[162.16] happened in the roughly 8 to 10year
[164.64] period that began around
[167.08] 536 AD.
[169.76] The lessons that this event has to teach
[172.8] us about what has occurred and affected
[174.879] our ancestors in powerful ways are
[177.84] mandatory for modern society to
[180.4] authentically learn to respond to and
[183.68] adapt to sudden climate changes that are
[186.959] due entirely to natural causes.
[190.959] So the focus of this episode is going to
[193.28] be uh upon that 536 AD event, its
[197.879] aftermath and its implications for the
[200.879] history that followed in its wake even
[203.36] down to our own times.
[205.92] It appears possible that in terms of
[208.159] global climatic effects, this episode of
[212.319] likely of environmental change, probably
[215.68] driven by volcanism, at least one of the
[218.239] agencies involved, may be the most
[220.799] severe of all events, all uh climatic
[224.4] events that have affected the course of
[226.76] civilization since at least the 15th
[230.0] century BC. So that's 1500 years plus
[234.959] 2,000 years. So that's 3,500 years ago.
[239.599] Uh what happened 3,500 years ago was the
[242.239] eruption of Terara, the uh uh island
[245.48] volcano which erupted in the eastern
[248.4] Mediterranean and was responsible for
[250.959] the ultimate catastrophic demise of the
[254.64] civilization on the island of Cree which
[257.68] is going to be a very interesting topic
[260.4] for another episode of squaring the
[262.4] circle.
[264.639] So an important new paper was recently
[267.44] published in the journal Boreas this
[270.479] past January in
[272.759] 2025. It provides more evidence for an
[275.759] extraordinary climatic event during the
[278.16] period from 536 to 540 AD. And this time
[283.919] in this new study, the focus was on
[286.24] Sweden, which had previously uh not been
[289.6] really examined in depth to determine
[292.56] the extra extent or magnitude of the
[296.08] climatic effects up in Scandinavia. So
[299.36] this study was intended to rectify that.
[302.24] So I'll begin by discussing a report
[305.12] authored by one Arini
[308.44] Anagnostu and Kirsten Leiden with the
[312.12] archaeological research laboratory at
[315.08] Stockholm al working along with John
[317.84] Linderholm with the environmental
[319.919] archaeology laboratory at the University
[322.84] of also in Sweden from this report which
[327.36] was entitled AD536/5
[332.039] 540 climate event in Sweden. A
[336.28] review from this report, we learn first
[339.68] in the introductory comments that quote,
[342.479] "As a result of growing concerns about
[345.68] the impacts of contemporary climate
[348.44] change, research in recent years has
[351.36] shown an interest in exploring the
[353.479] relationship between climatic
[356.12] fluctuations and human responses in the
[359.28] past. The various challenges spanning
[362.16] from climate change, food
[365.0] insecurity, animal extinctions to
[367.68] ecological disaster and societal
[370.84] instability that our planet is facing
[374.24] have led researchers from different
[376.08] disciplines to investigate past human
[379.56] responses to climate change in order to
[382.8] find ways to mitigate the impact of
[385.759] contemporary climate change.
[390.68] So we find in so many papers now dealing
[394.56] in any aspect or dimension of climate or
[398.4] environmental change or weather are
[401.28] usually prefaced by some uh endorsement
[404.72] of the what is clearly even though it's
[407.759] not explicitly stated here is clearly
[411.039] implied to be anthropogenic climate
[413.12] change.
[414.56] So the sticking point here is the use of
[417.36] the term climate
[419.24] change. Do we mean climate change in
[422.0] general which obviously we must uh be
[425.84] referring to if we are considering
[427.52] climate change in the pre-industrial era
[430.8] because we're assuming that in the
[432.319] pre-industrial area era we didn't have a
[435.68] major influence on the climate like we
[438.319] do now. Um, now of course the
[441.199] pre-industrial area uh comprises most of
[444.599] history. Or are we confining the
[447.52] definition of the phrase climate change
[449.68] to only mean change induced in the
[452.0] global climate through the activities of
[454.84] man, specifically humans use of fossil
[458.44] fuels. Unfortunately, with only a few
[461.36] exceptions, the use of the term climate
[463.919] change in mainstream media refers almost
[467.199] exclusively to the latter.
[469.599] It's human's
[470.919] fault. The uh the paper that I was
[474.0] citing here uh came out in Bereas volume
[477.52] 54 uh January of
[482.919] 2025. Now when we proceed to investigate
[486.4] past human responses to climate change,
[488.879] we are necessarily looking at climate
[491.919] change that is predominantly if not
[494.0] completely the result of natural forces.
[497.44] Therefore, to address the issue of human
[499.599] responses to changes in climate in the
[501.759] past, we are compelled to consider the
[504.4] full range of climate change variables.
[507.599] We have no choice but to look beyond the
[509.96] limitations of a singular causal process
[513.919] which however as a result of political
[516.32] and economic pressures now
[518.839] overwhelmingly dominates the public
[521.12] discourse.
[522.719] So with this in mind, the idea that the
[526.88] conversation, the discussion, the debate
[529.279] about global change, climate change,
[532.0] environmental change and whatever you
[533.68] want, however you want to describe this
[535.24] change, the overwhelming focus and
[538.72] dominance of the discussion has been on
[540.56] the anthropogenic component of climate
[543.399] change. When we go back into studying
[546.959] the history of climate on Earth, both in
[550.399] the short term and the long term, we
[552.32] discover over and over again with
[555.279] exceptional redundancy that there's all
[558.88] kinds of evidence from all fronts that
[562.48] climate has changed naturally and to a
[565.68] very significant degree.
[569.04] So in this Boras paper, the authors
[571.839] began by explaining that and I quote,
[574.56] "Abrupt climatic alterations have been
[577.76] considered as one of the main driving
[580.44] factors behind societal
[584.279] reorganization, civilization
[587.16] collapses, population declines, and
[590.8] material culture changes around the
[592.88] world.
[594.32] Large explosive volcanic eruptions can,
[598.399] for example, cause significant climate
[601.8] impact because of their substantial
[605.04] sulfur dioxide emissions and the
[607.92] subsequent formation of sulfate aerosols
[610.64] in the stratosphere.
[612.64] These aerosols reflect incoming solar
[616.519] radiation, thereby reducing the amount
[618.88] of sunlight available for primary
[621.079] production at the Earth's surface.
[624.32] A longlasting cold event caused by
[626.959] multiple severe volcanic eruptions in AD
[631.64] 536 to 540 has been recorded in various
[636.48] historical sources and
[639.959] dendrochronological and ice core data.
[643.12] What is
[644.44] dendrochronological? Well, that's a
[646.16] chronology that's derived from the study
[648.56] of tree rings, which like ice cores are
[652.56] layered and can yield up uh incredible
[656.8] uh detailed information about the nature
[660.0] of the environment when the tree was
[663.519] growing and when it added that
[665.839] particular layer, that ring of annual
[668.8] growth or in the layers in the icecore
[672.0] data. So, they're kind of similar in a
[673.76] way. Ice core data is usually going to
[676.16] be represented and preserved in layers
[678.32] of ice.
[680.279] Dendrochronological evidence is going to
[682.16] be preserved in layers of tree of wood.
[687.079] Um so this event this 536 540 AD event
[692.24] was first recognized by Stothers and
[695.04] Rampino in a paper published in
[697.88] 1983 and the extent of its global impact
[701.44] has been confirmed by highresolution
[703.92] climatic data. Several studies have
[707.12] considered the AD536 to 540 event as one
[711.12] of the factors contributing to major
[714.04] socopolitical changes such as settlement
[718.279] abandonments, population declines,
[721.88] migrations, the spread of the Justinian
[724.68] plague, the transformation of the Roman
[727.399] Empire, the invasion of Italy by the
[730.92] Lombards, the rise of the Ottoman Empire
[734.16] as well as the Arabic empire, the
[736.88] collapse of the dynasties in China, and
[739.04] the crisis in ma Mayan
[742.519] society. The event has also been
[744.88] connected to severe famine and economic
[747.76] crisis around the world owing to crop
[751.16] failure. Less is known about the impact
[753.92] of this event on Scandinavian
[756.56] societies."
[758.6] unquote. I asked the question, is it
[761.12] possible that such a broad range of
[763.399] phenomena can be connected uh and
[766.88] triggered by a singular event of
[768.959] outsized
[770.279] effect? Well, the more we learn, the
[772.8] more it becomes apparent that the
[774.32] natural changes of extreme and
[776.0] far-reaching influence have played a
[779.2] critically important central role in
[782.16] driving a wide spectrum of social and
[785.04] cultural change. With regard to this
[787.8] evolving insight, Ananastu and Leiden
[792.279] explain, quote, in Scandinavia, the
[795.76] consideration of climate change as a
[798.24] driving factor for the observed changes
[801.519] in the archaeological record in the
[804.639] middle of the first millennium AD began
[808.16] in the 1950s and the 1960s.
[811.6] uh and it revived the discussion of
[813.6] climate change and specifically the AD
[817.399] 536540 event as one of the causes behind
[821.6] the 6th century crisis and developed the
[825.639] so-called fimblewinter theory which
[829.12] influenced several subsequent studies.
[832.839] Um I will pause and mention in reading
[836.32] this quote that uh these events uh that
[839.92] occurred around 536 to 544 AD have been
[843.68] referred to or called uh uh referenced
[846.24] as the 6th century crisis. And then what
[850.56] is the fimble winter theory? We'll come
[852.399] back to that in a second. The AD
[855.72] 536 to 540 event in Scandinavia
[860.32] uh in Scandinavian research has been
[862.48] linked to the increased number of gold
[865.76] horde
[866.839] depositions, different ritual practices,
[870.399] settlement and burial abandonments,
[873.36] demographic decline, famine, and the
[876.24] spread of erotism and the Justinian
[878.8] plague. I'll back up for a second. I'll
[881.199] say g gold horde depositions. That's
[883.44] interesting because it shows that even
[885.76] uh almost 1500 years ago in times of
[888.88] crisis and social breakdown people were
[891.76] tending to hoard gold. Um the other
[894.72] interesting thing here is
[896.6] erotism which is a type of a fungus that
[899.6] grows on wheat and rye various types of
[902.639] grain when it's subjected to cold and
[905.279] damp and it can lead to all kinds of
[908.32] crazy uh reh behavior in those who are
[912.32] afflicted by it who acts who eat some of
[914.8] the grain that is um contaminated with
[917.6] the urgot. uh and then also the
[920.079] Justinian plague. We'll talk about that
[922.959] more
[923.8] later. Okay, so that's the end of the
[926.36] quote. So the specifics and the likely
[928.959] triggers of this climatic event are
[930.959] further discussed by the authors. So
[933.6] this is what they have to say. quote,
[935.68] "The period from AD 536 to
[938.76] 545 was the coldest decade of the past
[943.12] two millennia with the year AD 536 being
[948.32] extremely cold.
[951.36] Summer reconstructions from Scandinavia
[954.16] and Finland showed decreased
[956.959] temperatures of around 1.5 to 2°
[960.32] centigrade in AD 536 and 540.
[965.199] Bunchen at Al or others in
[969.56] 2016 suggested that three large volcanic
[973.8] eruptions in AD
[976.759] 536, 540, and
[979.88] 547 resulted in a longl lasting cooling
[984.56] from AD
[986.48] uh 536 all the way up to AD 660. Uh this
[991.839] is referred to uh this period uh is
[995.12] referred to as the late ant the late
[998.12] antique little ice age. The late antique
[1002.32] little ice age. So it was followed by
[1005.519] the worldwide warming that we call the
[1008.48] medieval warming period when the sea ice
[1011.199] retracted north. The sealanes opened up.
[1014.639] Scandinavians were able to sail from
[1018.079] Britain, Scandinavia to Iceland and from
[1020.32] there to Greenland. And Vikings were
[1023.519] able to settle on Greenland and start
[1025.919] farming which they did for the next 3 to
[1027.919] 400 years during this period of global
[1031.64] warmth. Um so that was the end of the
[1034.72] quote there. the late antique little ice
[1038.24] age followed by the medieval warm period
[1041.6] followed by the little ice
[1044.039] age. So to confirm this correlation, the
[1047.52] authors of this paper further explained
[1049.6] that, and I quote again, the
[1053.64] AD536540 event had more profound effects
[1057.679] than other more recent and well-known
[1061.2] volcanic eruptions such as the Tambora
[1064.16] eruption in AD
[1067.16] 1815, which caused worldwide crop
[1070.16] failure and famine. And I have talked uh
[1073.2] in two episodes of Squaring the Circle
[1075.12] about that uh 1815 eruption of the uh
[1079.12] volcano Tambbora and the year without a
[1081.76] summer. I think it was uh either
[1083.76] episodes 10, 11 or 112. If you go back
[1086.64] into the archives uh I say on Rumble,
[1089.6] you'll be able to find those. Uh I would
[1091.84] highly recommend re-watching those or if
[1094.559] you've already watched them um or
[1097.039] watching them if you haven't uh because
[1099.36] the information there complements the
[1101.679] information I'm presenting you here
[1103.919] about the 536 uh AD event.
[1108.36] Um so it's been one uh considered that
[1112.72] as one of the factors together with
[1114.799] political and economic conditions that
[1117.6] contributed to societal changes recorded
[1120.48] in this period
[1122.44] worldwide. The possible effects of this
[1124.799] event could be crop failures and famine
[1128.48] and it has been suggested that it
[1130.36] contributed to the spread of the
[1132.48] Justinian plague and population decline.
[1137.28] uh Helama al in
[1140.44] 2018 highlighted that not only the cold
[1143.799] conditions but also the reduction in
[1146.4] solar radiation could contribute to the
[1149.28] outbreak of famine and plague as a
[1151.679] result of malnutrition and a deficiency
[1154.4] of vitamin D. So we're seeing the
[1157.28] beginning to see the the lines of
[1159.2] interconnectedness here. um we have some
[1162.24] event now it's proposed that it's a
[1164.08] volcanic event that contributes to the
[1168.08] uh polluting of the atmosphere to the
[1169.919] extent that it is reflecting a
[1172.64] substantial amount or preventing a
[1174.64] substantial amount of solar radiation
[1176.799] from penetrating uh here to the to the
[1180.0] surface the earth's surface below right
[1183.039] so couple of things it produces the cold
[1186.08] it causes it forces a reducement a
[1188.32] reducing temperature which then can lead
[1190.799] to crop failures which then lead to food
[1193.4] shortages that then lead to famine and
[1196.32] famine then can lead to um the
[1199.28] malnutrition that opens the door to
[1201.88] opportunistic diseases and pandemics. At
[1205.28] the same time, because of the lack of
[1207.679] sunlight, we're now being deprived of
[1209.44] vitamin D, which is exactly one of the
[1213.12] uh one of the uh substances that we need
[1216.96] to be uh keeping our immune system
[1219.4] enhanced and resistant to exactly those
[1222.96] kind of diseases. So, we've got kind of
[1224.559] a double whammy at work here, but it
[1226.96] begins with whatever this agency is that
[1230.72] causes the change in the atmosphere. And
[1234.48] let's go in and talk about that some
[1236.12] more. Um,
[1238.84] so in summary, substantial evidence
[1241.919] exists that supports the occurrence of
[1243.919] several large-scale volcanic eruptions
[1247.08] between 536 and 54 something
[1253.32] AD. But I would ask could there be more
[1255.76] to
[1256.52] it? Let's go back to the seminal paper
[1259.28] that was referenced by a
[1261.88] Anagnostu and others that launched a
[1265.2] widespread interest in the events around
[1268.559] this date of 536 AD in the first place
[1272.4] as well as other abrupt climate changes
[1274.96] as well. This paper published in 1983 in
[1279.039] the journal of geoysical research was
[1281.679] offer authored by two
[1284.36] geoccientists Michael Rampino and
[1286.72] Richard based Richard B. Stothers at the
[1290.32] time affiliated with the Goddard
[1292.159] Institute for Space Studies with NASA.
[1296.4] This paper was a culmination of an
[1298.48] exhaustively researched phenomena
[1301.2] associated with volcanism that is
[1304.4] volcanic eruptions especially their role
[1308.0] in climate change and the history of
[1310.4] civilization.
[1312.0] Stothers and Rampino's research looked
[1314.559] at looked selectively at a series of
[1318.4] volcanic events beginning with the
[1321.12] explosive eruption of the Mediterranean
[1323.28] volcano Terra in the 15th century BC.
[1328.159] Then moving on to Etna which erupted in
[1330.64] 44 BC and Vuvius which erupted multiple
[1335.28] times in the years uh 217 BC, AD79 and
[1341.52] AD
[1343.159] 472. From proxy evidence, it was
[1347.0] concluded that great eruptions also took
[1350.88] place in the years AD 536 and AD 626.
[1358.24] One of the things that characterized all
[1360.799] the events listed here is that they were
[1363.84] followed by a marked veiling and cooling
[1367.6] of the atmosphere for at least a year
[1370.72] subsequent to the
[1372.919] eruptions. In reference to this event,
[1375.76] Stotherers and Rampino citing ancient
[1378.84] sources inform us that quote four
[1382.76] historians who were living in the year
[1386.52] AD536 have left surviving accounts of
[1390.24] that extraordinary year. So Stothers and
[1393.84] Rampino first quote Procopius. He was a
[1397.84] late antique Greek scholar and historian
[1402.559] who wrote the following in his history
[1405.76] of the wars. Quote, "And it came about
[1409.76] during this year that a most dread
[1412.72] portent took place. For the sun gave
[1416.159] forth uh its light without brightness,
[1420.159] like the moon during this whole year,
[1423.6] and it seemed exceedingly like the sun
[1426.32] in eclipse, for the beams it shed were
[1429.44] not clear, nor such as it is accustomed
[1433.44] to shed." unquote. Another quote was by
[1437.2] the Bz Byzantine administrator and
[1439.679] writer on antiquity, matters of
[1442.48] antiquity, John Leidus, who in his work
[1446.32] entitled on portants
[1449.559] 9c wrote that quote the sun became dim
[1454.72] for nearly the whole year so that the
[1457.6] fruits were killed at an unseasonable
[1461.039] time.
[1463.919] We're taking a bit little bit of a
[1465.2] detour here to uh tell a story that I
[1468.159] think is going to be valuable uh
[1470.72] concerning something that uh recently
[1472.96] happened to me. Oh, and I see I'm being
[1474.799] joined by my friend and colleague Mike
[1476.72] Robertson. Hello Rando. How are you? I'm
[1479.6] doing very well, thank you. Well,
[1482.159] regarding this little story we're going
[1483.679] to tell, we won't take too long. We'll
[1485.44] get back to the episode shortly, but I
[1487.12] understand you were in a conference
[1489.919] recently in Florida. Was it correct?
[1492.88] Yes. In Florida in a beautiful hotel,
[1495.44] the Fiana Hotel, I believe it was.
[1498.32] Excellent. And what uh something
[1500.24] happened there. Uh first of all, how was
[1502.48] the conference? But then I understand
[1504.72] the conference was great. The hotel was
[1506.559] awesome. But um yeah, everything was
[1509.84] good except I was coming down the stairs
[1512.08] and I think somebody just ahead of me
[1514.08] had spilled a little bit of something.
[1517.12] was, you know, crowds moving up and down
[1519.52] and I think somebody spilled a little
[1521.44] something on one of the treads in front
[1523.12] of me and my foot hit it and uh slid out
[1526.96] from under me and I tumbled down three
[1529.44] or four stairs to the bottom. Whoa. Uh I
[1532.96] survived as you can see. Look, I'm still
[1535.279] here and I'm intact. I didn't break any
[1537.44] bones. No, no breaking bones. But I sure
[1539.84] banged up my left knee. That was the
[1542.4] first thing that hit. My left knee hit
[1544.279] that tile floor. M and uh it it was
[1549.52] painful, but uh I had to go I was
[1552.72] actually on my way to do a presentation.
[1554.64] So I had to tough it out and go do a
[1556.96] presentation with my uh throbbing left
[1560.559] knee. So anyways, got done with that and
[1563.76] then as the day progressed, it got my
[1566.0] knee began to swell up and it got quite
[1568.4] painful and uh I was very relieved to
[1573.36] remember that I had brought I happened
[1575.279] to pack my CBD from the god sav and I
[1580.559] was really grateful that I had
[1582.72] remembered to do that. So I that night I
[1586.72] put some of the sav on went to bed. I
[1590.08] regularly applied it uh before I got
[1592.4] dressed and then I put some more on at
[1594.4] night before I went to bed. And I must
[1596.159] say though, I've I've, you know, being
[1598.4] in the construction and building
[1599.919] industry, I've had many falls and in uh
[1602.4] injuries and stuff. And I figured I'm
[1605.039] going to be laid up with this for a
[1606.799] month. We drove home. I think it was
[1609.12] three to four days later. I continued
[1611.44] applying to SAB, and I would say within
[1613.44] a week, I was getting around pretty
[1615.52] good. Uh Wow. Yeah. It it
[1619.52] It definitely helped. It It most
[1623.48] defining ingredients in that sav that
[1626.88] can actually penetrate in to a to uh to
[1631.84] to really alleviate the
[1634.039] inflammation that's in inside during an
[1637.279] injury like that. Yeah. Yeah. I don't
[1639.679] have all of the specifications for as a
[1642.24] matter of fact we might actually in
[1644.08] later segments we might actually
[1645.84] interview some of the people from the
[1647.679] company who make the product and they
[1649.76] can tell some of the details of u you
[1653.52] know of the ingredients and what they do
[1656.0] and how they because my understanding
[1658.24] it's more than just a pain relief. it.
[1660.48] There's actually healing
[1663.279] compounds and other ingredients in there
[1665.6] that literally heal as well as pain,
[1669.44] relieve pain. And that is one of the
[1671.919] reasons it works so fast. One of them I
[1674.159] know is comfrey.
[1676.08] And that's a big one. I know that for a
[1677.919] fact because anybody can look it up, but
[1680.08] you know, comry is an ancient name for
[1683.52] um for comry is called the bone healer.
[1686.96] Uhhuh. Yeah. And it gets that name for a
[1689.919] reason. But um did you you said now I
[1694.0] know you take um the Apollo oil as well
[1698.0] like when road trips when I travel when
[1701.84] I travel especially I I always bring the
[1705.12] oil because it helps relax me and I get
[1707.44] a it helps me to sleep and I have a
[1709.919] tough time sleeping sometimes when I'm
[1711.52] on the road and traveling. Uh so it
[1714.159] every little uh advantage I can take
[1717.12] that's going to help me get that rest
[1719.44] and get a good night's sleep because
[1721.919] particularly like if I'm leading a tour
[1723.84] I got to be on all day and for me to do
[1726.799] that effectively I have to have a good
[1728.559] night's sleep. Uh so I bring I always
[1732.48] bring the oil uh when I travel and I I'm
[1735.84] now after this episode I'm like okay I'm
[1738.159] always going to have the sab with me.
[1740.24] This was followed up by an account of
[1742.72] one Zachcharias of Mitellini, Greece,
[1747.039] who wrote in the Syriak Chronicle
[1750.44] 9.19 that quote, "The earth with all
[1754.88] that is upon it quake, and the sun began
[1758.64] to be darkened by day and the moon by
[1761.799] night, while the ocean was tumultuous
[1764.64] with spray from the 24th of March in
[1767.6] this year till the 24th of June in the
[1770.96] following
[1771.96] year. And as uh the winter in
[1775.559] Mesopotamia was a severe one, so much so
[1779.279] that the large and unwanted quantity of
[1782.76] snow that the birds
[1785.48] perished. There was distress among men
[1789.679] from these evil things. quote. So,
[1793.52] Stotherers and Rampino conclude uh with
[1797.039] a quote attributed to John of Ephesus in
[1800.32] his ecclesiastical history
[1803.44] uh by the chronicler of antiquity,
[1806.32] Michael Dyerion, um in his chronicle
[1813.48] 9.296. There was a sign in the sun the
[1816.559] like of which had never been seen and
[1818.799] reported before. The sun became dark and
[1823.2] its darkness lasted for 18
[1826.039] months. Each day it shone for about 4
[1829.2] hours and still this light was only a
[1831.84] feeble
[1833.0] shadow. Everyone declared that the sun
[1836.24] would never recover its full light. The
[1839.44] fruits did not ripen and the wine tasted
[1843.2] like sour
[1845.399] grapes. quote. Now, one of the most
[1848.159] provocative quotes I've read regarding
[1851.279] this 536
[1853.12] uh AD event comes from the 6th century
[1856.72] Roman senator and scholar
[1859.48] Caziodoris. Um, and this is what he
[1863.159] said. But who will not be
[1866.84] disturbed and deeply curious about such
[1870.2] events if something mysterious and
[1873.799] unusual seems to be coming at us from
[1877.52] the stars and that was full name Flavius
[1881.44] Magnus Orurelius
[1884.039] Kaziodoris who wrote that in the year
[1887.2] 536 AD.
[1889.84] This last perspective of Kaziodoris
[1893.44] uh might turn out to be essential in
[1895.2] understanding the larger implications
[1897.919] and the full spectrum of influences
[1900.559] producing the effects that manifested in
[1903.6] that decade starting in 546 AD.
[1907.36] This paper by Stothers and Rampino was
[1910.159] an important milestone in the study of
[1913.519] the effects of extreme natural phenomena
[1916.88] on cultural history and especially that
[1919.84] of the the role of great volcanic
[1923.0] eruptions many of which are exhaustively
[1926.519] documented. The entire paper is worth
[1929.44] reading and it can be downloaded from
[1931.919] Google Scholar. The full title of the
[1935.039] paper is volcanic eruptions in the
[1938.44] Mediterranean before AD 630 from written
[1943.84] and archaeological
[1945.799] sources. It was published in the journal
[1948.159] of geoysical research volume 88 number
[1952.559] B8 uh on August 10th
[1957.0] 1983. Since the publication of the paper
[1959.679] by Stothers and Rampino, many other
[1961.76] researchers have weighed in on the
[1963.919] mid6th century crisis. In the journal
[1967.6] climate change from the year
[1969.64] 2001, we find a report authored by four
[1974.039] dendrochronologists with the tree ring
[1976.6] laboratory Lamont Doherty Earth
[1979.44] Observatory.
[1981.2] The title of this paper is the rather
[1984.84] unwieldy spatial responses to major
[1987.919] volcanic events in or about AD 536, 934
[1992.96] and
[1994.36] 1258, frost rings and other
[1997.64] dendrochronological evidence from
[1999.48] Mongolia and northern
[2002.36] Siberia. It was published or written by
[2005.76] four dendrochronologists.
[2007.84] lead author was Rosanna
[2010.279] D'argo. Um, and this is what they wrote
[2013.679] in their paper. Stothers, now this is
[2016.64] Stother's post, Stothers and Rampino. He
[2019.2] wrote uh solo articles in 1984 and
[2023.96] 1999. He reported historical evidence
[2027.36] for dry fog and unusual cold in Europe,
[2031.039] the Mediterranean, and the Middle East
[2033.919] during AD 536, 537.
[2037.6] and accounts of plague in these areas in
[2041.32] AD 541 through
[2045.159] 544 references in Bailey come back to
[2048.399] him in a moment uh cited historical
[2051.24] documentation of crop failure, famine
[2054.8] and plague in Europe and the Middle East
[2057.2] around this time. In AD 536, northern
[2061.359] Chinese historical records documented a
[2064.32] period of dim sun, summer frosts, loss
[2068.159] of crops, severe famine, and
[2071.159] widespread population losses."
[2075.079] unquote. The reference to Bailey refers
[2078.159] to the Irish
[2079.56] paleoecologist Mike Bailey, a recognized
[2082.879] expert and author in the study of tree
[2086.079] rings and their use as a dating tool. He
[2089.76] had early access to extensive tree ring
[2092.8] chronologies from around the world and
[2095.2] this allowed him to develop a
[2096.8] comprehensive view of changes in climate
[2099.52] as recorded through this particular
[2101.359] medium. As far as the cause of the
[2104.119] event, they explain that quote,
[2107.28] "Stothers suggested that these extreme
[2109.839] environmental conditions were likely due
[2111.92] to a major volcanic event, perhaps the
[2115.28] tropical eruption of Rabbal, Rabul,
[2119.359] Rabel, I'm not sure how it's pronounced,
[2121.359] New Britain, or possibly a northern
[2124.0] latitude eruption. Alternatively, it has
[2126.88] been theorized, get this, that a cosmic
[2130.32] phenomena, an asteroid or comet, may
[2133.119] explain the unusual climate conditions
[2135.92] and other effects of this time.
[2138.56] Discussing further the work of Mike
[2140.24] Bailey from 1994 and
[2143.079] 1999, who was probably the first to
[2145.68] suggest that some of the evidence was
[2147.76] consistent with a cosmic impact event
[2150.72] around 536 AD. The authors, Die'go and
[2154.96] others say that Bailey has extensively
[2158.24] reviewed tree ring and other evidence
[2160.0] for very unusual conditions in many
[2163.359] areas of the globe in the middle
[2166.04] 500s. In a multi-millennial Irish oak
[2170.119] series, AD 536 was a very narrow ring,
[2175.599] but some of the narrowest rings in this
[2177.76] record actually occurred in 540 and 541.
[2182.48] AD 536 was the second coldest summer in
[2186.44] 1,500 years in a temperature record from
[2191.4] Fenoscandia that is from
[2193.56] Scandinavia. And there was reduced
[2195.68] growth from about AD
[2197.88] 536 through AD 545 or even later in this
[2204.24] and a number of other European
[2207.4] chronologies. A temperature sensitive
[2209.599] tree ring record from North America
[2212.4] shows AD 535, 536, and 541 to be the
[2218.0] second, third, and fourth coldest years
[2221.44] over the past two
[2223.56] millennia. Subnormal growth was also
[2226.56] found in western USA bristle pine
[2229.839] bristle cone pine chronologies.
[2232.96] A multi-millennial tree ring record from
[2236.28] Chile also shows decre decreased growth
[2239.599] at this time suggesting that this impact
[2243.04] uh that this event impacted parts of the
[2245.839] southern hemisphere. So this is very
[2248.56] important in establishing that this was
[2251.119] a globally propagated signal. It wasn't
[2253.839] strictly regional as has been maintained
[2256.88] by some of the researchers in this uh
[2259.28] early on. So in their paper de diaragno
[2263.48] durag
[2265.56] daragno which I'm probably not mis
[2268.16] mispronouncing and and uh team make
[2272.32] reference to a work showing that North
[2275.119] America was deeply affected by the onset
[2278.56] of the cold based upon a temperature
[2281.44] sensitive tree ring record. the years
[2284.52] 535, 536, and 541
[2288.64] uh are uh respectively uh which I
[2291.68] already told you were the uh coldest of
[2294.4] the last 2,000 years. So, the authors
[2297.119] developed a chronology of climate change
[2299.92] also affecting Mongolia for the period
[2303.359] from AD 262 to 1999.
[2307.92] By using relicked and living wood from
[2310.32] Siberian pine trees, they were able to
[2312.4] determine that quote, "The above results
[2314.72] for Mongolia are consistent with the
[2316.88] observations of summer frosts and snow,
[2320.16] crop failures, decreased star visibility
[2323.839] and famine documented for northern China
[2326.8] in July and August of 536 and 537.
[2332.079] Further indication for a climatic
[2334.079] response to this event in Eurasia comes
[2336.8] from a cross-section of wood from the
[2339.04] Tamer Peninsula in Siberia. As for
[2342.079] Mongolia, there is an abrupt growth
[2344.16] decrease in 536 followed by a brief
[2347.76] recovery and subsequent decline. Our
[2351.359] findings from Mongol Mongolian Tamer
[2354.24] indicate that the spatial impact of this
[2356.56] episode extended further eastward into
[2359.72] Eurasia than previously documented. So
[2363.44] again what's happening is more and more
[2365.44] evidence comes to light more and more
[2367.28] studies are conducted it's discovering
[2369.68] that the uh the imprint the signal the
[2373.28] fingerprints of this rapid and extreme
[2376.4] climate change uh are fel are indeed
[2379.2] being felt
[2380.92] worldwide. So jumping forward closer to
[2384.079] the present I'm going to turn now to a
[2385.68] paper that was published in
[2387.48] 2015. Uh this valuable and interesting
[2390.56] paper was co-au was authored by Neil
[2393.359] Price and Bo Grassland. Uh and it
[2396.88] appeared in the book um
[2400.119] uh archaeology, geomology and climate
[2403.96] events, past vulnerability, volcanic
[2407.599] eruptions and human vulnerability in
[2410.24] traditional societies past and present.
[2412.64] That was the title plus the subtitle.
[2414.8] The um the title of their chapter in
[2417.92] this book, chapter 6, was excavating the
[2420.96] fimble winter archaeology, geomthology
[2424.4] and climate events of AD
[2428.119] 536. Uh the book was published by the
[2431.32] Arus University Press. Um and it
[2435.52] represents an outstanding example of
[2437.359] geomthology.
[2438.96] Now, geomology is nothing less than the
[2441.359] recognition that the testimony of our
[2443.2] ancient ancestors can be extremely
[2445.76] useful in complimenting and elucidating
[2448.8] scientifically derived data from modern
[2451.68] proxies. So Price and Grassland begin
[2455.52] their paper by saying this quote. There
[2458.079] is now general agreement among
[2459.88] geocscientists that in the year 536 and
[2463.52] for varying lengths of time thereafter
[2465.599] several parts of the world experienced a
[2468.16] prolonged solar darkness. This took the
[2471.359] form of a loosely termed dust veil
[2474.96] blocking the sun's warmth from reaching
[2477.119] the earth traceable in numerous
[2479.599] environmental proxies. Various causes
[2482.72] have been put forward, including
[2484.96] atmospheric debris from a volcanic
[2487.359] eruption or the impacts of comets and/or
[2491.64] meteorites. While no consensus has been
[2494.24] reached, there is substantial rep
[2496.16] support for the eruption of Ilopango
[2500.079] volcano in El Salvador as a primary
[2503.119] factor. Uh in the next episode we will
[2506.079] look at that um in more detail uh as a
[2509.92] primary factor in driving this
[2512.359] remarkable climatic
[2515.24] excursion. It has also been persuasively
[2517.76] argued that the 536 event may have been
[2520.079] a combination of different events and
[2521.92] causes occurring within a relatively
[2524.56] short space of time in different
[2526.839] locations. I lean towards some variant
[2529.68] of that uh
[2531.88] explanation.
[2533.52] So the authors uh of this paper provide
[2536.64] useful insight into the work of Stothers
[2539.599] and Rampino and I'll quote on their uh
[2542.64] their comments regarding the work of
[2544.88] Stother Stothers and Rampino.
[2547.92] In the light of their discovery,
[2549.599] Stotherers and Rampino felt justified in
[2552.079] connecting the written sources with a
[2555.04] significant layer of sulfuric acid that
[2558.0] appears in the Greenland ice courts from
[2560.16] around the year 540, which might have
[2563.359] resulted from an event that occurred
[2565.92] some years earlier. Later investigations
[2569.68] of major deposits of sulfates in the ice
[2573.839] of both Antarctica and Greenland have
[2577.599] confirmed that sulfuric aerosols were
[2581.28] circulating in the strat stratosphere
[2584.319] over the entire globe for several years
[2587.92] after 536.
[2591.92] It turns out that the written sources
[2594.48] and the proxy the written sources uh
[2597.28] written historical sources and the proxy
[2600.56] evidence do complement each other quite
[2603.119] agreeably.
[2605.2] The authors uh continue, "As the aerosol
[2609.44] studies were ongoing, scientists were
[2612.319] also collecting fossil tree ring data
[2614.64] from around the northern hemisphere,
[2617.119] which appeared to indicate a series of
[2618.96] unusually cool summers during the period
[2622.24] from 536 to
[2624.68] 545 in places even until AD 550.
[2630.64] In eastern Siberia and northern Sweden,
[2633.44] the average summer temperature has been
[2635.28] estimated to have dropped by 3 to 4°
[2639.079] centigrade, a dramatic worsening of the
[2642.92] climate. Taken together, the evidence
[2645.76] was conclusive. The mystery cloud of AD
[2650.839] 536 was not only real, but one of the
[2654.56] most severe natural disasters to have
[2657.16] occurred over the last two millennia.
[2660.56] In the Mediterranean world, normal
[2662.88] levels of light and heat were not to
[2664.96] return for at least 18 months. In other
[2668.8] regions, especially further north, the
[2671.359] physical effects seem to have been more
[2673.64] severe, combining with other
[2676.079] environmental factors to cause misery
[2679.04] for up to a decade or more in some
[2682.119] places. But what was it that had
[2685.72] happened? They
[2687.72] ask. Well, they then proceed to present
[2690.4] a likely answer to the so-called mystery
[2693.8] cloud. Quote, "It is clear that
[2697.28] something was blocking the rays of the
[2699.8] sun, a form of atmospheric disturbance
[2703.52] that can only have resulted from the
[2705.599] projection of material from the Earth's
[2708.16] surface up into the stratosphere. Upon
[2712.079] the recognition of its existence, what
[2714.64] scientists have since termed the dust
[2717.96] veil was almost immediately identified
[2721.28] as the result of a volcanic eruption
[2725.04] formed by the sulfates and other ejecta
[2728.56] thrown out by an explosion of unusual
[2732.4] magnitude.
[2736.16] I would only add that it would be
[2738.24] premature to reject evidence uh for a
[2742.96] projection of material from outside the
[2746.56] earth's atmosphere as well as from the
[2749.44] earth
[2750.359] itself. The authors do go on to say that
[2753.52] there has a crude evidence that quote
[2757.359] there were in fact two clearly separate
[2760.72] periods of severe climate downturn. the
[2763.839] first in 536 and the second in 540 to
[2769.4] 542. This is important for several
[2772.359] reasons. Firstly, in raising the
[2774.88] possibility that the dust veil event
[2778.079] actually had multiple episodes of
[2780.16] varying nature occurring perhaps in
[2782.96] different parts of the world within a
[2785.28] relatively short period of time.
[2788.0] Secondly, this apparent diversion in the
[2791.0] data also prompted an alternative
[2794.68] explanation postulating that the dust
[2797.119] veil derived not from a volcanic
[2799.599] eruption but instead from one or more
[2802.68] extraterrestrial impacts of either comet
[2806.28] fragments and or meteorites.
[2812.24] Well, I would submit that it may not be
[2814.64] a case of either or either volcanism or
[2817.92] extraterrestrial impact at work here,
[2821.04] but more on that
[2822.599] later. I will continue with a report
[2825.68] from 2021 that appeared in the Swedish
[2829.4] archaeological journal uh in Saitu
[2833.88] Archaeologica with the title 536 dust
[2838.16] veil event and the long sixth century.
[2843.04] It was authored by Lars Eric Yerpe with
[2846.88] the culture histo museum in Oslo,
[2850.96] Sweden. From this report which provides
[2854.72] some background to research into this
[2858.079] period, we learned that quote in the
[2861.68] early 1980s an atmospheric anomaly um
[2866.4] the dry fog
[2869.079] um so back up. In the early
[2872.28] 1980s, we learn uh that there was a dry
[2875.92] fog in the Mediterranean AD 536 through
[2879.24] 541. And it gained attention from
[2882.16] Richard Stro Stother's and Michael
[2884.28] Rampino's paper. Their influential
[2887.68] study, and I'm quoting now, their
[2889.599] influential study demonstrated that the
[2892.319] fog caused a cold period and subsequent
[2896.079] crop failure and hunger. In the 1990s, a
[2900.0] few archaeologists highlighted the
[2902.0] impact the event had on at least some
[2904.96] aspects of Scandinavian
[2907.24] societies. This represented a radical
[2909.839] break with the main tendencies in
[2912.24] archaeological research of the 1980s.
[2915.04] I'm going to read that again. This
[2917.04] represented a radical break with the
[2919.44] main tendencies in archaeological
[2921.68] research of the
[2923.559] 1990s when human agency was considered
[2927.839] as the exclusive driving force for
[2931.28] societal change.
[2933.28] The breakthrough of what was dubbed the
[2935.52] dust veil event came when Bo Grasslo in
[2939.599] 2008, who we've just quoted, suggested
[2942.72] that two years with low temperatures and
[2945.839] lack of sunlight represented the reality
[2949.079] behind the fimble winter myth. Um, and
[2953.76] here you can see insightu archaeologica
[2957.599] um for 2021 volume 15. Um so I will
[2962.16] mention that the myth of the fimbleveta
[2965.2] or mighty winter has its origins in the
[2968.319] poetic eta which dates back to the 13th
[2971.72] century. Uh the Norwegian
[2974.119] scienceoriented website
[2977.319] ulukayen.org explains that
[2980.119] thimbleventor is a mythological concept
[2983.599] that depicts a cataclysmic period of
[2986.16] time.
[2987.44] It is described as a grim and terrifying
[2990.48] phase in Norse mythology consisting of
[2994.079] three successive winters devoid of any
[2997.839] intervening summer. During
[3000.76] Fimblevet, the world is gripped by an
[3003.52] unyielding cold and snow descends upon
[3006.96] the earth from all directions, covering
[3009.68] the land in a thick layer of frost and
[3012.72] ice. the once lively landscape
[3016.079] transforms into desolate and
[3018.76] inhospitable
[3022.2] realms."
[3024.599] Um, now the online journal uh
[3029.559] scienceway.no describes work pertaining
[3032.4] to the Fimble Vinter myth and its
[3036.0] possible connection with the 536 AD
[3038.88] event. So this account begins by stating
[3043.319] quote the long harsh fimble fimble
[3046.72] winter is not a myth. Half of Norway and
[3050.48] Sweden's population may have died.
[3054.079] Researchers now know more and more about
[3056.24] the catastrophic year of 536.
[3060.079] In recent years, researchers in Norway
[3062.64] and Sweden have found increasingly clear
[3065.92] evidence of a disaster that struck the
[3068.88] planet 1,500 years ago. The disaster
[3072.96] must have hit Norwegians and Swedes
[3075.28] extremely hard, as hard as the Black
[3078.839] Death. The same may have happened in the
[3081.359] Baltics, Poland, and Northern Germany."
[3085.88] unquote. So, circling back to researcher
[3089.64] Europe, he makes a point I consider to
[3092.72] be critically important with respect to
[3095.44] present-day social policy and planetary
[3099.119] change. And I quote, "Resilient
[3102.48] societies handle stress and crisis by
[3106.48] changing and adapting to new conditions
[3109.44] or simply by absorbing to
[3112.04] shock." Resilient societies. This is the
[3115.28] the the key here. Resilient societies.
[3118.4] They either uh adapt to new conditions
[3121.68] or they absorb the
[3123.559] shock. Therefore, at least two distinct
[3126.16] forms of societal resilience may be
[3129.04] identified.
[3130.599] Adaptive resilience is the ability of a
[3134.319] society to successfully avoid crossing
[3137.839] into an undesirable system regime or to
[3143.079] succeed in crossing back into a
[3146.48] desirable one after a disaster.
[3150.4] Having established that disaster is a
[3153.76] social phenomena as much as a result of
[3157.4] societal, political, economic and
[3160.079] cultural qualities of the stricken
[3163.319] society as of the cause
[3166.28] itself. It is then necessary to
[3168.64] understand the society hit by the dust
[3171.76] veil event.
[3175.68] So to clarify the implications here, the
[3178.48] key concept is adaptive resilience. I've
[3182.0] been making the argument for years that
[3183.92] the status of present- day American
[3185.839] society is woefully lacking in adaptive
[3189.4] resilience due to the incapacitating
[3192.319] presence of a bloated bureaucratic
[3196.359] topheavy parasitical socopolitical
[3199.76] structure devouring the lifeblood of our
[3202.44] nation. By ignoring the reality of
[3206.28] catastrophic natural climate and
[3208.559] environmental change with an exclusive
[3211.119] focus on the anthropogenic
[3213.4] contribution subordinated to a political
[3216.119] agenda which is what we have uh have had
[3219.359] going on for more than three decades
[3221.24] now. We leave ourselves vulnerable to
[3224.24] the inevitable natural shifts that are
[3227.28] no now so copiously documented from the
[3230.8] historical records and the archives of
[3233.839] natural
[3234.839] change changes which I must emphasize
[3238.64] uh natural changes for which we are not
[3242.599] prepared. So, I'm going to devote for
[3245.44] divest for divert for a moment and quote
[3248.76] myself from something I wrote at least a
[3251.68] year ago. And this is what I wrote in
[3254.48] one of the uh one of my newsletters. I
[3257.2] believe it was. It is past time to take
[3260.48] an axe to the oversted colossus embedded
[3264.8] in Washington DC.
[3267.28] With only a few exceptions, firsthand
[3270.079] experience has demonstrated repeatedly
[3272.96] that smaller, dispersed, independent
[3276.559] local and regional associations are far
[3280.0] more effective at responding to
[3282.28] disasters and emergencies than the
[3285.28] sluggish federal
[3287.48] bureaucracies shackled with excess
[3289.68] rules, regulations, restrictions,
[3292.04] procedures, control issues, and
[3294.8] incompetence.
[3296.48] We recently witnessed the consequence of
[3298.88] this bureaucratic overkill in October
[3302.52] 2024 with the catastrophic floods in
[3305.599] western North Carolina. The slow
[3308.24] reaction times and outright
[3310.319] obstructionism of FEMA while local and
[3313.599] private groups quickly mobilized and
[3316.559] went into action. The havoc in North
[3319.52] Carolina still prevails. People are
[3322.48] still struggling to subsist as federal
[3324.559] disaster relief money is bogged down in
[3327.68] a morass of regulatory
[3330.76] quicksand. Here's the thing to think
[3333.0] about. How much could the ability of
[3336.0] North Carolina or any state for that
[3338.8] matter to respond to disasters improve
[3343.44] if the state had more resources at its
[3346.839] disposal? This is an important and
[3349.119] timely question to ask. Well, is the
[3352.72] answer to that? I think the knee-jerk
[3354.64] answer to that is if more resources
[3356.96] resources are needed, then it's up to
[3359.359] the federal government to step up and
[3361.44] provide those resources. Well, I beg to
[3363.92] differ from that. Think about this. Give
[3367.599] Given that the federal government
[3369.28] extracts in the ballpark of 122
[3373.4] billion in cumulative taxes each and
[3376.559] every year just from North Carolina. One
[3379.839] can only speculate what would transpire
[3382.24] if a substantial portion of that revenue
[3385.599] stayed home for North Carolinians to
[3388.48] invest in policies and programs that
[3391.28] served their needs most
[3394.28] effectively. We also saw that uh what
[3397.92] happened in North Carolina was like a
[3399.92] replay of what happened in the aftermath
[3402.24] of Katrina in New Orleans.
[3405.4] bureaucratic characterized primarily by
[3407.68] bureaucratic
[3409.24] inertia. Where this evolving knowledge
[3411.68] of natural disasters in history is
[3413.68] leading to ultimately remains to be
[3416.119] seen. But in the meantime, it is giving
[3418.559] us new eyes with which to perceive a
[3420.64] deeper meaning in the inherited legacy
[3422.72] of our past. An unexpected hint of this
[3425.839] correlation can't help but grab our
[3428.559] attention.
[3430.16] The period from 5 536 to 544 AD, which
[3435.28] we now understand to be a time of
[3437.28] desolation and devastation, a time of
[3440.24] social and natural
[3441.96] stagnation, was precisely the time in
[3445.319] legend that the Knights of the Round
[3447.839] Table set out across the wasteland on
[3451.04] the quest to find the supreme healing
[3454.0] antidote to the decline of both king and
[3457.2] nature. symbolized through the vast
[3460.4] corpus of enigmatic and compelling
[3463.04] literature of the high middle ages known
[3465.52] as the grail
[3467.0] romances and therein represented as the
[3470.24] ultimate object of salvation the holy
[3473.52] grail. It was through the agency of the
[3476.0] grail that the healing and restoration
[3478.559] of both the king and the wasteland would
[3481.599] be accomplished.
[3483.839] So it appears that once again the wisdom
[3486.4] of our ancestors preserved and
[3488.799] transmitted to our own time as myth has
[3492.64] as its basis real phenomena that
[3495.68] profoundly affected those people of long
[3497.92] ago. There are so many rich and valuable
[3501.44] lessons to be gleaned from this fimble
[3504.64] winter event of almost 1500 years ago
[3508.079] that I will be obliged to present part
[3510.799] two in order to to do justice to this
[3515.04] remarkable
[3516.28] story and to demonstrate its possible
[3519.88] connections with the legend of the quest
[3522.88] for the holy grail. Finally, I would
[3526.24] submit that this juxtiposition
[3529.28] uh that we're seeing more and more of of
[3531.839] myth, legend, and scientific validation
[3535.76] is not a coincidence. But if it's not a
[3538.799] coincidence, what is it? Well, what it
[3541.04] is is that we are now recognizing that
[3543.119] there is a legacy of wisdom and
[3545.52] knowledge that we have inherited from
[3548.319] the past. And it is now up to us to
[3552.16] understand and recognize the value of
[3554.079] this information and to begin to uh
[3558.0] study that information in a way that uh
[3561.119] is warranted and uh is uh worthy of that
[3565.28] legacy that we've inherited. So I look
[3568.0] forward to seeing you on the next
[3569.44] episode of Squaring the Circle. I hope
[3571.839] you've enjoyed this uh first
[3574.559] introduction to this extraordinary uh
[3577.28] inflection point within the if you want
[3579.44] to call it Piscian age um of the last
[3582.799] 2,000 years and what we will explore
[3585.92] going forward is what are the
[3588.28] ramifications down through the centuries
[3590.88] for our own time. All right, thank you
[3593.52] again and I'll see you on the next
[3595.28] episode of Squaring the Circle podcast.

Title: 2 Miles of Ice Revealed the Truth About Climate
[0.08] We have in effect been sort of blessed
[2.24] the last 6 to 10,000 years with a
[5.12] relatively stable climate. Once we know
[6.879] that, begin to incorporate that into our
[8.559] thinking, we realize we're going to have
[10.24] to kind of re-evaluate our our models of
[12.48] prehistory. This goes back to the early
[14.4] '9s when glaciologists and
[17.48] paleoclimatologists, guys who study
[19.279] ancient climate, extracted these ice
[21.119] cores from the summit of Greenland. And
[22.72] the reason they went to the summit was
[24.16] because they were looking for the most
[25.359] undistorted ice core record that they
[27.119] could find. Previous ice core
[28.64] extractions had been near the perimeter
[30.24] of the ice sheets. The ice flow is is
[32.399] much more dynamic. So there was more
[34.32] distortion in the records. Basically the
[36.0] the ice sheet there was almost 2 miles
[37.76] thick. It took him 5 years to drill
[40.32] through. It was two miles thick. Yes.
[42.96] Yeah. Think about how far like looking
[45.92] how far 2 miles away is like. What is a
[48.0] plane? A plane's a mile in the air. No.
[49.76] No. Well, a jet's going to be about
[51.28] 30,000 ft. That's a amazingly huge mass
[55.199] of

Title: Are We Saving the Planet or Destroying Ourselves?
[0.08] But what if in the saving of the species
[2.32] you do things that actually will cause
[4.48] the destruction of species? For example,
[6.48] if you shut down fossil fuels, we have
[8.88] no energy. I mean, how do we save
[11.04] species? People can throw up their hands
[12.8] in despair if they believe the narrative
[16.16] that's been propagated that the fossil
[18.4] fuel consumption, which is increasing
[20.8] carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, is
[23.6] capable of triggering a major climate
[27.32] apocalypse. But it's not. It isn't. No.
[30.96] Does it cause changes in the
[32.48] environment? Yes, it does. But a lot of
[34.8] things do. And the role of carbon
[37.92] dioxide as the control knob on the
[40.879] climate has been way
[43.48] overexaggerated in my humble opinion.

Title: This Mesa Was Carved by a Flood
[0.16] This is important, I think, when
[1.52] studying the deposits around Steamboat
[3.919] Rock. Now, Steamboat Rock is generally
[6.56] not defined as a messa, such as you
[8.72] would find in the southwest. The scale
[10.559] of it, it it is very messike. It's wider
[13.599] than it is high. So, we're looking at
[15.599] Steamboat Rock here, which is an example
[17.76] of what could be defined as a mesa. When
[19.92] you scroll in, notice the cliff in the
[21.76] background. That cliff is also 800 ft
[24.64] high. Prior to the flood that was a
[26.96] continuous that void of 800 feet removal
[30.48] of bedrock had not happened. The floods
[33.28] that came through there stripped away
[35.76] 800 ft of rock and behind photograph
[39.12] there there's another cliff. So you have
[40.96] two pairs of cliffs and then standing
[42.719] out midstream you've got this 800 ft
[45.2] high. Typically this is not ever
[47.12] referred to as a mea and yet if you go
[49.2] to the southwestern desert you can find
[51.44] meases. for example, down there in in uh
[54.079] O Monument Valley that are basically the
[57.039] same height and the same width and the
[59.12] same length as this outcrop right here.
[61.6] But no one really suggests that they
[64.08] were the product of water erosion.

Title: How to Read the Layers of the Earth
[0.08] Once you've looked at a few out
[1.76] southwest, there's lots of really great
[3.919] sandstone outcrops that are wind
[6.319] deposited, sandstone, aolon, and you
[9.36] start looking at photos, videos, actual
[12.32] outcrops in the field. After you've
[14.32] looked at
[15.8] ei deposits, you'll begin to detect the
[18.96] differences. They're kind of subtle
[20.48] maybe at the beginning cuz I mean
[22.4] obviously moving air and moving water,
[24.16] they're both fluids. So you might have
[26.32] see endlacial sediments. That's
[28.24] sediments that are being moved inside
[30.4] the glacier mass. Then you look up there
[33.2] you see lateral or medial morane supra
[37.2] glacial sediments. That's riding on top
[39.44] of the glacier. And then finally you've
[41.44] got at the bottom you've got subglacial
[43.6] till. So that's at the bottom of the
[45.92] glacier. And then you've got at the
[48.32] snout there you've got the outwash
[50.559] sediments. So that melt water coming
[52.96] from under the glacier is moving usually
[55.52] fairly fine grained material forming the
[58.16] outwash. You could look at glacial
[60.76] deposits completely chaotic with no
[63.44] observable structure. Fluial deposits
[67.28] you're going to see structure. You're
[68.64] going to see bedding. You're going to
[70.08] see sediment, layered sedimentary
[72.72] deposits, etc.

Title: Was Lake Missoula Really the Source?
[0.24] origins of the flood was not Lake
[3.679] Missoula which is named after the town
[6.48] of Missoula and the basin of Missoula
[9.519] which would have been the one of the
[11.12] major basins that held the the lake
[13.599] evidence that has been left behind in
[15.599] the landscape mega scale evidence. I am
[19.199] questioning the ultimate origins of the
[21.359] flood. Mega floods which are terrestrial
[24.4] water flows with discharges exceeding 1
[28.0] million cubic feet per second. So
[30.0] there's about roughly 35 cubic feet in a
[32.8] cubic meter. What that means is if you
[35.12] multiply 1 million * 35 you're going to
[38.32] get about 35 million which is pretty
[40.719] much right in the ballpark of the
[43.52] Bonavville flood. So the Bonavville
[45.44] flood represents kind of the lowest
[47.68] stage volume of what is now defined as a
[50.399] mega flood. So say 35 million cubic feet
[54.239] per second and then up to flows during
[57.12] the Missoula flood that were up to
[59.32] 300400 million cubic feet per second
[62.0] which is an order of magnitude greater
[64.0] than the Bonavville flood.

Title: The Key to Building on the Moon
[0.08] If hydrogen were available on the moon,
[2.879] then the mass needed to be brought back
[5.279] from the earth would be significantly
[8.0] reduced. Now, this is in terms of if
[10.24] we're going to create water, obviously
[12.719] you need hydrogen to create water,
[15.12] right? And the mass payback would be
[17.52] greatly improved. But the only plausible
[21.199] near-term source of the needed amounts
[23.76] of hydrogen on the moon is polar ice.
[28.32] Logistic considerations make the moon a
[30.96] very attractive base of operations.
[34.64] If, and this is a big if, if ice is
[37.84] abundant in the lunar polar regions,

Title: Missoula’s Floods Made Katrina Look Like a Trickle
[0.0] Do you know what the highest amount of
[2.24] water flowing or flood flows there was
[4.56] during Hurricane Katrina or other modern
[7.68] flooding events? See, that's a little
[9.28] different because like with Katrina,
[11.44] you've got a storm surge, right? And you
[14.0] know, it's going to be an extraordinary
[15.519] volume of water that's being pushed
[17.68] ashore by the high pressure storms. The
[20.16] largest lake Missou outbursts were in
[21.92] the range of 10 to 20 spur drops. A spur
[25.039] drop is the measure, the unit of measure
[27.439] used to measure ocean current. So one
[30.24] spur drop equals 1 million cubic
[32.8] meters/s and a cubic meter again is
[35.44] about roughly 35 cubic feet. So you got
[37.92] about 35 million cubic feet per second.
[40.48] That's one spur drop. So the Bonavville
[42.64] flood essentially it's just roughly the
[45.44] same size as the standard unit of
[48.239] measure for measuring ocean current. Um
[50.64] if that's helpful at all. Now if you've
[52.719] got a volume 10 times that like 350 to
[55.44] 400 now 350 that's the flow out through
[59.76] a lula gap that is the estimated flow
[63.039] for grand at its peak. Now how
[65.84] does that compare? It's difficult to say
[68.159] because you know clearly like a tsunami
[70.96] coming ashore is a very short-lived
[73.119] event and I don't know if I've ever seen
[75.2] anybody trying to calculate the total
[78.4] volume of a tsunami. I mean, I imagine
[80.88] you could and it's probably been done
[83.52] that are only now being fully understood
[86.96] and I would say being understood but not
[90.0] yet fully.

Title: The Mega Floods That Rewired North America
[0.76] anastimosing. So there's an example of
[4.04] anastimosing, a branching stream
[6.799] pattern, anastimosing rivers, a review
[10.48] of their classification, origin, and
[12.4] sedimentary. The channel Scabland of
[15.12] eastern Washington is a complex of
[18.279] anastimosing rock cut fluial channels.
[21.52] Fluial means flowing water. These flows
[24.72] deeply inundated the Colombia gorge and
[27.92] the Wamut Valley before discharging into
[30.24] the Pacific Ocean. Other late glacial
[32.8] mega floods occurred along the margins
[34.96] of the great ice sheets that formed
[37.2] during the pleaene in North America,
[40.28] Eurasia and South America. River basins
[43.92] connected to these ice sheets were
[46.64] impacted by the flooding such that
[49.12] invasions of water changed drainage
[52.199] patterns, enlarged valleys, and
[55.52] delivered huge fluxes of water and
[57.92] sediment to the oceans. Numerous
[60.52] spillways were flood integrated into
[64.0] temporary rivers in parts of North
[66.92] America such as the St. Lawrence, the
[70.159] McKenzie, the Yukon, the Mississippi and
[73.2] Columbia rivers. The late pleaene mega
[76.0] floods are associated with a broad range
[78.64] of hydraologic and climatic changes that
[81.68] are only now being fully understood. Do
[84.24] it.

Title: Missoula and Bonneville Were Just the Beginning
[0.0] Here's North America and there was the
[2.96] situation at the end of the last ice
[4.839] age. Of course, this is not truly
[7.12] accurate because this is showing the
[8.72] current coastlines of North America,
[11.04] which would not have been the case when
[12.639] you had all this ice piled up.
[14.32] Coastlines would have been far seawward.
[17.039] These all represent great flows of
[20.24] water. So I've investigated the Vallis
[22.4] Calderas overflow, the Silver Lake, Soda
[24.8] Lake, Manley flows, the Bonavvilles, the
[27.279] Missoula, the Aabaska, the Living Stone
[30.0] Lake. We have explored the regions
[31.84] affected by the two greatest
[33.28] acknowledged floods in the history of
[34.96] North America, the Great Missoula and
[36.96] the Great Bonavville. Now the key word
[38.48] here is acknowledged. Now this was
[40.239] written probably 10 years ago. Now I
[42.559] think we have enough proof that we can
[44.239] say yes there have actually been floods
[46.239] with flows greater than the Bonavville
[48.559] for peak dis discharge and raw stream
[51.039] power. These events are not likely to be
[53.199] surpassed. However, the effects of mega
[55.28] scale catastrophic floods are by no
[58.0] means limited to the region directly
[60.48] affected by these two floods. It will be
[62.879] the purpose of this episode of the saga
[64.879] to elucidate the myriad e effect effects
[67.6] of colossal floods on a variety of
[69.84] landscapes around the remainder of the
[72.24] North American continent and to
[74.08] demonstrate the probability that the
[76.159] Missoula and Bonavville floods were
[78.08] actually a limited regional
[79.96] manifestation of a much larger That.

Title: Plato’s Myth of Phaeton
[0.08] What does Plato say? Fatan the son of
[3.72] Haleos having yolked the seeds in his
[6.4] father's chariot but because he was not
[8.48] able to drive them in the path of his
[10.16] father burned up all that was upon the
[13.28] earth and was himself destroyed as a
[15.519] thunderbolt. Now this has the form of a
[18.4] myth but it really signifies a
[20.84] declination a declining of the bodies
[23.92] moving around the earth and in the
[25.68] heavens and a great conflration of all
[28.96] things upon the earth recurring at long
[31.76] intervals of time. This is how Plato
[34.239] actually begins the account of Atlantis
[37.36] is by referring to this myth of the
[40.16] earth having this encounter with what is
[43.52] undoubtedly a celestial object.

Title: The Golden Ratio Is Built Into You
[0.16] artists came to understand a golden
[2.36] rectangle will perfectly frame the face,
[6.16] the height. Because you notice if your
[8.8] face was as wide as your head was tall,
[12.8] again, you would look strange. So, and
[15.44] then you can divide that rectangle. If
[19.279] you think if you've enclosed your head
[21.119] into a vertical
[22.92] rectangle, golden rectangle, then if you
[26.24] lop off a square, what's left is another
[30.08] golden rectangle.
[32.239] So the square defines your brow ridge
[36.239] like this. From your chin to your brow
[37.92] ridge would be a square. What's left
[39.92] over up here is another golden
[41.48] rectangle. But you can subdivide the
[44.079] features of the face according to the
[46.64] golden ratio. So you find it in your
[48.8] height in the division of your navl. You
[51.2] find it in your forearm.

Title: How Many Warnings Do We Need?
[0.16] That's what just missed us last June.
[2.72] Just missed us by a by a whisker. And
[5.359] we're sitting here, you see, completely
[8.28] oblivious. That almost every month,
[11.28] every couple of months, the it's like
[12.639] the cosmos is going, "Hey, you. Hey,
[14.88] hey, here's another here's another shot
[17.68] across the bow. How many is it going to
[20.279] take before you
[22.92] guys, you know, look upwards?" I am
[26.4] afraid what's going to have to happen is
[27.92] we're going to have an impact. Listen,
[29.359] I'd settle for one. I think we had an
[30.88] impact the size of Tangusa.

Title: From Pollution to Progress
[0.08] We've cleaned up a lot of the pollution
[1.92] here in America, which is a good thing.
[4.16] Back in the 70s, you couldn't fish or
[6.24] swim in the Hudson River, for example.
[8.559] There was a lot more pollution. But
[10.639] America was in the final waning stages
[13.599] of that first phase industrial
[15.519] revolution coming out of World War II.
[17.92] We progressed and one sign of that
[19.68] progression is we developed the
[21.52] technologies to not create a big
[23.92] polluting footprint in the environment
[26.0] which I think is the natural progression
[27.76] of an evolving scientific industrial
[30.08] technological society and that's has
[32.719] been confirmed abundantly since then and
[35.2] now the nations that are coming up
[36.96] behind us who are now relatively where
[40.239] we were at 25 30 40 years ago they're
[43.84] the ones doing most of the pollution.
[45.68] But if we keep evolving, which I think
[48.48] we will, as long as there's not forces
[51.2] of of
[52.36] obstruction preventing us, we will
[55.199] evolve very quickly into a global
[57.8] civilization that is very much living
[60.399] symbiotically with the planet.

Title: A Geologic Guide to Post-Ice Age America | Big Picture Ep 8
[0.24] Okay, Big Picture episode 8, Randall
[3.6] number eight. Number eight. Last week
[5.839] was a bit of a caveat to our normal
[8.32] story. We're talking about your life and
[10.16] kind of what brought you to this point,
[11.759] but now we are back on the path of
[15.04] looking at what could have destroyed the
[17.6] world.
[19.359] Well, it sort of did destroy the world
[21.84] or at least parts of it. Large parts of
[24.4] it. Yeah. Mhm. So, um, we were talking
[28.88] about the Missoula flood, right? We were
[31.679] talking about, uh, the so-called
[33.68] Missoula flood.
[35.28] suggest that it gets renamed to the
[37.36] Cordieran flood for reasons that will
[39.68] become apparent as we continue to talk
[42.719] about it only because I feel like the
[45.12] origins of the flood was not Lake
[49.36] Missoula which is named after the town
[52.079] of Missoula and the basin of Missoula
[55.6] which would have been the major one of
[57.6] the major basins uh that held the the
[60.559] lake. Um, we'll get into that, but we
[63.92] don't need to do that so much right now
[65.519] because I want to kind of cast the net.
[67.68] I want to start from where we left off
[70.0] and cast the net wider. You know, we're
[73.04] about to embark next week on a on the uh
[75.76] Bonavville flood tour. We're going to
[77.6] follow the route of that flood from Salt
[80.56] Lake City north through Red Rock Pass
[84.159] and then we're going to follow the Snake
[85.6] River Canyon. Um, and we're going to
[88.08] follow actually follow the route of that
[90.24] flood. And as we go, we're going to be
[91.92] looking at the evidence that has been
[94.079] left behind in the landscape, mega scale
[97.36] evidence. Um, so we've already spent
[101.119] quite a bit of time talking about the
[102.96] Bonavville flood. So I'll just refer
[105.28] people back to that if they haven't seen
[106.88] it. They can watch that uh or rewatch
[109.52] it. But we're going to go beyond that.
[111.6] We're going to
[112.92] um we're going to get into the
[115.84] continent, the larger continent as a
[117.84] whole, the North American continent.
[119.119] That's where we left off. I think it was
[120.96] episode 6 where you shared a map of all
[124.799] these different potential all these
[126.64] different points across North America
[128.959] that had evidence of mega floods and
[132.08] cataclysmic damage.
[134.16] Well, I'm going to read now. This is
[136.239] from maybe 15 years ago, but it's still
[139.04] of course up to date in the sense that
[142.8] um what was being discovered and
[144.959] reported on for the last 2530 years is
[147.599] all pretty much mostly accepted. Um
[152.0] although I am questioning the ultimate
[154.8] origins of the flood. Okay. But so
[157.56] um this is just some good basic
[159.92] information for people who want to
[161.44] understand the specifics more. So we
[163.44] have here this was from the 2009
[166.0] Portland Geological Society of America
[168.4] annual meeting. Uh and at 2009 I had
[172.319] already been going for at least 11 what
[174.48] are 12 years out exploring the the flood
[178.239] lands of the Pacific Northwest. And and
[180.879] of course also by this time I had gone
[182.72] and visited most of what we're about to
[184.879] look at in the larger view of uh uh the
[189.68] American continent. So anyways, they say
[192.319] this is what they what Victor Baker
[194.239] reports. He says mega floods which are
[196.879] terrestrial water flows with
[199.239] discharges exceeding 1 million cubic
[202.0] feet per
[203.159] second. So I'm sorry, 1 million cubic
[207.28] meters per second. So there's about
[210.239] roughly 35 cubic feet in a cubic meter.
[213.28] Yeah. So what that means is if you
[216.28] multiply 1 million times 35, you're
[219.44] going to get about 35 million, which is
[221.76] pretty much right in the ballpark of the
[224.799] Bonavville flood. Maybe a little more.
[227.2] We talked about between 35 and 40
[229.28] million. So the Bonavville flood
[231.44] represents kind of the lowest stage
[233.879] volume of what is now defined as a mega
[236.72] flood. So say 35 million cubic feet per
[240.48] second and then up to uh flows during
[244.08] the Missoula flood that were up to 300
[246.68] 400 500 million cubic feet per second.
[250.4] So in order I'm a little horsearse today
[254.28] um which is an order of magnitude
[257.04] greater than the Bonavville flood. So
[259.519] you can see there let's just in round
[261.12] numbers 40 million Bonavville say 400
[264.16] million from Missoula or Cordiieran
[266.56] flood. Yeah, like the flow that might
[268.8] have cut Grand Coulie for example, I
[271.52] that's estimated at about 300 to 350
[274.56] million. The discharge through Ula Gap
[277.36] in about the same uh magnitude the flow
[280.8] coming down the Spokane Valley northeast
[285.12] between Lake Pere in northern Idaho and
[288.0] Spokane, Washington. that reach in
[290.24] there, according to Baker's calculations
[292.4] way back in 1973 that haven't been
[295.28] disputed, are up to around 700 to 800
[298.479] million cubic feet per second. Oh my
[300.4] god. Yeah. So that's like 20 times the
[303.12] volume
[304.36] of the Bonavville
[306.84] flood. So anyways, they're the largest
[309.44] known freshwater floods with flows
[312.88] comparable in scale too, though of
[314.96] shorter duration than ocean currents. So
[318.72] you almost have to imagine ocean c
[320.96] oceans moving over the land to start to
[324.24] try to get a a concept of the scale of
[327.36] the thing off thousands of feet deep and
[329.84] miles wide. Yes. Although and I should
[332.72] actually probably go to presentation
[334.88] mode. Although there are no modern
[338.96] examples of mega floods. Thank God.
[342.24] Because if we if there was a mega flood
[344.56] such as what occurred at the end of the
[346.08] last ice age anytime within the last
[348.32] 5,000 years, it would be the most
[351.44] stupendous event that had happened in
[353.52] human history far and away. Um although
[357.52] there are no modern examples of mega
[359.199] flood, such flows occurred during major
[361.6] periods of glaciation.
[363.84] A prominent example is the paleo
[366.24] flooding caused by lake pletosene
[369.319] outbursts from glacial lake Missoula
[372.479] which formed when the purscell trench of
[374.72] the cordieran ice sheet extended south
[377.919] from British Columbia to the basin of
[380.08] modern Pere Lake in northern Idaho.
[384.8] The ice thereby impounded the Clark Fork
[388.479] River drainage to the east, forming a
[391.12] lake extending into western Montana with
[394.08] a volume of about 2500 cubic kilm. Oh
[397.68] my, which is about 600 something yeah
[401.6] 600 uh cubic miles and a depth of 600 m
[405.68] at the dam. So if I say 600 and a meter
[410.56] is 3.28 28 ft. That gives us uh just
[415.12] under 2,000. Although since 2009, a
[419.68] number of traces of higher shorelines
[422.8] have been found. So it appears that the
[425.12] water at the region of the dam may have
[428.08] uh risen to a height of about 2100 to a
[430.96] depth of about 2100 ft, but only for a
[433.599] very short while. So it was like the and
[437.12] and of course it has to be borne in mind
[439.199] that the water level was constantly
[441.12] fluctuating throughout the whole
[443.24] process. But it seems like that um
[447.24] 4,250 ft above sea level was the highest
[450.479] that the water ever rose. It was uh only
[453.52] there for a short time. So, it didn't
[455.919] create a really uh prominent shoreline
[459.199] or strand line, but it did leave enough
[461.36] to show that the water apparently did
[464.28] temporarily reach that height. And then
[467.199] it seemed to stabilize at about uh 4,200
[472.16] ft above sea level throughout the entire
[475.36] basin. So, short time meaning a day, a
[478.56] week, a month less. Well, yeah. Some
[481.599] probably somewhere between a day, a few
[484.319] days, and a and a week or two probably
[486.4] at the most because any longer than
[488.56] that, the the shoreline would have been
[491.039] much more prominent than it is. Okay. D
[494.8] quick comparison for the just the scale
[498.4] of flood flows. Do you know what the
[499.919] highest amount of uh water flowing or
[503.199] flood flows there was during Hurricane
[505.039] Katrina or other modern flooding events?
[508.16] See, that's a little different because
[510.72] like with Katrina, you've got a storm
[512.479] surge, right? And you know, it's going
[514.64] to be an extraordinary volume of water
[516.719] that's being pushed to shore by the by
[519.279] the high pressure
[520.599] storms. But what it's like right here at
[523.919] um the lake, the largest Lake Missou
[526.959] outbursts were in the range of 10 to 20
[529.04] spur drops. A spur drop is the measure,
[532.16] the unit of measure used to measure
[534.48] ocean currents. So one spur drop equals
[538.16] 1 million cubic
[539.959] meters/s and a cubic meter again is
[542.8] about roughly 35 cubic feet. So you got
[545.68] about 35 million cubic feet per second.
[548.32] That's one spur drop. So the Bonavville
[551.2] flood essentially is roughly the same
[554.32] size as the standard unit of measure for
[558.16] measuring ocean currents. Um if that's
[561.36] helpful at all. Now if you've got a
[562.959] volume 10 times that like 400 350 to 400
[566.959] now 350 that's the flow out through a
[570.88] lula gap that is the uh estimated flow
[575.12] for grand at its peak Moses
[578.16]  at its peak
[580.72] and um now how does that compare uh it's
[584.8] difficult to say because you know
[586.64] clearly like a tsunami coming ashore is
[589.6] a very short-lived event. And I don't
[592.56] know if I've ever seen anybody trying to
[594.64] calculate the total volume of a tsunami.
[598.399] I mean, I imagine you could, and it's
[600.88] probably been done. Um, maybe if you
[604.399] were to look at chevrons and get an area
[608.16] and then figure out a depth. Um, I know
[611.68] that the Madagascar chevrons, the depth
[614.079] was in excess of 600 ft. Yeah, we looked
[616.72] at that. I think we looked at that the
[618.0] first or second. Yeah. Right. So I would
[621.68] imagine you you could come up with some
[623.839] some idea of the total volume of a of a
[627.2] great tsunami that AI has some type of
[631.04] answer for us.
[633.68] You think AI is
[637.92] I don't know. We'll see. But we'll let
[639.36] it search do some research here. Okay.
[642.48] So the Missoula floods were responsible
[645.36] for generating the channel scab land of
[648.24] east central Washington state a complex
[651.12] of anastimosing rock cut fluial
[653.839] channels. What do we mean by
[655.72] anastimosing? I'm not sure. Okay. So
[659.04] anastimosing simply means branched. It
[661.2] it you have like a main channel that
[663.68] separates into multiple channels. Then
[666.0] those multiple channels may converge
[668.32] back into single channels. So it's a
[670.959] it's a branching pattern of streamfall.
[673.92] If you looked up an branching, it'll
[676.32] tell you I'm sorry, anastimosing.
[679.519] Anastimos. N A S T O M O S I N G.
[685.04] Anastimosing. So there's an example of
[688.839] anastimosing. A branching stream
[692.2] pattern. Uh anastimosing rivers. a
[696.88] review of their classification, origin,
[698.88] and set of entry.
[701.12] Oh, here's a good one. Yeah, there there
[702.8] you go. That's a perfect example of of
[705.44] uh
[706.68] anastimosing. So,
[710.12] uh the channel Scabland of Eastern
[713.44] Washington is a complex of anastimosing
[717.12] rock cut fluial channels. Fluial means
[720.24] flowing water. These flows deeply
[724.24] inundated the Colombia Gorge and the
[726.8] Wamut Valley before discharging into the
[729.2] Pacific Ocean. Other late glacial mega
[732.48] floods occurred along the margins of the
[734.72] great ice sheets. This is what we're
[736.72] going to be looking into now. Other late
[739.04] glacial mega floods occurred along the
[741.2] margins of the great ice sheets that
[743.36] formed during the plea to scene in North
[745.8] America, Eurasia and South America.
[750.639] River basins connected to these ice
[753.279] sheets were impacted by the flooding
[756.24] such that invasions of water changed
[759.36] drainage patterns, enlarged valleys, and
[763.36] delivered huge fluxes of water and
[765.76] sediment to the
[767.32] oceans. Numerous spillways were flood
[771.68] integrated into temporary rivers in
[775.279] parts of North America such as the St.
[778.56] Lawrence, the McKenzie, the Yukon, the
[781.44] Mississippi and Columbia rivers and in
[784.399] Eurasia and I won't necessarily the
[786.88] Neper vulga yi yanisai
[790.68] theish
[792.44] the others the late pleaene mega floods
[796.0] are associated with a broad range of
[799.04] hydraologic and climatic changes that
[802.24] are only now being fully understood and
[805.68] I would say being understood do it but
[809.279] not yet fully.
[811.639] Okay. All right. So, here's North
[813.92] America and there was the situation at
[816.88] the end of the last ice age. Of course,
[819.36] this is not truly accurate because this
[821.279] is showing the current coastlines of
[823.04] North America, which would not have been
[825.6] the case when you had all this ice piled
[827.6] up. Uh coastlines would have been uh far
[832.88] seawward. Mhm. But this is the uh is the
[837.6] graphic you were talking about. Exactly.
[839.839] These all represent great flows of
[843.04] water.
[844.839] Uh
[846.519] and yeah, there's I don't even this is
[849.68] not even comprehensive, but we did go
[852.88] over this, so we won't spend a lot of
[854.88] time looking at it. Let's see. So, I've
[857.279] investigated the Vallis Calderas
[859.199] overflow, the Silver Lake, Soda Lake,
[861.279] Manley flows, the Bonavville, the
[863.839] Missoula, the Aabaska, the Living Stone
[866.8] Lake. Uh I've not gotten up here to do
[869.6] the Lake Agaze super flood or the
[871.68] McKenzie River floods, but u the
[875.199] Superior floods, the Ontario mega
[877.12] floods, Lake Wisconsin, all of the
[879.04] others I've personally investigated in
[881.279] the field. And how long has it been
[883.6] since you started investigating in the
[885.519] field? Oh, in the 90s, you know, the
[888.24] 90s, I spent 20 years studying it. And
[890.72] then finally in the 90s, I started
[892.399] getting the resources and the time that
[894.16] I could actually do what I'd been hoping
[896.72] to do long before, which was get out in
[899.199] the field to personally investigate and
[901.76] learn directly from uh you know, a
[905.76] direct observation.
[911.16] Hum. So we have explored the regions
[914.48] affected by the two greatest
[915.92] acknowledged floods in the history of
[917.6] North America. The great Missoula and
[920.16] the Great Bonavville. Now the key word
[921.68] here is acknowledged. Now this was
[923.68] written probably 10 years ago. Now I
[926.48] think we have enough proof that we can
[928.16] say yes, there have actually been floods
[930.079] with flows greater than the Bonavville.
[933.04] Okay, some of which are in are listed
[936.639] right here. Uh for peak dis discharge
[939.6] and raw stream power, these events are
[941.68] not likely to be surpassed. However, the
[944.399] effects of megascale catastrophic floods
[947.199] are by no means limited to the region
[949.68] directly affected by these two floods.
[952.72] It will be the purpose of this episode
[954.48] of the saga to elucidate the myriad e
[957.199] effect effects of colossal floods on a
[959.68] variety of landscapes around the
[961.519] remainder of the North American
[963.44] continent and to demonstrate the
[965.48] probability that the Missoula and
[967.6] Bonavville floods were actually a
[969.519] limited regional manifestation of a much
[972.399] larger
[975.72] event. So we'll just get right into it.
[979.759] I think most people know the you know
[982.36] pleaene epoch of the quitterary the
[985.44] these two together is the quaternary
[987.6] comes after the plyiosene characterized
[990.399] by the appearance and reoccurrence of
[992.16] ice ages after the relatively mild
[994.72] plyiosene the epoch in which human
[997.12] beings emerged the pleaene began about 2
[1000.88] million years ago and ended about 10,000
[1003.44] now since I did this put this together
[1006.16] again like I said probably 10 12 years
[1008.8] ago anyway way. This number here is now
[1011.759] more like 2.6 million. Uh, and this one
[1015.44] has now been pretty precisely refined to
[1018.24] 11,600
[1019.759] Mhm. years ago. In fact, you know what
[1022.32] I'm going to damn
[1023.559] do? I'm just going to do this in real
[1027.439] time. In real
[1029.72] time, I'm updating my show. Uh, here
[1035.28] we'll go. How long was the ply scene?
[1038.4] Oh, let's see. The plyiosene was what
[1040.72] went back to 5 something million years.
[1043.679] So, it was over three million years. So,
[1046.319] previous to the plyasine, was there a
[1049.44] more volatile climate with ice ages?
[1052.799] Uh there, yes, there have been, but not
[1054.72] immediately before. Okay. Um what what
[1058.48] kind of marks the divide between these
[1060.4] heats?
[1062.32] Well, okay, that's been an evolving
[1064.799] process. used to be it was looking for
[1067.84] an area where nothing had happened.
[1070.919] So what that means is let's say you've
[1073.52] got uh you know a million years Mhm. and
[1077.52] something happens to start it and
[1079.12] something happens to end it. But in
[1081.36] order to define it, what they were
[1083.039] looking for originally was some horizon
[1086.48] where nothing happened and say, okay,
[1088.64] this is the
[1091.08] pioene, this is the eosene, this is the
[1094.2] illegene, right? Well, what's changing
[1098.4] now is that the horizons are more and
[1100.799] more being used as the the lines of
[1105.559] demarcation. And the the these are where
[1108.799] something did happen like at 11,600
[1112.559] years ago something did happen. Yeah,
[1114.4] there was a major melting event. It was
[1116.559] associated with I think the final uh
[1119.44] collapse of the megapona ecosystem. It
[1122.88] also was associated with a rapid pulse
[1125.039] of sea level rise. It was also
[1127.28] associated with a spasm of really fast
[1130.32] warming that jerked the planet out of
[1133.039] the ice age. there was a bunch of stuff
[1135.039] that sort of collected around that
[1137.4] 11,600 year ago date. Right? So now that
[1141.12] is an event horizon, you know, the the
[1142.96] the the upper younger dest boundary. The
[1146.559] lower younger dus boundary is an event
[1148.64] horizon. We can go in and we can see now
[1151.679] more and more I think you could say the
[1153.52] trend is getting to defining the epochs
[1158.24] according to when did something happen
[1161.12] rather than let's define the epoch as
[1164.16] much as we can in the middle where
[1166.48] nothing was happening. See I see. Yeah.
[1170.16] Does that make sense? Yeah. So it's
[1172.32] essentially marked around where there's
[1175.28] been large events that changed the
[1177.2] correct climate at Yes. drastic rate.
[1182.52] Yes. Okay. Uh ooh some more flood French
[1186.72] for us. Yeah. Aluvial pertaining to or
[1190.559] composed of alovvium which simply means
[1193.52] deposited by a stream or running water.
[1196.799] Alovvium is the general term for
[1199.039] detridal deposits made by streams on
[1202.0] river beds, flood planes, and aluvial
[1204.24] fans, especially a deposit of silt or
[1206.72] silty clay laid down during the time of
[1209.919] the flood. So if I say now when we
[1212.48] looked at the big rock, remember the oka
[1214.72] coast, when I say now that that was had
[1217.679] had depressed, had sunk into the
[1219.84] alovvium, you know what I'm talking
[1222.08] about. And that area of the prairie
[1224.48] there, you dig down through the layer of
[1227.919] of sod vegetation and it's alvium. How
[1232.559] thick it is, I'm not sure. It probably
[1234.159] varies throughout the pathway, but it is
[1236.36] aluvium. And then an aluvial fan, um,
[1240.64] you know, people can look at this for
[1242.24] themselves.
[1243.76] And and you can tell it is alovvium
[1246.4] because of some type of mineral content
[1248.48] in the silt or in the silty clay. How do
[1251.2] people figure out that it's alovvium
[1253.12] versus I guess just geological? Well,
[1256.08] for one thing, I'll show you the
[1257.76] difference. For one thing, alovvium is
[1259.36] deposited by water. So, water tends to
[1263.52] cause
[1264.679] structure. For example, glacial like
[1267.28] till has no structure. I'll be showing
[1268.96] you a picture of some till coming up in
[1271.2] a minute here. Um, usually there's
[1273.44] bedding, there's uh for sets perhaps in
[1278.159] it. there's some type of a structure
[1280.08] that's quite easily identifiable as
[1283.48] water deposit. So it's structural rather
[1286.72] than chemical. Yes, I think it would be
[1289.12] structural rather than chemical because
[1291.679] um I mean it could be from what you
[1294.08] would call a terigenous deposit meaning
[1296.24] it comes from land. It could be a marine
[1299.2] deposit from a storm surge or a tsunami.
[1303.12] Um it's just material that has been
[1306.24] deposited by water.
[1308.48] And I mean it could be any range of
[1312.12] compositions. So it's less, but I mean
[1314.799] obviously if you're looking if you're
[1316.24] going to be looking at a storm surge,
[1318.159] you're going to find marine fossils
[1320.159] within that deposit which will tell you
[1322.679] immediately. Likewise, you know, there
[1325.039] are freshwater fossils that are in lakes
[1328.08] and rivers that could end up in in the
[1331.919] alovvium. Mhm. Um it may be barren of
[1334.64] fossils. Just depend. If you got a flash
[1336.559] flood going across a a desert floor
[1339.84] that's had no uh um marine life on it at
[1344.4] all, you're probably not going to find a
[1346.72] lot of fossils in it. But again, what
[1349.44] you're going to be looking for is
[1351.039] structure. Mhm. The water does a very
[1354.4] different thing than just random
[1356.76] chaotic. Um but when we get down here,
[1359.84] look at this. So you got coluvium. is a
[1362.64] general term applied to loose and
[1364.559] incoherent deposits usually at the foot
[1367.52] of a slope or cliff and brought there
[1369.52] chiefly by
[1370.84] gravity. Talis and cliff debris are
[1373.36] included in such deposits. So again
[1376.679] colvium would be a deposit and it's more
[1379.919] it's gravity in place not water placed.
[1383.36] And again, if you've got a a landslide
[1385.6] or a cliff collapses and it all falls
[1388.44] down, the resulting uh material is just
[1392.799] going to be chaotic. You're not going to
[1394.64] go in there and expect to see any kind
[1397.039] of current structure. Yeah. That's been
[1400.159] any type of coherent pattern. Would this
[1403.2] would colium include windtorms or
[1406.159] something like that? No. No. Okay. So,
[1409.2] just by gravity. Got it. Yeah.
[1411.96] Now, could you have wind? Yeah, I mean
[1414.64] perhaps. But mainly wind deposits can be
[1417.52] an eolon or aolon
[1420.159] deposit. Got it. An aolon deposit. And
[1423.28] and it's actually you can distinguish a
[1425.84] wind deposit from a water deposit. Once
[1429.44] you've looked at a few, like we out
[1432.0] southwest, there's lots of really great
[1434.72] uh sandstone outcrops that are wind
[1437.52] deposited. In fact, put in there uh in
[1440.24] your uh search engine there. Let's see.
[1442.96] Uh sandstone aolon is spelled
[1447.159] Aeo L I A N. Sandstone Aolon deposits
[1452.0] that you should. Yeah. Oh yeah, that one
[1454.08] on the right there, the large one.
[1455.52] That's a beautiful example.
[1461.76] and you start looking at photos, videos,
[1465.679] actual outcrops in the field. After
[1468.32] you've looked at
[1470.4] uh eolan deposits and fluial deposits,
[1473.12] you'll begin to
[1475.2] detect the differences. They're kind of
[1477.039] subtle maybe at the beginning because I
[1479.2] mean obviously moving air and moving
[1480.72] water, they're both fluids. Um,
[1486.08] right.
[1489.6] I can't type for
[1491.559] anything. I'm
[1493.72] sure there's a braided.
[1497.36] Yeah, that's just showing the That's a
[1499.679] good one to pause on though. Right
[1501.4] there. Uh, look at the terms. You're
[1504.799] going to learn a lot of new
[1506.6] terms. Uh, here in Bacon and glacial,
[1509.44] that means within the glacier. So you
[1512.0] might have see endlacial sediments
[1514.24] that's sediments that are being moved
[1516.08] inside the glacier mass. Then you look
[1518.96] up there you see lateral or medial
[1521.72] boring supraglacial sediments that's
[1524.799] riding on top of the glacier. And then
[1527.6] finally you've got at the bottom you've
[1529.279] got subglacial till. So that's at the
[1532.799] bottom of the glacier. Ah yeah. And then
[1535.84] you've got at the snout there you've got
[1538.0] the outwash sediments. So that melt
[1541.44] water coming from under the glacier is
[1544.48] moving usually fairly fine grained
[1547.08] material forming the
[1549.159] outwash. Like you can go in Indiana and
[1552.0] we'll look at this on the on the LAR
[1555.2] maps in a in a minute. We can look at
[1556.799] that. If you look at places like
[1558.279] Indiana, you'll see the terminal moring
[1562.0] uh where the glaciers came to and built
[1564.32] these very hummicky deposits of of
[1567.88] hills. And then just south of there,
[1571.12] it's flat because that's all the
[1573.6] outwash. The outwash is the fine grain
[1575.84] stuff that is discharged from beneath
[1578.559] the glacier and it that pretty much
[1581.44] spreads out and creates a very flat
[1583.96] landscape. We'll see that in a minute.
[1586.24] And then finally, you see down here
[1588.159] where it says terminal moring. Yeah.
[1590.24] Okay. So what this tells you is that
[1592.24] this glacier here has receded a bit
[1595.76] because at one point it's now it was
[1597.679] right down there at the terminal moring.
[1599.76] Okay. And it just melted and that's the
[1601.6] Yeah. And it's receded back because it's
[1603.36] been melting and that melting has
[1605.36] created the outwash sediments. Uhhuh.
[1608.32] And then now let's look at the term
[1610.159] drift. Now, that's kind of an archaic
[1612.12] term because what drift is, it's like it
[1615.52] says, it's a general term for all rock
[1617.679] material transported by glaciers and
[1620.88] deposited directly from the ice or
[1623.679] through the agency of meltwater. It is
[1626.799] generally applied to pletosene deposits
[1628.96] in large regions that no longer contain
[1632.08] glaciers. term originated in the 19th
[1635.52] century. But the key was is they're
[1637.84] looking at
[1639.48] it. You could look at glacial deposits,
[1643.279] you're going to see in a minute,
[1644.559] completely chaotic with no observable
[1647.159] structure. Fluial deposits, you're going
[1650.4] to see structure, you're going to see
[1651.76] bedding, you're going to see uh
[1654.32] sediment, layered sedimentary deposits,
[1657.52] etc.
[1659.2] glacial
[1660.44] fluial, which is the modern term for
[1663.32] drift. The drift was the 19th century
[1666.08] term for this stuff that looked like it
[1668.32] was a combination because it was very
[1670.96] chaotic yet there was still some
[1674.039] structuring which you do not find that
[1676.64] structure in direct glacial deposits.
[1681.12] Okay. So
[1682.36] then the next term is till which is
[1685.88] unstratified drift. unstratified. Again,
[1689.36] no evidence of water
[1691.559] deposition. Deposited directly by a
[1694.24] glacier without reworking by meltwater
[1697.36] and consisting of a mixture of clay,
[1699.52] silt, sand, gravel, and boulders ranging
[1702.32] widely in size and shape. And then the
[1706.48] final term which is saw in the graphic
[1708.32] you pulled up n glacial is contained
[1710.799] embedded or carried within the body of a
[1712.88] glacier or ice ice sheet said of
[1716.08] meltwater streams till drift moing etc.
[1723.32] Now here's a nice little uh breakdown.
[1727.279] Let's go here.
[1729.24] Uh so generally you've got two ends of
[1732.72] the continuum. the processes you've got
[1734.96] erosional and then you got depositional.
[1737.84] If something is being deposited, it had
[1739.919] to have been eroded from somewhere
[1741.44] first, right? So, if we look down
[1744.48] erosional, we have the scab land, which
[1747.039] is butin basin
[1748.6] topography. Um, I think we saw pictures
[1751.2] of that. Sheerwalled canyons and gorges.
[1755.919] Slow erosion tends to make V-shaped
[1758.159] valleys. Catastrophic erosion tends to
[1761.039] leave sheer walls, vertical
[1763.88] walls. Uh coolies and spillways. Well,
[1767.2] coolies are large channels that have
[1771.039] insignificant to no water flow within
[1773.52] them. And the genesis of the is
[1776.0] clearly on a operational scale way way
[1780.36] beyond whatever is present there in
[1783.52] terms of water erosion. Like Grand
[1786.08] Coulie has no flowing water in it. Moses
[1788.72] Koulie has a tiny little insignificant
[1790.96] stream that had nothing whatsoever to do
[1793.44] with the carving of Moses Koulie. Okay.
[1797.24] Spillways. Well, this is where you know
[1800.64] every I you understand that every river
[1803.12] or creek has its own catchment basin,
[1805.44] right? So like right here where we're
[1807.279] at, if we go up to the end of the street
[1809.039] up here, East College, that's actually
[1811.679] the watershed divide between the
[1814.32] Savannah River catchment basin and the
[1817.36] uh Chattahuchi uh river basin. So if you
[1821.039] were to go up there and you were to
[1824.0] start dumping water in the middle of
[1826.48] College Avenue and some flow to the
[1829.279] south and some flow to the north, what's
[1831.6] flowing this way is going to end up
[1833.44] going out to the Atlantic. what flows to
[1836.159] the north is going to end up going into
[1837.76] the Gulf of Mexico. So that's a
[1840.24] watershed divide, right? Yeah. Often
[1842.72] times county boundaries, state
[1844.559] boundaries, and so on are associated
[1847.039] with watershed divides. Okay. Which
[1850.48] could be it could be either the
[1852.72] topographic high or the topographic low.
[1856.0] It for example a river or a creek is a
[1859.279] natural place to have a have a political
[1861.679] divide, right? You own that side of the
[1864.48] water. We own this side. This is our
[1866.159] state. That's your state over there. But
[1868.279] also, for example, if you've got a high
[1872.08] a high area where the water's shedding
[1874.799] off in two different catchment basins,
[1876.799] that's also a logical place because you
[1879.2] could say, okay, we've got this town
[1882.0] here, um, and if you dump pollution
[1885.72] into your watershed, it's not going to
[1889.279] flow into ours because it's flowing the
[1892.48] other way. It's flowing to a different
[1893.6] river. I mean it's it's a logical place
[1896.48] to divide um you know municipal boundary
[1900.159] count boundaries whatever the case may
[1903.72] be. A spillway is going to be uh a
[1908.399] channel that links two different basins
[1911.76] or two different uh watershed divides.
[1914.96] Two different catchment basins. So let's
[1917.44] say you've got a basin here with a rim
[1919.679] around it. Then you got a separate basin
[1921.919] over here that's actually a different
[1923.32] whed and the rain falling here goes this
[1926.64] leads to one river the headwaters of one
[1929.76] river this leads to a different but then
[1932.159] you get a influx of water from whatever
[1935.2] source could be intense rainfall it
[1937.44] could be a melting glacier whatever this
[1939.679] rises up and it rises above the high
[1944.08] elevation that forms the divide now it
[1947.039] spills over and that spill over will
[1950.159] often times then erode and cut a new
[1952.679] channel. And that's what we would think
[1954.799] of as a spillway. Got it. Right. Now,
[1957.679] you also got spillways because when you
[1960.48] had melting, it looks like you had
[1963.679] multiple melting regimes that affected
[1966.88] the adjacent or contiguous landscapes in
[1970.0] different ways. So if you got supra
[1972.64] glacial flow, let's say that you go 500
[1975.679] miles north of the of the margin of the
[1978.24] ice
[1979.0] sheet, like let's say for example, we're
[1981.44] looking at the cordier and we we
[1983.84] conclude that well it looks like a lot
[1986.159] of this water flow originated up near
[1989.679] the Chakaco plateau up by George um
[1994.399] Prince George. Prince George. Yes. Um I
[1997.279] almost was saying up by George Howard.
[1999.36] Uh um way up north there. Way up north.
[2004.48] Prince George. But I you know, maybe we
[2006.72] should start referring to Prince George
[2008.799] Howard. Yes, I think we should actually
[2012.08] when we introduce him at the uh
[2014.399] Everybody's Give a big round of applause
[2016.799] to our Prince George Howard. Uh sorry.
[2019.919] Um but if you go up there, you you you
[2022.32] make the assumption that that water flow
[2024.88] originated there. Okay. So now you're
[2027.12] talking about melting obviously because
[2030.08] in order to have water flowing you have
[2032.32] to melt the ice. But so let's assume
[2034.799] you've got melting an epicenter of
[2037.399] melting. Couple of things are going to
[2039.36] happen. One, you're going to have water
[2041.12] volume that's going to be able to by one
[2043.44] means or another get through the ice to
[2046.559] the bottom. That's going to become a
[2048.48] subglacial flow. Other melting would be
[2051.52] over the surface. That's going to be
[2053.2] nlacial. Now obviously if you think
[2055.839] about it there's going to be a lot
[2057.839] greater frictional resistance to the
[2059.839] subglacial flow than the surface flow.
[2062.079] Yeah. You just got this free flow in the
[2064.24] air. It's so if it starts flowing it's
[2067.28] going to get to the margin
[2069.0] first then subsequently the subglacial
[2072.639] flows will reach the margin. This is
[2076.0] important I think when studying the
[2077.599] deposits around flathead lake. I think
[2080.399] we can identify where superglacial
[2084.32] deposits
[2086.119] um came in discharging off the surface
[2088.96] of the ice sheet and distinguish those
[2091.359] from subglacial deposits that came
[2095.24] afterwards after the surface depos flows
[2099.92] had already created a substantial volume
[2102.64] of water. Um anyways, let's go on with
[2106.0] this. So we've got strand lines and
[2107.599] shorelines. Strand lines is a term for
[2110.079] the for the fossil shoreline. Uh dry
[2113.56] cataracts, these are the recessional
[2115.76] cataracts we've talked about frequently
[2118.16] that the the sheer power of the streams
[2121.2] flowing over the precipice uh pluck and
[2126.0] quarry the material off the cliff face
[2128.96] causing the uh the cataract to recede.
[2133.68] And that's basically what we have
[2135.359] happening up at Niagara Falls. But it
[2138.24] this is at obviously a much slower pace
[2141.119] than what would have occurred during
[2142.64] some of these mega
[2144.2] floods. Uh then we have butes pinnacles
[2147.68] and pedestals. Now butes um I should
[2151.76] actually also suggest maces. I should
[2154.079] have put that in there. In fact I think
[2156.0] I will add that right now. But all right
[2159.839] good. So, a messa is essentially like a
[2163.32] table and it's it's a uh and again we'll
[2166.48] look at uh if you pull up uh say uh
[2169.76] steamboat rock. Now, Steamboat Rock is
[2173.119] generally not defined as a messa
[2176.24] um such as you would find in the
[2177.839] southwest. And yet, when you look at the
[2180.56] the scale of it, it it is very messike.
[2183.52] It's wider than it is
[2185.64] high. Okay? A messa is an erosional
[2189.64] outcrop that is wider than it is high.
[2193.839] Are you finding anything? Yeah. Yeah.
[2195.359] Yeah. Okay. So, we're looking at
[2196.8] steamboat rock here, which which is an
[2198.64] example of what could be defined as a
[2200.48] mesa now. Yeah. When you when you scroll
[2204.079] in, notice the cliff in the background.
[2206.64] That cliff is also 800 ft high. Yeah.
[2209.839] And prior to the flood that was a
[2212.68] continuous that void of 800 feet removal
[2216.32] of bedrock had not happened. It the
[2219.52] floods that came through
[2221.64] there stripped away 800 ft of rock and
[2226.0] behind the
[2227.56] the photograph there there's another
[2230.079] cliff
[2231.68] right. So you have two pairs of cliffs
[2233.839] and then standing out midstream you've
[2235.76] got this 800 foot high called steamboat
[2239.2] rock because from the air and kind of
[2241.839] has the profile of a boat or a ship
[2245.359] which is immediately an indication that
[2248.8] water uh was the agency of erosion here.
[2253.76] See so that would be a messa. Now,
[2256.32] typically this is not ever referred to
[2258.24] as a mesa. And yet, if you go to the
[2260.16] southwestern desert, you can find
[2262.48] meases, for example, down there in in uh
[2265.68] um Monument Valley that are basically
[2269.04] the same height and the same width and
[2271.28] the same length as this outcrop right
[2273.48] here. But no one really suggests that
[2276.72] they were the product of water erosion.
[2279.359] In fact, the origin of these is is
[2281.599] usually just pretty much glossed over
[2283.76] and
[2284.68] assumed like somehow wind or whatever,
[2287.28] but um we're going to get to that.
[2289.76] That's why we we get through the whole
[2291.68] continent here. So, we've got these
[2294.24] terms here, meases, but pinnacles and
[2297.0] pedestals. A but is about as wide as it
[2300.8] is tall.
[2302.76] Okay? A pinnacle is taller than it is
[2306.16] wide. And a pedestal is a tall pinnacle
[2309.44] rock with a sort of a extended a canal
[2312.96] levered platform on top. Okay. And again
[2317.04] we'll see
[2318.359] examples. Okay. Then potholes is another
[2322.0] erosional form. Uh when you have
[2324.56] extremely fastmoving turbulent water you
[2326.96] get this vortex phenomena and that can
[2329.599] literally drill holes in the bedrock.
[2332.24] Now that's erosional stuff. Now look at
[2334.92] depositional. Well, large gravel beds
[2337.359] and bars, right? Boulder streams and
[2340.72] block fields. I'll show you some
[2342.24] examples of those. Large erratic
[2344.76] boulders, aluvial and debris fans. So
[2348.56] you got a gush of water coming through a
[2350.48] mountain valley and then it opens up,
[2353.119] discharges into a basin. Perfect example
[2355.839] is uh put in Mormon Point, Death Valley.
[2361.92] And there's a beautiful example of uh an
[2364.88] aluvial
[2367.4] fan if you see it from the air.
[2373.28] Let's look.
[2374.92] Boom. Uh let's see. There's probably a
[2377.92] better picture. Actually, I've got some
[2380.48] pictures here that I
[2384.56] I don't know why it has that. That's
[2386.32] okay because I've got pictures that if
[2388.48] we start we get through this we'll see
[2390.079] it. Yeah. Okay. So, you've got fossil
[2392.48] lake beds. Is that like John Reeves
[2395.8] boneyard lake bed in Alaska? Is which
[2399.599] one like that? Uh fossil lake beds. No,
[2402.72] a fossil lake bed is simply a a dry
[2406.32] basin that once held a lake. Oh, okay.
[2410.0] So, it's a fossil. Of course, it can
[2411.52] have fossils in it. Yeah. and oftenimes
[2413.92] does, but it just means that it's, you
[2416.4] know, it's an extinct lake. Makes sense.
[2418.64] And you had large examples of that,
[2421.599] particularly in the southwestern deserts
[2424.4] of very large lakes,
[2426.44] uh, manly lake in Death. You ever been
[2429.92] through Death Valley? I have not. Okay.
[2431.92] So, we're going to have to organize some
[2434.0] I think some tours.
[2436.48] Get boots on the ground, man. Get boots
[2438.48] on the ground. Manley Lake was a a body
[2441.28] of water that filled up Death Valley,
[2443.92] what I believe is probably the driest
[2445.839] place in North
[2447.88] America. Once held nearly 1,000 ft of
[2450.8] water. Wow.
[2453.32] Yeah. Okay. So, another depositional and
[2456.24] this is a little bit giant current
[2458.0] ripples. giant current ripples really
[2460.56] are more more accurately kind of a
[2464.04] combination of erosion and deposition,
[2467.2] but generally I think they're more
[2468.8] depositional than erosional. And they're
[2471.04] usually I think built at the final the
[2473.44] the waning stages of the flood.
[2476.88] Then imbrecation. Do you remember what
[2478.4] that is? I don't. Well, we will we again
[2481.599] we'll see slides. Imbrecation, you can
[2483.52] look it up on YouTube. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[2486.52] Uh, so we've got imbation. We'll show
[2489.92] examples. Then down here, I've got
[2492.4] things that are definitely combinations
[2495.119] of erosion and depositional. It's hard
[2497.28] to draw a line where erosional erosion
[2501.119] stopped and deposition started. So that
[2503.359] includes drumlands, escars, tunnel
[2505.44] valleys, terraces, and benches. Yeah.
[2509.4] Okay. I don't know if this is all
[2511.92] encompassing everything. I'll add to
[2513.68] this if there's more that comes up. This
[2515.44] is you know gives you a good working
[2517.839] basis for
[2520.28] um you know understanding and and
[2522.88] developing the vocabulary to talk
[2525.839] sensibly about this kind of
[2528.119] phenomena right because you know clearly
[2532.44] um you know there's if you're talking
[2534.88] about well imation well if you know what
[2537.599] it is then instantly understand the
[2540.079] implications of im imbcation right
[2544.359] Um, okay. Let's go on here. And we'll
[2547.76] look at examples of that. Yes, we will.
[2552.48] Um, this is a rather interesting map
[2555.119] because it shows um couple of things.
[2558.4] The maximum extent of uh Wisconsin
[2561.72] glaciation. You follow this around um
[2565.68] and you see the hash marks defining the
[2568.319] margins of the ice sheet. And you'll see
[2570.48] that all of the modern Great Lakes are
[2573.319] all non-existent. They are under the ice
[2576.2] sheet. Right? But look, put all of the
[2579.359] Great Lakes together and you still don't
[2581.92] have the volume of Lake Agaze.
[2585.359] This was a massive massive
[2589.64] um body of glacial melt water. Fresh
[2593.92] water, not salt water, not marine salt.
[2596.88] I mean fresh water. Um when we were
[2600.56] taking Graham across the
[2603.4] uh from Portland to Minneapolis,
[2607.04] um one of the last places the last two
[2609.92] places we stopped are actually indicated
[2611.76] by the arrows that you see here. This
[2614.88] was the southern outlet of Glacial Lake
[2618.48] Agassy. Mhm. And that's what formed the
[2620.8] Minnesota River that I've told the story
[2622.72] about so many times. Glacial River
[2624.96] Warren. Yeah. that was 4,000 times
[2627.28] greater than the modern Minnesota. And
[2629.68] when I first beheld that large valley of
[2632.319] the Minnesota, I had this impression.
[2635.04] Okay, so that was that was this
[2637.76] discharge point, the southernmost
[2639.599] discharge point of Lake Agassy. There
[2642.56] was um other discharge points. You can
[2645.52] see Lake Agaze here is connected with
[2648.8] Superior. And then all of the Great
[2651.04] Lakes are interlin. And you can see that
[2653.52] they're discharging over here. Here's a
[2656.0] major discharge going up the St.
[2658.72] Lawrence Seaway out to the ocean. So
[2661.359] this was going over feeding into the
[2664.28] Mississippi which then flowed to the
[2666.56] Gulf of Mexico. Right in here is where
[2669.76] the St. Croy Wild and Scenic River forms
[2672.56] the northern border of Minnesota and
[2674.96] Wisconsin. And you can see that the Lake
[2678.319] Superior lobe discharged down that
[2681.52] pathway and that's where these giant
[2683.76] potholes are. Uh that that was the last
[2686.48] place I took Graham. That was the last
[2688.16] spot we visited on his twoe tour when he
[2692.48] was re researching the mega floods.
[2696.04] Um so this is a kind of a useful map.
[2699.2] Yeah.
[2699.96] Uh and you can see here this glacial
[2702.4] lake Agazy is interconnected with all of
[2704.64] these other lakes up here that
[2706.56] ultimately are discharging north uh into
[2710.079] the Arctic Ocean via what is now the
[2712.88] McKenzie River. The Mckenzie River
[2715.359] occupies a massive oversized valley with
[2719.52] scabland features throughout it. So I I
[2722.079] may have missed this but is glacial lake
[2725.16] Agassine a subglacial lake? Is it uh
[2728.64] formed from the melting of the glaciers?
[2730.88] It's formed directly from the melting of
[2732.56] the glaciers. The question is is the
[2735.68] timing of
[2737.48] that transition from glacial ice to
[2740.56] massive amounts of melt water. Mhm. Um,
[2743.92] not only its timing in the
[2746.359] larger temporal framework, but it's
[2748.88] timing also how long did it take that
[2752.56] volume of ice to melt and form the
[2756.16] volume of water that formed glacial lake
[2758.92] Agassy. Personally, I think it was a lot
[2761.599] quicker than the the standard models of
[2765.92] deglaciation and melting allow for. I
[2768.319] think it was a lot quicker. And um and
[2771.76] that's something we'll be talking about
[2773.599] down the road. Okay. Um but you can see
[2776.64] like right up here you can see uh flow
[2779.359] paths this way. Then you'll see a flow
[2781.44] path down here, flow paths over here. Um
[2786.24] these are showing directions of flow
[2789.52] uh meltwater flow because all of it of
[2792.079] course is headed back to the oceans. So
[2795.04] colossal for set gravel deposits. Now
[2797.599] four sets. You see the tilt. Mhm. Okay.
[2800.56] So, and you can see here that that the
[2802.4] variation in the color shows different
[2805.28] mineral composition, different content.
[2808.0] I've not looked at the provenence of
[2809.92] this. Remember the term providence.
[2812.56] Provenence. Yeah. We have lithology that
[2815.68] tells you what kind of stone. And then
[2817.599] the provenence tells you where it came
[2820.16] from. Basically, where did it originate?
[2823.319] Um so it says this is evidence for giant
[2826.319] flood flows from the melting cordier and
[2828.64] ice sheet. The glacial fluial flooding
[2831.599] did not contribute to the formation of
[2833.599] the channel scab land of eastern
[2835.359] Washington. Instead it discharged into
[2837.76] the straight of Georgia and Vancouver
[2840.52] BC. So this was gigantic meltwater flows
[2845.119] that were flowing down the ra Frasier
[2847.76] River and they're just within the last
[2849.599] few years of some new studies coming out
[2852.44] confirming what I knew in 1999 when Brad
[2855.68] and I traveled down long reaches of the
[2858.48] Frasier River ultimately to its
[2860.8] discharge point. You know the town of
[2862.64] the city of Vancouver is built upon the
[2865.119] massive debris fan that spled out from
[2868.319] the mouth of the Frasier River Valley.
[2870.96] So we followed that and photographed all
[2873.599] the way down evidence of gigantic
[2876.0] floods. That was 1999. Then in 2021, a
[2880.8] team of uh geologists published a paper
[2883.28] saying that it there were catastrophic
[2886.4] flows down the Fraser River. And then
[2888.64] that was followed up by a second study
[2891.44] uh I think it just came out this year.
[2894.0] Um, again confirming more evidence that
[2896.76] confirms mega floods down the Fraser
[2899.28] River because the reason I did is
[2901.68] because we went up to the headarters of
[2903.359] the Fraser up near Prince George and the
[2905.92] headarters of the Colombia. See, this
[2908.079] here is the headarters of
[2910.119] Colombia. No, wait a minute. No, this is
[2913.28] a I'm sorry. This is the Frasier. Yeah,
[2915.76] that's the Frasier. And then we've done
[2918.4] this covered this so we're not going to
[2920.16] get into that. But here you can see
[2922.0] again now when I say this rock was
[2924.68] deposited and it was rice iceberg
[2927.319] rafted. So you're talking about an
[2929.359] iceberg here big enough essentially the
[2932.319] size of a tanker ship. It's floating an
[2935.04] 18,000 ton rock bring hauls it hundreds
[2938.72] of miles from its place of origin and
[2941.28] then sets it gently down on the prairie
[2944.119] into unconsolidated alovvium. And you
[2947.68] can see how the rock sank under its own
[2950.48] weight. And as it sank, you can see it
[2953.04] had a crack in it. It sank and look what
[2956.079] happens. Yeah, it split. The crack
[2957.839] opened up. Now, there's no way that that
[2960.64] if that was transported endlacially or
[2963.72] subglacially, there's no way it would
[2966.079] have survived intact. Yeah. But it was
[2969.119] even you can see here that there's a
[2970.8] fracture line here. There's a fracture
[2972.559] line here. You can see that the corners
[2974.8] are acute angles, sharp angles. They
[2977.52] didn't get ground off. This had to have
[2979.839] been transported via iceberg sitting on
[2982.96] top of an iceberg. And that iceberg is
[2985.599] being swept along in a gigantic flood.
[2989.2] When the floodwaters finally
[2992.119] relax, the iceberg comes to ground and
[2995.68] then the final the the the the launching
[2998.559] of this process would have been
[3000.079] catastrophic, almost beyond imagination
[3002.88] because you've got to
[3004.359] simultaneously rip gigantic boulders off
[3007.52] the so shoulders of these mountains,
[3009.92] megalo them onto the ice sheet while the
[3012.96] ice sheet is being fractured into a
[3014.96] million icebergs and melt the water
[3017.599] that's now going to float those
[3018.96] icebergs. All of that's happening
[3021.52] simultaneous virtually. Wow. The end
[3024.4] process is if is this great rushing
[3027.76] flood is sweeping along in this case to
[3030.64] the south iceberg comes to ground flood
[3034.24] finally drains off. Now that iceberg
[3036.96] huge iceberg probably is going to take
[3039.359] years to melt away. So the final stage
[3043.28] of this process is the iceberg's
[3045.28] melting. As it's melting away, this big
[3047.68] cargo, this giant rock is just slowly
[3050.559] sinking down and then it sits onto the
[3053.28] landscape which is basically soft
[3055.92] because it's saturated with water,
[3058.079] right? So now it sinks and then
[3061.359] gradually the the the mud layers dry and
[3064.96] now it transforms into the modern
[3066.96] prairie. And this is an 18,000 ton road.
[3070.16] That's an 18,000 ton ride if you take it
[3072.64] all together. And then south of here,
[3075.28] when you follow this train to its end
[3078.559] where it where it transforms into the
[3081.119] headarters of the Missouri River, right
[3083.359] at the Montana border, that's where you
[3084.96] see the giant
[3086.2] ripples. And these ripples that right
[3088.64] there, that white line is a mile long.
[3091.68] So these are huge, huge
[3095.079] ripples. and mute testimony as to the
[3099.119] magnitude of this water flow. Now, this
[3101.92] is completely east of the continental
[3103.839] divide. All of this that we're seeing
[3105.359] here, Channel Scablands, Missoula, Lake
[3108.319] Missoula, all of that is to the west of
[3110.559] the continental divide. So, you've got
[3112.72] big flows coming off to the east, other
[3115.119] gigantic flows coming off to the west. I
[3117.359] see. Yeah. Yes. Now, one of the
[3119.92] questions in my mind is that I want to
[3121.92] know what is the exact
[3124.28] timing of those two events. Did they
[3127.599] proceed? Did one precede the other?
[3130.24] Yeah, I would be inclined to think that
[3132.48] they're happening simultaneously. Here
[3134.64] you see the ripple. This is the Montana
[3136.72] line right here. Montana Alberta line.
[3139.68] This is Milk River. Yeah. So, now let's
[3142.64] come to the east. glacial lake spillway
[3145.52] incision and deposition of a coarse
[3147.839] grained fan near I don't know how to
[3150.559] pronounce this
[3151.72] Wattru
[3153.48] Saskatchewan Wattro yeah so this
[3156.64] appeared 1994 in the canadian Journal of
[3159.119] earth sciences the legacy of
[3161.68] catastrophic drainages of proglacial
[3164.88] lakes is a characteristic suite of
[3167.52] erosional and depositional features
[3170.24] spillways generally lack deposits from
[3173.119] floods themselves because of the intense
[3176.079] erosion that accompanied lake drainage.
[3177.839] So again, thinking back to our model
[3179.52] we're talking about. Here's a basin.
[3181.52] Here's a basin separated by a drainage
[3184.0] divide. Water rises up, spills over,
[3186.8] starts down cutting, but what it's doing
[3189.04] in the process is flushing everything
[3191.359] out. So if you go to the other basin,
[3193.599] the downstream
[3195.44] uh lake basin, there you will find the
[3198.44] deposits either forming the floor of the
[3202.4] of the Fossil Lake or there will be a
[3204.88] debris fan spewing out from the mouth of
[3207.52] the spillway. But you'll be able to
[3209.44] distinctly discern that. And you'll be
[3211.76] able to tell from that which way the
[3213.2] water was flowing because on the
[3215.599] upstream basin where it's flowing over,
[3217.599] there's not going to be a a depositional
[3220.319] aluvial fan. That'll be on the
[3221.92] downstream side. Right now, one way
[3225.119] really to help understand these
[3226.96] processes is if you just spend time now
[3230.16] I get an opportunity because you know
[3231.92] building we'll always have cleared
[3233.92] building sites. So you go in and you
[3236.16] clear a building site now you've got
[3237.76] clay or sand or silt matrix. You have a
[3240.88] heavy rainfall. You come back the next
[3243.28] day and there it is a whole channel scab
[3245.92] land landscape laid out in miniature and
[3248.48] you can see everything. Yeah, we were
[3250.0] looking at that the other day. Yeah,
[3252.24] what we were looking at there wasn't
[3253.52] really a good exa and when you see a
[3255.2] good example,
[3256.839] it's unambiguous. It's unmistakable,
[3260.16] right? You'll have all you'll have
[3261.359] recessional cataracts. You'll have
[3263.44] meanders, you'll have debris fans,
[3266.319] you'll have all of it. Well, you may not
[3268.64] have glacial I mean, you may not have
[3270.559] you won't have drumlets. Yeah, drumlands
[3272.8] are unique. You have to have a
[3274.64] subglacial flow and an over a thick cap
[3277.359] of glacial ice because what happens is
[3280.48] normally water flowing free surface over
[3283.44] the ground will seek its own level. It
[3285.68] can't do that under a glacier, can it?
[3288.24] Now obviously that flowing water will
[3291.24] melt, will raise the roof of the
[3293.68] channel. It absolutely will. But it's
[3295.839] still under pressure. And it's that
[3297.52] pressure that then takes and shapes the
[3301.52] till the chaotic till into these long
[3304.8] aluvial forms.
[3309.559] Uh the size and morphology of these
[3312.48] channels are the best indication of
[3314.16] magnitude and duration of these events.
[3318.16] The morphology of the Wattro spillway is
[3320.96] similar to many proglacial lake
[3323.119] spillways in the mid-continent prairies
[3325.2] of Canada and United States. These
[3327.76] channels were rapidly insized by erosive
[3330.48] flows of high discharge. Despite the
[3333.599] problems in quantifying the
[3335.2] characteristics of glacial lake
[3336.839] outbursts, the channels and deposits
[3339.28] themselves provide confirmation of the
[3341.68] impressive magnitude of these events.
[3344.079] Now, there are dozens and dozens of
[3345.92] these huge spillways, right? All the way
[3348.96] from uh the headarters of the Missouri
[3351.599] there by the Milk River ripples, you
[3353.359] come east all the way over to the Great
[3355.76] Lakes, you find dozens and dozens of
[3358.64] these massive spillways, right? Most
[3361.599] people have no clue. And but here's a a
[3365.359] difference. Those spillways that are
[3368.119] mid-continent, they're
[3370.119] traveling, 1200 miles to get to the
[3372.559] ocean.
[3373.68] The channel scab lands are traveling 2
[3377.119] 300 miles. They're also starting from an
[3381.48] elevation 4,000 ft above sea level. So
[3385.359] what's happening? You've got much
[3387.4] steeper like this. Steeper means faster
[3390.319] velocity. Faster velocity is more shear
[3392.96] power, more stream power. More stream
[3394.96] power means far more erosion and moving
[3398.16] of material. All of that. the slower
[3401.04] lower gradient in the mid-continental
[3403.72] region. It's not as erosive. However,
[3407.52] the volumes of water way up there in the
[3410.64] millions of cubic feet per second. It's
[3413.839] just that they're moving over a much
[3415.839] slower, lower gradient, so they're not
[3418.24] as erosive. Makes sense. Yeah. Well, it
[3421.04] does make sense. Um yeah, glacial lake
[3423.839] outbursts occurred in the northern great
[3426.24] plains as ice marginal lakes suddenly
[3428.64] drained forming an interconnected system
[3432.0] of glacial lake spillways. The outbursts
[3434.96] were highly erosive. So an
[3436.88] interconnected system of glacial lake
[3439.52] spill. So it's they're not just going in
[3441.359] isolation. They're actually forming this
[3443.599] whole network that we're really
[3445.76] beginning to see now with
[3447.559] lidar that is kind of laying, you know,
[3450.16] under the top soil, under the the the
[3452.88] glacial debris that was put down. I
[3455.44] mean, again, an important point to
[3457.2] emphasize here is that it's only within
[3458.96] the last few decades that we've really
[3461.44] gotten to this pinnacle of technology
[3463.92] where we can begin to see this stuff. I
[3467.04] mean, it took Jay Harland Brett's 25
[3470.0] years of of laborious uh traveling over
[3475.52] the the the area of the channel
[3477.52] Scablands to make a remarkably accurate
[3480.92] map. But that map now you can see
[3483.839] instantly on Google Earth.
[3486.799] Yeah. Can you imagine if Brett's in the
[3488.72] 1920s or 1930s had a tool like Google
[3491.28] Earth to help him in his exploration?
[3492.96] The world would be different. We'd have
[3494.319] a way different understanding. Oh,
[3495.839] totally. But see, we're there now. And
[3497.839] so, we have these tools. And what these
[3500.0] tools are revealing to us is is
[3502.4] mind-boggling. It's amazing. And it
[3505.04] really throws into bold relief uh some
[3508.0] of the assumptions and mis assumptions
[3510.16] about what may or may not have pass
[3512.319] happened in our own human past on this
[3514.72] planet. Yes. And of
[3516.92] course once you realize that that this
[3520.16] that these mega floods these diluvial
[3522.96] events really
[3525.4] wide uh then you can begin to appreciate
[3528.76] why so many cultures have legends of
[3533.119] gigantic cataclysmic world destroying
[3535.799] floods because the fact is is that a
[3538.4] flow of half a billion cubic feet per
[3540.559] second is going to be world destroying.
[3542.319] Yeah. not planet destroying in a sense
[3544.88] of a supernatural flood drowning all the
[3547.359] highest mountains on earth. But as far
[3549.88] as any survivors of an event like that,
[3553.52] there's very little. There's there's
[3555.52] going to be very few survivors. There's
[3557.28] going to be some cuz obviously here we
[3559.359] are, right? But to a lot of the
[3562.92] survivors, everything that they knew as
[3565.28] their world is gone. It's gone. It's
[3568.72] erased from reality. it's rea erased
[3572.0] from creation itself. And so in that uh
[3577.48] perspective, you wouldn't necessarily
[3579.359] even know if somebody 300 miles away had
[3582.72] survived or you have no way of
[3584.799] communicating with anyone outside your
[3586.799] own group that has survived. Uh travel
[3590.079] well travel is going to be very
[3591.599] difficult because how do you travel
[3593.68] across two or 30 hundred miles of
[3595.52] utterly devastated landscape? nothing to
[3598.799] no food to forage, nothing to hunt. It's
[3601.76] just uh it's just a total wasteland.
[3605.2] Now, give it a few centuries. Yeah. It
[3607.44] what's miraculous is how nature quickly
[3610.319] can begin to restore a devastated
[3613.44] wasteland in the aftermath of a
[3616.0] catastrophe like that. A great
[3618.16] laboratory to watch that unfold over
[3621.04] decades is Mount St. Helens. I made one
[3624.799] visit there. I'd like to make several
[3626.799] more to see what has changed just in the
[3629.44] last what seven, eight, 10 years ago
[3631.76] that I was there. But yeah, there is a
[3634.799] place where we had a couple hundred
[3636.079] square miles that were just rendered
[3637.92] completely barren like the moon. And now
[3640.88] you see by degrees nature is recovering
[3644.88] and restoring, right? You also see some
[3647.92] very interesting aluvial or fluial stuff
[3650.72] going on because uh because now you've
[3653.599] got these layers thick thick layers of
[3656.16] volcanic ash, right? Well, now you have
[3659.04] a rainstorm. The rain is creating a
[3662.16] whole new set of incisions of nasting
[3667.64] channels. Uh you can see all of this
[3670.4] stuff kind of on a median scale, right?
[3673.92] Because you can some of those gullies
[3675.76] now cut into the volcanic ash are 200
[3678.4] feet high. Yeah. Right. But you go in
[3681.04] there and again everything that you see
[3683.119] that really impresses the scale and
[3684.88] variant nature of of water uh erosion
[3689.119] and deposition. Do geologists just not
[3692.559] see this because they don't want to look
[3694.0] this big? It seems like you can see
[3696.4] examples of this at much smaller scale.
[3698.559] So, it's not like we don't understand
[3699.839] the phenomena, but are we just not
[3702.88] looking large enough or as geologist?
[3704.72] That's what I think. I don't think we're
[3705.839] looking large enough. See, this is the
[3707.44] next stage and it's starting to happen.
[3709.68] Like these guys here, Mark Lord, Allen,
[3711.599] Ki, who this was in
[3713.24] 1987. Notice if you read their work,
[3715.68] they're not in any way connecting it
[3717.52] with, for example, the Bonavville flood
[3719.44] or the Missoula flood. They're looking
[3721.68] at it kind of in its own compartment.
[3724.72] Well, you had these big glacial
[3726.319] meltwater spillways. Well, but then I
[3730.319] say now can we
[3732.28] integrate those spillways and are
[3735.359] clearly evidence of catastrophic
[3737.559] melting? If if one of these
[3741.559] uh excuse me, if one of these was
[3744.96] considered catastrophic, then what are
[3747.28] we talking about when we're talking
[3748.24] about dozens and dozens of them flowing
[3750.599] simultaneously? What does that imply
[3752.64] about the melting and the rate of
[3754.48] melting to the great Laurentide ice
[3756.96] sheet to the
[3758.359] north? So,
[3760.28] uh, so now we see what kind of things
[3762.88] would we look for out in the field. Uh,
[3766.559] here you have a giant boulder bar. This
[3769.359] thing is probably hundreds of feet,
[3771.2] maybe a mile long, and it's composed of
[3774.4] probably a few million boulders. And you
[3776.88] can see they're all rounded and they've
[3778.96] been they've been ripped from somewhere,
[3781.68] but they've been transported far enough
[3783.839] that tumbled around. Tumbled around.
[3786.72] Yeah. Then when the water drained away,
[3789.44] it left this as a calling
[3792.2] card.
[3794.599] Uh okay. So this is
[3797.319] Drumland's. Now look at this carefully.
[3799.599] Which way was the water flow?
[3802.88] Can you tell
[3804.88] the tail is downstream? Downstream. The
[3809.039] blunt end is upstream. So this was a
[3811.68] flow from lower left to upper right.
[3813.839] Okay. Oh, okay. I see. Yeah. Yeah. Like
[3817.68] look look right here. You see this is
[3819.2] blunt right here. And then you can see
[3822.559] uh Yeah. This one isn't quite as clear,
[3825.039] but yeah. All of this is a flow. This is
[3828.559] a flow up to the uh to the right. There
[3831.2] you go. Flow
[3833.559] direction. There's another Google Earth
[3836.48] view of the Drumland swarm.
[3839.28] That's a nice one because it gives you
[3840.559] the sense of what a drumland kind of
[3842.559] almost looks
[3843.64] like. Um, and see, here's the thing.
[3846.799] When you're traveling over this
[3848.0] landscape, like I have several times,
[3851.119] you're up in the middle of a drumland
[3852.559] swarm where there's thousands of
[3853.839] Drumlands, but you don't know it because
[3855.68] everything is covered in trees,
[3858.96] right? Yeah.
[3860.359] However, now with liar, it sees through
[3863.44] the trees and you can see what's under
[3864.96] the trees. See? So, it's starting to the
[3869.52] the planet is revealing itself to us.
[3872.24] Excellent example of a braided or
[3874.48] anastimosing stream pattern. This is the
[3877.52] muddy river in Alaska above its junction
[3879.52] with the McKinley River. Note the small
[3881.839] size of the modern water flow compared
[3884.0] to the massive sediment load. So
[3886.319] basically what you had here was a
[3887.68] gigantic meltwater flood that dumped
[3889.68] huge amounts of sediment. Yeah. And then
[3891.68] now the modern river is just, you know,
[3893.48] meandering casually back and forth over
[3896.28] this. Um but the the the old assumption
[3900.64] is that all of this sediment would have
[3902.48] been
[3903.319] deposited, you know, slowly over long
[3905.68] periods of time. And it was probably one
[3908.88] or a few major depositional events that
[3911.92] left that behind. And undoubtedly, I
[3914.16] think it would have been melt water,
[3916.4] glacial meltwater
[3919.64] flows. Um, let's just keep going here.
[3923.559] Um, important work. John Shaw, right?
[3927.28] Bruce Reigns, late Wisconsin subglacial
[3931.119] mega flood paths in Alberta.
[3934.0] Subglacial sheet floods were proposed on
[3936.48] the basis of the landform evidence of
[3938.559] the Living Stone Lake Drumland Field in
[3941.039] northern
[3942.039] Saskatchewan. Such floods require the
[3944.799] release of enormous volumes of stored
[3947.359] water and it is important to demonstrate
[3949.76] that such storage and subsequent
[3951.839] catastrophic releases are feasible. Some
[3954.72] Laurentine subglacial sheet floods were
[3957.119] at least several hundred kilometers wide
[3960.0] and tens of meters deep. So try to
[3962.88] imagine several hundred kilometers wide.
[3966.24] Well, you know, you could be talking
[3967.92] about 100 to 150 miles wide and tens of
[3971.92] meters deep. That could be 50 that could
[3973.92] be 100 m deep. So think of you know a
[3977.92] subglacial river. So mean velocities at
[3981.2] maximum discharge are estimated
[3983.28] estimated to have been at least 5
[3985.4] m/s. Instantaneous discharge is in
[3988.319] excess of 10 the 6 cubic meters. So
[3991.119] that's a million cubic meters/s. So
[3993.2] that's your scar drop. Yep. That's your
[3995.359] unit of measure. So uh in
[3998.839] excess instantaneous discharges in
[4001.92] excess total flow volume of 8.4 * 10 4
[4006.839] km. What that is is that's uh well
[4011.039] what's 84.4
[4013.2] * 10 4th. Well, I can pick up my
[4015.92] calculator right here and I can go 10 up
[4019.76] there
[4020.92] 4 equals
[4023.599] * 8.4 four and what I get is 84,000
[4028.0] cubic kilm and there's roughly five
[4030.88] cubic miles per uh I'm sorry uh reverse
[4036.319] that um a uh the cubic mile contains I
[4042.0] think around 5 cubic kilome. So if I
[4045.68] divide this by five we're looking at
[4048.0] about
[4049.799] 16,800 cubic miles.
[4052.799] Now that divided by 600 the volume of
[4056.16] Lake Missoula. So that's like on the
[4058.319] order of 30 Lake Missoula
[4061.44] discharging under the ice sheep. Oh my.
[4063.68] And mainstream geologists couldn't
[4065.68] handle it. And they made a what I think
[4069.44] is a valid criticism. I think the the
[4072.4] weakness in this theory which is right
[4075.599] here it says uh right here at the key
[4078.0] storage and subsequent catastrophic
[4080.4] release. So the critics said, "Well, how
[4082.88] the hell do you store that much
[4084.92] water? How do you how do you
[4087.799] store, you know, 28 times the volume of
[4091.44] Lake Missoula?"
[4093.599] and John Shaw who came up with
[4096.04] this idea by looking at the Drumland
[4098.88] studying them and seeing to me now
[4101.52] having visited what three or four
[4103.12] different Drumland fields seeing with
[4105.48] with like one of John Shaw's leading
[4109.279] graduate students um Jerome Leman um I'm
[4114.64] you know totally convinced yes they were
[4116.239] created by subglacial floods the weak
[4119.839] point though again and this is where the
[4121.679] critics have savaged John Shaw's theory
[4123.839] is, well, how do you store that much
[4125.799] water? Can you store that much water
[4129.0] subglacially? Well, no. That doesn't
[4131.04] make any sense, does it? I mean, where
[4134.719] how do you store under the ice 30 times
[4137.12] the volume of Lake
[4139.0] Missoula, right? Do you store it on top?
[4141.92] Well, no. We know that that's impossible
[4143.92] because every season you get lakes
[4146.96] forming, meltwater lakes forming in the
[4150.279] summer that quickly drain away through
[4154.96] cracks in the ice sheet and they flow to
[4157.359] the bottom of the ice sheet and they
[4158.799] come out and discharge as
[4161.4] as glacial streams, right? You couldn't
[4165.04] put how do you put 40 time 30 times the
[4167.679] volume of Lake Missoul on top of the ice
[4169.6] sheet?
[4171.359] Can you put it in the middle of the ice
[4173.12] sheet somehow? You see, if it's frozen,
[4175.679] this was the problem in why John Shaw's
[4179.359] theory, even though you look at the
[4181.44] Drumlands, you study the Drumlands,
[4183.359] every single thing points to the same
[4185.679] conclusion, they were formed by
[4187.279] subglacial water flows. The problem is
[4190.08] is that the scale of the Drumland fields
[4192.0] is so huge that it requires massive
[4195.199] amounts of water.
[4196.76] So the storage problem became the weak
[4202.32] link in in acceptance of John Shaw's
[4205.64] work. Does that make sense? Yeah. Well,
[4209.6] here's what I'm getting at. We don't
[4211.84] need
[4213.08] storage because we're talking about
[4215.28] instantaneous catastrophic melting.
[4217.52] There was no storage. It was instantly
[4220.76] melted. Huge volumes of water gushed to
[4223.679] the base of the ice sheet. The ice sheet
[4226.0] is fractured into a million pieces,
[4229.199] right? Huge volumes of ice directly
[4232.0] sublimate into the
[4233.64] vapor state and are spread around and
[4237.04] then begin to rain out. Huge volumes of
[4240.4] rain which I think we can see the
[4242.56] imprints of these incredible rainstorms
[4246.0] in the southwestern de deserts. I've
[4248.32] looked at it in the sonor and I've
[4249.84] looked at it in the Mojave. You can see
[4252.08] it imprinted in the desert. You can see
[4254.159] it imprinted in the basin and range
[4256.4] province of Utah and Nevada in these dry
[4259.76] desert. You can see it in the
[4261.84] Appalachian Mountains of of the southern
[4264.64] southeastern United States. I'm going to
[4266.32] show you some evidence here in a second.
[4268.32] So, let's just keep moving. Let's keep
[4269.92] moving. There are widely divergent
[4272.88] theories on the formative processes of
[4275.679] giant flutings and drumlins. Flutings
[4278.159] are just like drumlins that have been we
[4280.48] saw pictures of them. I'll show you
[4282.08] here. Let me go back. Okay, look up
[4284.0] here. You see these long skinny things?
[4286.64] Yeah, those are flutings. Okay,
[4288.719] divergent theories on the processes uh
[4291.36] for the formative processes of giant
[4293.199] flutings and drumlins. Early where can
[4295.28] western North America invoke variations
[4297.679] of direct ice erosion andor deposition
[4301.28] as explanations?
[4303.92] You know, so the question is how do you
[4305.28] have a a life sheet grinding over the
[4307.36] landscape, pulverizing the bedrock into
[4310.239] thick layers of glacial till at the same
[4313.12] time shaping that glacial till into
[4315.36] these nice aerodynamic forms, streamline
[4318.48] forms. How does that happen? Well, this
[4320.719] is why they've been arguing how the
[4323.36] glaciers do that for a century and a
[4325.36] half and nobody, you know, there's
[4327.199] different theories, different models
[4329.04] come up. Here's maybe how the glaciers
[4330.88] are doing it. Here comes John Shaw says,
[4332.64] "Well, it wasn't directly the glaciers.
[4334.48] It was large volumes of water moving
[4336.32] under the ice that did it." But then the
[4339.04] people are the critics who go, "Yeah,
[4340.88] well, if they're if it's sublacial
[4343.199] floods producing the drumland swarms,
[4345.12] these drumland swarms are fantastically
[4347.6] huge and it requires enormous volumes of
[4350.96] melt water and you can't provide away a
[4354.08] source for that much melt water. So get
[4356.719] the hell out of here." That's pretty
[4358.96] much it. That's pretty much Yes. Okay.
[4362.52] Um, numerous researchers continue to
[4365.28] support these explanations despite
[4367.52] recent work in northern Saskatchewan,
[4370.0] Ontario, Quebec, and the Northwest
[4371.76] Territories. This work has shown that
[4374.44] enormous turbulent subglacial water
[4377.76] flows better account for a variety of
[4380.48] erosional bed forms including giant
[4383.52] flutings, ice cavity fill depositional
[4387.44] forms and some types of drumlet. So
[4390.08] here's your near the headarters of the
[4392.8] Missouri River and you see the river
[4395.36] modern river down here. But the channel
[4397.679] this is the channel that was cut by the
[4400.159] water flows that deposited the erratics
[4404.32] the big the big rock this gives you a
[4406.96] sense of the scale of the water flow
[4408.719] right here. Yeah. Right. Uh, the modern
[4411.76] Missouri River will never go out of this
[4414.84] channel unless it gets deep enough to
[4417.44] overflow the divide,
[4419.239] which it probably will not anytime in
[4423.12] the near future because what's missing
[4426.92] is four or five million cubic miles of
[4429.679] ice immediately to the north. Right. But
[4433.52] yeah, this gives you a sense of the
[4434.88] scale of of uh and and so not far north
[4438.96] of here is where the giant ripples were.
[4441.12] So you can follow the train of the
[4442.64] erratics. You got the the ripples and
[4445.199] then you head into this giant valley and
[4447.76] it's captured what is now the modern
[4450.239] Missouri
[4452.679] River. And then so this is mega scale
[4455.679] streamlined erosion mid-continental
[4457.76] North America. M and you can really
[4460.08] begin to see that you're looking at an
[4462.4] erosion here that's dwarfs Lake
[4466.199] Superior. All of this is headed for the
[4468.4] Gulf of Mexico. Here you can see what
[4470.159] would have been streamlined islands
[4472.48] within the flood
[4474.44] flow. And if you look at these features
[4477.56] here, just like what we were talking
[4480.0] about in the scab lands, the
[4482.84] intermediate material has been removed.
[4486.36] See this if if this flow had continued
[4490.48] these
[4491.56] islands would have been erased away.
[4494.32] Exactly. This was when the uh I was
[4497.44] shooting slide film and then that they
[4500.48] had just installed the uh what do you
[4503.36] call them? The the the security stuff in
[4505.92] the airports. You shot this? Yeah. And
[4509.76] well what happened was the scanners.
[4511.6] Yeah. The scanners up my film.
[4513.84] Yeah. Is what happened.
[4516.08] So, looks like a animation or video
[4519.6] game, an old Yeah, I climbed up on this
[4521.76] prominence, but we're looking out across
[4523.52] a gigantic riverbed, a dry riverbed that
[4527.12] reached from here like this would have
[4528.64] been underwater and you can't Let's see.
[4531.92] Are you standing on the top of the other
[4533.679] peak? I'm standing I took this picture.
[4535.92] So, I'm standing above these guys
[4538.159] looking out across this uh this river a
[4543.12] fossil river bottom. Yeah. But here's
[4545.92] what you can It doesn't show up here
[4548.08] because the picture got screwed up, but
[4551.92] yeah, you can see then from the air,
[4553.679] this is what you've got. Yeah. Wow.
[4555.199] Giant ripples. Aerial view. Giant
[4558.0] current ripples in the Mojave Desert
[4560.239] near Kadis Dry Lake bed. So again, this
[4564.159] kind of stuff is all over and nobody has
[4566.4] really paid any attention to it.
[4568.8] Geologists generally aren't looking at
[4571.36] surface stuff. They're not, you know,
[4573.52] most geologists are working in industry
[4575.44] or for government and their objectives
[4578.64] are totally different. Find oil. They're
[4580.719] prospecting for hydrocarbons for
[4582.64] precious metals. Um, you know, they're
[4585.679] looking studying the water flow through
[4588.0] the through the bedrock because they're
[4590.08] wanting to know, you know, the depth of
[4592.64] aquifers, um, how much water might be
[4595.76] available, you know, all that kind of
[4597.679] stuff. But it it doesn't really lead
[4600.0] into the question of well was were these
[4603.28] land features created catastrophically.
[4606.96] So most mainstream geologist work is
[4610.08] about what can we extract from pretty
[4612.719] much the earth and most of the
[4614.8] geologists that are like doing this kind
[4616.96] of work are doing it in their own time
[4619.84] on their own
[4621.32] dime. But hopefully hopefully we can
[4623.679] change that. And this has got I mean
[4625.6] this is uh okay so this is 2009 so this
[4628.56] is 16 years ago that I took this I went
[4631.52] out and traveled in this area a couple
[4633.199] of things that are interesting you can
[4635.28] see here all of this in here this is
[4637.199] called bed forms this is a result you
[4639.679] can actually trace this was a huge water
[4641.76] flow through here over here you can see
[4644.76] another and then also look at this
[4647.12] pyramid-shaped mount one of the things I
[4649.52] like to point out is that both glaciers
[4651.76] and water can create pyramidal
[4655.76] So, don't be too quick to look at
[4657.679] something that's pyramidal in shape and
[4659.6] assume that it's an artificial pyramid.
[4661.84] What was the uh we looked at one of
[4663.199] those in the glacier where uh what's the
[4666.159] term for it? Um the nun attack or nun um
[4671.199] I think so none.
[4674.88] Yeah, here you
[4677.32] go. That's a beautiful example of an
[4679.92] aluvial fan. Yeah. Can you see over
[4683.28] there? So, couple of things here. Um,
[4687.44] you can see the obvious connection
[4690.56] between this fan spled out and the
[4693.32] channel and the fan is built of material
[4696.64] that was eroded in the down cutting of
[4699.28] the gully. And so, this is uh Mormon
[4706.08] Point, Death Valley. And this would have
[4709.92] I'm certainly would have formed uh at
[4712.48] the end of the last ice age. Now in
[4716.239] Death Valley just like uh in Lake
[4718.84] Bonavville, Death Valley had this giant
[4721.6] temporary lake that filled it up. Lake
[4723.679] Manley it's called and the water again
[4725.44] about 1,000 ft deep. And if you look at
[4727.44] this, you can see the high shoreline of
[4730.159] Lake Manley right here. See that? Then
[4733.52] you can see successive shorelines as the
[4735.76] water
[4737.44] subsided and and ultimately evaporated
[4740.0] away because Death Valley has no outlet
[4742.4] to the ocean. So any water that goes
[4744.32] into Death Valley either accumulates or
[4746.84] immediately evaporates away. Um so for
[4751.04] example, you see this gully cut here. So
[4753.679] this
[4754.44] gully came after the lake subsided,
[4758.4] right? Because look, the gully cuts
[4760.4] across the shoreline. Mhm. You see that?
[4762.8] Yeah. So that tells you relative timing.
[4766.08] The shoreline was there first. When the
[4768.719] water declined, then runoff from the
[4771.6] hills up here could now carve this gully
[4774.32] and it it insized through the
[4778.04] shorelines. Now look here and you can
[4780.4] see that the modern erosion and flow is
[4784.08] building another aluvial fan, a small
[4786.32] fan right there. Okay, you can see that.
[4788.719] Yeah. So you've got a scale and variant
[4790.64] thing going on from this to this.
[4793.8] However, if this uh this you can see
[4798.08] that if this water level is up here
[4801.12] 1,000 ft deep, this is not cutting a
[4804.44] gully. This can only down cut the gully
[4807.12] once the water levels dropped. But
[4811.199] again, scale and variance here. Look at
[4813.679] this. As this fan is to this fan, this
[4818.719] fan is to this entire deposit right
[4821.199] here.
[4822.52] Oh yeah. So now you have this massive
[4827.239] flow of deposit into this basin while
[4832.4] it's filling up with 1,000 ft of
[4834.84] water rapidly. And then that water
[4838.08] slowly evaporates away. When it
[4840.32] evaporates away, it leaves a succession
[4842.239] of shorelines. And now the post deluge
[4846.4] erosion begin. And so now you start the
[4849.12] the more normal flows begin to cut and
[4851.84] carve these gullies that transsect the
[4856.239] the strand
[4857.8] lines. And see that's why they were so
[4860.239] easy to downcut because this is all just
[4862.52] unconsolidated aluvium. Mhm. Look at
[4864.88] this deeply trenched and eroded aluvial
[4867.6] fans on the west base of Panamment
[4869.44] Range, California. Note the remnant
[4872.0] shorelines up
[4873.96] here. So all of this you you begin to
[4876.88] see here here when you begin to connect
[4879.679] the
[4880.6] dots. Yeah. That's when you begin to see
[4883.04] the true scale of what we're talking
[4885.04] about here. Then we have this origin of
[4887.28] aluvial fans and white mountains.
[4889.92] Deposition by deposition by perennial
[4892.32] streams on white mountain aluvial fans
[4894.56] appears to be of minor significance.
[4897.92] Streams in the area appear to accomplish
[4900.0] little erosional or depositional work
[4902.08] during periods of normal discharge
[4904.56] either within the mountains or on the
[4906.84] fans. Their theoretical capacity for
[4909.6] load may be high, but the caliber of
[4912.88] most of the available debris is such
[4914.8] that they are incompetent to move it. In
[4918.32] other words, the material composing this
[4920.08] fan, the modern streams can't touch,
[4922.88] aren't doing Yeah.
[4925.12] But then he goes on to say, "A notable
[4927.719] morphological characteristic of many of
[4930.159] the White Mountain fans is the presence
[4932.159] on their surfaces of large boulders far
[4936.4] from canyon mouths. These are
[4938.96] particularly conspicuous in the northern
[4941.04] part of upper Owens Valley. The largest
[4943.84] boulder discovered is on the Marble
[4946.0] Creek fan. This massive granite block
[4948.56] measures about 30x 25x 25 ft and has an
[4952.48] estimated weight of 1,500 tons. The
[4956.4] location of such huge blocks has
[4958.719] stimulated much speculation about how
[4961.92] they could have arrived at their present
[4966.52] sites. There's an example of one of
[4969.159] those from an old journal article that
[4972.0] probably is this article here, 1963.
[4975.92] So this guy is out there looking at this
[4978.239] big old rock sitting on the surfaces of
[4980.56] Louisville fan going, "How the hell did
[4982.88] this get here?" Yeah. Yeah.
[4986.8] In 1963, too. Yeah. What were you doing
[4990.8] in 1963?
[4992.639] Ah, those are the 60s. Crazy days. Yeah.
[4995.6] Crazy
[4996.679] days. Yeah. I was riding my bicycle all
[4999.84] over the place and just about getting
[5002.8] interested in I was more of a
[5005.88] dancer an artist. Well, you were a
[5009.56] dancer. Aluvial fan. Now, get this.
[5012.56] Aluvial fans of the White Mountains and
[5015.44] by analogy those of other great basin
[5018.76] ranges appear not to have been built by
[5021.92] the ordinary processes of stream
[5024.08] deposition. Instead, spectacular
[5027.76] episodes of debris flow deposition have
[5030.159] been irregularly interspersed with
[5033.199] periods of
[5034.44] quiescence. During intervals between
[5036.719] major rubble flows, morphological
[5039.6] changes on the fans have been minor. So
[5041.44] again this back in 1963 this author
[5044.32] Charles
[5045.239] Bey is constructing a model in his head
[5048.4] of where you've got the
[5050.44] normal you know observed rate of change
[5053.12] and not much is happening yet then that
[5056.159] is interrupted by these what he's
[5058.239] calling spectacular episodes of debris
[5061.6] flow deposition. Well, how do you have a
[5064.48] a spectacular episode like that? you
[5066.32] have to have here, you know, you're
[5068.32] looking at uh at a, you know, without
[5071.36] you don't have the great ice sheets.
[5072.8] Now, you got some mountain glaciers, but
[5074.8] I recently read that the contribution of
[5078.639] mountain glaciers to the formation of of
[5080.96] Lake Bonavville was about
[5083.56] 3.3%. So, the vast volume, most of that
[5087.84] volume of water was rainfall. That's
[5090.719] what that tells us. Yeah. Yeah. And the
[5093.52] same thing here. So here's my question
[5095.679] now. These spectacular episodes of
[5098.239] debris flow deposition when these
[5100.28] enormous rainstorms are falling
[5103.159] over
[5105.48] California. I would venture to speculate
[5107.84] that that's happening. It's all
[5110.199] happening at the same time. Yes. Yeah.
[5113.44] In the Great Basin environment, the
[5115.76] spectacular seems to have been the
[5117.92] normal. For it is by spectacular
[5120.48] processes that a large share of the
[5123.04] grand work of gradation has been carried
[5126.0] out.
[5128.0] So this was another this is Aftton
[5130.199] Canyon 150 meter deep canyon that's
[5133.04] almost 500 ft that formed as a result of
[5137.52] overflowing drainage of Lake Manx an
[5140.719] approximately 215 square kilometer late
[5144.639] lake lake Wisconsin pluvia lake in the
[5148.32] central Mojave desert stratographic and
[5151.52] geomorphic evidence suggests that Afton
[5153.6] canyon was cut rapidly sometime after
[5158.199] 14,230 plus or minus
[5161.32] 1,325 years before present. The rapid
[5164.639] draining of lake manics and subsequent
[5166.719] basin dissection have important
[5168.56] implications for lake quiterary lake
[5172.0] fluctuations in Death Valley. Well,
[5174.4] let's see if I put in so this could have
[5176.88] been as recent based on this dating. If
[5179.12] I put in
[5181.32] 14,230 and I minus
[5184.679] 1325, you'll notice how close that comes
[5187.199] to the younger dry. Yes. 12,95.
[5190.239] Yeah. There we go. So, so two things. We
[5194.32] have the sudden formation of this huge
[5196.56] lake, Lake Manx. It overflows. It then
[5200.4] cuts a canyon 150 meters deep, which is
[5204.0] nearly 500 feet. Um, and it says then
[5209.52] the canyon was cut rapidly, rapidly. Not
[5213.28] something lasting hundreds of thousands
[5215.679] of years or even tens of thousands of
[5217.84] years, but rapidly. And it was
[5220.96] associated with the rapid draining of
[5222.88] Lake Manic. So, it appears that what we
[5225.52] have is the rapid filling, the overflow,
[5228.96] and then the rapid cutting of the
[5230.639] canyon. And where was this water all
[5232.639] ultimately headed? It was all going to
[5234.8] Death Valley. Mhm. So, one year Brad and
[5238.159] I went and we followed this whole flow
[5241.6] from the the highest lake, ancient lake
[5244.8] bed we could find all the way to Death
[5246.639] Valley. And all along that whole route,
[5249.12] you could see the spectacular features
[5251.28] of water erosion and deposition, water
[5255.199] carved landscape where it is now
[5258.239] extremely arid desert.
[5261.04] So here, listen to this. Stratographic
[5263.12] and geomorphic evidence suggests that
[5265.44] the draining of Lake Manx, the carving
[5268.239] of Aftton Canyon, and initial deposition
[5271.28] in the downstream areas occurred
[5273.96] rapidly. The conclusion that Afton
[5276.48] Canyon was cut rapidly and that Lake
[5279.28] Manics quickly emptied has important
[5282.679] implications for areas downstream of
[5285.36] Afton Canyon. Much of the overflow must
[5288.239] have passed all the way to Death Valley.
[5291.84] And so here's the entrance. As you go
[5294.239] into A Canyon, you have mountains of
[5296.88] alovuvia. And you can see the uh you can
[5300.4] see the hoodoo that are formed, which
[5302.08] are very typical what happens when you
[5304.56] have these rapid depositions of large
[5306.8] amounts of cons unconsolidated alovvium.
[5309.84] They're going to be very subjective to
[5312.4] uh post depositional erosion. And that's
[5315.84] what carves out the hoodoo and all the
[5317.84] gullies and the
[5319.8] sides. And here you can look at the a
[5322.239] section closeup of massive aluvial
[5324.48] deposits at the entrance to Afton
[5326.4] Canyon. We can see here's a good example
[5329.44] of scale, you know, and then if you look
[5332.48] at the if you look at the the uh the
[5337.04] structure of this, you'll see it's just
[5339.199] it's basically unconsolidated. There's
[5341.679] cobbles, boulders, all kinds of things
[5344.239] interspersed throughout. Why didn't a
[5347.04] big boulder sink to the bottom? Well,
[5349.199] the reason is is because this material
[5351.52] was extremely viscous when it was
[5354.12] deposited. It was like a a big thick mud
[5357.679] flow essentially.
[5362.96] And then by going into some of the one
[5366.0] and two and three century old a royos
[5368.08] you can you can see the the desert floor
[5370.96] which again if you look at this close up
[5373.28] I should I've got other I haven't put
[5375.679] them in but you can see suspended rocks
[5378.56] cobbles and then in a lot of places
[5380.8] you'll actually see boulders suspended.
[5383.28] This is a mud flow. The whole desert
[5385.52] floor is a dried out mud flow.
[5390.88] Rio
[5393.639] Grand. Let's see. Nvalish
[5398.12] Calderas. This is quite an interesting
[5400.92] place. Um, largest volcanic caldera in
[5404.96] North America, 11 miles wide. And let's
[5408.32] zoom in on this here. And there's a
[5411.6] breach point right here. Mhm. So, this
[5414.48] thing filled up with water. In fact,
[5416.32] it's happened several times that water
[5419.679] filled up and spilled over the rim. And
[5424.679] uh this topo map, you can see these are
[5428.48] subsequent volcanic eruptions that
[5431.12] happened within the large caldera here.
[5434.08] Um and then we're going to zoom in on
[5436.159] this discharge point right here.
[5440.28] So right here you've got what's called
[5443.12] battleship rock
[5446.199] and you could say battleship rock
[5449.44] calderas. You find pictures of it. I've
[5451.679] got pictures. So I've these blue lines
[5454.48] represent the
[5456.56] uh flow routes out of Valos
[5460.28] Calderas. And so you had flows that came
[5463.52] together right here and created the
[5466.92] prow. It's called Battleship Rock
[5469.52] because it looks like the prow of a
[5471.84] ship. Yeah.
[5474.76] Right. And when you go through the
[5479.04] channel outlet channel, you start
[5481.36] finding this kind of stuff revealed in
[5484.159] road
[5485.159] cuts and this kind of stuff.
[5489.32] So coarseness of boulder gravel is
[5492.32] evidence of catastrophic flows. Degree
[5494.96] of angularity suggests short transport
[5497.92] from source or insulation of clasts
[5500.96] which are the rocks by a surrounding
[5503.6] finer grained
[5505.4] matrix. Uh but these these boulders here
[5509.36] were most likely eroded through the
[5512.96] cutting of the rim here and then dumped
[5515.92] all down this trough. And then when you
[5518.56] get down to the base Oh yeah, you see
[5520.88] the rolled boulders. Mhm. The modern
[5523.6] river, uh, east fork of the James River
[5526.32] is not moving these rocks. Yeah.
[5530.08] You look here's Bradley. He's standing
[5531.6] on a almost perfectly spherical 8ft
[5534.159] diameter boulder. So, you know that this
[5536.719] got transported a pretty good ways. Um,
[5540.0] how deep was the water have to be in
[5542.0] order to carry this kind of sediment
[5543.679] load? Look at the size of these rocks
[5545.44] here. See
[5548.719] that that small river is not even even
[5551.36] large. Look look look at these that are
[5553.04] broken up and jumbled into into creek
[5555.199] troughs. This water here did not put
[5559.199] those boulders there. I don't think so.
[5562.56] And here's your battleship
[5565.4] rock. And here's looking kind of up at
[5567.92] the
[5572.199] prow. So here's an example of a plot pia
[5576.48] lake. The willox basin is a
[5579.36] topographically and hydraologically
[5581.28] closed basin in the northern portion of
[5584.0] the semierid sulfur springs valley in
[5586.48] southeastern Arizona. In the past the
[5589.12] willox basin was intermittently occupied
[5592.159] by larger and more permanent bodies of
[5594.4] water. These lakes represent former
[5596.8] stands of ancient lake
[5599.239] coochis. As today, no external surface
[5602.88] or subsurface sources of water entered
[5604.96] the Wilcox
[5606.28] Basin. Consequently, the large lakes
[5608.8] formed whenever precipitation and
[5610.639] surface runoff within the basin exceeded
[5613.44] losses due to evaporation. A prominent
[5616.239] shoreline representing a high stand of
[5618.239] Lake Coochis circumscribes the bases at
[5621.199] an altitude of,274 meters. So, we went
[5624.719] down there, explored the basin, found
[5627.52] the shoreline, I think. Do I have
[5632.36] um
[5634.12] uh an additional source of atmospheric
[5636.96] moisture that could have helped maintain
[5638.48] a lake in the Willox Basin during the
[5641.04] early holysine may have come from h who
[5643.679] would have thought intense
[5645.56] rainfall. Perhaps an intensified period
[5648.32] of tropical storm activity provided
[5650.719] supplementary moisture which maintained
[5653.199] the high level of lake coochis during
[5655.199] the early holysine. With respect to the
[5657.76] early hollesene high stand of lake
[5659.44] coochis, one conclusion is clear.
[5662.08] Precipitation must have been greatly
[5665.4] enhanced. See now we're in southern
[5668.0] we've gone from California, you know, to
[5671.199] New Mexico. Now we're southern Arizona.
[5673.679] We could go the whole desert region, the
[5676.28] southwest, right?
[5679.08] Uh let's see here. When water filled the
[5682.159] basin to an elevation slightly below the
[5684.8] late place to see maximum stand at 12
[5689.239] 1,274 m. In addition, the potential
[5692.239] moisture from large tropical storms must
[5695.199] also be considered in the hydraologic
[5697.12] budget of Lake Coochis. Well, okay. So
[5700.0] they're saying looking for modern
[5701.92] analoges and the closest they can come
[5703.6] up with is a huge tropical storm. Yeah.
[5706.4] Okay. Wait a minute. You had huge
[5707.52] tropical storms over the deserts of
[5710.28] Arizona. Well, yes, you did. But that
[5714.639] just opens the door to trying to figure
[5717.44] out what actually we're talking about.
[5720.56] That doesn't solve anything. Now, when
[5723.12] you go into the uh let's see if I've got
[5726.56] my uh let me escape here. We're running
[5729.199] out of time soon.
[5731.44] Yeah.
[5732.96] Just when it's starting to get
[5734.159] interesting. Yeah. So, when you say
[5735.44] tropical storm, I mean coming
[5740.199] from the evaporation or the evaporation
[5744.52] of glaciers wouldn't be considered
[5746.88] tropical, would it? Like if let's just
[5750.239] say something. Well, yeah. I mean, so in
[5752.48] other words, where are the biggest most
[5754.08] intense rainfalls on Earth? The
[5756.639] rainforest. Yeah. Yeah. So, what he's
[5758.96] saying essentially is we're looking at
[5760.719] something that's comparable to a
[5762.88] tropical storm that we would require
[5766.239] that kind of rainfall, but for how long
[5769.199] in order to fill this lake basin? I'm
[5771.6] going to show you something here. I'm
[5773.36] going to go zoom down here. So, he's
[5775.28] just comparing them to tropical storms.
[5777.199] I see. Correct. Yeah. Correct. Yes. That
[5780.32] was the only thing he could come up with
[5781.6] where it's like, okay, well, there needs
[5783.04] to be an immense amount of rainfall and
[5784.88] this is the only thing that I know. PS
[5788.4] produces that. Okay.
[5790.52] So, right here, this is Willox Ply. This
[5794.56] is where that lake was that it's being
[5796.639] talked about here. These are the uh uh
[5799.84] Churikawa mountains. Right. So, now the
[5803.04] Cherikawa mountains are rocked. It's
[5805.36] formed. It's called welded tus
[5808.92] TUFF. It's spewed out during really huge
[5812.48] volcanic eruptions, right? So all these
[5815.44] mountains are built of this welded
[5817.119] tough. Well, welded tough is erodess
[5820.159] very interestingly. Um and I'm going to
[5822.639] show you a picture here. Now you we're
[5824.56] going to see two things here. We're
[5825.76] going to see a massive amount of erosion
[5828.239] in the Chiraawa Mountains that would
[5830.56] have had to flow off down into the
[5832.36] lowlands and we're going to see evidence
[5834.48] of a massive lake in this basin adjacent
[5838.48] to the mountains. Right. So, first thing
[5841.92] we're going to do here is we'll go and
[5843.6] I'll show you some pictures that I took.
[5845.6] Severely eroded volcanic tough. Note the
[5848.639] extinct lake bed. You can see the
[5850.4] extinct lake lake bed right out here.
[5853.36] That's Willox Playa. So, a pia lake is
[5856.4] an ephemeral lake. It's a basin where
[5858.719] lakes can form, but they don't remain.
[5861.84] They disappear. And typically, your play
[5865.04] is going to be a very shallow. It's not
[5866.88] going to be a large lake, but look at
[5868.96] some of the
[5871.76] uh well, I should have had more
[5873.6] pictures, but if you look up Kiraakawa
[5875.44] Mountains, you can see the spelling
[5877.36] right here. I bet you you'll find some
[5879.52] really uh interesting, but you can see
[5882.4] thousands and thousands thousands of
[5884.48] these paths. Oh, yeah. Wow. Yeah.
[5889.04] Wow. Wow. Was right. So what you have is
[5892.56] you have evidence in these mountains of
[5895.44] intense erosion and then at the foot of
[5898.56] the mountains you have evidence for a
[5900.48] gigantic extinct lake. I would argue
[5903.44] that most likely those two events are
[5905.84] related. The water that eroded these
[5908.56] mountains created the lake that's no
[5911.04] longer there.
[5913.6] Isn't so uh volcanic a toughs are made
[5917.52] from volcanic ash. Correct. What is Tus?
[5920.96] Tus. Yeah. Yeah. Tough. Where is the Is
[5924.719] there a volcano that Yes. Okay. What is
[5928.32] the volcano near this?
[5931.28] I don't remember to be quite honest. I
[5934.159] don't remember. Um,
[5936.719] but that's not particularly significant
[5938.48] for this story. Well, the the volcano
[5940.96] would have been a number of million
[5943.199] years ago. Got it. So, it was a
[5945.52] different So, we're gonna have to skip
[5948.639] through some stuff.
[5950.76] Um, if we're running out of time. This
[5953.36] is the hoodoo. We got about 20 minutes.
[5955.28] 20 minutes. Okay. Coal mine Canyon. This
[5957.36] is on the Hopi reservation. Um, again,
[5960.239] this is uh up on a messa and you can
[5963.28] kind of see the rim of the mesa over
[5965.199] here. And this is evidence of huge
[5968.56] discharges off the surface of the mesa
[5971.199] that have cut these channels. And you
[5973.28] see the the hoodoo here. Yeah, that's
[5976.48] typically something you'll see. And
[5978.159] again, this is fairly soft uh material.
[5981.52] So, just so I'm clear about the term
[5984.08] hudoo, a hudoo is what is created once
[5988.96] there's some type of deposit and it's
[5991.28] some type of aluvial deposit and it's
[5993.199] still soft and it's easy to be eroded
[5995.28] while it's soft. Yes. And you see many
[5997.44] many hoodos in Bryce Canyon is famous
[5999.76] for its hoodos.
[6004.96] Canyon Deay, eastern Arizona. Sheer
[6007.36] vertical walls and freestanding pinnacle
[6010.56] rocks uh are inconsistent with slow
[6015.159] erosion. What's happening see is let's
[6017.76] see I think we've got yeah here's spider
[6019.84] rock and canyon deta you'll see that
[6022.56] this is a pinnacle rock and it is being
[6025.32] destroyed slowly. It's not being
[6028.08] produced. You don't have features like
[6029.84] this being created today that we can go
[6032.32] out and point at and say all we can do
[6034.32] is assume, oh yeah, it's being created
[6036.08] today by just wind wind eroding one
[6040.159] grain of sand and maybe one drop of
[6042.08] water at a time. So if I come back next
[6044.8] year or 10 years from now or even 100
[6046.8] years from now, I won't see much
[6049.56] difference unless of course what's
[6051.92] happening here is mostly gravity is
[6054.56] eating away. You might have uh you know
[6057.6] maybe every 10 years you might have a
[6059.28] heavy rainstorm and a flash flood going
[6061.44] through here, but they're not creating
[6063.92] these pinnacle
[6065.4] rocks. They're destroying them. Mhm.
[6068.32] See, same way with with arched bridges.
[6071.36] Uh as we'll see here, uh let's see.
[6081.36] Okay, so here you've got extinct
[6082.88] cataracts and extreme erosion along
[6084.96] Green River. This is in Utah. And once
[6087.52] you've seen a recessional
[6089.48] cataract, they're pretty pretty obvious,
[6093.199] but there's no water flowing
[6096.76] here. So, how did this landscape form?
[6100.8] Well, are you saying that wind, if
[6102.719] you're a gradualist geologist, are you
[6104.32] going to say that wind is has formed
[6106.239] these? No. I would say because if you
[6108.96] try to say well they're wind then what
[6110.719] you're saying is well there it's an
[6112.239] ongoing process it's just happening so
[6114.56] slow that we don't really see change
[6117.679] from year to year decade to decade
[6119.84] except minimally right well on the other
[6123.6] hand maybe a better explanation is no
[6126.0] these are fossil features in the
[6127.76] landscape and they're result of of
[6131.0] processes orders of magnitude more
[6133.44] energetic than what we see now
[6135.92] prevailing in this landscape. Mhm.
[6140.56] And there we go. So here we've got
[6143.48] butes. So I'm asking this question. Slow
[6146.239] erosion over millions of years or
[6148.32] catastrophic erosion. How is slow
[6150.96] erosion removed the extraordinary amount
[6153.28] of missing material? You could follow
[6155.92] the strata here and it has its
[6158.4] counterpart over here and over here
[6160.88] showing that that all of this
[6163.679] intervening material has been removed.
[6167.719] So you know what is the assumption? My
[6170.159] my question is okay by what exact
[6172.159] process was it removed? Does it make
[6175.119] sense to say oh wind did that? So the
[6179.04] original landscape west blew it all
[6181.36] away. Well the original surface of the
[6184.0] land was the tops of these
[6186.6] but all of this has been
[6189.719] removed. Now you got spire rocks like
[6192.88] this pinnacle rocks. Look over here.
[6196.48] These are called the thumbs, right?
[6198.56] Because look, you see you got the
[6200.159] thumbs.
[6202.52] Well, here's a question. Those those
[6206.96] pinnacle rocks are very
[6210.119] fragile. What intensity of an earthquake
[6213.199] would it require to just topple those
[6216.239] skinny? Wouldn't take much. So the
[6218.96] question is when was the last time there
[6221.84] was a a a seismic event in this area
[6225.44] that would have been sufficient to
[6226.8] topple those spires. And so if it was
[6230.56] sufficient to topple those spires then
[6233.199] you have to assume that these rocks the
[6236.159] spires are younger than the last time
[6238.48] you had sufficient
[6241.159] seismic activity that would have caused
[6243.6] the collapse of those spires. Mhm. And
[6247.52] here is a sentinel mea 900 ft high just
[6251.119] over one mile in length compared with
[6253.679] steamboat rock in Grand Culie. Same
[6256.56] height, same length, same
[6258.92] size. This is sandstone. The other in
[6262.88] granulie is basalt, but in terms of the
[6267.4] morphology, they're
[6269.48] almost again this is just about the same
[6272.0] size as as uh Grand Koulie. Look at
[6275.84] here's here's your messa
[6278.239] um showing
[6280.44] again what process removed all of this
[6283.199] material surrounding this. Well, in the
[6285.52] case of Steamboat Rock and Grand Kulie,
[6287.92] everybody admits it was water. But
[6290.639] nobody is going well this was
[6294.119] water. It's because why? Because the
[6296.56] implications of it are just
[6299.0] too out outside normal bounds of
[6303.36] thinking.
[6306.719] sandstone arches. How do you get these
[6308.639] aren't being created anywhere in the
[6310.639] world today except maybe on a minimal
[6312.8] scale in a in where are they found?
[6315.199] Sometimes they're found temporarily like
[6318.0] if you have clay deposits next to a a
[6321.52] stream bed and you have a flash flood
[6323.28] through there, you might come and find
[6324.639] something like this, but you come back a
[6326.8] week later, they're not there anymore.
[6328.88] Yeah. And you might find them in
[6329.92] cenotes, too, actually. Like when you're
[6332.56] inside underwater in a cenote, you have
[6334.96] small Oh, there we go. Small examples of
[6338.0] this. Take a look. What's this up
[6342.44] here? It's Well, I'll tell you what it
[6344.8] is. It's a pothole. Yeah, it's been
[6346.96] bored into the cliff
[6348.679] face. Well, a pothole, what does that
[6352.08] mean? That means you had turbulent
[6353.92] waters up to this level.
[6358.119] And and I've pondered this for years
[6361.199] trying to think of any kind of
[6362.48] uniformitarian way you could produce
[6365.119] natural arches or rock bridges like
[6367.56] this. And I finally realized because I
[6371.4] saw some new papers on the Missoula
[6374.4] flood and it was up on private
[6376.48] properties. I've never been able to get
[6378.0] up there to see it firsthand, but it was
[6379.679] photographs of rock arches that were
[6382.76] created by the same flows that created
[6385.84] Grand Kulie. I said, "Well, there we
[6388.639] have an example. We have an example that
[6391.04] nobody would dispute that this rock
[6393.36] arch, this rock bridge was created by
[6396.239] catastrophic flows that created Grand
[6398.52] Koulie." Well, if that's the case, then
[6400.639] how do you produce this? See, here's
[6403.52] another example. These things are not
[6406.239] forming. Show me anywhere in the world
[6407.92] today where these are
[6412.04] forming.
[6414.28] So anyhow, this even goes back to
[6418.6] 1908, some highlevel terraces in
[6421.28] southeastern Ohio. So about 30 years
[6424.32] ago, so good lord, what does that put
[6426.0] us? 19 I mean 1878. Yeah. Uh, Professor
[6430.48] JJ Stevenson called attention to a
[6433.119] considerable number of highlevel
[6435.04] terraces or benches occurring in the
[6437.36] upper Ohio River region. almost
[6440.8] absolutely level, ranging in height
[6443.52] from,00 to
[6445.56] 2580 ft above sea level. These highlevel
[6449.84] terraces are recent, having been made
[6452.48] since the latest warpings of the region
[6455.199] and being very well preserved. Professor
[6457.76] Stevenson explained that they are due to
[6459.76] wave work on the valley walls and
[6462.96] hillsides when the region was deeply
[6465.4] submerged subsequent to the retreat to
[6467.76] the ice sheet.
[6469.6] So on the walls of the Ohio River Valley
[6473.199] and what he's saying here is that they
[6474.4] were deeply submerged. This would have
[6476.719] been melt
[6478.28] water. Uh then this is uh from
[6482.04] 1927. The outstanding topographic
[6485.199] feature of northern Indiana is the great
[6487.679] till plane beneath which is buried an
[6490.719] ancient preglacial erosion surface.
[6494.0] crossing this broad till plane in a
[6495.92] generally western direction is the
[6498.239] Wabash Valley with its major stream
[6501.32] valleys beneath which is buried. So what
[6505.04] you've got is thousands and thousands of
[6507.92] square miles that has been eroded and
[6511.28] other thousands and thousands of square
[6513.36] miles that has been buried. M now when
[6516.239] you take account of the massive degree
[6519.28] of geomorphic work that has occurred
[6522.28] during say between 8,000 and 14 or
[6526.159] 15,000 years
[6527.88] ago for the archaeologists to think
[6530.8] they've got it all figured out and that
[6533.36] that that they know what's buried under
[6536.96] hundreds and hundreds of feet of uh you
[6541.159] know great masses of glacial hill what
[6545.679] that they knew what was in some valley
[6548.0] before hundreds of feet of bedrock were
[6550.639] originally ripped out. No, they just
[6553.44] don't know. They don't know. But they
[6556.159] think they do. The Wabash Valley is a
[6558.88] great slooh way which came into
[6561.36] existence during the pleaene glaciation
[6564.88] by the erosive work of debris laden
[6567.6] floodwaters which deboost there's a
[6570.159] French word for you from the melting
[6572.719] glacier. Not only the Wabash but the
[6576.28] Salmon, Mississippi, Eel and Little
[6579.36] Rivers are superimposed streams which
[6582.56] have cut down into and in some cases
[6584.88] through the drift from 50 to 100 ft
[6587.92] below the upland till plane. So in other
[6591.8] words, there's a buried land surface and
[6595.6] it's under 50 to 100 ft of glacial till.
[6599.52] Yes, sir. Now, are you going to tell me
[6602.08] if you're an archaeologist that you've
[6603.92] investigated all that and you know what
[6606.0] you're going to No, you're not. No, they
[6608.08] might. Well, they will they will claim
[6610.56] that. Yeah. Yeah. Thus in northern
[6613.199] Indiana today we find set into the till
[6616.8] plane a glacial sleuthway which was once
[6620.159] filled with a great rushing torrent of
[6623.6] debris laden waters but which is now
[6626.56] occupied by a rather insignificant
[6629.28] stream that covers but a fractional part
[6632.639] of the flood plane of its mighty
[6635.199] progenitor. So, I mean, see, we could
[6636.88] keep going rivers. Uh, yes. On and on
[6641.28] bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River
[6643.36] along the Wisconsin Minnesota
[6646.36] border. Okay. So, I'm standing or Yeah,
[6649.6] this picture I'm I don't think I took
[6651.44] this picture, but it's I I was I've
[6653.6] stood on this point and we're up on a
[6655.84] bluff here that has its counterpart on
[6658.48] the other side. And how far away is
[6660.4] that? Oh, that's got to be like three
[6661.92] miles. Wow. Two and a half. Three miles.
[6664.8] Okay. I've learned a lot of terms today,
[6667.119] but we've looked at an immense amount of
[6670.159] land being removed and all different
[6672.48] parts of the United States. We looked at
[6675.56] some deposit like depositional
[6678.639] structures as well, but it seems like
[6680.96] this is a lot of land that has been
[6683.199] removed. Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
[6686.4] Absolutely. It's a lot of land that's
[6688.239] been removed. Um, where where do we find
[6691.84] more of this? Or maybe I'm just not
[6693.76] understanding, but we've looked at some
[6695.76] depositional structures. We were talking
[6697.76] about this at the beginning of last week
[6699.28] with the Nile River Valley where there's
[6701.119] essentially 8,000 ft of sediment that
[6704.4] fills up these.
[6707.119] Where do we find more of this land
[6709.36] through the the landscape of North
[6711.92] America? Oh, pretty much everywhere. I
[6715.28] mean, yeah, almost everywhere. I mean,
[6718.48] that's the thing. Once you begin to
[6720.08] realize the scale and scope of the
[6722.639] geomorphic work that has transpired
[6724.8] since the last ice age, there's almost
[6727.36] no place on earth that's been untouched.
[6730.4] I mean, that's just the way it's, you
[6733.52] know, it's revealing itself.
[6735.639] So, that's the thing is that I would
[6738.4] like to get these archaeologists and
[6740.4] send them off for about a year study in
[6743.36] catastrophice geology.
[6746.08] um then they maybe would not be quite so
[6748.88] certain that they have it all figured
[6750.32] out what was going on 20,000 or 30,000
[6753.44] years ago in terms of human
[6755.8] civilizations or what kind of societies
[6758.48] we might have been building or engaged
[6760.96] in in uh what may have evolved in terms
[6764.239] of you know human societies or whatever
[6767.199] and they're not they're not I mean
[6770.0] they've already decided that there was
[6772.639] no such thing and So therefore, they've
[6776.159] sort of
[6777.159] necessarily blinded themselves to the
[6780.8] evidence that you might find. Think
[6782.159] about um out there at the Savannah River
[6785.199] uh at the site Dr. Al Goodyear. He's
[6788.08] told the story and I find that that
[6790.4] story um really sort of uh encapsulates
[6795.28] the whole problem here. You know, he was
[6798.0] excavating down there at the at uh uh
[6801.76] down near there. It's off the Savannah
[6803.679] River. I forget the c the the name of
[6805.52] the the topper site. He was down there
[6807.92] actuating the topper site. And you know,
[6811.119] he went down. We were there. I went
[6812.56] there with George Howard and Graeme
[6814.08] Hancock and and and Chris
[6817.32] um who's kind of leading some of the
[6819.76] studies of the uh Carolina Bays. Now,
[6822.639] Catrell, not Chris Catrell. Chris, he's
[6826.56] in the uh comet research group.
[6831.08] Um he's co-authored or been lead author
[6834.8] on several of the major papers that have
[6837.199] come out in the last few years on Moore.
[6839.679] Dr. Moore. Dr. Moore, of course. Chris
[6841.599] Moore. Yeah, that's what I'm talking
[6842.8] about. So, he was there. Anyways, we
[6845.199] went down, we went with Dr. Al Goodyear.
[6847.599] We looked at the went to the museum
[6849.52] first where he was showing us the
[6850.88] artifacts that he was finding at the
[6852.96] topper site. We went down to the topper
[6854.8] site. He showed us where I think 6 feet
[6857.28] or so below the surface where the the
[6859.76] younger dest boundary horizon was from,
[6862.8] you know, a little bit less than 12,000
[6864.56] years ago. Well, and then he was telling
[6866.719] the story about how people kept asking
[6869.599] him, well, what's what's lower down? And
[6871.84] his response was generally, well,
[6873.44] nothing. I mean, because we know the
[6875.04] Clovis were here first. So, we're not
[6877.52] going to find artifacts of human
[6880.08] occupation of this site earlier than the
[6882.96] Clovis because that's the standard
[6884.88] model. Everybody accepts it. Clovis
[6886.8] first,
[6887.8] right? Well, then Dr. good years.
[6891.599] Obviously an open-minded person who was
[6893.679] willing to think outside the box a bit
[6895.679] because he decided after enough parent
[6898.08] pressure uh uh from students and others
[6900.88] I guess uh whether there was anything
[6904.08] lower he decided to excavate lower and
[6907.119] he went down and what did he find? He
[6909.44] found another cultural layer
[6911.04] considerably lower and I think it dated
[6913.92] to about 30,000 years ago. Think about
[6916.239] that. Yeah. Um and so that completely
[6919.36] didn't fit the prevailing model. So his
[6921.36] work has been ignored conveniently. But
[6924.159] but see that to me represents okay so
[6927.119] the assumption was well there's nothing
[6928.56] there so why look and then you look and
[6931.28] there's something there. Well I think
[6933.119] that's a widespread problem across the
[6935.679] whole spectrum of archaeological
[6938.0] research is too many assumptions about
[6940.48] what may or may not have possibly
[6943.04] happened in prehistory.
[6945.84] And if you would go, well, maybe we just
[6948.08] need to go look. Uh, but again, the
[6950.719] problem is is that this lack of
[6953.36] understanding of the intensity and
[6955.92] severity and magnitude of these
[6958.96] geomorphic processes and how they can
[6962.44] instantaneously completely alter a
[6964.92] landscape. So whatever would have been
[6967.32] there gets lost in that process. Right?
[6972.48] So that's the problem. So, we need to be
[6976.0] able to find first of all be more
[6979.76] open-minded to the possibilities of what
[6982.159] may or may not have happened 15, 20,
[6984.239] 30,000 years ago or even longer. And
[6987.36] then, you know, look, actually look. Um,
[6992.08] but the the the challenge will be
[6993.92] knowing where to look because, you know,
[6997.36] are you going to excavate through 200 ft
[6999.36] of a a thick boulder bar to see what's
[7001.76] sitting on the bottom of it? And even if
[7003.92] you did, the processes that deposited
[7006.8] that boulder bar or that that debris fan
[7009.679] or whatever probably also erased
[7012.96] whatever was there. Mhm.
[7015.159] Um so there's the problem. Um and we've
[7019.84] got a lot more to get into here to try
[7022.0] to educate people about this. Um it's a
[7026.32] whole language. If we're going to uh
[7029.119] come to to a working functional
[7032.239] understanding of this language, yeah,
[7035.04] it's doing what we're doing is it is the
[7037.76] way to do it. We we're investing in
[7039.199] time. We're learning the terminology.
[7041.44] We're going through some of the
[7042.639] scientific work in the papers. We're
[7044.4] looking at the images. Uh in the next
[7047.199] one, let's try to look at some drone
[7048.88] footage. Let's do it. Um and then some
[7051.599] LAR scans. LAR scan. Well, yeah, we
[7053.84] didn't get that far. If we had another
[7055.199] hour, we would be getting into LAR scans
[7057.28] that are coming up here. Here's a LAR
[7060.32] scan of the Minnesota River Valley. And
[7063.44] you can see this little ribbon here.
[7065.119] That's the modern river. And here's the
[7067.76] ancient champ.
[7070.239] Beautiful example of an
[7073.48] underfit. And and I was standing right
[7078.719] here next to this gully. Or was it this
[7080.88] one? looking into this thing and that's
[7084.4] when it began to dawn in my mind that
[7087.639] something something had gone on there.
[7090.0] Something had happened cuz I could
[7092.4] standing right here I could look and I
[7093.84] could see this and then I could see this
[7096.96] and something didn't seem to add up.
[7100.4] That was it just didn't fit. That was
[7102.4] 1969. Wow. Summer of 69. That's really
[7105.84] kind of where it Yeah. Wow. This started
[7109.84] in the '60s for you. Well, yeah, it did.
[7112.56] 69. We've been here for 3 days having a
[7115.679] lot of fun. So, we've covered a lot of
[7117.44] stuff and this is always super
[7119.679] interesting and Oh, yeah. Thank you,
[7121.679] Randall. Oh, you're welcome. I've
[7123.76] enjoyed it.

Title: Why Geology Ignored the Biggest Clues
[0.08] The present is the key to the past.
[2.0] Basically, in order to try to understand
[3.919] what happened in the past, you look at
[5.6] processes that are happening today that
[7.759] we can witness on a dayto day or a year
[9.76] to year and then we extrapolate
[11.36] backwards. The problem with that though
[13.519] is that it became entrenched dogma. What
[16.08] that meant was that only processes that
[18.96] we're seeing today in terms of scales
[21.6] and rates of change and magnitudes and
[24.0] things, anything beyond that was
[25.92] considered to be pseudocience or science
[28.56] fictiony. And so you couldn't talk about
[31.199] giant floods. Part of that goes back to
[33.44] the origins of geology when you had late
[36.239] 16 early 17 through the 1700 you had
[38.879] this conflict between science and
[40.559] religion. Literalists say the biblical
[42.879] literalists had a lot of political
[44.8] power. You know then there was you had
[46.16] the breakaway with the Protestants but
[47.92] they were pretty much the same way. Very
[49.44] fundamentalist about taking the Bible
[51.76] literally. You It just You can't do

Title: The Desert Wasn’t Always Dry
[0.16] What I'm showing you here is we can
[2.639] identify these geomorphic after effects
[5.759] of these gigantic water flows. And once
[8.16] you begin to understand the basic
[10.12] vocabulary or the basic alphabet of
[13.2] these events, you can start connecting
[15.44] these dots and realize that well wait a
[18.08] second. We can see that here we have
[19.84] deserts of the southwestern United
[21.76] States that have very similar type of
[24.24] evidence of gigantic water flows of
[27.119] previous tempered if even almost lush
[29.84] when there was rivers and lakes in
[32.079] abundance and they're gone. To me, this
[34.64] raises very interesting questions about
[36.96] climate and environment and how much it
[39.2] changes and on what scale on what level.
[42.0] uh and I think we could say sometimes it
[43.92] changes very fast, very dramatically and
[47.12] on a perhaps global scale. And this is
[50.48] what tends to be overlooked in a lot of
[54.079] the concern about climate


Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyNDwMC9IKk
Title: Did Humans Cause the Extinction?
[0.08] humans are the sole cause of global
[2.8] change and that we are the dominant
[4.72] force within this whole process. Now
[7.04] here we come along and we're saying well
[8.639] no there's actually been forces
[10.4] unleashed on this planet that really
[12.4] utterly dwarf anything we've done yet.
[14.559] What does that do to that paradigm? You
[16.72] see that's that's what I think what
[18.08] we're we're coming down here. The
[19.52] scenario now is that humans are engaged
[21.6] in causing the sixth great mass
[23.519] extinction as we talked about in one of
[25.359] your one of the previous and now we're
[28.08] coming along and saying well wait a
[29.519] second here's something from outer space
[31.92] that has come in and caused the last
[33.52] great mass extinction on earth and
[35.6] what's interesting I found is that quite
[37.44] a number of the the scientists that have
[39.84] been in the opposition to the younger
[42.16] dus impact hypothesis have been in the
[44.8] forefront of pushing this this scenario
[47.68] of human caused mass extinction and
[50.399] blaming the extinction of the great
[52.48] megapa that died out 12,000 years ago on
[55.92] human hunters. You know, paleoindian
[57.84] hunters using spears are going to cause
[59.92] the extermination of 10 million woolly
[61.84] mammoths before they could even
[63.159] reproduce along with 120 other species
[66.159] of megapa.
[67.96] 65% of all mammals in North America were
[71.2] wiped out somewhere around that time.
[73.36] Mega mammals. Mega male, which is over
[75.36] 100 lb in body weight essentially almost
[77.92] instantaneously.

Title: 600 Megatons and Nobody Talked About It
[0.08] So why are they trying to downplay it
[1.839] and why do you think it's a bigger deal
[3.679] than what the establishment climate
[5.2] change folks are telling us? Well,
[6.72] because again it points to the idea that
[8.559] the climate changes naturally without
[10.559] help from humans and the whole climate
[12.719] change narrative is about ultimately
[14.88] using climate change towards social
[16.8] control. I think the strategy now is to
[19.199] focus exclusively on anthropogenicdriven
[22.4] climate change. This event here a meteor
[24.88] what was it 400 to 800 ft. Yeah. the
[27.68] size of Eiffel Tower I believe that was
[31.199] in between uh earth and moon and the
[33.92] moon and no one really that was also a
[36.96] non-story right so I knew about it okay
[39.28] tell us I wrote about well it was
[41.36] slightly different trajectory it
[43.12] impacted the earth it would have
[44.96] detonated with a explosive force of
[47.36] about 600 megatons now what's 600 megat
[50.48] tons the biggest hydrogen bomb tested in
[53.44] the US arsenal I believe was Mike maybe
[56.079] 1950 51 largest US hydrogen bomb test
[61.28] and it was about 15 megat tons and
[64.0] that's about a,000 times greater than
[65.6] the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima
[68.0] and that's what this meteor just two
[69.68] months ago was capable of doing? Much
[71.68] bigger than that. Huh. Interesting.

Title: The Myth of a Stable Climate
[0.08] It's important to note that the
[1.52] empirical evidence of the little ice age
[3.52] and the effects of global cooling are
[5.56] inconsistent with the computer narrative
[8.4] which claims amplified warming is going
[11.04] to cause increased storminess. It should
[13.2] be recalled that as the climate warmed
[16.16] during the decade of the
[18.6] 1730s the health of the nor northern
[21.279] Europeans improved and hence the
[23.68] population numbers took an upturn. Lamb
[26.72] elaborates upon the assumptions upon
[29.359] which the concept of a steadystate
[32.0] climate were based. Around 1880 to 1900,
[35.92] it was apparent from the first 100year
[38.719] series of weather observations that the
[41.28] climatic averages of that time were very
[44.559] similar to those of a century earlier.
[46.64] And it became conventional to treat
[48.559] climate as essentially constant.
[51.559] Accordingly, study of the development
[53.68] and possible changes of climate was
[56.32] given a very low priority or more
[58.559] generally neglected altogether. Given
[61.28] these circumstances, it was natural that
[63.68] the general public and workers in the
[65.76] other disciplines also ignored the
[68.96] possibility that climate might not
[71.119] always be so stable and climatic change
[74.64] might affect their lives.

Title: Earth’s Annual Brush with Cosmic Danger
[0.16] Between the 3rd and 15th of November
[2.0] each year, the Earth runs through a
[3.439] meteor stream coming from a small area
[5.44] in the constellation of Taurus, the
[7.2] Bull. A young stream made up of meteors
[9.679] not long released from their parent
[11.599] comet would be narrow and probably
[13.92] strong, and the Earth would pass through
[16.0] it in a half a day or so. The Geminid
[18.48] meteor stream is one such, the Earth
[20.72] encountering it on the 10th of December
[22.64] each year and the shower being over by
[24.88] the 12th of December. The torid meteor
[27.359] stream on the other hand takes the earth
[29.599] 12 days to cross and it is not very
[32.079] intense. It looks old. It has two main
[35.12] branches, northern and southern,
[36.64] emerging from slightly different parts
[38.64] of the constellation. The branches being
[41.84] about equal intensity. Orbiting the
[44.96] torid with the torid meteor is a small
[47.76] comet discovered in 1818 by pawns. An
[51.68] orbit was calculated for this comet by
[54.079] Johan Anki, a pupil of the famous
[56.399] mathematician Gaus, who had developed a
[59.12] method for calculating the orbits of
[61.039] bodies from their movement across the
[63.4] sky. There are about a hundred known
[66.56] short period comets. All of these, with
[69.68] the sole exception of Anki's comet, are
[72.08] in orbits which sooner or later lead to
[75.119] a close encounter with Jupiter and
[77.6] ejection from the solar system by the
[80.4] powerful gravitational pull of that
[83.04] planet. But Ankkey's comet has somehow
[85.2] established itself in a stable orbit
[87.68] such that it never comes within the
[89.84] Jovian sphere of influence. It does
[92.479] however come close to

Title: Chelyabinsk Was a Warning
[0.08] I made the point about Chel Yabinsk,
[2.0] which happened on February 15th, 2013,
[5.44] damaged over 7,000 buildings and caused
[8.88] over 1,500 injuries. Now, if it had been
[11.84] just slightly larger or slightly denser
[14.24] or coming in at a slightly steeper
[16.16] angle, it could have caused quite a few
[18.08] casualties. At this point, among most
[20.72] people, you know, was very much in the
[22.72] news. It was very much talked about at
[24.32] the time in the immediate aftermath.
[26.16] Now, it's um for the most part
[27.84] forgotten. Nobody's considering that
[29.679] anymore. But again, it was like to me
[31.439] it's like a wakeup call. Hey, these
[33.28] things are out there. They um Earth
[36.079] encounters them with a far greater
[37.68] frequency than anybody had imagined. But
[40.32] also, if you're paying attention, one of
[42.559] the things is is that, you know, for
[44.64] took over a century or a century and a
[47.039] half to discover the first four
[48.84] asteroids. And now we've discovered
[51.52] every few months one comes flying into
[54.96] near Earth

Title: When the Sahara Was Green
[0.08] In the Sahara and the deserts of the
[2.32] Near East from about 5,000 to 2400 BC,
[8.08] there was an appreciably moistister
[10.32] climate than now. The evidence,
[12.559] archaeological and zoological, is
[15.04] especially convincing as regards the
[17.039] early part of this period.
[18.92] Antarctica also experienced a warm
[21.84] period after the main ice age when the
[25.6] Antarctic ice sheet had been several
[27.92] hundreds of meters thicker than now in
[30.96] the Walat mountains near 72° south 10°
[36.079] east. Temperatures were so many degrees
[39.04] higher than now that there were
[40.96] considerable streams of running water
[43.28] and fluial erosion of the landscape.
[45.52] Between 600 and
[48.28] 1,890 m above sea level, lakes were
[52.16] formed which have subsequently frozen
[54.48] solid and remain as fossils. is

Title: After the Collapse, Who Survives?
[0.08] So dispersed survivors would mean that
[2.879] you have people that do stay alive if
[5.839] they have some sort of access to
[8.24] resources. It's definitely going to be
[10.559] based upon upon that your access to
[13.2] resources. The habitat destruction is
[15.679] not going to be uniform. So there's
[17.279] going to be some places where the damage
[19.439] is is less severe in ecology when you
[22.48] have a major environmental destruction.
[25.519] Oh, a few years ago I went to uh Mount
[27.76] St. Helens to study the how the nature
[31.84] was recovering in the aftermath because
[33.52] you had a couple hundred square miles in
[36.32] the aftermath of Mount St. Helens back
[38.399] in May of of 1980 that was just
[40.64] basically turned into a completely
[42.16] decimated lunar landscape. Yeah. But
[44.48] even within that there were little
[46.0] pockets of ferns that survived. And from
[48.96] those ferns, you see life gradually
[52.64] beginning to proliferate outwards. And
[55.28] then with an increasing pace as the
[57.68] years go by, another few centuries, the
[60.32] mountain will be pretty much reforested,
[62.32] which is a very small amount of time
[64.0] relatively for the earth. Yes. Certainly
[66.479] by half a millennium, I think you're
[68.56] going to be seeing forests completely
[71.04] recovering. It's such a fascinating
[73.04] subject because I feel like we're so
[75.36] underprepared and under informed. We're
[78.96] so accustomed to our supply chain. We're
[81.6] so accustomed to supermarkets and yeah,
[84.0] this is the most vulnerable the species
[86.159] has ever been in terms of our ability to
[88.159] subsist. Yeah, we're almost completely
[91.04] dependent upon these large structures.

Title: From Yurts to Cathedrals
[0.16] I wanted to know more about that and
[2.32] that's when I discovered that science
[4.96] had no answer. How different cultures
[6.879] and different peoples, indigenous
[8.559] peoples and so on, how they solve the
[11.2] problem of of existing in their
[13.679] environment through architecture. So it
[16.0] was everything from like a yurt,
[18.0] something as simple as yurt all the way
[19.6] up to a Gothic cathedral and everything
[21.279] in between. As I started studying into
[23.519] the history of building and
[24.8] architecture, I kept seeing over and
[26.32] over again Freemasons and their
[27.84] involvement. That's what led to it. And
[29.76] then by 1978 I was really curious about
[33.28] it and I also discovered you know there
[35.04] was a lot of spiritual symbolism and
[37.28] things like that involved that like
[39.2] added this whole other dimension to it.
[41.12] There is a lot of depth to the whole
[43.36] system. It's the symbolism when you
[45.84] start unpacking it uh pertains to every
[48.48] aspect of life. Do you yourself like
[50.719] even today you for me one of the things
[52.64] I want to ask you about you go to
[54.239] Smithsonian right and you wonder some of
[56.48] the people that control history what did
[57.92] they do with it? So then for me it goes
[59.92] down to are there secret societies that
[62.8] have the type of influence and poll that
[65.519] can rewrite history and gaslight us if
[68.08] we want to and how do you feel about
[70.159] other secret societies when when we hear
[72.08] about skull and bones when we hear about
[73.36] Illuminati we hear about what do you
[74.96] think about these guys okay secret
[76.479] societies you have to bear in mind that
[78.32] during some of the post middle ages
[80.56] during the time of like various
[82.24] religions religious suppressions and so
[84.4] on I mean to be be a known Freemason was
[86.96] essentially a death sentence

Title: The Holocene Wasn’t Stable
[0.08] The Arctic Ocean with much open water
[2.96] was probably ice free. Yet that was
[6.08] probably ice free at least in summer
[8.72] though not the channels of the Canadian
[10.599] archipelago. Lamb suggests that there
[12.96] would be value in the study of climate
[16.24] since the end of the last ice age. the
[18.56] time during which the established view
[20.56] was that climate change during the
[22.24] period we call the holysine was
[24.88] negligible to the point that it could
[27.199] essentially be ignored when developing
[29.439] models of history. But as Lamb was
[31.76] willing to acknowledge by the early
[33.719] 1960s the accumulating evidence was not
[37.04] consistent with this steadystate model.
[39.6] He goes on to lay out the broad
[41.6] parameters of the change over the course
[44.399] of the past roughly 10,000 years. At
[47.84] least four climatic epochs since the ice
[52.559] age seem likely to repay more study by
[56.6] meteorologists than they have so far
[58.879] received. The postglacial climatic
[62.0] optimum, a warm period culminating
[64.879] between about 5,000 and 30,000 BC, that
[68.56] is between about 8,000 and 5,000 years
[71.28] ago, to the colder climatic epoch of the
[74.96] early Iron Age, which culminated between
[77.68] about 900 and 450 BC, the secondary
[82.24] climatic optimum in the early Middle
[85.56] Ages, broadly around AD 1,000 to,200 or
[91.28] rather longer. And finally, D or four,
[94.96] the little ice age, a period of very
[97.119] cold climate marked between about
[100.759] AD430 and 1850. 50.

Title: A Canyon Formed in 2 Days
[0.08] Canyon Lake Gorge, which is down towards
[2.24] San Antonio, is a site that uh in 2002
[5.839] there was a heavy heavy rain and Canyon
[8.559] Lake is a reservoir. It overflowed and
[11.84] it cut this canyon and reproduced all
[14.48] these features like um uh recessional
[17.52] cataracts and plunge pools and all these
[20.24] kind of things geologists assumed were
[22.8] kind of slow to form but are very
[25.6] similar to some of the things that are
[27.76] on a much grander scale. What it is is
[29.84] it's kind of almost forced a revision in
[31.679] thinking because basically they're
[33.6] seeing this duplication of these forms
[35.84] although on a smaller scale but formed
[37.92] in two days and not thousands of years.
[40.079] You probably heard the term the ice-free
[42.0] corridor. Yeah. The old ideas that North
[45.28] America was exclusively populated by the
[48.0] Clovis people coming across the Bearing
[50.0] Land bridge which was exposed because of
[52.16] lowered sea levels migrating down
[54.32] through Alaska and through that ice-free
[56.16] corridor down into unglaciated North
[59.039] America and then eventually all the way
[60.8] down to tiar del fuego within a thousand
[63.76] years. Now you've got this gradual
[65.519] warming. Now, at about
[67.4] 12,850 to 12,900 years ago, that process
[71.6] is suddenly interrupted by this massive
[74.56] spasm of cold. Basically undoes
[78.119] 2,500 years of warming. And now the
[81.2] planet is plunged back into full glacial
[83.439] cold. And it takes like 1300 years for
[86.24] the planet to resume its upward arc of
[89.28] of warming.

Title: Earth Just Missed a 500-Megaton Impact
[0.0] I think I have a video that was put out
[1.839] by NASA. This is 50 megat ton explosion.
[5.37] [Music]
[16.56] Russia put this together. Yeah.
[23.199] So, the impact of the object we were
[25.519] just talking about that passed the Earth
[27.359] June 29th, that would have been 12 times
[31.119] more powerful than what we just saw. And
[32.96] that's 50 million megat tons of TNT. The
[36.32] largest hydrogen bomb ever tested by the
[38.96] human race is what that video was. 10 to
[41.36] 12 times more powerful than that would
[43.52] have
[44.12] been that object from June 29th.

Title: The Arctic Has Melted Before
[0.16] In the worst decades, Scotland as well
[3.2] as parts of Scandinavia and Iceland
[6.0] experienced famine. Upland farms and
[8.72] villages in England and Germany may have
[10.96] been abandoned partly for this reason.
[13.04] With respect to the period immediately
[15.519] following the great delacial phase, now
[19.439] usually referred to as the climatic
[22.08] optimum, Lamb had this to say. The
[24.64] extent of ice on land decreasing
[27.279] throughout the warm epoch may have
[30.08] reached its minimum around 2,00 to,500
[34.719] years BC. That is after the main part of
[39.44] the warm epoch was over. By soon after
[43.28] 4,000 BC, the world's sea level had
[46.239] risen to about its present level or
[48.96] possibly even a few meters above because
[51.68] of rather higher ocean temperatures than
[53.92] now. And he estimates that they were at
[55.84] least 1° centigrade higher in the
[58.719] tropical Atlantic and probably several
[62.079] degrees warmer in the Arctic. What I'm
[64.559] presenting to you here is evidence that
[66.799] the status of ice in the Arctic Ocean
[70.52] presently in terms of the of the mass
[73.28] and volume of the ice is not
[75.439] unprecedented. There's clearly evidence
[77.92] that exists that shows that the volume
[80.479] and amount of ice in the Arctic Ocean
[83.439] has waxed and waned along with the
[85.92] oscillating climate.

Title: What Are The Structures Beneath The Great Pyramids in Giza?
[0.08] I was not intending to remark on these
[2.32] supposed structures uh in the bedrock
[5.12] below Cafre's pyramid, but so many
[6.96] people have been asking me about it. I
[9.12] thought I would shed a little light on
[11.04] the matter uh by looking at it through
[13.679] the geological perspective. So I want
[16.88] you to join me here because there's some
[18.56] pretty amazing things that have played
[20.24] out over the Egyptian environment over
[23.279] the last say couple of million years and
[25.6] we're going to talk about that and I
[27.039] think some of it's pretty mind-blowing.
[38.16] As far as the the the whole question of
[40.399] the uh structures under the coffrey
[43.92] pyramid, I I'll say I'm ambivalent.
[46.16] Certainly, it would be exciting if that
[48.719] was real. I will certainly admit right
[51.76] off the bat that that would be very
[53.28] exciting if it was real.
[55.239] However, you know, uh, tipping my hat to
[58.239] Carl Sean, uh, I've got to agree that,
[61.28] uh, extraordinary claims require
[63.84] extraordinary proofs. And so, I would
[66.88] definitely be requiring, uh, some
[69.439] serious evidence, uh, over and above
[72.479] what I've seen so far. And with that in
[77.119] mind, uh, I think what I'm going to do
[79.04] though is talk about what could be
[80.64] possible. And I I I think there's let's
[83.92] take the number of possibilities here.
[86.68] Um let's assume that the uh the
[90.799] synthetic aperture radar images are not
[93.439] doctorred in any way. Um it does appear
[96.56] that some kind of a structure
[99.079] exists. But the ambiguity of the images
[101.92] precludes any conclusion as to whether
[103.759] these apparent images or structures are
[106.68] natural or man-made.
[110.0] I'm biased towards the natural and we'll
[112.96] go through some material here, some of
[114.64] the geological studies of Egypt that
[117.2] would seem to uh suggest the possibility
[120.479] or probability that there would be uh
[123.759] cavities within the limestone bedrock of
[127.119] uh the Giza
[128.84] plateau. So, let's start out with some
[131.36] geological context to the question and
[133.52] then we'll consider what this may uh uh
[137.239] suggest. Now most of the uh bedrock
[140.879] comprising the Giza plateau is eucosine
[143.84] limestone from the uh Eosene period of
[147.12] the the geological times uh table. Uh
[151.2] now there's some other for the
[152.64] geologists there's some other there's
[154.16] some mixed dolommites which are also uh
[157.36] calcium carbonate based rocks. There's
[159.68] some sandstone, not much, but there is
[162.08] some sandstone and mars that are uh you
[165.12] might say thrown in good for good
[166.64] measure. But to considerable depths, the
[169.519] mass of the limestone, the mass of the
[171.36] bedrock is limestone. Uh now, if you
[174.48] know anything about petroly, which is
[176.72] the study of rock composition, you know
[179.28] that carbonate based limestone rocks are
[182.239] soluble in acidic water. Uh, and this is
[185.68] one reason why there's so many caves
[187.36] found in limestone ter terrain. Like if
[189.599] I go up here near here to the next door
[192.159] states, uh, Tennessee and Kentucky,
[194.08] there's lots of limestone and there's
[196.08] lots and lots of
[197.72] caves. But what we want to look at is
[200.72] the climate over the region of Egypt and
[204.48] its nearest neighbor, Libya, to the
[206.4] west. and in fact for that matter the
[208.959] whole Sahara Desert, the whole Sahara
[212.08] Desert region of North Africa. So
[215.36] numerous studies and I mean there's
[217.84] dozens of more than I've read, but I've
[219.92] read plenty enough of those studies to
[222.56] know that the Sahara Desert was not in
[227.2] fact has not for long actually been a
[229.599] desert. We don't have to go back too
[231.76] many thousands of years uh when we get
[234.159] to the point where it isn't a desert. In
[235.92] fact, it's all almost lush. Um, and so
[238.879] that's what we're going to talk a little
[240.239] bit about here. I want to introduce some
[242.319] of these studies to you and see what
[244.879] this may imply as far as the question of
[248.08] could there be or could there not be
[250.48] structures under uh the Giza plateau and
[253.84] under the pyramid complex.
[256.12] Um, so I'm going to begin uh by talking
[259.359] about a 2011 report that was published
[264.24] in the proceedings of the National
[266.479] Academy of Sciences. Uh, and in this
[270.08] report they discussed evidence that the
[272.0] Saharan Desert was not always an
[274.759] obstacle to the dispersal of humans
[277.759] northward. the out of Africa uh theory
[281.44] that you've probably heard of that
[283.04] humans moved primarily from the
[285.68] equatorial regions and near the uh in
[289.6] eastern Africa near the uh the great
[292.0] rift area uh and then moved northward
[295.04] and eventually colonized uh all the way
[297.919] up to the Mediterranean. But the problem
[300.72] was is that if people didn't have the
[303.68] means to travel across a thousand miles
[305.84] of desert, uh the desert would actually
[308.56] act as an obstacle to the migration of
[311.759] human population. Uh because for one
[314.479] thing, if it's the kind of desert that
[316.32] it is there now, there's not a whole lot
[318.639] to support life. Uh at least the kind
[321.28] that you would expect would be
[322.88] accessible to a roving band of of
[325.759] humans.
[327.479] Um so in this report they I'm going to
[331.44] quote from it the authors uh say that uh
[336.32] there was actually there was five five
[338.08] authors um and the title the title of
[340.88] the paper that I'm going to quote from
[343.68] is ancient water
[345.8] courses and
[348.84] biogeography of the Sahara explain the
[352.56] peopling the peopling of the desert.
[355.919] Okay. So,
[358.199] uh the what made possible this migration
[362.4] across what is now the vast wasteland of
[364.56] the Sahara Desert was that quote during
[367.919] the holene humid period. Now the
[370.88] holysine remember the holosene is the
[373.44] geological epoch that we're in right now
[376.08] goes back it's dated the date that is
[379.039] now given in the literature is
[381.16] 11,600 11,500 to 11,600 years ago which
[386.08] is a very interesting date because that
[388.4] is a date of one of the great meltwater
[390.639] pulses and sea level rise events that
[393.199] occurred in the transition from the
[395.44] preceding epoch the pleaene into the
[398.319] modern epoch the holysine. And so it is
[400.96] within the holene that essentially the
[403.36] modern story of of civilization and the
[407.759] rise of organized
[410.199] societies have has taken place. Uh
[414.08] because if we go back 10,000 years, we
[416.4] see the beginning of organized
[418.72] agriculture. We see a shift from nomadic
[420.96] to sedentary lifestyles. We see the
[423.68] dispersion of languages. Um not long
[427.199] after that we see some of the first
[429.36] urban complexes in the Middle East.
[431.52] Well, it's during this period of time
[433.68] that uh these authors are referring to
[436.319] that was also the Egyptian humid period.
[439.28] So this is what they say. During the
[440.72] holene humid period, the region
[443.52] contained a series of linked lakes,
[446.639] rivers, and inland
[448.36] deltas comprising a large interlin
[453.479] waterway, channeling water and animals
[456.96] into and across the Sahara, thus
[460.24] facilitating these dispersals. The
[462.56] system was last active in the early
[464.96] holosene when many species appear to
[468.24] have occupied the entire Sahara Desert,
[471.84] which wasn't a
[475.24] desert. They then go on to say, "The
[478.84] Sahara was formerly covered by a dense
[483.28] paleo river network with many channels
[486.96] containing very large aluvial fans."
[489.199] Now, what's an aluvial fan? Um well an
[492.24] aluvial fan if the water is flowing
[495.28] through a constriction and eroding
[497.319] material and and entraining that
[500.0] material into its water flow and it's
[502.479] flowing in a confined channel when it
[505.12] opens say into a wider channel or a
[508.199] basin. Uh what happens is the water
[511.199] spreads out it slows down. As it slows
[513.919] down, it loses its competency to carry
[517.039] sediment and it begins to to dump that
[519.519] sediment and it builds what are called
[522.0] aluvial fans. Uh aluvial meaning
[525.68] deposited by water. That's all that
[528.0] means. And it looks like a fan. It's
[530.24] spled out like often times you'll have a
[532.399] mountain uh a narrow mountain canyon
[535.68] opens out onto a wider valley. And there
[538.88] you're going to see these these fan-like
[541.279] structures spread out. Well, there's
[543.279] many many many fan structures that are
[545.6] essentially fossil features. They're not
[548.08] really being created on the same scale
[550.399] now in many mountain environments that
[552.88] they were at another time. The same goes
[555.519] for Egypt.
[557.32] So uh he says the Sahara was formerly
[561.2] covered by a dense dense paleo river
[565.12] network with many channels containing
[568.0] very large aluvial fans where rivers
[570.8] divide into multiple branches in an
[573.279] inland area. The green sahara also
[577.36] contained numerous closed basins that
[580.48] supported some very large lakes. When
[584.399] these lakes were full, they would have
[587.56] overflowed, thereby linking adjacent
[591.72] catchments. Many fans and lake spillways
[594.56] are located in strategic positions that
[597.6] link waterways across the desert. So
[601.839] what's being described here is so
[604.08] drastically and dramatically different
[606.48] than what's there now. And the
[609.76] supposition here is that migrating
[612.399] humans found this to be a completely
[615.76] hospitable terrain rather than
[618.0] inhospitable and probably in fact a
[620.32] occupied this whole region of North
[623.24] Africa which is very interesting because
[625.44] now you have to begin to ask the
[626.72] question well how did it change so
[629.279] quickly which it did because we're
[630.8] looking at a period that might have
[632.959] lasted from 6,000 to maybe 9 or 10,000
[636.72] years ago the humid period.
[638.6] Now the evidence also shows as we'll go
[641.44] on to look at here that that humid
[643.6] period was only like a the most recent
[646.399] phase in an alternating environmental
[650.0] context between desert and temperate
[653.04] region. Uh and there have been multiple
[655.839] shifts back and forth is what the
[657.6] evidence is now suggesting. I am
[660.24] actually having my uh co-host here
[664.04] somewhere. Maybe he'll jump in. Oh,
[666.48] there he is. Okay. Um,
[670.079] howdy. Howdy. I've been listening.
[673.92] Yeah, you know, I got so carried away I
[676.0] forgot that you were there.
[679.12] Sorry, I apologize. You know, I'm
[680.8] actually drinking um Yeah. What is it
[683.2] that you're drinking? Fresh pineapple
[685.88] juice. It's
[688.36] delicious. And I hopefully healthy.
[693.32] Um I've been horse this week, as you
[696.079] know.
[697.6] Yes, sir. Uh, it's much better, but I'm
[700.48] still a bit horsearo. Uh,
[704.079] I hear it. There's something going
[705.44] around. Yeah, there is. And I I caught
[708.16] it. I fought it off successfully, but
[710.16] I've still got some of the dregs of it
[711.92] in my in my throat.
[715.88] Um so uh we're talking here about Egypt
[719.76] and we're talking about that Egypt has
[722.959] at least Egypt, Libya, North Africa,
[726.24] that whole belt across there has had a
[728.399] had some very very dramatically
[730.639] different environments and many the most
[734.0] recent one basically only came to an end
[736.8] around 6,000 to 5,000 years ago. And
[740.639] it's interesting and I'm not sure what
[742.639] the connection would be with that
[745.959] transition between that type of
[748.68] environment into the arid environment
[751.279] that it is now which is then shortly
[754.76] thereafter is the rise of the old
[757.04] kingdom of
[759.16] Egypt. Unless it has something to do
[761.519] with the Nile
[762.839] River because once the rest of North
[766.0] Africa dried up and turned into de
[767.92] desert, the Nile would have been the
[771.399] lifeline. And the floods continued each
[775.2] year on a very regular annual basis. Uh
[779.04] you know around just not long after
[781.519] summer solstice when uh the floods would
[785.44] come down from the Ethiopian highlands.
[787.76] You had the white Nile and the blue Nile
[790.519] converging, carrying all of this
[792.48] sediment north to the Mediterranean and
[795.68] dumping that sediment into this canyon.
[799.279] Now, that was interesting. I have
[800.56] something here about Let me Yeah. How
[802.48] deep is the Nile Canyon? I'm sure the
[804.959] our listeners are going to want to know.
[807.519] Well, let's Yeah, that's where I wanted
[809.519] to go with this. Um because something
[812.36] happened. Something
[814.44] changed. You saw the progress of man.
[817.44] like you're saying that there's there's
[818.959] anthropological evidence
[821.24] that things were not
[823.88] always the way they are contrary to the
[827.519] uh the slow you know uniformitarian
[831.36] correct system that has been laid out
[833.12] for us by the by the establishment.
[836.32] Right. Well, wait till you see what I've
[838.399] got to show you here.
[841.199] um in term when you bringing up in terms
[843.68] of gradualism.
[846.04] Um so this was something I put together
[850.56] here. I was writing uh and I put some of
[853.36] this in the newsletter that went out.
[855.36] people should, if you're not subscribed
[857.279] to the newsletter, get the newsletter
[859.6] because what I'm talking about here,
[861.04] I've got a a whole written presentation
[863.839] uh about some of the uh
[866.92] accumulated evidence for these
[869.079] extraordinary landscape changes and
[871.44] environmental and climatic changes.
[874.92] Um, so the Nile River, it's a famous
[878.079] very long river, but it doesn't it it's
[880.399] a low discharge. You might look up my uh
[882.959] my uh John, what is the annual average
[885.76] discharge of the Nile
[887.72] River? It's not one of the major rivers.
[891.44] It actually is a in terms of big rivers,
[895.36] important rivers, it's low on the
[899.56] uh the scale of of volume of water being
[904.88] conveyed, if you want to put it that
[906.399] way.
[908.88] Average annual discharge is
[912.76] 2800 uh cubic meters per second at
[915.92] ASwan. Okay. 2800 cubic meters per per
[920.48] second. Okay. 2800
[925.44] it reduces to 150 meters per second when
[928.399] it reaches the Mediterranean.
[931.36] It reduces interesting. Okay. Um well
[935.04] that is probably because a lot of it is
[937.76] being absorbed into the sedimentary
[941.079] column that occupies the
[944.199] canyon the Nile
[946.519] canyon. So this is something you have to
[949.04] picture here uh to get the to get the
[951.92] full understanding of what we're talking
[953.839] about here. Um I will mention that if
[957.519] you look at maps and we could actually
[959.6] pull one up here if we wanted. The whole
[962.519] northern Egypt is the Nile Delta, which
[965.68] is exactly what we were just talking
[967.36] about, an aluvial fan.
[970.6] Um, spread out, and it has that very
[973.36] fan-like, uh, shape to it.
[977.0] Uh, and I think I'll go ahead
[980.36] and pull up a map here while we're
[983.199] talking about this. we can refer over
[985.44] here to some some maps and that will be
[989.839] very helpful for people to visualize
[992.8] what we're talking about here. So if we
[996.16] look at the map of the river Nile, we'll
[999.759] see that what I was talking about
[1001.399] earlier, the aluvial fan, we'll see that
[1004.32] the whole uh from Cairo north to the
[1007.44] Mediterranean, from Cairo up to
[1009.16] Alexandria, it's all part of this
[1011.36] aluvial fan that you can see right here.
[1015.279] Uh if I go over to
[1017.639] uh uh satellite view, it shows up very
[1021.839] clearly. You'll notice that in mi in the
[1024.4] midst of all of this brown and barren,
[1027.039] you've got this green Nile, right? And
[1030.16] then you look at the uh you look at the
[1032.559] aluvial fan here, the delta fan of this
[1035.52] material, sedimentary material being
[1037.839] carried out here, and it builds this
[1040.0] fan-like structure. And you'll notice
[1041.52] it's all green. And one reason for that
[1044.559] is because as the water of the Nile
[1046.88] discharges it, it saturates in to the
[1050.12] unconsolidated alovvium that forms the
[1052.559] fan. So it keeps it moist and green. So
[1055.6] this is what made the Egyptian
[1059.559] civilization possible was this the Nile
[1062.799] River. And it's interesting that the
[1065.12] that the rise of the Old Kingdom follows
[1067.6] shortly after this great transition from
[1071.679] the green Sahara into the desert Sahara.
[1075.039] Now, as you're looking at this, what
[1077.44] you're seeing is you're in this in the
[1079.28] uh map, the satellite view that we just
[1082.08] looked at, and you saw that the that the
[1084.16] Nile stood out all lush and green,
[1087.28] right? Um well, what we're looking at is
[1090.32] the top of an aluvial column of material
[1093.6] that has infilled uh the Nile Canyon.
[1096.96] Now, what is this Nile Canyon? Well, the
[1099.2] Nile canyon is an incision in the
[1102.72] limestone bedrock of the Giza of Giza in
[1106.0] that area, at least in the in the area
[1109.28] of the uh near the Giza plateau. But it
[1112.24] goes the the incision actually goes as
[1114.96] far back as south of Azawan. By the time
[1119.24] the canyon gets to Cairo, it's it's
[1124.0] 8,000 ft deep. Okay, 8,000 ft deep. This
[1128.0] is deeper than a mile. This is deeper
[1131.12] than the Grand Canyon by 1500 ft. If we
[1135.039] were able to sweep out, clean out all of
[1138.0] the alovvium from the Nile channel,
[1141.679] you're going to be looking at a sheer
[1143.48] canyon that's 8,000 ft deep right there.
[1146.559] And this canyon is right next to flo
[1149.28] right next to the Giza plateau. And
[1152.48] we're looking at a 2
[1154.12] kilometer descent into the quote unquote
[1157.44] structure beneath the cafrey pyramid as
[1160.799] opposed to how how deep is the Nile uh
[1163.679] valley? 8,000 ft. We're taking a little
[1167.039] bit of a detour here to uh tell a story
[1169.679] that I think is going to be valuable uh
[1172.88] concerning something that uh recently
[1175.12] happened to me. Oh, and I see I'm being
[1176.96] joined by my friend and colleague Mike
[1178.88] Robertson. Hello Rando. How are you? I'm
[1181.76] doing very well, thank you. Well,
[1184.32] regarding this little story we're going
[1185.84] to tell, we won't take too long. We'll
[1187.6] get back to the episode shortly, but I
[1189.28] understand you were in a conference
[1192.08] recently in Florida, was it? Correct.
[1195.039] Yes, in Florida in a beautiful hotel,
[1197.6] the Fiana Hotel, I believe it was.
[1200.48] Excellent. And what uh something
[1202.4] happened there. Uh first of all, how was
[1204.64] the conference? But then I understand
[1206.88] the conference was great. And the hotel
[1208.48] was awesome. But um yeah, everything was
[1211.919] good except I was coming down the stairs
[1214.24] and I think somebody just ahead of me
[1216.24] had spilled a little bit of something
[1219.28] was, you know, crowds moving up and down
[1221.679] and I think somebody spilled a little
[1223.6] something on one of the treads in front
[1225.28] of me and my foot hit it and uh slid out
[1229.12] from under me and I tumbled down three
[1231.6] or four stairs to the bottom. Whoa. Uh I
[1235.12] survived as you can see. Look, I'm still
[1237.44] here and I'm intact. I didn't break any
[1239.52] bones. No, no breaking bones. But I sure
[1241.919] banged up my left knee. That was the
[1244.559] first thing that hit. My left knee hit
[1246.44] that tile floor. And uh it it was
[1251.679] painful, but uh I had to go I was
[1254.88] actually on my way to do a presentation,
[1256.72] so I had to tough it out and go do a
[1259.12] presentation with my uh throbbing left
[1262.72] knee. So anyways, got done with that.
[1265.76] And then as the day progressed, it got
[1267.919] my knee began to swell up and it got
[1270.159] quite painful. And uh I was very
[1274.2] relieved to remember that I had brought
[1276.96] I happened to pack my CBD from the god
[1280.84] sav. And I was really grateful that I
[1284.72] had remembered to do that. So I that
[1288.32] night I put some of the sav on, went to
[1291.039] bed. I regularly applied it uh before I
[1294.32] got dressed and then I put some more on
[1296.32] at night before I went to bed. And I
[1298.159] must say though, I've I've, you know,
[1300.32] being in the construction and building
[1302.0] industry, I've had many falls and in uh
[1304.48] injuries and stuff. And I figured I'm
[1307.2] going to be laid up with this for a
[1308.919] month. We drove home. I think it was
[1311.28] three to four days later. I continued
[1313.6] applying to SAV and I would say within a
[1315.76] week I was getting around pretty good.
[1318.24] Uh Wow. Yeah. It it
[1321.679] It definitely helped. It It most
[1325.64] defining ingredients in that sav that
[1329.039] can actually penetrate in to a to uh to
[1333.919] to really alleviate the
[1336.2] inflammation that's in inside during an
[1339.44] injury like that. Yeah. Yeah. I don't
[1341.84] have all of the specifications for as a
[1344.4] matter of fact we might actually in
[1346.24] later segments we might actually
[1348.0] interview some of the people from the
[1349.84] company who make the product and they
[1351.919] can tell some of the details of um you
[1355.679] know of the ingredients and what they do
[1358.159] and how they because my understanding
[1360.4] it's more than just a pain relief.
[1362.64] There's actually healing
[1365.44] compounds and other ingredients in there
[1367.76] that literally heal as well as pain,
[1371.6] relieve pain. And that is one of the
[1374.08] reasons it works so fast. One of them I
[1376.32] know is comfrey.
[1378.24] And that's a big one. I know that for a
[1380.0] fact because anybody can look it up, but
[1382.24] you know, comry is an ancient name for
[1385.6] um for comry is called the bone healer.
[1389.12] Uhhuh. Yeah. And it gets that name for a
[1392.08] reason. But um did you you said now I
[1396.159] know you take um the Apollo oil as well
[1400.159] like when road trips when I travel when
[1404.0] I travel especially I I always bring the
[1407.28] oil because it helps relax me and I get
[1409.6] a it helps me to sleep and I have a
[1412.08] tough time sleeping sometimes when I'm
[1413.679] on the road and traveling. Uh so it
[1416.24] every little uh advantage I can take
[1419.28] that's going to help me get that rest
[1421.6] and get a good night's sleep because
[1424.08] particularly like if I'm leading a tour
[1426.0] I got to be on all day and for me to do
[1428.96] that effectively I have to have a good
[1430.72] night's sleep. Uh so I bring I always
[1434.64] bring the oil uh when I travel and I I'm
[1438.0] now after this episode I'm like okay I'm
[1440.32] always going to have the sab with me
[1441.679] too. The Nile is the green part.
[1445.559] Uh, lot of Cairo sits on the the the
[1450.32] floor of the Nile Valley. And here you
[1452.96] see the edge of the plateau and you see
[1457.039] the pyramid complex. And literally, if
[1460.799] you go out here and clean this aluvium
[1463.559] out, you'll be on the edge of a canyon
[1468.4] that's 8,000 ft deep.
[1472.0] So, I mean, you don't picture that, but
[1474.559] that is a lot of
[1476.84] erosion. Now, how how long did that
[1479.52] take? Uh, how did it happen? Did it come
[1483.2] about that this canyon was created
[1485.039] that's, you know, 1500 ft deeper or
[1487.6] whatever than the the Grand Canyon?
[1490.159] Well, that's an interesting story in
[1491.84] itself, and I wasn't really going to go
[1494.0] there today too much, but I'll mention
[1496.48] it. uh around 6 million years ago is is
[1501.039] the estimated age. The entire Sahara
[1506.44] uh the entire Sahara not sorry the
[1510.08] entire Mediterranean dried
[1513.799] up. Entire Mediterranean dried up. So
[1517.44] what is the what is the depth of Eastern
[1520.24] Mediterranean? Could you look that up
[1521.919] while we're looking at Got it. Eastern
[1523.36] Mediterranean
[1525.4] depth and it'll we'll see how that
[1528.24] compares to the depth of the Nile
[1530.159] Canyon.
[1535.88] 16,762 max depth. Okay. So, where the
[1541.039] river uh flows into the Eastern
[1544.0] Mediterranean, it wouldn't of course be
[1545.76] that deep right there. It probably in
[1548.559] fact is pretty close to 8,000 9,000 ft
[1551.279] deep right there.
[1553.24] So whatever the explanation for why the
[1556.32] Mediterranean dried up,
[1559.64] uh if that water is gone, now what
[1563.44] happens is that will accelerate the down
[1566.2] cutting,
[1567.96] right? It will uh massively accelerate
[1571.6] the down cutting because what the water
[1573.279] will want to do is it will want to down
[1575.12] cut to the base level. The base level is
[1578.48] going to be the depth of the floor of
[1580.32] the Mediterranean at the point where the
[1582.96] Nile flows in. Right?
[1586.84] So, how is it that that that the entire
[1589.679] Mediterranean Sea dried up? I don't
[1592.32] know. I there's some interesting new
[1594.72] evidence coming out on that that I
[1596.48] haven't really followed up on. But the
[1599.12] part that really interests me though is
[1601.039] the the filling the refilling of the
[1603.919] Mediterranean uh in an event called the
[1606.88] Zancan flood. And apparently if I go
[1610.32] back over here to the Straits of
[1612.52] Gibralar and I zoom in, let's go to
[1616.44] this. There was a major breakthrough
[1619.679] right here because the Atlantic Ocean
[1621.36] was still here but the Mediterranean was
[1623.919] gone.
[1625.44] So there was this breakthrough right
[1627.48] here
[1629.159] and like 100 million cubic feet 100
[1632.88] million cubic meters per second I think
[1636.48] it was the estimate poured through here
[1639.2] and it filled the Mediterranean. If you
[1641.52] look up Zanclean
[1643.88] flood Z an C
[1647.08] lan the Zanclean flood let's get the
[1649.919] exact date on it. I just threw out an
[1651.919] approximate date of 6 million years,
[1655.52] which I remember from when I first
[1656.96] learned about this. The date's probably
[1658.48] been refined. 5.33 million. Uh, so it's
[1662.48] gotten a little younger. 5.33 million
[1665.44] years ago. What does it say about the
[1667.2] Xan Clean flood? Uh, it's theorized to
[1670.559] have refilled the Mediterranean Sea 5.33
[1673.679] million years ago. The flooding ended
[1675.679] the Messian crisis. Messinian.
[1679.36] Messinian. Thank you. Minian salinity
[1682.32] crisis. Messinian salinity crisis and
[1684.88] reconnected the Mediterranean Sea to the
[1686.96] Atlantic Ocean. Although it is possible
[1689.2] that even before the flood, there were
[1691.279] partial connections to the Atlantic
[1692.799] Ocean. The reconnection marks the
[1694.72] beginning of the Zancen age, which is
[1697.52] the name given to the earliest age on
[1699.2] the geological time scale of the
[1701.76] piosene.
[1704.88] That's would make sense. So you had this
[1707.36] g a shift in geological epochs that
[1710.799] seems to have this defining event. Well,
[1714.559] what they didn't do did they get into
[1715.84] the flood at all? Talking about the ma
[1717.919] uh magnitude of the flood. Uh we're
[1720.96] looking sea level rise in the basin may
[1723.12] have reached rates at times greater than
[1724.96] 10 meters per day. Okay, think about
[1728.0] that. 10 m per day. That's like 33 feet
[1732.399] per day. Can you imagine? Flash flood
[1734.799] warning. My gosh, can you
[1737.48] imagine 33 feet per day? So, you're
[1740.32] standing on the shore. How far inland
[1743.2] would you have to go to get, you know,
[1744.799] you'd have to get above 33 feet? You You
[1747.36] couldn't stop to rest. You'd have to
[1748.96] keep moving miles. You'd have to make
[1750.96] miles every day. Yeah. 33 feet. So,
[1754.96] that's the vertical. But then, how does
[1756.96] that translate into the depends on how
[1759.2] long? Yeah, exactly. You'd have to look
[1761.679] at the shelf and you'd have to look at
[1763.2] everything else that was going on there.
[1765.76] Do they to give you the peak dis
[1767.52] estimated discharge through through the
[1770.96] straits?
[1772.64] See, uh, maximum of 100 million cubic
[1775.76] meters per second. Okay, I did get that
[1778.96] right. 100 million cubic meters per
[1781.36] second.
[1782.88] Good God. That's um 100 million 100 1 2
[1788.72] 3 4 5 6 per second time 35 to convert it
[1794.08] to cubic feet because there's roughly 35
[1797.279] cubic feet in a cubic meter. And I'm
[1800.08] going to divide that by
[1802.6] 350 3 4 5 6. So, okay. So, that's at
[1807.52] least 10 times greater than the Missoula
[1810.799] flood peak
[1811.88] discharges. At least at least 10 times.
[1814.48] Oh, look at there. So, this is an
[1816.0] artist's rendition of it right here.
[1819.6] Uhhuh. What it might have looked like
[1822.08] from the satellite if there had been a
[1824.24] satellite 5 million years ago. So, this
[1826.24] is not an actual satellite photograph
[1828.08] from 5 million years ago. Yeah. It it
[1830.64] was lower resolution back then, you
[1832.96] know. Uhhuh. Okay.
[1836.08] Yeah. Okay. So, so now think about
[1839.96] this. We know that the canyon was
[1842.799] already there during the refilling
[1846.279] because marine waters backwashed into
[1849.76] the k into the
[1851.88] canyon all the way to Azwan and then
[1856.279] deposited marine sediment. So there's
[1858.799] thick layers of marine sediments
[1861.36] sandwiched in between the freshwater
[1864.96] sediments that were carried down from
[1868.48] what were
[1869.72] undoubtedly extremely vigorous rainfalls
[1873.52] because there is evidence that even uh
[1876.96] you know the the that the discharge of
[1878.88] the Nile River has been at times much
[1881.919] much greater than now. What was the
[1884.399] number we came up with? You looked up
[1886.24] the p the average annual discharge.
[1889.279] Uh the average what I pulled up was the
[1892.24] average discharge per second. And that
[1895.039] Oh yeah. Yeah. Right. That was uh down
[1898.48] at the Mediterranean Sea. We're looking
[1900.96] at 103 uh 50 cubic meters per per
[1904.559] second.
[1906.159] How many? Uh 150 cubic meters. Okay. 150
[1910.72] cubic meters per second. Okay. And then
[1914.0] you it was greater at Aswan. Azwan was
[1916.799] 2800.
[1919.559] 2800. Well, that's a significant
[1921.76] difference. 2,800 to 150. Where is that
[1925.279] water going? Well, it's what's all that
[1928.32] green lush stuff? It's turning into soil
[1931.919] and percolating into the aluvium. That's
[1934.96] what it's what's happening. Mhm.
[1939.279] So uh anyways let's let's go on here. So
[1943.36] um this is from uh a standard
[1949.399] geological text on uh the river Nile.
[1953.039] It's by a well-known Egyptian geologist
[1957.12] by the name of Sed Rashi. Uh and uh it's
[1962.0] entitled the geological evolution of the
[1964.64] river Nile.
[1967.0] uh published in
[1969.72] 1981. This is what he says. I'm quoting
[1972.159] from his work now from this book. Uh the
[1975.08] Nile is not only small relative to other
[1978.96] rivers of the world. Uh but it is also
[1982.48] small compared to its predecessors since
[1985.44] the incision of the valley of the Nile
[1987.76] as a grand canyon some 2 and a half
[1990.64] kilometers deep about 6 million years
[1994.08] ago. Okay, this is where I got the 6
[1996.0] million years from. Uh, gigantic rivers
[1999.12] have come and gone filling this canyon.
[2002.159] 2.5 k end of quote. 2.5 km is equal to
[2005.6] 8,200 ft or 1.5 miles. It took an
[2010.24] extraordinary amount of water to carve a
[2013.279] canyon to this depth. And this canyon,
[2016.24] as I said, sits right on the edge of the
[2018.399] Giza Plateau.
[2020.399] Now, does that have any implications as
[2023.2] far as the question
[2024.919] of what might be under the I don't know.
[2030.159] Uh but let's go on.
[2032.12] Um the whole area of the Sinai desert
[2035.039] south of Egypt. Let's talk about a
[2036.88] little bit about that. This is a uh from
[2040.0] a paper that uh was published
[2043.64] in 2009. It was actually presented at a
[2047.44] the fall meeting of the American
[2049.04] Geohysical
[2050.839] Union. Title of the paper is mega floods
[2053.2] and landscape change during oxygen
[2055.2] isotope stage three in the cyani
[2058.24] mountains. Oxygen isotope stage three.
[2060.76] We'll talk about that in a second here.
[2063.96] Um so this 2009 fall meeting of the
[2069.28] American Geohysical Union uh this is uh
[2073.76] quoted from that uh by the way let's see
[2076.399] oxygen isotope stage 3 stands uh it was
[2079.599] a climatic period that lasted from about
[2083.24] 60,000 to about 26,000 years ago.
[2087.76] Interestingly, note that 26,000 because
[2090.48] that's right there at the uh one full
[2093.76] processional cycle. 26,000 years. Um,
[2099.119] and something happened there that caused
[2100.88] them to go from oxygen isotope stage
[2103.359] three to oxygen isotope stage two. We'll
[2107.28] not talk about that here, but that'll be
[2109.119] one of the things that we regularly come
[2111.2] back to. So, we'll be uh discussing that
[2113.76] in in more detail later on. But they're
[2116.24] also referred to as marine isotope
[2118.24] stages. And we we'll talk about that is
[2120.079] because they are marking major rapid
[2123.28] abrupt shifts in climate basically that
[2126.0] define these different stages like we're
[2128.88] in stage one. We can go back to stage I
[2131.76] forget 12 14 15 uh which is a hund
[2135.359] couple hundred thousand years ago.
[2138.92] Uh so this is quoting now from this
[2142.16] paper that was presented at the uh fall
[2145.52] meeting of the American Geophysical
[2147.64] Union. Quote, much of the Syinai. Okay,
[2150.4] here we go. Much of the Sinai is deeply
[2153.56] dissected by river valleys or waddis
[2157.119] within the deeply insized valleys.
[2160.4] Mighty sediment fillings up to 50 m are
[2164.0] characteristic elements of the
[2166.079] landscape's morphology. Reaching the
[2168.72] mountain rim, the sediment
[2171.079] p the sedimentation processes formed
[2174.48] mighty and broad aluvial rivers. I'll
[2177.599] read that again. Reaching the mountain
[2179.76] rim from the sedimentation processes
[2183.28] formed mighty and broad aluvial fans. So
[2186.96] this is what I was talking about
[2187.839] earlier. When you have again a
[2190.32] channelized
[2191.56] flow exiting from the mountain front out
[2194.48] onto a valley floor or an open plane or
[2197.2] a basin, uh that's when you get these
[2200.079] broad aluvial
[2201.96] fans. Okay. So what they're saying here,
[2204.64] this is by
[2206.2] 1981 when uh some of the first radar
[2209.68] images coming uh is is showing up uh
[2213.839] because of the uh space shuttle
[2215.76] overflights and they're seeing for the
[2217.839] first time what's under some of the sand
[2220.8] of the of the
[2222.359] deserts. But a lot of it, as I'm about
[2224.8] to show you here in a few minutes, was
[2227.52] actually not buried. You can see the
[2229.2] large canyons, the large channels, these
[2232.48] dissected uh river valleys which are
[2234.88] called wadis. Okay.
[2238.359] Um so let's see in the uh in the early
[2242.96] 1980s okay uh when the North African
[2246.24] overflights of the space shuttle was
[2248.96] carrying this spaceorn imaging radar SIR
[2252.64] radar spaceorn imaging radar uh and also
[2256.24] this system called the global
[2259.72] landbasation project digital elevation
[2262.88] models I'll say that again global
[2265.68] landbase
[2267.72] elevation project digital elevation
[2271.56] models. So using this technology, the
[2274.72] shuttle uh was able to see what lay
[2277.44] hidden beneath the desert sands. And
[2279.76] what did they see? Quote, "Both large
[2282.48] flood features and later superimposed
[2286.32] drainage channels of variable morphology
[2290.0] all drain northeast and eastn northeast
[2293.44] from northwest Sudan.
[2296.16] Some of these channels were enormous.
[2299.2] The authors
[2300.68] describe aluvial filvium fil basins or
[2306.76] valleys about 100 kilometers in length.
[2309.76] This is about 60 miles uh greater than
[2313.68] 15 kilometers wide and at least several
[2317.52] hundred m deep. So several hundred
[2320.72] meters could be 200 300. Let's say it's
[2323.119] 250 m. then we're talking about uh
[2326.64] channels that are 800 ft deep. If we're
[2330.56] talking about a channel here, 60 mi
[2334.04] long, right, uh about 9 mi wide and 7
[2339.839] 800 ft deep. Well, if you've been
[2342.24] watching or or know a lot about the
[2344.32] other research on the scab lands, the
[2347.119] channel scablands of eastern Washington,
[2349.52] I could almost be describing one of the
[2351.2] great coolies uh that are about 800 ft
[2355.44] deep. Uh Grand Coulie only ranges from
[2359.2] about a mile wide to 5 miles wide right
[2362.079] in there. uh we're talking here uh what
[2366.4] they said about 8 or 9 miles wide, but
[2368.96] still we're kind of in that same
[2370.4] magnitude range, that same ballpark as
[2373.119] some of the great coolies that we see in
[2375.68] the uh channel scablands of eastern
[2378.4] Washington. And we know that those
[2381.119] channels were cut out by floods that
[2383.76] ranged in the hundreds of millions of
[2385.92] cubic feet per second. Now, is that the
[2388.64] same magnitude of flows we're talking
[2390.4] about here? Well, we don't know. But
[2392.8] clearly, we're seeing these channels
[2395.04] deeply insized into what is now desert
[2398.64] floor with essentially very little or
[2402.32] any running water at all. But clearly,
[2406.16] this was the handiwork of enormous
[2408.64] volumes of
[2409.88] water. Okay.
[2413.64] Um let's see. Uh yes. So we had both
[2417.44] large flood features and later
[2420.72] superimposed drainage channels of
[2423.359] variable morphology. And where are they
[2425.359] draining? They're all draining towards
[2426.64] the north northeast east northeast in
[2429.92] the direction of Egypt and Libya. Uh
[2434.32] let's see. So um this was from a report
[2439.359] uh that was published in the year 2000
[2442.0] entitled use of radar data to delineate
[2446.16] paleo drainage flow directions in the
[2450.56] salma sand sheet eastern Sahara. This
[2454.4] was uh published in the journal
[2459.0] photogram
[2460.52] photogramtric engineering and remote
[2463.72] sensing.
[2466.52] Uh so here it goes
[2469.8] on it seems easier to relate land forms
[2473.839] in many deserts. This is from
[2477.0] um we're getting now into some of the
[2480.839] uh some of the older things, some of the
[2483.599] older evidence that I like to go back to
[2486.24] actually even from the 60s. And this is
[2489.04] from one of the standard textbooks of uh
[2492.56] the early days of geomor
[2495.48] geomorphological studies. And a
[2497.72] geomorphological study is essentially
[2500.72] the uh the study of the land form. So
[2503.44] this is going back to a standard
[2505.0] textbook 1960, right? So even back as
[2508.72] far back as 1960, it was al already by
[2511.92] that time becoming apparent to
[2513.92] geologists that water had played a very
[2516.56] important and profound role in sculpting
[2518.96] the landscapes of Egypt even though
[2521.599] those landscapes now are some of the
[2523.599] driest on earth. All right. So this was
[2526.16] from a 19 I'm going to quote from a
[2528.76] 1960 standard textbook in
[2531.8] geomorphology by uh one of the actual
[2535.2] considered one of the esteemed names
[2536.96] within uh midcentury geomorphological
[2540.48] studies.
[2541.8] Geomorphology again to remind you is the
[2544.16] study of landscapes and landscape
[2546.2] formation. This was by BW Sparks. So
[2550.64] even back in 1960, the uh geologists and
[2554.72] geomorphologists that had been studying
[2556.48] the area of the Sahara uh knew that uh
[2559.599] it had once uh supported a drastically
[2562.56] different climate. So here we we go.
[2564.319] We're going to quote from that 1960
[2566.8] textbook. Although stream floods and
[2569.68] sheet floods may be effective agents in
[2572.72] the formation of semierid landforms,
[2576.24] many deserts bear the imprint of even
[2579.2] more significant water action. It seems
[2582.8] very doubtful whether the required
[2585.04] amount of water ever falls in present
[2588.2] conditions and many authorities have
[2590.56] attributed such erosion to a wetter
[2593.119] period during the pleaene. For example,
[2596.8] the valley on the west side of the Nile
[2599.44] at Luxor containing the tombs of the
[2602.56] kings appears to be a water eroded
[2605.079] valley. But the tombs themselves show no
[2608.4] signs of destructive water action. This
[2611.68] means that water action of any
[2613.68] significance probably ceased at least
[2617.44] 4,000 years ago.
[2620.72] It seems easier to relate landforms in
[2623.839] many deserts to earlier wetter periods
[2627.28] than to present conditions. Hume gives
[2630.56] photograph after photograph of
[2633.0] steepsided valleys in limestone and
[2636.96] sandstone country in Egypt which are
[2639.92] obviously of water cut form. And now
[2642.079] here's I think the the significant point
[2644.72] many of them containing caves from which
[2648.16] springs probably issued at an earlier
[2650.24] period. The same author has also many
[2653.4] illustrations of closely spaced bad
[2656.56] lands type of valley pattern on imperous
[2660.88] ignous and metamorphic rocks in the same
[2663.2] region. Indeed, the chief impression on
[2666.56] viewing the Mount St. Cyani massf from
[2669.92] the Gulf of Suez is of the gashed sides
[2673.599] of this stark mountain mass.
[2677.16] So the point here is that even back in
[2680.8] 1960 they were already recognizing that
[2684.4] this had to have been a massively water
[2687.96] sculpted landscape in these regions
[2691.2] which of course then implies a very
[2694.56] different kind of environment.
[2697.72] Uh let's see what else did he has to say
[2700.72] here. Yeah.
[2702.76] Um, this is what he says in addition to
[2705.76] that in reference to the wadis which are
[2707.839] these water cut. While you're at it,
[2710.56] John, and while I'm reading this, why
[2712.24] don't you look up wadi and we'll give
[2714.319] the uh we'll give the the definition the
[2717.359] technical definition of a wadi w a
[2720.68] di. So BW Sparks goes on to say further
[2724.48] evidence for a wetter climate is to be
[2728.079] found in the wadi pattern present in
[2730.48] many parts of the deserts. These wadis
[2733.52] are too long and in many cases form too
[2737.44] integrated a pattern for them to have
[2739.92] been formed under present climatic
[2742.119] conditions. In Arabia, wadis of very
[2745.28] great length are known. While some of
[2747.44] the patterns in the Sahara have been
[2750.119] described, the Ahagar massive was
[2753.92] apparently one of the chief watersheds
[2756.56] for enormous wadis radiate from it in
[2760.0] all directions. The comparatively recent
[2763.04] date at which water flowed in these
[2764.88] wadis is attested by the presence of
[2768.0] some of the oases of fish from tropical
[2771.52] Africa.
[2773.44] And then I'm going to defer now here.
[2776.48] I'm going to go over to a uh an article
[2778.88] which appeared in 2010 in the journal
[2782.4] global and planetary change. And the
[2785.76] title this was uh three authors Allan E
[2790.839] Khw who has done a lot of work in the uh
[2794.64] Midwestern North American floods. He's a
[2797.599] very prominent
[2798.76] paleohhydraologist who has studied some
[2801.119] of the great meltwater floods uh of the
[2803.92] Midwestern uh region uh particularly in
[2807.44] North and South Dakota in that area
[2809.68] where a lot of these great spillways
[2811.76] have uh insized big valleys into the
[2815.359] into the prairie. So the title of this
[2819.079] article that appeared in global and
[2821.359] planetary changes, reconstructing an
[2824.24] extreme flood from boulder
[2827.96] transport. Reconstructing an extreme
[2830.72] flood from boulder transport and rain fe
[2834.319] rainfall runoff modeling. This is the
[2837.64] wadisa south cyani Egypt. So boulder
[2841.599] transport, right? The idea is that the
[2844.24] bigger the flood, the faster it's
[2845.92] moving, the more powerful it is, the
[2848.0] bigger boulders, the bigger rocks it's
[2849.92] going to be able to move, transport, and
[2851.76] deposit. Right? We're going to uh look
[2854.4] at a study now that was presented in the
[2856.4] journal Global and Planetary Change in
[2859.359] 2010. The title of this paper is
[2862.319] reconstructing an extreme flood from
[2865.52] Boulder Transport and Rainfall
[2869.16] Runoff. Rainfall runoff modeling. Wadi
[2873.319] Islah, South Sinai, Egypt. So, we found
[2877.28] out, did you find out what a watti was?
[2879.68] Sure. So, a wadi is defined as a valley
[2883.28] uh or ravine that's been carved out by
[2886.56] uh you know, just regular water flow,
[2888.72] but it's typically dry. Unless it's the
[2891.359] monsoon season, it will flow and become
[2894.56] active. Correct. Something. And and just
[2897.28] real quick, it looks something like
[2900.64] this. See if we can add this to the
[2902.319] stage. Okay. Quick. Yeah. So that's a
[2906.079] typical body in Egypt.
[2909.2] This is the area in question. This is
[2911.04] the Sinai Massive here. Yours are the
[2913.599] Gulf of Suez. Now Giza is up in here.
[2917.119] You don't see it off of this picture,
[2918.72] but this study is very uh representative
[2923.119] of many of these wadis that do not have
[2926.24] major water flow in them now. Okay.
[2929.64] Um, so let's take a look here. This is
[2932.4] the area. This is the watershed that
[2934.64] feeds the Wadi that you see right here.
[2937.359] So this study you're we're basically
[2939.839] looking at where the uh the the Wadi
[2943.16] canyon or ravine opens out onto the
[2947.04] plane here. And there's a very
[2950.76] interesting deposits there as you're
[2953.119] about to
[2954.76] see that that provide testimony that the
[2959.839] modern water flows are insignificant
[2962.8] compared to the ancient water
[2968.839] flows. So this is at the mouth, right?
[2972.16] So, as that that water rushing through
[2976.0] this ravine opens into the valley, boom.
[2979.76] This is the kind of stuff it's that it's
[2982.72] this is the kind of stuff that it's
[2984.16] dumping down right now. So, uh, pardon
[2989.2] me. Let's look at the next
[2993.64] one. So, that's a pretty good sized
[2996.16] rock. That's probably 1500 tons right
[2998.48] there. Thousand
[3000.04] tons. So, that's uh a pretty major water
[3005.16] flow.
[3007.0] And we'll just go through some of
[3012.68] these. In this one, you see here smaller
[3017.2] rocks. So, this would have been farther
[3018.8] from the valley mouth, right? Because
[3021.44] the larger the boulders, the bigger the
[3024.8] uh the shorter the distance that they
[3026.96] were transported. So in other words, as
[3029.28] that water spreads
[3031.96] out, you know, from the confinement of a
[3035.079] channel, then the larger stuff goes down
[3039.52] first, and the further out you get from
[3041.68] the discharge point, the uh the smaller
[3045.76] it'll get. So you see some intermediate
[3047.92] size stuff, but this is still a very
[3051.16] impressive depositional feature right
[3053.92] here. This dash line shows the level of
[3057.44] the water that deposited these boulders
[3063.72] here. So he's standing in the wadi here
[3067.04] next to uh these large boulders, right?
[3070.72] And in the background you see the the
[3073.8] walls of the wadi. There would be
[3076.8] another wall you wouldn't see like he
[3079.599] this man the the gentleman here is
[3081.52] facing in this channel. So the thing
[3085.04] here is you can see over here you see
[3087.2] the row of boulders up against the base
[3089.599] of the cliff. Well, so the boulders and
[3093.68] the cliff are basically the function of
[3096.559] the same water flow. So the water flow
[3098.88] that carved the cliff quarried out all
[3102.0] these boulders and dumped it. Now we can
[3105.2] come completely around the other side of
[3107.44] the world to the Snake River plane and
[3110.88] we've got this
[3113.52] And it's the same
[3115.24] thing. It's called a or in this
[3118.4] case it's actually the Snake River
[3120.079] plane. So it's not a because a
[3122.16] koolie would be dry in in in North
[3125.04] American nomenclature. A watti would be
[3127.76] a because a is a channel.
[3130.48] It often times has big boulders in it
[3132.8] and little to no or or insignificant
[3136.319] water flow.
[3138.28] So here you see this is mostly basalt
[3141.119] rounded basults and this is the Snake
[3143.44] River Canyon and the cutting of the
[3146.119] canyon is
[3147.96] what produced this right here.
[3154.119] Um and this here shows a section of
[3160.559] deposits. And the interesting thing I
[3163.44] like to point out to people, this is a
[3166.68] paleocurren indicator. A paleocurrent
[3170.0] indicator uh will give you flow
[3173.76] direction. And the way to understand
[3175.839] that, let's see if I got some books
[3177.44] handy here.
[3181.68] If you have I'll use a like think of
[3184.96] think of uh think of a stack of books.
[3188.64] And if I push them this way, they tilt
[3191.599] this way. If I push them the other way,
[3194.16] they'll tilt like this. This is
[3196.4] essentially what we're seeing in this
[3198.319] image. Let's go like this. I want to get
[3201.04] the same orientation, I think. Yeah,
[3205.52] it's backwards, isn't it? So, I'm
[3207.2] dealing with a mirror here. Uh but yeah,
[3209.599] so this would be what you're looking at
[3213.2] essentially right here. This is imcation
[3215.599] and it's a very useful tool for uh
[3219.839] instantly being able to decipher which
[3222.079] way water is flowing in a fossil
[3225.559] deposit.
[3227.24] Um if that makes sense 100%.
[3231.76] And this is just a large mass of
[3235.24] alovvium. So in the channels you will
[3237.92] have places like in the bends and some
[3239.68] of maybe the hollows and stuff you will
[3241.839] have this deposition of of more almost
[3244.24] like muddy stuff. But if you look in
[3246.4] here like look up at the top huge
[3248.8] boulder up here uh boulders at the
[3251.52] bottom. Hoodos forming on the sides and
[3254.64] that's from runoff right after this is
[3257.64] deposited and you have this clearing
[3260.8] out. Imagine you got thick layer of mud
[3264.0] but the flow continues to come through
[3266.319] and it leaves this channel within the
[3268.92] mud. The mud starts to harden but then
[3271.76] you have erosion from it. The water
[3274.559] subsequent to the deposition of the mud.
[3276.88] It dries out. It forms this kind of a
[3279.2] deposit right here. And you see right up
[3281.359] here at the top also there's boulders at
[3283.2] the top. So this is in the wadi right
[3286.88] and and if we come over to uh America.
[3291.92] All right. So here we have Aftton Canyon
[3294.96] which is in the Mojave Desert of
[3297.079] California. And this is essentially the
[3299.52] same type of uh depositional feature
[3303.2] that we were just looking at in the Wadi
[3306.88] in the Sinai Desert, but this is in the
[3309.359] Mojave Desert. Let's see if I've got
[3311.68] Yeah. So this give you see the little
[3313.68] guy down here for scale. So this kind of
[3316.0] gives you a a sense of this. Now what
[3319.76] this
[3320.76] represents is a channel that was cut uh
[3325.52] that ultimately leads across the Mojave
[3328.24] Desert and
[3330.319] uh terminates in Death Valley. So there
[3334.16] was a whole succession of uh of lake
[3337.119] basins and interconnected channels that
[3340.4] at some point maybe even around the same
[3343.92] time that these bodies were being cut in
[3346.119] Egypt these channels in the western
[3350.16] southwestern deserts formed as well. And
[3353.92] just like you know you have the same
[3355.839] thing you if you start looking you I
[3357.28] don't know if you see any big boulders
[3359.839] here but there are large boulders
[3361.52] dispersed through this. You also see the
[3363.28] formation of the hoodos
[3365.079] here. Essentially, it's the same
[3367.24] feature. So, what what I'm showing you
[3370.16] here is we can identify these
[3373.96] geomorphic after effects of these
[3376.96] gigantic water flows. And once you begin
[3379.68] to understand the basic vocabulary or
[3382.48] the basic alphabet of these events, you
[3386.16] can start connecting these dots and
[3389.04] realize that well, wait a second. We can
[3391.599] see that here we have deserts of the
[3393.44] southwestern United States that have
[3395.839] very similar type of evidence of
[3398.16] gigantic water flows of previous
[3400.559] tempered if even almost lush when there
[3403.119] was rivers and lakes in abundance and
[3406.079] they're gone now and and desert aid
[3409.72] aridification has set in. So to me this
[3413.2] raises very interesting questions about
[3416.079] climate and environment and how much it
[3418.24] changes and on what scale on what level.
[3421.52] uh and I think we could say sometimes it
[3423.44] changes very fast, very dramatically and
[3426.64] on a perhaps global scale and this is
[3431.2] what tends to be overlooked in a lot of
[3434.92] the concern about climate change to not
[3438.559] necessarily try to bring it back to that
[3440.319] whole issue but I'm afraid we need to
[3443.92] because that is kind of an issue in that
[3445.839] there has been a very concerted effort
[3448.319] to focus the emphasis on one uh mode of
[3453.359] change and one only and that's
[3456.119] anthropogenic when clearly this kind of
[3459.599] evidence is something on a completely
[3462.0] different scale. Okay. So
[3465.0] this is the configuration of the
[3468.599] Laurentide ice sheet loes in Wisconsin
[3472.4] at the end of the last ice age showing
[3475.2] locations of tunnel channels and
[3477.48] Drumland topography. Approximately 70
[3481.2] tunnel valleys intersect the margin of
[3483.599] the Green Bay Wisconsin Valley and
[3485.52] Chipoa lobes. So here's the lobe. This
[3488.48] is Lake Michigan. Here's the state of
[3490.319] Wisconsin. Now, if we look at this, each
[3492.64] one of these little hash marks
[3494.24] represents a tunnel
[3496.76] valley. Well, these tunnel valleys are
[3499.96] essentially just another name. If they
[3502.559] were over there in the Sinai, we'd be
[3504.4] calling them wadis. They were out there
[3506.48] in the Pacific Northwest, we'd be
[3508.0] calling them
[3509.079] coolies, right? But here, they're being
[3511.44] called tunnel valleys. But like it says,
[3514.64] there's uh approximately 70 of them. I
[3516.88] mean at each of these points that is
[3519.119] where
[3519.96] major channels of meltwater coming from
[3523.04] under the ice sheet discharged right so
[3527.28] you have this very for one thing you
[3529.52] have this alteration in pressure regime
[3532.28] regimes but you also because of that
[3535.119] when it's flowing under the ice it's
[3536.64] under pressure because it's under
[3538.319] pressure it's more hydraulically
[3540.0] energetic so it's capable of entraining
[3543.52] and moving sediment more effectively
[3546.4] Then once it discharges from the ice
[3548.64] sheet and begins to it essentially does
[3551.04] the same thing when it's under the ice
[3552.96] sheet it's in a confined channel it
[3554.799] comes out from underneath the ice sheet
[3557.68] and it spreads out. So then what it does
[3560.16] is it deposits the sedimentary load that
[3563.04] it was carrying. So, if we go to the
[3565.04] next slide, this is I was able to find
[3567.92] uh like at the Antiggo
[3571.2] uh one here in the B uh the Bryant,
[3575.44] we've got some photographs of the
[3577.119] discharge and it's actually being
[3578.96] quarried and this is what it looks
[3581.559] like. So, here you see the tunnel valley
[3584.799] comes out, discharges from under where
[3586.96] the glacier was and you can see for
[3589.68] scale, look at the dump truck
[3591.88] here. Now go back to here and imagine
[3595.44] that you've essentially got similar
[3597.2] stuff in every one of
[3600.839] these.
[3603.319] Oops. So notice the parallels between
[3606.799] what we're seeing right here and the
[3608.4] pictures of the wadis that we just saw.
[3611.04] So all in all, what we're seeing here is
[3614.16] evidence of gigantic floods. Now is this
[3618.64] necessarily the same kind of a flood as
[3620.559] we saw in the Sinai? Well, not
[3622.119] necessarily because this is glacial
[3626.359] meltwater. What was the source of the
[3628.48] water in the cyani? What was the source
[3630.4] of the water that was creating the
[3632.88] plexus of interconnected channels all
[3635.28] over the bedrock of the Sahara? Well,
[3638.0] I'm guessing it was probably
[3639.88] rainfall. A lot of
[3642.76] rainfall. Lots and lots of rainfall. And
[3647.16] uh but how much
[3650.04] rainfall? I don't know. We need to I'm
[3652.799] sure there are more studies because I
[3654.4] have not availed myself of all the
[3656.72] studies. Probably somebody has done a
[3659.119] quantitative analysis somewhere along
[3661.76] the line. I haven't seen it but u it
[3665.76] would certainly be worthwhile to address
[3667.839] that question of where is the source of
[3671.359] the
[3672.119] water and if it is rainfall because I
[3674.72] don't think it would have been glacial
[3676.24] melt. uh even during the ice age there
[3679.04] was not you know like some of the higher
[3681.359] mountains like Kilimanjaro and others
[3683.119] yes did have expanded glaciers but would
[3685.52] that have been enough water source to
[3688.24] create the wadis I don't know the answer
[3691.04] to that but it's a very interesting and
[3693.68] important question so yeah here's a good
[3696.559] overall view and what's interesting
[3698.0] about this is the colors are based on
[3699.839] elevation not
[3701.799] vegetation but this whole area up here
[3704.48] which is now desert was
[3708.119] intermittently green and there's been a
[3711.68] lot of interesting studies about what
[3713.359] was happening culturally, what kind of
[3715.599] animals were living there.
[3718.68] Um, when you look at the uh floor of the
[3722.44] Mediterranean, uh you can see here that
[3725.68] there was would have been a whole
[3727.119] complex. Now, 6 million years ago again
[3729.599] or 5.3 million years ago, this was all
[3732.16] dry.
[3733.68] And when that water gushed through the
[3736.72] aperture here, we found out, we learned
[3739.599] that some of the estimates say up to
[3742.76] 30 30 feet per day. 30 feet per day. 30
[3747.04] feet per day. I'm still trying to wrap
[3749.28] my head around that. During the late,
[3751.2] this is from paleo oceanography of the
[3754.4] postglacial eastern Mediterranean was in
[3757.52] nature
[3759.4] 1979. During the late deep water, the
[3763.2] hydrography of the eastern Mediterranean
[3765.359] underwent severe changes in response to
[3767.839] climatic
[3769.079] fluctuations. Among the most striking of
[3771.92] these changes were periods of deep water
[3774.28] stagnation. Well, that is evidence that
[3777.359] there were enormous after the refilling
[3780.0] of the
[3780.92] Mediterranean, there continued to be
[3782.88] really gigantic floods coming down the
[3785.04] Nile and those floods discharged out
[3787.839] with fresh water. The fresh water is
[3790.24] less dense than the salt water of the
[3793.24] Mediterranean, right? Well, what happens
[3795.359] is it forms a freshwater lid that uh
[3798.88] interrupts the circulation, the oxygen
[3802.68] circulation that occurs, the
[3804.68] thermmoaline circulation. Um it creates
[3807.92] a density stratification that
[3810.599] inhibits the the the carrying of oxygen
[3814.0] down to deep waters. So what happens?
[3816.24] there's not enough oxygen to
[3819.4] uh to cause the decay of uh organic
[3823.359] material that is now being flushed out
[3825.359] in these very vigorous floods. So the
[3827.599] vigorous floods do two things. They
[3829.92] flush out organic material that settles
[3832.48] to the bottom and then they create this
[3834.559] density stratification that prohibits
[3837.119] oxygen from reaching that freshly
[3839.359] deposited organic material. So what it
[3841.599] does is it doesn't fully decay. It
[3843.28] doesn't it it it forms layers of
[3846.16] sapropel. It's called
[3848.119] um episodes of oxygen deplet depletion
[3851.92] are indicated by the presence of layers
[3854.64] of dark sapropolitic muds enriched in
[3859.2] organic carbon devoid of the remains of
[3862.079] benthic organisms. Bottom dwelling
[3864.48] organisms that's
[3866.28] benthic. Several theories have been
[3868.319] proposed to explain the past
[3869.52] stagnations. They all use a mechanism
[3871.44] which stabilizes the water column by
[3873.76] forming a steep density gradient in the
[3875.92] upper waters. In this way the vertical
[3877.92] mixing and hence the ventilation are
[3880.319]  Oxygen is depleted in the deep
[3882.88] water and stagnation commences. Olison's
[3886.16] theory whereby influx of fresh water
[3888.319] leads to reduced surface density and the
[3890.24] interruption of normal vertical
[3891.72] circulation is the most widely accepted
[3894.16] at the present. That's still pretty much
[3895.68] the same idea.
[3898.2] But what this is showing is there was
[3900.64] increased precipitation at the same time
[3903.68] as these sapropolitic layers were being
[3906.76] deposited. Um we're not going to get
[3908.96] into this a lot right now other than I
[3911.92] think that we're going to leave it here
[3913.039] at this um and then come back to the
[3915.44] question that we opened this discussion
[3917.119] with. But uh the evidence of these
[3921.44] sapropolitic layers uh suggests that
[3924.24] there were extraordinary floods coming
[3926.079] down the
[3927.48] Nile. Extraordinary floods, much larger
[3931.119] than any that we've seen in recent
[3933.839] years. And notice the date roughly in
[3936.799] that window, you know. Um
[3941.2] right here's a good place to to leave it
[3943.92] here with this and then circle back. The
[3946.16] geomorphic evol evolution of the Nile
[3948.4] Valley until the late middle pleaene was
[3951.359] dominated by local hydrographic
[3954.2] dynamism with major wadis supplying the
[3957.68] bulk of the runoff and sediment
[3959.44] redistribution by the Nile. Some five or
[3962.48] six meters of well-rounded cobble
[3964.799] conglomerates may overly the potholed
[3968.079] bedrock floors of Nubian wadis. That's
[3971.2] another important indication. Potholes
[3973.92] are formed by extremely turbulent
[3976.079] vortices
[3977.76] uh in fastmoving water and we don't find
[3981.599] a lot of that occurring today. No, at
[3984.96] all really. So they imply a local base
[3988.0] level at or below modern flood plane and
[3990.559] record a last episode of high wad
[3994.359] competence in valleys now transporting
[3997.039] little coarser than sand grain
[3998.96] particles.
[4000.559] So that's obviously a very dramatically
[4003.68] different flow
[4005.0] regime and this speaks of major pluial
[4009.039] events in recent geological history of
[4012.079] this
[4015.0] planet. Very interesting stuff. So we're
[4018.079] not going to go there. But then so
[4020.559] here's the thing.
[4023.039] All this water flowing over and eroding
[4026.4] limestone bedrock would have also
[4029.359] penetrated beneath the surface. Right?
[4032.559] Just makes sense. As is the case with
[4034.96] well-known examples of limestone
[4036.72] terrains all over the world which are
[4039.2] honeycombed with extensive cave networks
[4042.0] and prominent carstification.
[4045.44] So perhaps it's not
[4048.52] improbable that there could be
[4050.4] substantial voids below the surface of
[4052.24] the Giza plateau as was asserted by
[4055.68] author and researcher Andrew Collins in
[4058.64] his 2009 book beneath the pyramids where
[4061.68] he actually goes in and explores some
[4064.96] caves. Not on of course on the scale
[4067.359] that we're talking about here with this
[4068.96] new research but but significant caves
[4072.52] nonetheless. Uh but it is a considerable
[4076.0] leap to go from natural cave systems to
[4079.68] the existence of some kind of massive
[4082.4] underground machinery complex or
[4084.48] whatever it is that the animations are
[4086.52] showing. So for the time being I'm not
[4089.52] going to go beyond that. Uh but I've
[4092.559] just been informed that I those Italian
[4095.359] scientists who published this work are
[4097.52] going to be at the cosmic summit. So,
[4100.96] I'll try to keep an open mind.
[4104.64] It'll be interesting. But yeah, the tomb
[4106.88] of the birds, which Andrew Collins
[4108.96] explored, is 500 something yards away
[4112.319] from the cafir pyramid, and those are
[4114.56] carsted caves. Carsted caves. Yeah. To
[4117.199] your point, the cenotes in Mexico uh
[4119.92] near
[4120.679] Chichenita, you have uh plenty of cars
[4124.0] caves underneath those pyramids. So it's
[4128.08] it's not to say that one way or the
[4130.48] other this is this is disqu or upsetting
[4134.239] the these Italian scientists apple cart.
[4136.64] It's just there's definitely a potential
[4139.759] natural explanation.
[4142.159] That's that's the whole point. I think
[4143.839] there's a potential natural explanation.
[4147.12] I would think the natural explanation is
[4151.48] uh you know is that it's carstification.
[4154.96] So, the cave of
[4157.64] Ha Fata in Libya, it's the largest cave
[4161.839] in the Mediterranean basin and one of
[4163.6] the largest caves in the world right
[4167.0] there. Huah Fatia remains one of the
[4169.759] best evidences that humans have existed
[4171.6] continuously in one site in Libya. I
[4174.08] don't know why that is. Uh but yeah,
[4177.199] that's a
[4179.319] pretty pretty substantial hole in the
[4181.839] ground and not that far away. Not that
[4185.839] far away geolog right geographically
[4188.96] speaking. Mhm. It's not that far away at
[4192.159] all. Right.
[4193.92] So,
[4195.719] uh, so we're going to leave it at that
[4199.199] and I'm going
[4201.0] to conjecture that there could be large
[4204.159] caves. Now, the last question we will
[4206.64] raise then is if if
[4210.04] if these are caves, larger caves, have
[4214.159] they ever been accessed by people?
[4219.6] And if so, I
[4222.04] mean, look, we've seen some of the
[4225.719] scale of the engineering capabilities of
[4229.04] ancient people on a monumental scale.
[4232.4] So, it wouldn't necessarily be
[4233.92] completely out of the
[4235.64] question that if humans had accessed
[4238.96] large caves by one means or another that
[4241.44] they could have modified those caves. I
[4245.679] think I think we actually could site
[4248.4] actual evidence that in some cases
[4251.36] people did modify caves uh on the scale
[4255.679] that we're seeing here. I don't know.
[4257.6] Remains to be seen. Well, that that is
[4260.56] the tomb of the birds, right? You know,
[4264.08] five football fields away. It's caves to
[4268.0] to your point,
[4270.04] carcification, exploited and used by the
[4272.64] ancient people for tomb. So, it's been
[4275.92] definitely been done before. So, shout
[4277.92] out for Andrew Collins
[4280.12] book. I haven't read it, but now I
[4282.64] better go back and read it before the
[4284.76] summit. I don't think he's going to be
[4286.8] there. Maybe he is going to be there.
[4288.96] He's big in the UK in the Megalith Mania
[4292.32] UK
[4293.719] group. So, maybe we should get you two
[4296.159] together.
[4298.719] Yeah. I've seen some of their stuff
[4300.08] online, but I've not had any interaction
[4302.4] with that group.
[4304.08] Yeah.
[4306.64] Okay. Well, I think that's about all my
[4309.36] voice is going to, you know, I've been a
[4310.96] little horsearse this week. Uh, getting
[4313.04] better. Another day or two, I should be
[4314.719] back to normal, but I don't want to
[4317.12] overt tax my voice after I've been
[4320.0] horse. There was something going around.
[4321.44] I had two days of a sore throat, which
[4323.52] is gone, thank God. Um, hadn't had a
[4326.32] sore throat in a few years. Anyways, um
[4330.0] so at that point, I mean, there's always
[4331.6] more we could talk about, but we'll save
[4333.84] that for another
[4336.679] episode. Well, John, thanks for joining
[4339.199] me. Thanks for having me. And uh yeah,
[4343.36] we'll uh do this again soon. Yes, sir.
[4346.48] See you soon. See you.

Title: Ice Ages Ended Faster Than We Thought
[0.08] in the early '7s was what is called the
[2.32] energy paradox. With the uh advent of
[5.52] radiocarbon dating in the 1950s, what
[8.08] happened is you accumulated a couple of
[9.679] decades of radiocarbon dating. After a
[11.84] couple of decades, the geologists and
[14.0] the climatologists and so on, they're
[15.759] looking at that data and they're going,
[16.88] "Wait a second. Our old models of the
[19.279] onset of a glaciation, glacial period,
[21.76] the termination of a glacial period were
[24.24] tens of thousands of years, 50, 60,
[26.48] 70,000 years. Radiocarbon dating is now
[29.039] showing it happened way way faster than
[31.359] that. For example, radiocarbon dating
[33.68] showed that in central area of Canada
[36.48] where it was assumed that there had been
[38.239] a mile, a mile and a half of ice,
[40.399] forests were growing like 30,000 35,000
[43.52] years ago. Well, clearly there was no
[45.12] ice there when the forests are growing
[46.559] there, right? The other thing was the
[48.079] rapidity with which the whole thing came
[50.079] to an end. Rather than 15, 20, 25,000
[53.52] years, it was more like 3 4 5,000 years.
[56.16] So this is what introduced the concept
[57.92] of the energy paradox.

Title: Europe’s Climate Has Flipped Before
[0.24] the strangest contrast to what now meets
[3.6] the eye. In these latitudes, we see our
[6.4] islands and northern Europe at one time
[9.36] enveloped in snow and ice. While from
[12.719] the Alps and other mountain areas,
[15.28] enormous glaciers descend to the low
[18.0] grounds. At another time, the British
[20.08] islands are united to the continent and
[22.16] the land is occupied by savage men and
[25.72] animals, many of which have long since
[28.72] vanished from the European fauna. In a
[31.76] word, epochs of Arctic severity are
[35.68] beheld alternating with epochs of genial
[39.76] climate conditions, each accompanied by
[42.879] less or greater geographical changes
[46.32] throughout a protracted cycle of Time.

Title: The Cold That Changed Everything
[0.08] The tale of climatic deterioration, that
[3.2] is to say cooling from the early mid
[6.96] middle ages to sometime about 1700 is
[10.639] equally clear from Iceland where grain
[13.519] cultivation had to be given up. from
[15.679] Norway where farms in many upland
[17.92] districts stood empty for hundreds of
[20.8] years to some extent from Denmark where
[23.359] English visitors to a royal wedding in
[26.039] 1406 reported much
[29.08] uncultivated soden land and that wheat
[32.64] was grown nowhere although it had been
[35.28] grown as far north as central Norway
[38.0] around 1280 and from the plains of
[41.2] Eastern Europe where increasing
[43.12] frequency of floods and famine Mons and
[45.52] harshness of the winters led to many
[48.079] more deaths and even incidents of
[50.879] cannibalism.

Title: Are We Ignoring the Real Drivers of Climate Change?
[0.16] there's still not enough importance
[2.32] being attributed to this phenomena. And
[4.64] of course, one of the reasons for that
[6.64] now is the dominant paradigm is
[8.8] anthropogenic climate change. And if we
[11.92] I've been making this point all along
[13.679] that if we start looking at natural
[15.839] triggers for climate change whether it's
[18.039] volcanism or changes in oceanic
[21.0] circulation or changes in solar
[23.64] variability, galactic ray bombardment.
[26.32] We could go through a whole list of
[27.92] potential other influences on climate.
[30.24] The point is though is to talk about
[32.48] these things then diverts attention away
[35.2] from the dominant paradigm which again
[37.6] is anthropogenic climate change and they
[40.0] would be distractions from the
[42.0] imposition of that particular narrative
[44.64] into the discussion of particularly of
[48.239] policy and I think this is probably one
[50.16] of the main reasons for the neglect of
[52.48] some of these other factors which I
[54.8] would consider two of the most important
[57.039] being the impact phenomena and solar or
[60.0] variability.

Title: When Geologists Believed in Catastrophe
[0.08] When I finally got serious about
[1.839] studying geology in the early 1980s, I
[5.359] determined to familiarize myself with
[7.52] the history of the subject. There was a
[9.44] book. It was published in 18 going back
[11.599] a ways to 1874 and it was authored by
[15.519] the muchhonored Scottish geologist James
[18.8] Gy who lived from 1839 to 1915. The
[23.119] title was the great ice age and its
[26.4] relation to the antiquity of man. The
[28.96] earlier students of the physical history
[31.199] of our earth considered that a great gap
[35.04] or strongly defined boundary line
[37.6] separated the present from the past.
[40.239] Some mighty convulsion of nature was
[42.8] believed to have marked the close of
[45.52] geological time and to have preceded the
[48.399] advent of man and the introduction of
[51.36] the plants and animals with which he is
[54.399] associated.

Title: Tunguska Wasn’t a One-Off
[0.08] When you put that together into your
[1.76] models, and this is now the model of a
[3.52] comet nucleus, and it's basically an icy
[5.92] matrix, and within that icy matrix,
[7.919] you've got all of these chunks and
[9.679] pieces. When that matrix fragments, you
[12.88] now get all kinds of subnuclei. Yeah.
[15.839] So, you got a Halley type comet nucleus.
[18.08] So, what happened? You had a single
[20.0] object like this that got ripped into 21
[22.96] pieces. Now, if it hadn't plunged into
[25.039] Jupiter, each one of those 21 pieces
[27.199] could have spawned a whole another
[29.119] generation of cometary debris. Do you
[31.519] know explosion in Siberia of 1908? The
[34.16] Tonguska event of 1908 was probably a
[36.559] piece of a comet. It was about 150 ft in
[38.96] diameter. It had, what's interesting
[41.2] about that is the explosion, the energy
[43.92] of explosion of that Tangusa event was
[46.239] about 15 megat tons. That's the
[48.0] estimate. So conveniently, we've got a
[50.719] natural event that was about 15 megat
[52.96] tons, but we know the destructive
[54.8] potential of a 15 megat ton explosion
[56.879] because we tested bombs with that level
[59.76] of energy released. So in other words, a
[62.0] tangusa of explosion, 150 foot wide
[66.32] meteor or piece of comet and then they
[68.479] said this happens every 500 years by the
[70.56] time it hit our atmosphere was going
[72.08] 40,000 km per hour like a 15 megat ton
[74.799] hydrogen bomb. I think that that's
[76.32] wrong. I think that we have to look at
[78.0] once or twice a century at least.

Title: Climate Change Before Carbon
[0.08] I will mention that I have studied and
[2.56] frequently discussed the work of Hubert
[5.12] Lamb, the English climatologist and
[8.92] meteorologist who founded the climate
[11.519] research unit at the University of East
[14.44] Anglia and is considered one of the
[16.96] original and eminent lights in the field
[19.279] of climatology. I will mention that the
[22.08] uh climate research unit at uh East
[24.76] Anglia was the one involved in the
[27.84] controversy about the released emails
[31.84] showing that there was collaboration to
[34.2] suppress certain evidence that
[36.559] contradicted the carbon dioxide driven
[39.84] climate change narrative. Getting back
[41.44] to Hubert Lamb, I'm going to quote
[43.04] extensively from two of his papers.
[45.6] Climatic changes during the last five or
[48.559] 6,000 years appear at some times to have
[52.64] allowed sufficient vegetation for
[55.6] primitive men and animals to travel
[58.039] across what are now deserts in North
[61.64] Africa, Central Asia, and northern
[65.159] Mexico, southwestern United States of
[68.24] America, and at other times to have cut
[70.64] off these routes of trade and migration
[74.0] within the last thousand years. Various
[76.32] categories of evidence suggest that
[78.32] there was at first rather little
[81.439] permanent ice on the Arctic seas.

Title: Witches, Weather & the Rise of Freemasonry
[0.08] were directly connected with inclement
[2.56] weather. You know, there would be a cold
[4.4] spell or a hail storm and the priests
[7.04] were blaming that upon the witches. So,
[9.519] in order to try to rectify the um bad
[12.48] weather of the 14, 15, 1600s and so on,
[17.279] they were burning women at the stake and
[20.16] they were also killing Freemasons. If
[22.64] you were a Freemason, perhaps your life
[24.88] would be in danger. What year is this?
[26.96] Oh, this would be from 1400s right down
[29.599] to the early 1700s. And then what
[32.16] happened was as society became more
[34.239] liberal and more, you know, open to
[36.0] science and all this right on the heels
[37.84] of the scientific uh enlightenment, what
[40.48] you would call in the Renaissance, in
[42.92] 1717. You had three lodges in the United
[46.64] Kingdom in the British Isles that sort
[49.68] of in a sense went public. They joined
[52.0] forces. They formed what is now still to
[54.32] this day the Grand Lodge of Britain. I
[56.399] think it was 1717. They consolidated
[59.44] these separate lodges that had existed
[62.16] in secret. They joined forces 1717 and
[65.439] became the Grand Lodge of Britain which
[67.76] charters most of the of the Masonic
[69.92] lodges around the

Title: Jupiter Took the Hit
[0.08] You got to picture these things are out
[1.68] there orbiting the sun, right? A lot of
[4.4] them are, think of it like a cosmic
[6.319] pingpong game. And a lot of these things
[8.4] like comets and asteroids that are
[10.559] circling in an orbit that takes them out
[12.96] to Jupiter and back to the sun again.
[15.2] Well, do you remember 1994, summer of
[18.56] 1994, July, when 21 objects of a
[22.24] fragmented comet plunged into Jupiter?
[24.4] Shoemaker leaving 9. It's circling,
[26.8] going into the sun, going back out,
[29.76] going behind Jupiter, and coming back
[31.519] in. It's a big elliptical orbit. Each
[34.079] time it's going out there to Jupiter,
[35.76] it's being Jupiter's gravity is puddling
[37.92] it in closer and closer. The last time
[40.719] before it was discovered, it has just
[42.8] passed within Jupiter's gravity field.
[44.96] Jupiter's gravity field is so powerful
[47.2] that it literally ripped a single comet
[49.76] nucleus into 21 pieces. And that's what
[52.719] you're seeing here, the so-called string
[54.399] of pearls. Now, astronomers can predict
[58.64] orbits if they know basically what are
[60.719] called the orbital elements. And so, it
[62.8] took 3 months of observations and you've
[65.28] got enough of the ellipse, the orbital
[68.159] ellipse to reconstruct the whole
[70.4] ellipse. You've also got data on the
[72.68] velocity. So, when you put that together
[75.04] into your models with the other orbital
[77.2] elements, you can now make predictions.
[79.119] And so after they discovered this thing
[81.92] just after it's coming around behind
[83.6] Jupiter and in the early stages of
[85.52] breaking apart in the second week of
[87.799] July 1994, these 21 pieces were going to
[91.119] fall into Jupiter. The impact of the
[93.2] object we were just talking about,
[94.799] that's 50 million megat tons of TNT. The
[98.159] largest hydrogen bomb ever tested by the
[100.799] human race is what that video

Title: The Year Without a Summer
[0.16] Everything we know would be gone so
[2.08] quickly. If that phone dies, all that
[4.48] stuff's gone. If something hit us, if we
[7.04] lost the power grid for a decade. You
[9.28] heard the year without a summer, 1816.
[12.12] Tambbora, plus several other unknown
[15.519] volcanoes erupted within about a 5-year
[18.0] span. Tambbora was the big one,
[20.16] Indonesia, and it disgorged huge amounts
[23.039] of ash and fine sediment into the
[26.4] atmosphere, which circled the globe. And
[28.88] basically, this was in 1815. The
[31.439] following summer there was basically no
[33.52] summer. They were having Fourth of July
[36.0] commemoration in New England and it was
[38.559] snowing out. Wow. Fourth of July. And
[41.2] this has been referred to as the last
[42.8] great subsistence crisis of Western
[45.04] civilization because there was famine
[47.28] because you had agricultural failures.
[49.68] So you have this thing that you can
[51.039] begin to to to track now where you have
[53.6] primarily cold that's brought about by I
[56.239] think primarily vulcanism is going to be
[58.16] the main instigator of this but also I
[60.879] think hypervelocity impacts
[62.8] hypervelocity impacts are way way more
[65.92] common it was even assumed a decade two
[68.56] decades certainly a generation ago we
[70.56] actually been rather lucky in the last
[72.479] few centuries that we've not had any
[74.72] major impacts

Title: Why Don’t We Take Impact Craters Seriously?
[0.08] It almost seems that there is a
[1.6] reluctance to take craters seriously.
[4.799] Given their potential importance in
[7.279] assessing impact hazards, it is
[9.76] surprising that their identification is
[12.08] not afforded more importance by nation
[14.799] states. In general, they are not
[16.8] regarded as national priorities and
[19.92] their study is left to the whim of
[21.84] individual researchers. Despite that,
[25.279] there is a reasonable evidence for at
[27.84] least a dozen craters on land within the
[31.439] past 5,000 years. That would equate
[34.8] allowing for the greater area of the
[37.76] ocean to a minimum of 40 notable impacts
[41.84] on the entire Earth's surface in this
[44.719] time interval.

Title: Did Atlantis Sink at the Azores?
[0.0] The Azors are actually islands that are
[1.92] above sea level and the major part of
[4.24] the plateau is a mile to a mile and a
[5.839] half underwater. So that's where all the
[8.559] action would be most likely. Yes. And is
[11.519] there any sort of plan to do an
[15.56] excavation or some sort of an expedition
[18.0] where they go underwater and look at
[20.16] some of that stuff? And a lot of what
[21.439] I'm documenting here is how catastrophic
[23.68] some of these events were. I mean, you
[25.359] would have had massive tsunamis that
[27.68] would have affected everything. Like
[29.279] Plato says, Atlantis subsided beneath
[32.48] the waves because of a great earthquake.
[34.96] And we can actually show now that um
[37.2] there has evidence of massive traumatic
[40.399] seismic events along the mid Atlantic
[42.96] ridge coincident with the rapid rise of
[45.44] sea level. So, a lot of the pieces fit

[35.07] [Music]
[44.559] So when I finally got serious about
[46.719] studying geology in the early 1980s, I
[50.16] determined to familiarize myself with
[52.399] the history of the subject, being aware
[55.28] of the criticism heaped upon the
[57.28] proponents of geological catastrophism
[60.239] during this era of the 70s and 80s and
[63.84] the decades leading up to it by the
[66.72] mainstream scientific community. I was
[69.52] learn surprised to learn to what extent
[72.56] the gentlemen who are considered to be
[75.04] the founders of the discipline of
[77.799] geology were virtually all
[79.92] catastrophists in one form or
[82.6] another to this extremely interesting
[85.68] historical chronicle. I will turn in
[88.56] other episodes upcoming episodes of
[90.96] squaring the
[92.36] circle. But there is some classic work
[95.2] from which I would like to uh quote that
[97.92] I would like to uh invoke a little bit
[100.24] here to uh sort of lay the groundwork
[103.36] for what is to come. There was a book.
[106.0] It was published in 18 going back a ways
[108.24] to
[109.72] 1874 and it was authored by the
[112.759] muchhonored Scottish geologist James Gy
[116.479] who lived from 1839 to
[120.119] 1915. The title of this book and this
[122.96] was one of the early books that I I re
[126.079] read on the subject of geology. Uh the
[129.2] title was the great ice age and its
[132.4] relation to the antiquity of man. I came
[135.84] across a worn copy of this work in a
[138.08] university library sometime in the first
[141.44] few years of the
[143.0] 1980s. Upon opening the book, I read the
[146.4] following on page one.
[149.36] The earlier students, and I quote, the
[151.52] earlier students of the physical history
[153.84] of our earth considered that a great gap
[157.599] or strongly defined boundary line
[160.239] separated the present from the past.
[163.76] Some mighty convulsion of nature was
[166.879] believed to have marked the close of
[169.599] geological
[171.4] time and to have preceded the advent of
[174.64] man and the introduction of the plants
[177.599] and animals with which he is associated.
[181.84] It was hardly doubted that the present
[183.68] distribution of land and water dated
[186.08] back to an age anterior to the coming of
[189.519] our race and that when man first entered
[192.56] Britain, uh, Giky was a a British
[196.44] geologist. When man first entered
[198.64] Britain, he had to cross seas that
[200.8] rolled between us and the continent. In
[203.92] short, it was held that within the human
[206.48] period only a few minor changes had been
[209.28] affected in the physical aspect of our
[212.0] country. It was admitted indeed that
[215.68] large areas of forest land had been
[219.08] displened and that consider considerable
[222.4] trackcts of pete bog had grown and that
[226.319] here and there where the coasts were
[228.319] formed of incoherent materials. The sea
[232.0] had made some inroads.
[234.64] But no one supposed that greater changes
[237.28] than these had come about since the
[240.48] first occupation of
[244.439] Britain. To
[246.28] summarize, the view was that from the
[249.2] time of the first occupation of the
[251.76] British Isles by humans, the climate had
[254.959] been more or less stable and the modern
[257.84] configuration of the landscape had not
[259.919] undergone significant change.
[262.639] However, it was believed by a not
[265.44] insignificant few that there had been a
[268.24] mighty convulsion of nature only that it
[271.759] had occurred prior to the advent of man.
[276.32] Giki goes on to say this quote,
[279.72] "Subsequent research, however, has
[282.479] overturned many of these opinions and
[285.44] widened our views as to the magnitude of
[288.4] the physical changes of which man has
[291.52] been the witness. Not only have great
[295.199] oscillations of climate happened within
[298.56] the human period, but the distribution
[301.44] of land and sea also has undergone very
[305.32] considerable
[307.32] modifications. Seas have vanished and
[310.28] returned. Wide areas of land have
[312.8] appeared and
[314.28] disappeared. Broad and deep valleys have
[317.68] been hollowed out of solid rocks by
[320.72] running water.
[322.8] It is from a knowledge of these and
[324.8] similar facts that geologists arrive at
[328.56] their estimate of the antiquity of man.
[331.84] The study of these deposits has unfolded
[334.56] a deeply interesting and almost romantic
[338.52] history. We are introduced to scenes
[341.44] that are in the strangest contrast to
[345.199] what now meets the eye in these
[347.52] latitudes.
[349.12] changes of the most stupendous character
[352.56] pass before us."
[356.039] unquote. Going on to describe some of
[359.12] these changes of stupendous character,
[362.72] Giki declares, quote, "We see our
[366.639] islands and northern Europe at one time
[369.6] enveloped in snow and ice, while from
[372.96] the Alps and other mountain areas,
[375.44] enormous glaciers descend to the low
[378.6] grounds. At another time, the British
[381.039] islands are united to the continent and
[383.199] the land is occupied by savage men and
[386.759] animals, many of which have long since
[389.68] vanished from the European fauna. In a
[393.52] word, epochs of Arctic severity are
[397.44] beheld alternating with epochs of genial
[401.52] climate conditions, each accompanied by
[404.639] less or greater geographical changes
[408.08] throughout a protracted cycle of time.
[411.44] Gley writes rightly points out that
[415.36] those who hear of this history for the
[417.44] first time may well be excused if they
[420.56] listen with some
[422.52] incredul. It seems difficult to
[424.8] understand how the records of such
[426.639] extraordinary events could be preserved
[429.84] or how having been preserved geologists
[433.12] are able to interpret them.
[435.68] My aim in short will be to discover if
[439.319] possible at what stage during those
[442.24] great climatic and geographical
[445.08] revolutions which shall have previously
[447.84] engaged our attention man certainly
[451.24] occupied Western
[454.199] Europe. The relationship of early man to
[457.599] the prehistoric world of Europe and
[459.44] Britain, its climate and its flora and
[462.0] fauna was the focus of Giki's work.
[465.039] In the course of this investigation, he
[467.199] came upon some extraordinary
[469.319] circumstances within great deposits of
[472.16] river gravel and in the accumulations of
[475.84] clave cave
[478.12] deposits. This was the preserved
[480.96] remnants of the now extinct prehistoric
[483.919] animals and their association with the
[487.039] artifacts of man. But there was a
[489.919] circumstance that seemed impossible of
[492.479] explanation.
[494.24] I'll let Giki explain in his own words.
[497.479] Quote, "Reference has been made to the
[500.8] fact that both in cave deposits and
[504.24] river gravels, human implements are
[507.199] found associated with numerous mamalian
[510.44] remains belonging to species, many uh of
[514.959] which are either now locally or wholly
[517.68] extinct.
[519.36] The appearance of these remains suggests
[522.08] many interesting inquiries. But at
[524.959] present, I shall confine attention to
[527.76] one question, namely, what were the
[530.44] climatal conditions under which these
[533.76] animals occupied our country? The
[537.32] species naturally arranged themselves in
[540.399] three groups. The first embracing
[543.92] embracing those animals which are either
[547.04] at present living in warm climates or
[550.399] which have uh in southern regions their
[554.08] nearest
[555.56] representatives. The second comprising
[558.64] animals of Arctic and northern habitats
[562.32] and the third containing such species as
[565.48] inhabit temperate latitudes.
[570.56] Now keep in mind that the varied species
[573.12] which are found which had been found uh
[577.04] by GI co-mingled in these deposits are
[581.279] from widely varying climatic
[584.0] environments ranging from warm southern
[587.12] through mid latitude tempered climates
[589.44] and even up to arctic climates. Yet the
[593.279] remains are found in association with
[595.68] each other in the same
[598.68] deposits. One theory that had been
[601.279] proposed to explain this peculiarity was
[604.08] that these varied groups of animals
[606.16] originating in such widely varying
[608.48] climatic
[609.64] regimes all migrated to the location
[612.64] where the remains were found. In his
[615.839] book, Giki examines this in great detail
[619.2] and decides that there are many uh many
[622.72] objections to this idea of this uh
[625.68] unified migration of all these different
[627.92] animals to the region uh of of Great
[631.839] Britain where they're found.
[634.88] So without ever really coming to any
[637.279] accepted resolution to this conundrum,
[640.16] GI does understand the perspective
[643.12] implications when he states this.
[646.24] The theory of annual migrations being as
[649.12] I have tried to show
[651.079] untenable, we can now only explain this
[655.2] remarkable co-mingling of the northern,
[658.16] southern and tempered groups in our
[660.88] superficial deposits by assuming that
[664.64] certain great oscillations of climate
[668.24] characterize the accumulation of our
[671.2] cave earths and river
[674.6] gravels. Was Giki wrong about his
[677.6] assumption of great climatic
[679.44] oscillations playing a role in this
[682.44] puzzle? How exactly these deposits came
[685.2] to be is still an open question, but the
[688.0] confirmation of his beliefs of great
[690.24] oscillations of climate has long been in
[693.6] hand at this point. Much work ensued
[697.04] over the next century that verified
[698.88] Giki's insight regarding these certain
[702.24] great
[703.64] oscillations. By the 1960s, with the
[707.279] advent of climatology as a profession
[710.48] and an academic discipline, workers in
[713.44] the field began to realize that some
[715.839] changes in climate were indeed
[719.32] catastrophic despite the prevailing view
[722.64] of constancy and stability.
[727.92] Let's bring this conversation then a
[730.32] little closer to the present and going
[732.72] back to this period from the 1960s
[735.04] roughly a century after uh Giki was
[738.32] doing his
[741.0] work. I will mention that I have studied
[744.16] and frequently discussed the work of
[746.56] Hubert Lamb, the English climatologist
[749.839] and
[750.92] meteorologist who founded the climate
[753.519] research unit at the University of East
[756.36] Anglia and is considered one of the
[758.88] original and eminent lights in the field
[761.279] of climatology.
[763.6] I will mention that the uh climate
[765.76] research unit at uh East Anglia was the
[769.44] one involved in the in the controversy
[773.44] about the uh the uh released emails
[778.32] showing that there was collaboration to
[780.76] suppress certain evidence that
[783.12] contradicted the carbon dioxide driven
[786.8] climate change narrative. I'll have more
[788.56] to talk about that uh in another
[790.92] episode. But for now uh getting back to
[794.24] Hubert Lamb, he was born in 1913 and he
[797.36] died in
[798.68] 1997 after a long and celebrated career.
[802.399] I'm going to quote extensively from two
[804.56] of his papers in which can be found his
[808.519] documentation of abrupt natural climate
[811.92] change. First, however, I want to quote
[814.72] from Wikipedia biography where they of
[818.24] lamb where they acknowledged that quote
[821.36] lamb was one of the first to propose
[824.56] that climate could change within human
[827.8] experience going against the orthodox
[830.8] view of the time that climate could be
[832.72] treated as constant for practical
[835.36] purposes."
[837.72] unquote. Lamb was one of the first
[840.88] scientists to call attention to the
[843.279] evidence for a medieval warm period and
[846.8] a little ice
[848.44] age. So I'm going to quote now from his
[851.12] paper that was published in
[853.399] 1966 entitled on the nature of certain
[857.44] climatic epochs which differed from the
[861.32] modern from the modern
[863.88] normal. Uh this was published uh in the
[867.36] symposium changes of climate uh the
[870.72] proceedings of the Rome Symposium uh
[873.6] hosted by
[875.079] UNESCO uh and I'm going to be quoting
[877.6] from pages 125 through 150 of those
[881.6] proceedings.
[883.839] So I quote, "Climatic changes," and this
[887.36] is Lamb. Now, climatic changes during
[890.56] the last 5 or 6,000 years appear at some
[894.519] times to have allowed sufficient
[897.56] vegetation for primitive men and animals
[900.48] to travel across what are now deserts in
[904.48] North Africa, Central Asia, and northern
[908.519] Mexico, southwestern United States of
[911.8] America, and at other times to have cut
[914.639] off these routes of trade and migration.
[918.88] Within the last thousand years, various
[921.199] categories of evidence suggest that
[923.199] there was at first rather little
[926.32] permanent ice on the Arctic seas. I'll
[929.04] read that again. various lines of
[931.519] evidence that suggest that there was
[934.72] rather little permanent ice on the
[937.44] Arctic seas and later such a great
[941.199] extension of this ice that grain growing
[944.24] was for centuries impossible in Iceland
[947.6] and the total evacuation of that country
[950.72] was considered.
[953.04] At the same time, the cod fishery almost
[956.92] disappeared even from the Pharaoh
[959.8] Islands. In the worst decades, Scotland,
[963.44] as well as parts of Scandinavia and
[965.959] Iceland, experienced famine. Upland
[969.759] farms and villages in England and
[971.839] Germany may have been abandoned partly
[973.839] for this
[974.839] reason. With respect to the period
[977.68] immediately following the great
[979.92] deglacial phase, now usually referred to
[983.519] as the climatic optimum, Lamb had this
[987.199] to say. The extent of ice on land
[991.04] decreasing throughout the warm epoch may
[994.24] have reached its minimum around 2,00
[998.12] to,500 years
[1000.68] BC. That is after the main part of the
[1004.72] warm epoch was over. By soon after 4,000
[1010.92] BC, the world sea level had risen to
[1013.92] about its present level or possibly even
[1016.88] a few meters above because of rather
[1020.0] higher ocean temperatures than now. and
[1022.959] he estimates that they were at least one
[1024.799] degree centigrade higher in the tropical
[1027.72] Atlantic and probably several degrees
[1030.88] warmer in the
[1032.76] Arctic. So what I'm presenting to you
[1035.839] here is evidence that the uh the status
[1040.24] of ice in the Arctic Ocean presently in
[1044.319] terms of the of the mass and volume of
[1046.48] the ice is not unprecedented. There's
[1049.919] clearly evidence that exists that shows
[1052.16] that the volume and amount of ice in the
[1055.76] Arctic Ocean has waxed and waned along
[1058.48] with the oscillating climate. We're
[1061.28] taking a little bit of a detour here to
[1063.52] uh tell a story that I think is going to
[1066.16] be valuable uh concerning something that
[1069.44] uh recently happened to me. Oh, and I
[1071.36] see I'm being joined by my friend and
[1073.2] colleague Mike Robertson. Hello,
[1074.96] Randall. How are you? I'm doing very
[1077.36] well, thank you.
[1078.96] Well, regarding this little story we're
[1080.799] going to tell, we won't take too long.
[1082.32] We'll get back to the episode shortly,
[1083.919] but I understand you were in a
[1086.4] conference recently in Florida, was it?
[1089.6] Correct. Yes, in Florida in a beautiful
[1092.0] hotel, the Fiana Hotel, I believe it
[1094.96] was. Excellent. And what uh something
[1097.44] happened there? Uh first of all, how was
[1099.679] the conference? But then I conference
[1102.4] was great. The hotel was awesome. But um
[1106.16] yeah, everything was good except I was
[1108.0] coming down the stairs and I think
[1110.0] somebody just ahead of me had spilled a
[1112.08] little bit of something was, you know,
[1115.36] crowds moving up and down and I think
[1117.52] somebody spilled a little something on
[1119.2] one of the treads in front of me and my
[1120.88] foot hit it and uh slid out from under
[1124.559] me and I tumbled down three or four
[1127.28] stairs to the bottom. Whoa. Uh I
[1130.16] survived as you can see. Look, I'm still
[1132.48] here and I'm intact. I didn't break any
[1134.559] bones. No, no breaking bones. But I sure
[1136.96] banged up my left knee. That was the
[1139.52] first thing that hit. My left knee hit
[1141.48] that tile floor and uh it it was
[1146.64] painful, but uh I had to go I was
[1149.919] actually on my way to do a presentation,
[1151.76] so I had to tough it out and go do a
[1154.16] presentation with my uh throbbing left
[1157.679] knee. So anyways, got done with that.
[1160.799] And then as the day progressed, it got
[1162.96] my knee began to swell up and it got
[1165.2] quite painful. And uh I was very
[1169.24] relieved to remember that I had brought
[1172.0] I happened to pack my CBD from the god
[1175.88] sav. And I was really grateful that I
[1179.76] had remembered to do that. So I that
[1183.36] night I put some of the sav on, went to
[1186.08] bed. I regularly applied it uh before I
[1189.36] got dressed and then I put some more on
[1191.28] at night before I went to bed. And I
[1193.12] must say though, I've I've, you know,
[1195.28] being in the construction and building
[1197.039] industry, I've had many falls and in uh
[1199.52] injuries and stuff. And I figured I'm
[1202.16] going to be laid up with this for a
[1203.96] month. We drove home. I think it was
[1206.32] three to four days later. I continued
[1208.559] applying to SAV, and I would say within
[1210.559] a week, I was getting around pretty
[1212.72] good. Uh Wow. Yeah. It it
[1216.72] It definitely helped it. It most
[1220.679] defining ingredients in that sav that
[1224.08] can actually penetrate in to a to uh to
[1228.96] to really alleviate the
[1231.159] inflammation that's in inside during an
[1234.48] injury like that. Yeah. Yeah. I don't
[1236.88] have all of the specifications for as a
[1239.44] matter of fact we might actually in
[1241.28] later segments we might actually
[1242.96] interview some of the people from the
[1244.88] company who make the product and they
[1246.96] can tell some of the details of u you
[1250.72] know of the ingredients and what they do
[1253.2] and how they because my understanding is
[1255.679] more than just a pain relief. it.
[1257.6] There's actually healing
[1260.48] compounds and other ingredients in there
[1262.799] that literally heal as well as pain,
[1266.64] relieve pain. And that is one of the
[1269.039] reasons it works so fast. One of them I
[1271.36] know is comfrey.
[1273.2] And that's a big one. I know that for a
[1275.039] fact because anybody can look it up, but
[1277.28] you know, comry is an ancient name for
[1280.64] um for comry is called the bone healer.
[1284.159] Uhhuh. Yeah. And it gets that name for a
[1287.12] reason. But um did you you said now I
[1291.2] know you take um the Apollo oil as well
[1295.12] like when you road trip when I travel
[1298.799] when I travel especially I I always
[1301.84] bring the oil because it helps relax me
[1304.0] and I get a it helps me to sleep and I
[1306.799] have a tough time sleeping sometimes
[1308.32] when I'm on the road and traveling. Uh
[1310.64] so it every little uh advantage I can
[1314.0] take that's going to help me get that
[1316.159] rest and get a good night's sleep
[1318.08] because particularly like if I'm leading
[1320.24] a tour I got to be on all day and for me
[1323.679] to do that effectively I have to have a
[1325.6] good night's sleep. Uh so I bring I
[1329.36] always bring the oil uh when I travel
[1331.679] and I I'm now after this episode I'm
[1334.64] like okay I'm always going to have the
[1336.0] sav with me too. So Lamb goes on to say,
[1338.64] "The Arctic Ocean with much open water
[1342.48] was probably ice free, get that, was
[1346.48] probably ice free, at least in summer,
[1349.679] though not the channels of the Canadian
[1353.159] archipilago." End of quote. Lamb
[1356.24] suggests that there would be value in
[1358.72] the study of climate since the end of
[1361.28] the last ice age. A time during which
[1364.159] the established view was that climate
[1366.24] change during the period we call the
[1368.4] holene was negligible to the point that
[1371.84] it could essentially be ignored when
[1374.72] developing models of history. But as
[1377.76] Lamb was willing to acknowledge by the
[1380.159] early 1960s, the accumulating evidence
[1383.679] was not consistent with this steadystate
[1386.6] model. He goes on to lay out the broad
[1389.679] parameters of the change over the course
[1392.4] of the past roughly 10,000 years.
[1396.2] quote, "At least four climatic epochs
[1401.44] since the ice age seem likely to repay
[1405.12] more study by meteorologists than they
[1407.919] have so far received.
[1410.159] One, the postglacial climatic optimum, a
[1414.64] warm period culminating between about
[1417.44] 5,000 and 30,000 BC, that is between
[1421.039] about 8,000 and 5,000 years ago, to the
[1425.6] colder climatic epoch of the early Iron
[1428.559] Age, which culminated between about 900
[1432.24] and 450 BC.
[1435.44] Three, the secondary climatic optimum in
[1439.12] the early middle ages broadly around AD
[1443.6] 1,000 to,200 or rather
[1447.4] longer. And finally, D or four, the
[1451.12] little ice age, which was a very a
[1454.32] period of very cold climate market uh
[1457.919] marked between about
[1460.36] AD430 and
[1462.6] 1850. Now as we go and talking more
[1465.679] about uh these changes in climate, the
[1468.32] medieval warm period, the little ice age
[1470.08] and so forth, you will hear that there
[1471.84] are uh vary varying estimates as to
[1475.36] exactly when they started and when they
[1477.559] stopped. Some of that is going to be
[1479.84] subjective to the area uh because some
[1483.6] places felt the shift in climate effects
[1487.039] earlier than others. So it depends on
[1489.2] where the study was. Generally, most of
[1492.159] the information now suggests that the
[1494.96] climate begin
[1496.2] deteriorate from the medieval warm
[1498.32] period uh in the late 1200s and early
[1502.919] 1300s. So, Lamb goes on to describe the
[1505.76] conditions during the period of the
[1508.0] climatic
[1509.559] optimum. Notice now it's now called the
[1512.2] hipsothermal. And I wonder how much that
[1514.559] change in nomenclature had to do with
[1516.48] the fact that by calling it the climatic
[1519.279] optimum, we know what optimum means. And
[1522.72] that would seem to imply that a climate
[1525.76] somewhat warmer than now is actually the
[1528.24] optimum climate for at least for human
[1531.039] well-being.
[1533.039] Anyways, Lamb goes on to say this, and I
[1536.32] quote, "The extent of ice on land
[1539.76] decreasing throughout the warm epoch may
[1542.96] have reached its minimum around 2,000
[1546.36] to,500 BC. That is after the main part
[1550.799] of the warm epoch was
[1553.08] over. By soon after 4,000 BC, the world
[1557.52] sea level had risen to about its present
[1560.12] level or possibly a few meters
[1563.88] above. And in upcoming episodes, we will
[1566.64] be looking at some of that uh some of
[1568.559] the evidence that suggests that yes, sea
[1570.559] level in recent times has actually been
[1572.96] higher than now.
[1575.36] uh and this uh possibly a few meters
[1578.48] above the present because of rather
[1580.72] higher ocean temperatures than now. At
[1584.0] least one degree centigrade in the trop
[1586.64] tropical Atlantic and probably several
[1589.6] degrees warmer in the Arctic. The Arctic
[1592.48] Ocean with much open water was probably
[1596.48] ice free at least in summer though not
[1600.08] the channels of the Canadian
[1601.72] archipelago. Then there is the matter of
[1603.919] fossilized marine fauna of holysine age
[1606.96] found above the modern sea level.
[1610.24] Complementing that evidence is the
[1612.24] presence of bogs and vegetation that
[1614.799] resulted from submergence beneath
[1618.919] seawater. So lamb elaborates on this
[1621.919] evidence. Fossil marine fauna such as
[1625.76] mollisks and edible muscles and evidence
[1629.12] of past vegetation and bog growth
[1632.039] indicate much higher sea and air
[1635.44] temperatures than now quite generally in
[1638.559] high latitudes north and south. In the
[1642.4] present temperate zone of the northern
[1644.84] hemisphere, temperatures were higher
[1647.36] than now. And there is evidence of
[1650.08] northward anomaly of an northward
[1653.24] anomaly, especially before 5,000 to
[1656.96] 4,000 BC or 7,000 to 6,000 years ago.
[1663.36] Um, the vegetation belts were displaced
[1667.159] poleward towards the poles and to
[1670.159] greater heights above sea level than
[1672.36] now. In Europe, the summer temperatures
[1675.679] can be estimated as
[1678.44] prevailingly 2 to 3° centigrade higher
[1682.88] than now. In North America, rather less
[1687.36] above present levels. The snow line was
[1691.12] 300 m or about 985 ft above the present
[1696.72] level in central
[1698.52] Europe. Obviously, if the snow line goes
[1701.2] up nearly 1,000 ft, that means that the
[1704.559] climate is warmer than it is now. When
[1707.6] it gets cold, the snow line comes down.
[1710.48] When it gets warmed, the snow line goes
[1712.48] up in elevation.
[1715.44] He goes on to say, uh, annual mean
[1718.64] temperatures in Europe were about 2°
[1721.96] centigrade higher higher than now. The
[1726.48] subpolar depressions in the axis of the
[1728.88] main anti-cyclone belt were generally
[1732.159] displaced north at that time in the
[1734.64] European sector, perhaps by as much as
[1738.24] 10° latitude.
[1741.12] So that's something along the lines of
[1743.12] 700
[1744.36] miles. In the Sahara and the deserts of
[1747.36] the Near East from about 5,000 to 2400
[1752.84] BC, there was an appreciably moistister
[1756.159] climate than now. The evidence,
[1759.36] archaeological and zoological, is
[1761.919] especially convincing as regards the
[1763.919] early part of this period.
[1766.52] Antarctica also experienced a warm
[1769.44] period after the main ice age when the
[1773.2] Antarctic ice sheet had been several
[1775.52] hundreds of meters thicker than
[1778.36] now. In the Walat mountains near 72°
[1782.96] south, 10°
[1785.399] east, temperatures were so many degrees
[1788.64] higher than now that there were
[1790.88] considerable streams of running water
[1793.2] and fluial erosion of the landscape.
[1796.32] Between 600 and
[1799.08] 1,890 m above sea level, lakes were
[1803.279] formed which have subsequently frozen
[1806.08] solid and remain as
[1809.399] fossils. In a 1981 report updated, Lamb
[1814.64] reiterates his observations and
[1817.08] conclusions from the earlier 1966 paper
[1821.52] wherein he focused on the effects of
[1823.44] climate change primarily in in Britain
[1825.84] and then uh northwestern Europe. The
[1829.12] title of the new paper is an approach to
[1832.399] the study of de the development of
[1834.88] climate and its impact in human affairs.
[1839.44] It appeared as a contribution to the
[1841.44] book climate and history published by
[1844.64] the Cambridge University
[1847.88] Press. So let's recall from the 1960s
[1851.2] Lamb was considered a maverick in that
[1853.44] as
[1854.279] explained historians of the time gave
[1856.72] little credence to the role of climate
[1858.96] change in human affairs being generally
[1862.24] dismissive of the idea of climate
[1865.36] determinism.
[1867.279] To reiterate an important point, this
[1870.96] attitude was largely the result of the
[1873.36] assumption that climate was, although
[1876.159] with some local and regional exceptions,
[1879.2] essentially a stable steadystate
[1882.6] phenomena. By de by contrast, after
[1885.76] decades of study, Lamb concluded that
[1889.12] climate change was indeed a matter of
[1891.52] concern to the stability of society,
[1894.08] commenting that, quote, Britain's
[1896.559] climate does have a history and that
[1899.76] this is something which must concern
[1903.039] us."
[1904.919] unquote. Ironically, in the context of
[1908.0] the modern fears regarding global
[1910.6] warming, Lamb's apprehension was
[1913.6] centered around the matter of global
[1916.24] cooling. He had by then come to
[1918.919] understand that there had been a major
[1921.44] climatic shift between the Middle Ages
[1923.919] and the present and that the intervening
[1926.96] centuries involved a change from a
[1929.2] warmer than now to cooler than now
[1932.399] climatic
[1933.72] conditions. His report elaborates upon
[1937.039] the specific consequences of this
[1940.159] climate shift.
[1942.399] I quote, "Some parts of the tale are
[1945.76] very clear and fairly
[1947.96] wellnown. There is no reasonable doubt
[1950.799] that the Arctic was warmer and that
[1953.519] there was less ice on the northern seas
[1956.96] when the old Norse voyages to Iceland
[1959.76] and Greenland were made, especially
[1962.48] between AD 1 and
[1964.919] 1200. Then has been the case since.
[1968.96] Ice was increasingly encountered on the
[1971.36] old sailing route which crossed to east
[1974.559] Greenland near the Arctic Circle from
[1978.2] 1203 onwards and by 1350 to400 this
[1983.039] route had to be abandoned for one
[1985.279] further south rounding cape
[1988.6] farewell. After 1410 there was no
[1991.84] regular communication anymore between
[1994.08] Europe and any part of Greenland. The
[1996.88] old Norse colony died out and no
[2000.48] European ship ever got in through the
[2002.919] ice, even on the southwest coast
[2006.24] after605."
[2010.2] unquote. Lamb explains what was even
[2013.679] then becoming well known that during the
[2016.48] Middle Ages the Arctic was warmer than
[2018.799] during the following centuries at the
[2021.519] same time during which a viable farming
[2023.76] community evolved in Greenland and sea
[2026.559] lanes between Greenland and Europe were
[2028.72] open due to a major retreat of sea ice
[2033.12] northward.
[2034.799] But the following centuries saw the
[2037.159] expansion of sea ice southward and total
[2041.12] isolation of Greenland from the European
[2044.12] mainland. And this, as I said, led to
[2047.919] the complete extinction of the Norse
[2050.0] community on Greenland after some 400
[2053.44] years of occupation.
[2056.159] Lamb goes on to describe the abysmal
[2059.0] consequences of this global cooling now
[2061.919] referred to as the little ice age upon
[2066.0] human
[2067.079] civilization. and I quote lamb once
[2069.72] again the tale of climatic
[2073.079] deterioration that is to say cooling
[2076.72] from the early mid middle ages to
[2079.119] sometime about 1700 is equally clear
[2083.119] from Iceland where grain cultivation had
[2086.48] to be given up from Norway where farms
[2089.52] in many upland districts stood empty for
[2093.28] hundreds of years to some extent from
[2096.399] Denmark where English vis Visitors to a
[2098.72] royal wedding in
[2100.28] 1406 reported much
[2103.32] uncultivated Soden land and that wheat
[2106.88] was grown nowhere, although it had been
[2109.92] grown as far north as central Norway
[2112.96] around 1280.
[2115.76] and from the plains of Eastern Europe
[2118.16] where increasing frequency of floods and
[2120.96] famines and harshness of the winters led
[2123.76] to many more deaths and even incidents
[2127.04] of
[2128.44] cannibalism. Reportedly, advances of the
[2131.119] glaciers in the Alps, Norway, and
[2133.96] Iceland convey a broadly parallel record
[2137.839] and all the evidence points to a
[2140.079] considerable recovery of the climate
[2142.64] i.e. net warming between 1700 and about
[2147.32] 1950. It is important to note that Lamb
[2150.24] interprets the return of warmth as a
[2154.04] recovery from the dismal and
[2156.4] deteriorating conditions of the little
[2158.48] ice age with its increasing frequency of
[2161.599] floods, famines, harsh winters, deaths
[2164.72] by starvation, and even cannibalism.
[2169.119] There was however, as Lamb points out, a
[2172.079] short-lived amelioration of the severe
[2175.119] little ice age conditions during the
[2178.48] 1730s.
[2180.16] This temporary recovery, in Lamb's
[2182.96] words, quote, so far affected the health
[2186.32] of people in northern lands as to be
[2189.2] accompanied by a remarkable up upward
[2192.599] turn of the population figures in
[2195.88] Iceland, Sweden, and Finland. A trend
[2199.44] that was checked when the climate
[2201.44] recovery faltered."
[2205.56] unquote. Lamb points out that near the
[2208.24] end of the warm middle ages in the late
[2210.24] 13th century, the tale of North Sea
[2213.52] floods of the eastern coasts of England
[2216.56] and of the Flemish, Dutch, and German
[2219.079] coastlands down the centuries appears
[2221.92] nevertheless to support and verify the
[2224.32] various indications that there was a
[2227.359] great and possibly increasing storminess
[2230.64] in these
[2231.72] latitudes between then and about 1700.
[2236.24] Most attention should be paid to the
[2238.24] numbers of severe floods which altered
[2240.88] the coast and caused great damage and
[2243.76] loss of
[2245.88] life. Here Lamb is describing the
[2249.04] consequences of a cooling climate as
[2251.76] opposed to a warming climate. It's
[2254.96] important to note that the empirical
[2256.64] evidence of the little ice age and the
[2258.4] effects of global cooling are
[2260.599] inconsistent with the computerived
[2263.04] narrative which claims amplified warming
[2265.92] is going to cause increased storminess.
[2268.72] It should be recalled that as the
[2270.88] climate warmed during the decade of the
[2274.599] 1730s the health of the nor northern
[2277.28] Europeans improved and hence the
[2279.68] population numbers took an upturn.
[2283.359] Lamb elaborates upon the assumptions
[2285.92] upon which the concept of a steadystate
[2288.96] climate were
[2290.44] based. Quote, around 1880 to
[2294.839] 1900, it was apparent from the first
[2297.76] 100-year series of weather observations
[2301.28] that the climatic averages of that time
[2304.64] were very similar to those of a century
[2306.92] earlier. And it became conventional to
[2309.44] treat climate as essentially
[2312.44] constant. Accordingly, study of the
[2315.119] development and possible changes of
[2317.44] climate was given a very low priority or
[2320.48] more generally neglected altogether.
[2324.56] Given these circumstances, it was
[2326.4] natural that the general public and
[2328.96] workers in the other disciplines also
[2332.119] ignored the possibility that climate
[2334.96] might not always be so stable and
[2337.839] climatic change might affect their
[2340.599] lives. Of course, this did not apply to
[2343.839] the occasional extreme events, but the
[2346.48] incident in incidents of these, it was
[2348.56] generally
[2352.839] supposed. Lamb cites the fact that by
[2355.44] mid 20th century, there was enough
[2357.52] evidence to contradict this sedate model
[2361.28] of climate
[2364.2] change. and I quote
[2366.44] again, "By 1950, however, it was obvious
[2371.359] that the climate had been changing
[2374.359] significantly during the 20th century,
[2377.2] though in ways which made things easier
[2381.119] for most human activities in most parts
[2385.119] of the world."
[2387.28] Bear in mind what made conditions easier
[2391.119] for humans,
[2392.52] activities easier was warming, not
[2396.96] cooling.
[2398.839] Okay, continuing with Lamb Lamb's quote.
[2403.839] There had been a general rise of
[2405.92] prevailing temperatures with recession
[2408.72] of the ice on the Arctic seas and
[2412.119] increasingly rapid recession of the
[2414.8] glaciers almost
[2416.599] everywhere. There were fewer failures of
[2419.2] the monsoon in India and West Africa and
[2423.44] rainfall had increased in continental
[2426.079] interiors.
[2427.599] A scientific explanation of global
[2429.839] warming in terms of the effects on the
[2432.56] radiation balance by carbon dioxide
[2435.839] which man was added to the
[2438.359] atmosphere an end product of all the
[2440.72] fossil fuels burnt one wide
[2444.92] acceptance. This left it possible to
[2447.839] believe the climate had been essentially
[2450.28] constant until the industrial
[2453.32] revolution. Right? So there was
[2455.44] assumptions built upon assumptions and
[2458.079] one of the assumptions was that the 10
[2460.96] 11,000 years of the holysine had
[2463.76] essentially the climate had been steady
[2466.04] state and uh and didn't really change
[2469.28] significantly until the industrial
[2472.48] revolution.
[2475.68] proposing that only by looking at and
[2478.48] understanding extreme examples of
[2480.8] climate change will historians be in a
[2482.88] position to have a realistic
[2485.04] understanding of the past. Lamb again
[2488.0] points out that the cooling climate
[2490.359] provoked increased storminess.
[2493.839] Quoting again, if we will demonstrate
[2496.88] the influence of the climatic
[2499.16] development and shocks produced in the
[2502.24] course of this on human history, we must
[2506.16] look first at extreme cases. For this
[2509.839] purpose, the record of the last thousand
[2512.079] years is well suited because it seems to
[2514.4] have included a notably wide range of
[2517.599] climatic regimes. The high middle ages
[2521.04] evidently saw a persistently warm
[2523.44] climate epoch which lasted until about
[2527.319] 1300 to 1310 in Europe and affected
[2531.76] about 2/3 of the northern hemisphere in
[2534.319] the previous 1 to200 years. A peak of
[2538.079] warmth seems to have been attained a few
[2540.88] centuries earlier in Greenland and much
[2543.76] more of the Arctic and cooling in those
[2546.64] regions may have been responsible for an
[2549.359] increase of storminess affecting the
[2552.16] North Sea and perhaps much of the
[2554.64] Atlantic and Europe after AD1200.
[2561.52] So after AD 1200, what Lamb is
[2564.24] documenting and commenting on here is
[2566.8] that with the shift away from the
[2569.56] medieval warm period into the little ice
[2572.64] age, there was an increase in uh
[2576.52] storminess and inclement
[2579.079] weather. He goes on to describe the
[2581.44] onset of the little ice age after a
[2584.24] series of abrupt changes. Quote, "The
[2587.92] following centuries brought a series of
[2590.599] changes, some of them abrupt, leading to
[2594.4] the so-called little ice age between
[2597.839] about 1550 and 1700 or later, when the
[2602.72] extent of ice on the Arctic seas and of
[2605.52] ice and snow on land seems to have been
[2609.04] greater, get this, than at any time
[2612.319] since the last major glaciation.
[2616.8] The changes of winter temperature
[2618.64] amounting to a fall of the 50-year means
[2622.56] of 1 to 1.5° centigrade between the 13th
[2626.319] and 17th centuries appear to have been
[2629.52] accompanied by similar changes in other
[2632.16] seasons.
[2633.76] These changes imply a shortening of the
[2637.119] average growing season by about a month
[2640.24] and a decline of almost 200 m in the
[2644.319] upper limit of productive cultivation of
[2647.359] crops in England and presumably in other
[2651.119] places at about the same latitude in
[2654.24] Europe.
[2657.44] An important point that needs to be kept
[2659.52] in mind is that the swollen little ice
[2662.8] age glaciers had grown to their greatest
[2665.28] extent since the end of the great ice
[2667.64] age. This is important because the
[2670.8] baseline by which we measure glacier
[2673.28] recession currently as a proxy of
[2676.72] climate change marks the greatest extent
[2679.52] of glacier mass and volume in over
[2682.16] 10,000 years. Any scaling back in mass
[2686.48] from this holosene glacial maximum will
[2689.599] of course then appear
[2691.8] unprecedented. But in reality it is if
[2694.56] one limits one's framework to 10,000
[2697.92] years or
[2699.48] less. Lamb continues to explain the the
[2703.44] dramatic effects of little ice age
[2706.4] global cooling.
[2708.48] quote, "The fossil evidence and many
[2711.76] actual reports of advancing glaciers in
[2715.28] most parts of the world and in the
[2718.24] little ice age period have been
[2720.56] cataloged by many authors. For example,
[2723.839] in Iceland, Norway, and the Alps, the
[2726.96] records include the overrunning of farms
[2729.52] and farmland by the glaciers, as well as
[2733.52] disasters from avalanches, landslides,
[2737.44] and the bursting of glacial damned
[2741.0] lakes. Even in Ethiopia, there's
[2744.079] evidence from Portuguese travelers that
[2746.24] the snow line came down on the highest
[2749.24] mountains. And in eastern equatorial
[2751.92] Africa, the glaciers on Mount Kenya and
[2755.4] Kilimanjaro were in more advanced
[2758.44] positions than their present
[2761.4] limits. Lamb was unquote. Lamb was not
[2765.52] the first to call attention to the
[2767.8] deteriorating conditions imposed upon
[2770.96] the European population by a cooling
[2773.599] climate. As early as 1951, Danish
[2777.079] archaeologist and Axel Steberg writing
[2780.8] in the journal Nature observed that, and
[2783.92] I quote, "It is a general feature of the
[2786.96] agrarian history of Northern Europe
[2790.0] during the Middle Ages that largecale
[2793.44] colonization of the land came to an end
[2797.44] in the 13th century and that in the next
[2800.64] two centuries it was followed by the
[2802.76] abandonment of hundreds of villages in
[2806.319] nearly all parts of North European
[2809.56] countries. This phenomena seems to be
[2812.68] connected with climate
[2816.359] change. The abandonment of farms to
[2819.28] which Ste refers was the result of two
[2822.96] factors. One being the overrunning of
[2826.4] farms by massively expanding little ice
[2829.68] age glaciers and the second an overall
[2832.88] decline in population due to famine,
[2835.28] deteriorating health of the population
[2838.079] and increasing mortality. All which were
[2841.44] consequences of the return of the cold
[2844.839] weather. Again, the climate change was
[2848.4] responsible
[2850.48] uh was cooling and not warming. Those
[2853.839] who have attempted to dismiss the
[2855.359] significance of the climatic excursions
[2857.52] just described by one of the founding
[2860.48] fathers of
[2862.119] climatology for Europe have generally
[2865.04] used the argument that they only
[2867.119] represented regional change and were
[2870.319] therefore not analogous to modern
[2872.64] warming which by contrast is presumed to
[2876.319] be global in extent. However, an
[2879.68] abundance of climate change research
[2882.76] demonstrates unequivocally that the
[2885.52] medieval warm period and the little ice
[2887.52] age were global in extent. The onset of
[2892.16] the little ice age presided over the
[2894.96] demise of the medieval world. Its
[2898.44] termination half a millennia later that
[2901.599] is the uh little ice age saw the birth
[2905.359] of the modern world. And it is only now
[2908.48] that the scientific community is coming
[2910.64] to terms with the reality of natural
[2914.079] convulsive and abrupt climate changes
[2917.44] and the profound role such events have
[2919.839] played in the evolving pageant of human
[2923.359] history. However, as it stands now, no
[2927.599] society on earth is prepared for the
[2930.4] kind of extreme shifts in climate that
[2933.28] have been regularly occurring throughout
[2935.52] the lifespan of the human species.
[2938.72] What is demanded within the context of
[2941.28] our growing knowledge of the planetary
[2943.359] of planetary change is a major upgrade
[2946.96] in our understanding of and response to
[2951.52] the inevitable effects of
[2953.96] catastrophic natural climate and
[2956.4] environmental change and the realization
[2959.839] that to do this we must begin to think
[2961.92] and operate on a cosmic scale. In
[2965.92] upcoming Squaring the Circle and other
[2968.599] podcasts, I will be addressing the
[2970.96] critical questions and issues of our
[2973.119] time and how we as a species might
[2975.92] develop a blueprint to maximize the
[2978.72] probabilities of creating a successful
[2981.52] and enduring civilization on planet
[2984.44] Earth. So, thank you and please uh join
[2988.0] me for the next episode. I'm Randall
[2990.64] Carlson. Please like and subscribe to
[2993.52] help promote this knowledge and the

Title: Did Cosmic Dust Collapse Civilizations?
[0.16] human causes for climate change.
[2.08] Episodes of increased commentary or
[4.64] meteoric activity punctuating societal
[7.839] evolution should be looked upon as
[10.32] potential agencies determining the rise
[13.04] and fall of ancient civilizations. both
[15.599] the emergence and the collapse of human
[18.16] cultures, the pleaene holysine
[20.56] transition and the neolithic revolution
[23.68] and even the collapse of the Roman
[25.6] Empire may be associated with episodes
[28.24] of increased cosmic activity and
[30.48] multiple impacts that may well have
[32.96] included incidences of cosmic dust
[35.92] loading. Now, this is another byproduct
[38.48] of cosmic encounters, the incursion of
[41.36] dust into the global atmosphere. Now,
[43.76] what that's going to do, of course, is
[45.6] make the atmosphere more opaque. It's
[48.559] going to reflect more sunlight back into
[50.48] space and it's going to cause a general
[52.32] decline in temperatures which can have
[54.399] devastating consequences as we've seen
[57.039] during several of the episodes of
[59.199] climatic downturn that have led to
[61.44] agricultural collapses which in turn
[63.359] have led to famine and which in turn
[65.6] have led to the onset of disease
[68.0] pandemics because people when they're
[70.56] malnourished they are not getting enough
[72.96] nutrition and their immune systems get
[75.119] weak.

Title: How Climate Collapse Set the Stage for the Black Death
[0.08] There was also several years without a
[1.92] summer, near the early 1300s, when the
[4.319] climate shifted from the medieval warm
[6.24] period, which was now estimated to be at
[8.8] least 1 to 1.5, maybe 2 to 2.5° warmer
[12.719] than now. And that uh gave way to the
[15.2] first phase of the little ice age in the
[17.92] early 1300s. and you had uh about a 25
[22.88] or 30-year period of cold, damp weather
[25.92] that led to a succession of agricultural
[29.119] failures. By the time you had the 1330s,
[32.559] you had major famines in the northern
[34.559] hemisphere at least. By the time you get
[36.16] to the 1340s, people's immune systems
[38.64] had apparently weakened so much that
[40.64] they were now susceptible to
[42.28] opportunistic diseases. And we had the
[44.559] black plague which I think 1340s which
[47.44] could be considered to be a direct
[49.52] result of the malnutrition of large
[52.0] numbers of people which was a direct
[53.52] result of repeated agricultural failures
[56.48] and that was a direct result of the
[58.64] cooling climate.

Title: Why Africa Survived Earth’s Last Mass Extinction
[0.24] 95% of all species on Earth went extinct
[3.679] just like that. And they're still trying
[5.359] to figure out why. Here's the
[6.96] interesting question. We can see from
[9.599] the species loss is going to be directly
[12.16] related to habitat loss. The greater the
[14.559] loss of habitat, the greater it will
[16.72] affect species that are adapted to
[19.439] living in that habitat. You can conclude
[21.359] from that that if 3/4 of the species of
[23.68] North and South America went extinct,
[25.84] that was where the greatest habitat loss
[27.84] occurred. the the last global
[29.92] catastrophe was kind of focused on the
[32.0] western hemisphere. Eurasia was second,
[34.719] Africa was third. What that tells you is
[36.88] the safest place to have been on Earth
[38.8] during these events would have been
[40.399] Africa. You had the greatest survival of
[42.48] species.

Title: Never Let a Good Crisis Go to Waste
[0.08] he was proposing to in order to control
[2.72] carbon dioxide emissions. I looked at
[4.64] okay it's good to be able to affect and
[7.68] control carbon dioxide emissions it is
[10.16] everything we do our homes would be
[11.719] monitored our travels would be monitored
[14.559] the ways in which certain crises are
[17.119] used to extend uh surveillance
[19.84] behavioral modification programs and
[22.24] just in general systems of control. So
[25.279] uh terrorism you know beginning of this
[28.0] millennium but the way that governance
[30.32] was conducted and policing was conducted
[32.32] the degree of privacy any individual
[34.64] expected to enjoy the amount of rights
[37.36] that a person had in the face of being
[39.04] accused of a crime for instance being
[40.719] charged with a crime without being
[42.079] detained or before being detained. uh
[44.559] you saw terrorism became the central
[48.0] focus. You know, I'm of the generation
[49.68] where I remember well, you know, flying
[51.6] and you go to the airport and no
[54.48] security. You walked right up to the
[56.0] gate and we seem to have got along fine
[58.079] for decades with that. But you know, I
[60.96] mean, I think the whole point again is
[62.719] that, you know, we have to look at the
[64.72] larger framework of geopolitics and what
[67.28] happened in the early '90s with the
[69.36] collapse of the Soviet Union rather than
[72.159] NATO at that point being disbanded
[74.32] because it completely had no rationale
[76.88] to exist anymore. The game plan was
[79.36] promoted to, well, now we have no
[81.759] rivals, so we can now essentially
[84.24] dominate the global economy. Yeah. Never
[86.479] let a good crisis go to waste. Never let
[88.08] a good crisis go to waste.

Title: Ancient Floods Carved the Sinai Landscape
[0.08] We're going to look at a study now that
[2.159] was presented in the journal Global and
[4.08] Planetary Change, South Syinai, Egypt.
[7.44] This is the area in question. This is
[9.2] the Sinai Massive here. This study is
[11.92] very representative of many of these
[14.16] wadis that do not have major water flow
[17.199] in them. Now, this is the area. This is
[19.439] the watershed that feeds the Wadi that
[22.0] you see right here. So this study you're
[24.72] we're basically looking at where the the
[27.279] Wadi canyon or ravine opens out onto the
[31.439] plane here that provide testimony that
[35.04] the modern water flows are insignificant
[38.32] compared to the ancient water flows.
[40.48] That water rushing through this ravine
[43.68] opens into the valley. Boom. This is the
[46.719] kind of stuff that it's dumping down
[48.399] right

Title: Post-COVID Education: The Great Awakening
[0.0] and the men of the community in general.
[2.159] Absolutely. And so now they're taking
[4.24] that cultural imprint, they're taking
[6.48] that generational imprint, they're
[8.559] assuming the values of the community, of
[11.12] their families, etc. All of that has
[13.44] been severed and it's gotten way more
[16.08] extreme from the time like Rowan and I
[18.56] were in school. You know what what
[20.4] strikes me about that is that now so the
[23.119] pandemic represented a real line of
[25.359] demarcation uh between what you're
[28.16] talking about which is still
[29.76] persontoperson education right uh and
[32.8] that more digital form of education you
[35.76] know I remember reading about this and
[37.84] hearing about this education is set up
[39.92] basically to turn you into a good docile
[42.079] factory worker and that this whole model
[44.16] needs to be jettisoned one of the things
[46.079] one of the bright sides in my opinion
[48.559] the old co thing was that you had a few
[51.52] million at least and that could be a
[53.6] conservative number a few million
[54.96] families decide to extricate themselves
[57.84] from the industrial education system and
[60.16] their homeschooling. Homeschooling isn't
[61.92] the final answer to everything. I
[63.68] definitely got the sense that there was
[66.0] a whole different psychology amongst
[68.08] kids who had not been subjected to that
[71.52] system that the good eventually does
[73.36] win. Pas.

Title: Evidence of Megafloods Hidden in the Rocks
[0.08] In this one you see here smaller rocks.
[3.12] So this had been farther from the valley
[5.04] mouth because the larger the boulders
[7.04] the the shorter the distance that they
[8.96] were transported. So in other words as
[10.88] that water spreads out from the
[13.36] confinement of a channel then the larger
[16.8] stuff goes down first and the further
[19.359] out you get from the discharge point the
[21.52] smaller it'll get. So you see some
[23.439] intermediate size stuff but this is
[25.519] still a very impressive depositional
[28.32] feature right here. This dash line shows
[31.519] the level of the water that deposited
[34.559] these boulders here. So he's standing in
[37.04] the wadi here next to these large
[39.52] boulders, right? And in the background
[41.68] you see the walls of the wadi. There
[44.719] would be another wall. You wouldn't see
[46.879] like he this man the the gentleman here
[49.12] is facing in this channel. You see the
[51.6] row of boulders up against the base of
[53.68] the cliff. The boulders and the cliff
[56.16] are basically the function of the same
[58.32] water flow. So the water flow that
[60.48] carved the cliff quarried out all these
[62.64] boulders and dumped it. Now we can come
[64.879] completely around the other side of the
[66.56] world to the Snake River plane and we've
[69.04] got this and it's the same thing. It's
[71.119] called a because a is a
[73.76] channel. It oftenimes has big boulders
[75.76] in it and little to no or insignificant
[79.119] water flow.

Title: Is AI Progress—or Just Illusion?
[0.08] Coming back to the topic of technology,
[2.0] there's a sense that there's that this
[3.52] all represents progress, both a progress
[5.839] in in awareness of the world and
[7.279] progress in human beings able being able
[9.12] to control the world, fairness, justice,
[11.679] all of that. If there's one thing that I
[13.84] would buck up against in almost all of
[16.16] modern discourse, including the
[18.0] so-called conservative discourse, is
[19.6] that that progress should be taken for
[21.52] granted as a concept at all. That that
[24.0] we are truly progressing. I had not
[25.84] considered artificial intelligence in
[28.08] the direction of the transhumanism.
[30.64] Obviously, I was aware of it, but it
[32.719] hadn't been within my wheelhouse of and
[36.239] so I hadn't really pondered what the
[38.559] implications were as far as our own
[41.04] future, humanity on Earth. I can
[43.04] definitely even see our grandfather was
[45.12] a carpenter and he was, you know, a
[47.76] young man between, you know, World War
[49.6] I, World War II and he was a carpenter
[51.84] and he used all pretty much hand tools,
[54.48] you know, he was like, "Hey man, we can
[56.399] we don't have to do this so we got power
[58.719] saws now. So easy to overcut with a
[61.199] power saw." With a handsaw, you're right
[63.199] there. You can feel what you're doing,
[64.799] you know? So, I think that there's a
[66.0] room for both. But like our dad, every
[68.24] nail he drove was driven by hand. when
[70.64] we came along late 70s early 80s we
[73.52] started getting pneumatic nailers boom
[76.0] boom boom you know compressed air you
[77.84] know it's a mixed bag these are tools
[79.52] you can use to make yourself more
[81.28] powerful but it's very clear like in the
[83.439] case of GPT it's not making you more
[86.08] powerful it's maybe getting you to your
[88.479] goal quicker and more efficiently but
[90.4] you yourself are not becoming smarter
[92.64] because your machine did your research
[94.079] for you becoming like that barnacle on
[96.56] the ship hole and I I think that we can
[100.0] look forward to a decade plus basically
[102.32] just reckless rollouts of these sorts of
[104.64] technologies and it won't be until a
[106.72] real crisis point hits and all this this
[109.28] cosmic vision I think it really does
[111.759] mask the more mundane even if they're
[114.88] really impactful the more mundane issues
[117.28] of habitat loss species loss and
[120.719] pollution rampid pollution and also just
[123.28] the general kind of spread of human
[126.32] habitation out further than it really
[128.56] should go. In my opinion,

Title: Sea Levels Dropped 450 Feet
[0.08] The volume of ice on the earth was more
[2.159] than double what it is now. It was that
[4.319] that caused sea level to drop 400 to 450
[6.879] ft. That's a full glacial. Now, by
[9.12] definition, we're an interglacial. And
[10.96] then you've got phases in between
[12.719] glacial and interglacial. It's still
[15.04] basically a mystery. What triggers these
[18.08] transitions between a glacial and an
[20.16] interglacial age? your central argument,
[22.8] and I've I've heard you speak on this
[24.8] before, seems to be that the earth is
[27.039] undergoing these natural processes that
[29.519] are by and large unaffected by human
[32.96] activity in regard to climatic
[35.44] temperature. Whether we kind of let
[38.32] things go in a lair way, if it is more
[42.0] along the lines of what you're talking
[43.2] about, then it's basically a a very
[45.44] flimsy excuse for economic and political
[48.48] control. I'm not saying that it isn't.
[50.559] We should we shouldn't just have a
[52.0] complete free-for-all.

Title: City Kids Pay a Price Nature Never Charges
[0.08] The title of this article is scientists
[3.12] discover a major lasting benefit of
[6.08] growing up outside the city. Using data
[8.48] from
[10.04] 3,585 people collected across four
[12.88] cities, scientists from the Barcelona
[15.679] Institute for Global Health report a
[18.24] strong relationship between growing up
[20.96] away from the natural world and mental
[23.359] health in adulthood. Overall, they found
[25.6] a strong correlation between low
[28.24] exposure to nature during childhood and
[31.599] higher levels of nervousness and
[33.52] feelings of depression in adulthood. The
[36.079] relationship between nature and mental
[38.0] health remains strong even when adjusted
[40.64] for confounding factors. What we found
[43.04] is that the childhood experience of
[45.12] green space can actually predict mental
[47.52] health later in life. Wow. The people
[50.32] that reported more exposure to nature
[52.8] actually have better mental health than
[55.199] those that don't, even after we adjust
[57.92] for exposure at the time of interview
[60.32] when they are adults. Many studies have
[62.92] noted nature's ability to reduce
[66.159] rumination, a risk factor for mental
[68.88] illness. Spending time in nature
[71.36] increase self-esteem, quality of life,
[73.2] and physical activity as well as lower
[75.439] body mass index. uh in this sense nature
[78.08] itself is beneficial. These findings
[80.32] fold into the biofilia hypothesis the
[83.6] idea that humans intrinsically seek out
[86.32] connections with nature including
[88.24] exposure to green spaces. An offshoot of
[90.64] this idea is that nature promotes
[92.96] certain developmental changes in the
[95.04] brain particularly in children that may
[97.68] not happen when we are removed from it.
[100.799] The reason for it is in general our
[102.799] brains are still wired for when we were
[105.04] still living in the savas and jungles
[106.96] with a lot of nature around us. It's
[109.04] only in the last few hundred years that
[110.799] we have moved into cities. Our brains
[113.04] are not really adjusted to that. The
[115.6] second way to interpret the results is
[118.24] to consider not the benefits of nature
[120.96] exposure but the disadvantages of being
[123.36] away from it. Polluted cities in
[125.36] particular seem to extract additional
[127.28] tolls on health and may actually impact
[129.92] cognitive development in children.
[131.76] Fascinating stuff, isn't it? Isn't it
[133.52] though? Yeah.

Title: Did Ancient Cultures Master Levitation?
[0.08] I don't know too many people left that

[4.24] pyramids were built with uh by lifted
[8.12] lifted stone that are that weighed tons
[12.08] thousands and thousands of pounds with

[15.759] beginning to question and and the thing
[17.92] is is you know you could look at it as
[20.08] an anomaly and one culture at one point
[22.8] in history said hey you know what we're
[24.72] going to quarry and move 200 ton stones
[27.359] just for the heck of it. But you see the
[28.96] thing all over the world. All over the
[30.72] world they're doing these incredible
[32.559] structures with these massive stones.
[34.8] How do you think that was done? I've
[36.399] been asked that question a lot of times
[38.399] and I don't know the answer. I have a
[40.8] some ideas of which direction to go now
[43.12] that I didn't have even a year or two
[45.28] ago. However, my understanding of the
[47.76] the science of it is not to the point
[50.879] yet where I I feel like I would fall on
[53.52] my face if I attempted to explain these
[56.879] thoughts that I have had about how such
[59.6] a thing might be accomplished. I believe
[61.6] they were able to harness some type of
[63.12] energy out of the earth to move those.
[64.72] Basically, we're talking about
[65.92] levitation. I think levitation was
[68.32] probably the scientific reality to
[70.88] ancient cultures.

Title: The Sinai Desert Was Shaped by Catastrophic Floods
[0.08] The whole area of the Sinai desert south
[2.159] of Egypt. Much of the Sinai is deeply
[5.4] dissected by river valleys or wadis.
[8.96] Within the deeply insized valleys,
[12.4] mighty sediment fillings up to 50 m are
[15.92] characteristic elements of the
[18.0] landscape's morphology. Reaching the
[20.48] mountain rim from the sedimentation
[23.4] processes formed mighty and broad
[26.24] aluvial fans. This is what I was talking
[28.72] about earlier. When you have again a
[31.359] channelized flow exiting from the
[33.6] mountain front out onto a valley floor
[36.0] or an open plane or a basin, uh that's
[38.96] when you get these broad aluvial fans.
[41.76] Both large flood features and later
[45.04] superimposed drainage channels of
[47.84] variable morphology all drain northeast
[51.36] and eastn northeast from northwest
[54.399] Sudan. But clearly this was the
[56.8] handiwork of enormous volumes of

Title: Hyper Velocity Impacts and Human Civilization Cosmic Encounters of the Holocene
[0.16] Hello, I'm Randall Carlson. I'd like to
[2.56] welcome you back to another episode of
[4.319] Squaring the Circle. In recent episodes,
[7.2] we've been looking at the phenomena of
[9.2] hypervelocity impacts of comets and
[12.28] asteroids. We've been looking at the
[14.799] cosmic environment, close
[17.24] encounters that have come very close to
[20.08] Earth, but not actually struck us. In
[22.64] the most recent episode, we looked at
[24.64] the big picture, the long range of
[27.68] impacts into the Earth, and we saw a
[31.359] gallery of craters that are the impact
[34.719] scars left over from these great
[36.88] impacts, also called astrolams if
[39.28] they're not the classical B-shaped
[41.52] crater. In this episode, we're going to
[43.84] bring it a little closer to home and
[45.28] we're going to look at the evidence for
[48.079] cosmic impacts within the last 10,000 to
[51.92] 12,000 years. This would be what we call
[54.64] the holysine in terms of geological
[57.48] epochs. This is the period of time
[60.079] during which human civilization arose
[63.359] out
[64.28] of simple huntergatherer societies,
[69.479] foragers and so on. So we see the shift
[73.439] over into sedentary lifestyles. We see
[77.64] the dispersion of languages. We see the
[81.92] first urban
[83.24] complexes. We
[85.32] see all of these kinds of things
[87.6] occurring in the early to mid
[90.68] holysine. And what has been neglected in
[94.56] looking at models of human history and
[96.96] the the rising and the falling of
[98.799] civilization is the potential role of
[101.6] cosmic impacts and encounters with
[103.6] things from space. So it's interesting
[106.079] that while conventional models of
[108.399] prehistory still dominate, there's been
[110.479] a whole lot of research over the last
[113.119] couple of decades that suggests that
[115.439] cosmic impacts have played a much
[117.119] greater role than has previously been
[119.2] recognized. So that's what we're going
[121.04] to start looking at in this episode. So
[123.84] I'm calling this one hypervelocity
[126.0] impacts in human
[127.959] civilization cosmic encounters in the
[130.72] holene. So, we're going to get right
[132.959] into it here. And I'm going to refer to
[136.08] an article that I actually came back way
[138.8] back in 2007 as the paradigm was
[141.44] beginning to
[142.84] shift was Mike authored by Mike Ba
[146.44] Bailey with the department of geography,
[149.2] archaeology, and
[151.319] paleoecology at Queens University in
[153.84] Belfast, UK. And he is an expert in tree
[157.04] ring analysis.
[158.959] and he also spent a bunch of time
[162.8] looking at the evidence for climatic
[166.68] downturns and connected with evidence
[169.76] for cosmic impacts occurring or
[172.64] corresponding at the same time. So the
[175.76] title of this paper that he published
[177.68] back in uh 2007 in the journal of
[181.319] quaternary science was entitled the case
[184.959] for significant numbers of
[186.84] extraterrestrial impacts through the
[189.36] late
[190.76] holysine
[192.44] and this is this is I'll just get into a
[196.239] little bit of it here and this is what
[198.4] he wrote. It almost seems that there is
[200.48] a reluctance to take craters seriously.
[203.92] Given their potential importance in
[206.319] assessing impact hazards, it is
[208.879] surprising that their identification is
[211.2] not afforded more importance by nation
[214.04] states. In general, they are not
[216.4] regarded as national priorities and
[219.519] their study is left to the whim of
[221.44] individual researchers.
[223.76] Despite that, there is a reasonable
[226.84] evidence for at least a dozen craters on
[230.84] land within the past 5,000
[234.36] years. That would equate, allowing for
[237.92] the greater area of the ocean to a
[241.2] minimum of 40 notable impacts on the
[244.64] entire Earth's surface in this time
[248.08] interval. Now the points he makes here
[250.879] way back in to way back way back in
[253.959] 2007 are still true. There's still not
[257.199] enough importance being attributed to
[259.519] this phenomena. And of course one of the
[262.56] reasons for that now is the dominant
[264.8] paradigm is anthropogenic climate
[266.8] change. And if we I've been making this
[269.6] point all along that if we start looking
[271.68] at
[272.6] natural triggers for climate change
[275.12] whether it's volcanism or changes in
[278.56] oceanic circulation or changes in solar
[282.52] variability or in the the galactic ray
[286.88] bombardment. We could go through a whole
[288.72] list of potential other influences on
[291.16] climate. But the point is or cosmic
[294.479] impact. The point is though is to the to
[298.08] talk about these things then diverts
[300.24] attention away from the dominant
[302.88] paradigm which again is anthropogenic
[305.12] climate change and they would be
[307.16] distractions from the from the
[310.24] imposition of that particular narrative
[313.199] into the discussion of particularly of
[316.88] policy. And I think this is probably one
[319.199] of the main reasons for the neglect of
[321.52] some of these other factors which I
[323.919] would consider two of the most important
[326.08] being the impact phenomena and solar
[329.0] variability. Well, we will be talking
[331.199] about solar variability in future
[332.96] upcoming episodes, but for now we're
[335.199] focusing on the phenomena of impacts
[338.32] that could be by asteroids or could be
[340.479] by comets or cometary related debris in
[343.84] the holene. So this would have been
[346.32] cosmic phenomena that could have
[348.08] directly affected human societies, human
[350.88] cultures and human
[354.199] history. So Bailey goes on and he says
[357.44] in general terms people who thought that
[359.84] impacts from space were mostly
[362.84] inconsequential were the products of
[364.96] earlier 20th century thinking. According
[368.319] to the vast majority of 20th century
[370.88] historical and archaeological
[372.84] researchers, there is no evidence for
[374.96] anything from space having had any
[376.96] effect on human populations in the whole
[379.759] of the time since humanity became
[382.36] literate. That is within the last 5
[385.319] millennia. Obviously, if you live on a
[387.919] planet which has not been hit by
[390.08] anything within, say, 5,000 years,
[393.68] there's little to worry about in the
[395.52] less than century lifespan of a typical
[398.919] human. Presumably by extrapolation of
[402.319] this thinking, impacts by comet
[404.4] fragments would be
[406.759] inconsequential. In July
[409.479] 1994, however, it was observed that the
[412.479] impacts on Jupiter were indeed huge. The
[416.4] largest releasing the equivalent of
[419.12] millions of megatons. Now, I may think
[422.96] I'm sure a lot of listeners do remember
[425.12] the event of July 1994, which was the
[428.479] impact of the fragments of comet
[431.039] Shoemaker Levy 9, 21 fragments to be
[433.84] exact, that plunged into into Jupiter.
[437.919] And there was a lot of discussion and
[440.88] controversy leading up to that event as
[443.199] to whether the the consequences would
[447.72] be be profound or not. And it turns out
[450.96] that they were like Bailey says here,
[454.96] millions of megatons were released. Had
[457.24] that event
[459.319] occurred on Earth, had those say 21
[462.56] objects struck Earth in July of 1994, we
[466.639] would pretty much be extinct right now.
[470.08] Okay, so that's kind of a big deal.
[473.759] Then there was another paper around that
[476.24] time that came out at the Cambridge
[480.28] conference correspondence and it was
[483.52] entitled now this was at the a
[486.319] presentation at the annual meeting of
[487.919] the American Association for the
[489.52] Advancement of Science Dr. Penn excuse
[493.28] me Dr. Benny Paiser of Liverpool, John
[496.4] Moore University presented there and
[499.12] what he did is he presented evidence
[501.36] suggesting that more than 500 impact
[504.96] events of extraterrestrial origin have
[507.919] punctuated earth during the past 10,000
[510.56] years which comprises most of the
[512.399] holysine. The great majority or 70% of
[516.8] these events have been of the Tangusa
[519.519] type class of atmospheric impacts with
[522.8] an average energy yield of between 20
[525.92] and 100 megat tons of TNT. Now, you will
[529.76] recall, I hope you've seen the episodes
[532.399] we did on the Tangusa event. You'll know
[534.8] that the general consensus at this point
[538.24] is that the energy released during the
[540.24] Tangusa event was about 15 megat tons,
[543.279] which was about the size of
[545.8] the largest hydrogen bombs tested by the
[549.6] the United States back in the 1950s.
[553.2] So anyways, Piser is making the point
[556.399] that the majority of these impacts were
[559.92] of the Tangusa type. Now you remember
[561.839] that Tangusa did not create a crater
[564.32] because it was an air burst. And air
[567.2] bursts will create tremendous havoc on
[570.32] the ground in the immediate area of the
[572.56] burst, but they don't leave the kind of
[574.88] lasting imprints that you would find
[577.04] from a direct impact into the ground
[579.36] itself, which creates a crater or a a
[583.44] classic B-shaped hole in the ground. So
[586.48] what he's suggesting here is that more
[588.24] than a 100 surface impacts including
[591.6] more than a dozen oceanic impacts are
[595.04] believed to have repeatedly devastated
[597.04] whole regions, small countries and early
[600.0] civilizations around the globe. In a
[603.04] worsted estimate, Dr. Piser said that up
[606.399] to eight climatic downturns detectable
[609.6] in the geological and climatological
[612.0] records of the holysine may be directly
[614.48] associated with multiple impact events.
[617.519] Okay, let me let's reemphasize that up
[620.399] to eight climatic downturns. So he in
[623.04] his research he sees a direct link
[625.32] between climatic phenomena, climatic
[628.16] variability changes and the incursion of
[631.44] cosmic objects whether they're direct
[634.0] impacts or air bursts. Okay, this is
[637.04] important and this is the thing that
[639.04] wants to be downplayed and
[641.0] deemphasized by the estab the proponents
[643.76] of the establishment narrative which is
[646.079] that we're only supposed to be looking
[647.839] at human caused human causes for climate
[651.2] change. Okay, he goes on here. He says
[653.519] that episodes of increased cometary or
[656.72] meteoric activity punctuating societal
[660.32] evolution should be looked upon as
[663.2] potential agencies determining the rise
[666.079] and fall of ancient
[667.959] civilizations. both the emergence and
[670.399] the collapse of human cultures, the
[673.04] pleaene holysine transition and the
[676.36] Neolithic revolution, the onset and
[679.76] collapse of the Bronze Age
[681.6] civilizations, which is something we're
[683.279] also going to be addressing in greater
[685.2] detail in future episodes, and even the
[688.16] collapse of the Roman Empire may be
[690.56] associated with episodes of increased
[692.64] cosmic activity and multiple impacts
[695.92] that may well have included incidences
[699.279] incidents of cosmic dust loading. Now,
[702.56] this is another byproduct of cosmic
[705.56] encounters is the in the the incursion
[709.839] of dust into the global atmosphere. Now,
[712.48] what that's going to do, of course, is
[714.72] make the atmosphere more opaque. It's
[717.76] going to reflect more sunlight back into
[719.6] space and it's going to cause a general
[721.44] decline in co in temperatures which can
[724.56] have devastating consequences as we've
[726.88] seen during several of the episodes of
[730.24] climatic downturn that have led to
[733.2] agricultural collapses which in turn
[735.12] have led to famine and which in turn
[737.36] have led to the the onset of of disease
[741.839] pandemics because people when they're
[744.48] malnourished they are not getting enough
[746.8] nutrition. nutrition and their immune
[748.32] systems get weak. But again, this is not
[751.36] something that is supposed to be
[753.04] included within the mainstream
[758.92] discussion. So he goes on to say that
[762.24] while most of these impacts occurred
[764.72] over unpopulated unpopulated areas of
[767.6] the globe, there are historical accounts
[770.72] about devastating cosmic catastrophes.
[774.0] According to a number of Chinese
[775.92] records, about 10,000 people were killed
[778.639] in the city of Chiing Yang in 1490 AD
[783.76] due to the breakup of a small asteroid.
[787.44] Then he he goes on to say about a dozen
[790.519] hypervelocity impact craters that date
[792.88] from the holene period that is since the
[795.839] end of the ice age have been discovered
[798.24] to date. The majority of impacts,
[800.88] however, that occurred during this
[802.24] crucial period of societal evolution
[804.88] have not been detected yet. According to
[808.56] Dr. Piser, the 14 known impact craters
[812.639] most certainly paint a rather deceptive
[815.36] picture of our past. The fact that no
[818.32] massive impact crater dating to the
[820.16] holysine has been detected has led to
[822.639] the belief that no hemispheric or global
[826.24] impact disaster can possibly have
[828.44] happened. However, this is a widespread
[832.04] delusion and that is directly quoting
[834.959] Dr. Piser. And yet there is still a
[839.199] regrettable lack of interest in the
[841.76] scientific community to scrutinize the
[844.8] holysine for major impact events. And
[846.959] that is still true to this day in
[849.8] 2024, which to me is an oversight that
[853.279] could have ultimately very dire
[855.839] consequences if we don't become more
[858.399] aware of the cosmic environment of which
[860.959] our planet is a part and its role in
[864.079] human societies and civilization on
[866.16] earth.
[868.8] So I am now going
[871.0] to go and show you a map that is the
[875.76] distribution of known impact sites just
[878.399] within the past 5,000 years. So let's
[882.0] see if we can get this here. I would
[884.399] like to mention that one of our original
[886.48] sponsors at Cosmographia, CBD from the
[889.76] Gods, is following us here to our new
[892.24] podcast, Squaring the Circle. As many of
[895.279] you know, I've been using their products
[896.959] for going on four years now. And having
[900.0] tried a number of CBD brands, CBD from
[903.279] the gods seems the most effective for my
[905.839] needs, which is primarily as a sleep aid
[908.8] and as a remedy for inflammation and
[911.199] associated pain. I use both the oil and
[915.04] the sav. My wife also likes their
[917.92] products, especially the SAV, which
[919.68] alleviates the pain in her hands, which
[922.24] is the result of working for years as an
[924.68] electrician. If you've been thinking
[926.48] about trying a CBD product and
[928.48] experiencing the benefits for yourself,
[931.12] give CBD from the gods a try. To learn
[934.56] more and see their product line, check
[937.36] out

[942.16] products helps our efforts here at
[944.079] Squaring the Circle to realize our goal
[947.04] of making this world a better place.
[951.72] Thanks. Let's see. Let's just roll down
[955.44] and we will get to that
[959.48] map. Here it is right here. Okay. So,
[964.079] you can see here this is the I think
[966.16] there's at least 14 of them here. Now,
[968.56] these are all within the past 5,000
[970.639] years, which is not even half the
[972.24] holysine,
[973.48] right? Some of these would have been
[975.519] only local or regional. Some of them may
[977.759] have had global consequences. We're
[979.6] going to look at some of them in more
[981.279] detail. And then in the next segment
[984.0] here, we are going to really unpack some
[986.24] of these particular events and look at
[989.92] the long-term consequences. We're going
[991.92] to examine whether or not they had a
[994.16] role to play in the evolution of human
[999.24] civilization. So we'll begin here by
[1001.839] looking at a very interesting example.
[1004.72] This was recent grazing impacts on the
[1007.92] earth recorded in the Rioart crater
[1010.72] field in Argentina. Let's look at this
[1012.88] together. The most probable angle of a
[1015.92] meteoroid impact on a planet is
[1019.48] 45°. And an impact at 15° from the
[1023.04] horizontal or lower is as likely as at
[1026.52] 75° or higher. Yet little direct
[1029.919] evidence for oblique impacts exists on
[1032.64] the Earth. Oblique meaning a very
[1036.28] shallow a very shallow angle of
[1039.679] approach. Okay? Unless the impact angle
[1043.36] is very low, any asymmetry created
[1046.079] during the initial transfer of energy
[1048.079] from impactor to target is lost as the
[1050.96] crater is formed. In other words, you
[1052.799] can come in at an angle and the
[1055.52] explosion is going to create a basically
[1057.44] a round crater, not necessarily an
[1060.64] elliptical
[1062.36] one. And the shallow crater, moreover,
[1065.2] the shallow craters formed by oblique
[1066.799] impact are more easily obscured by
[1069.28] subsequent erosion.
[1071.52] during routine flights two years ago.
[1073.6] Now, this is from Nature, the journal
[1076.08] Nature in 1992, so this has been a while
[1078.64] now since this
[1080.12] discovery. One of us noticed, and that
[1083.679] was Reuben E. Leonza, noticed an
[1086.88] anomalous alignment of oblong rimmed
[1090.16] depressions 4 km by 1 km on the
[1094.08] otherwise featureless farmland of the
[1096.16] Pampas in Argentina.
[1098.799] We argue here from sample analysis and
[1101.76] by analogy with laboratory experiments
[1104.64] that these structures resulted from a
[1106.799] low angle impact and ricochet of a
[1110.64] condritic body originally 150 to 300 m
[1114.64] in diameter. Now 300 m in diameter
[1118.559] that's going to be about six times
[1120.559] greater diameter than Tangusa. So you
[1122.88] can extrapolate up from that you know
[1125.76] the
[1126.52] energies released during this thing
[1129.36] might be on the order of 80 to 100 megat
[1132.559] tons. So this would have been a
[1136.2] regional disaster
[1139.08] here.
[1140.919] that goes on to say, "The Rio Corto
[1143.679] crater field provides a rare opportunity
[1146.32] to invest in investigate energy
[1148.72] partitioning associated with large-scale
[1151.36] oblique impacts and to explore the
[1154.48] complex interactions between impactor,
[1158.0] target, and atmosphere. Previously only
[1161.28] observed in the laboratory and preserved
[1163.12] in different planetary settings. The
[1166.0] size of crater A indicates that the
[1168.16] impact body was about 150 m in diameter
[1171.2] resulting in an estimated energy release
[1173.84] of 350 megat tons of TNT equivalent.
[1178.88] Okay, so this was I was even off by an
[1182.0] order of magnitude here. 30 times larger
[1184.16] than the 1908 Tangusa event for an
[1188.08] assumed impact velocity of 25 km/s.
[1192.16] The age of the implaced lust, which is a
[1194.48] type of top soil, the excellent
[1196.559] preservation state of the smaller
[1198.679] craters, the preserved glassy sheen on
[1201.679] the impact, and the state of the
[1203.44] recovered condrite all suggest an age
[1206.64] considerably less than 10,000 years.
[1209.6] Consequently, it is conceivable that
[1211.52] this event was witnessed by early
[1213.919] inhabitants of South America.
[1217.28] So this shows the recent grazing impacts
[1219.6] on the earth recorded in the Rio Cuartto
[1222.0] graater crater field
[1223.96] Argentina. Okay, you can see this is
[1226.799] like imagine a gigantic version of
[1229.84] skipping a stone on a pond and and you
[1232.24] kind of get the impression of what
[1234.24] happened
[1235.64] here. And then from the aerial view
[1238.159] above, you can see how elongated these
[1240.32] scars actually are. So, and then above
[1244.24] the black and white photograph here is
[1245.84] one of the smaller members of the Rio
[1247.52] CuTau crater field. Approximately 250 m
[1251.52] across the ridge and grooved terrain
[1254.96] extending to the southwest is typical of
[1257.44] craters formed by a tight cluster of
[1260.24] small projectiles in the
[1263.24] laboratory. Okay. And in the next one we
[1267.52] have here a specimen of the Rio Cuartto
[1270.4] Hollisine impact glass
[1273.32] melt and this is from the study by Peter
[1277.799] Schultz 2014. This was a followup on
[1281.36] this and the archaeology of cosmic
[1283.96] impacts. This is lessons from two
[1286.6] midhallles Argentine case studies.
[1289.919] There's another one I don't think we'll
[1291.36] have time to talk about that in this
[1293.36] particular episode.
[1296.48] But let's go on. There is
[1300.52] more. This is a very interesting case.
[1304.48] The 1930 August 13th Brazilian Tangus
[1308.76] man. And so this is from the scientific
[1313.28] journal of the observatory. And this
[1316.48] information was provided by the NASA
[1318.24] astrophysics data
[1320.44] system. and Mark Bailey was also
[1323.2] involved in this the authoring of this
[1328.28] particular report. So let's look at this
[1331.12] a brief note in the journal of the
[1333.76] international meteor organization citing
[1336.08] an article by Kulik remember him
[1338.76] Kulik was Leoned Kulik that it's
[1342.0] referring to here who was the first
[1343.52] scientist to reach the Tangus the site
[1346.24] of the
[1347.32] Tangusa cosmic event.
[1350.96] So this is citing an article by Kulich
[1353.44] in a popular Russian scientific journal
[1356.559] in
[1358.039] 1931 and it has drawn attention to a
[1360.64] possible Brazilian twin of the Tungusa
[1364.48] meteoroid explosion in 1908 which
[1367.76] devastated nearly 2,000 km of forest in
[1370.96] an area near the Podkanaya River about
[1373.919] 70 km from the central Siberian town of
[1377.12] Vanavaro. Kulik's article contains
[1380.159] information published in the Daily
[1382.28] Herald of March 6, 1931, which itself
[1386.48] refers to report originating from
[1388.96] Catholic missionaries working in Brazil
[1391.76] and published in the newspaper La
[1395.64] Aervara Oservator Romano. There is
[1399.6] currently much interest in the frequency
[1401.76] and the possible hazards to civilization
[1405.12] posed by impacts with the Earth of
[1407.12] relatively small fragments of comets or
[1410.2] asteroids in the 10 to 100 meter Tungusa
[1414.0] object size range. And since neither the
[1416.96] report in the Daily Herald nor that in
[1419.6] La Observator Romana are readily
[1422.799] accessible, we thought that a summary of
[1425.52] the former and a complete translation of
[1427.6] the latter would be of interest to
[1429.6] readers of the observatory. Now, we're
[1431.039] not going to do the
[1433.24] complete translation here about
[1436.36] that, but we'll get into it enough here
[1438.799] that you can sort of get the the the
[1442.159] gist of it.
[1445.0] So, this is the archaeology of cosmic
[1448.52] impacts. Let's see. This is a little bit
[1450.799] out of order here. Was supposed to have
[1453.36] been backed up by the the Rio Quartto
[1456.799] before we jumped into
[1458.36] the before we jumped into the Brazilian
[1461.679] Tangaska. So, we'll just look at this
[1464.24] while we're here and then we'll go
[1466.48] forward. Cosmic impact is a category of
[1469.52] natural catastrophe neglected or
[1471.919] misunderstood by most archaeologists in
[1474.799] reconstructions of past population
[1477.6] dynamics. Let's emphasize that it's a
[1481.36] type of natural catastrophe neglected or
[1485.08] misunderstood by most
[1487.48] archaeologists in reconstructions of
[1489.919] past human population dynamics. We
[1493.44] discussed the nature of impact by
[1494.96] asteroids and comets and what is known
[1497.039] and theorized about the quaternary
[1500.2] period impact record. Now quaternery
[1503.039] we're going back 2.6 million years.
[1505.6] We're not focused on that big of a span
[1507.76] of time in this episode. We're looking
[1509.96] at the last 10 to 12,000 years. As case
[1514.159] studies for our exploration of how
[1516.32] archaeological method and theory can be
[1518.4] productively applied to the study of
[1520.159] cosmic impact. We focus on two confirmed
[1524.08] holysine asteroid impacts in central and
[1526.88] northeastern Argentina. One was the
[1529.2] Rioart, which I just introduced you to,
[1531.919] and the other is the Campo Delchiello,
[1534.559] both likely dating between 6 and 3,000
[1538.559] years before present. We model and
[1541.36] assess the potential destructive effects
[1543.52] of these impacts on contemporary hunting
[1546.159] and gathering populations using several
[1548.48] lines of evidence. The search for
[1551.12] quturnary period cosmic impacts along
[1553.919] with the documentation of the effects of
[1556.72] confirmed cosmic impacts on human
[1559.4] populations particularly of those in
[1562.48] organized in small-cale social groups
[1564.88] represents a challenge and a key
[1568.279] opportunity for our future
[1570.44] archaeological
[1572.279] research. And then I have a quote here
[1575.679] by one of the
[1577.88] preeminent scientists studying impact
[1581.4] phenomena and it he says impact
[1584.72] cratering is the most fundamental
[1586.4] geological process in the solar system.
[1589.2] And we know that now in a large scale
[1590.96] geological we also suspect that in a
[1593.48] paleontological context it is also one
[1596.24] of the most fundamental
[1598.76] processes. What we're not now yet
[1601.36] accepting is the idea that it may be one
[1603.76] of the most fundamental processes in
[1606.0] human civilization. And this is what I'm
[1608.24] trying to get the the attention and the
[1610.32] discussion to shift over away from the
[1613.52] dominant politically contrived narrative
[1615.679] to be looking at this phenomena that it
[1618.64] may have played a very important role in
[1621.76] the evolution of human civilization on
[1624.159] this planet within the last 10,000
[1626.4] years. So now let's get back to
[1629.48] the the
[1631.799] the Brazilian and Guska. Okay. So this
[1635.36] appeared in the new science the journal
[1637.039] New Scientist back in
[1639.559] 1995. They're posing the question, did a
[1642.72] falling comet cause rumble in the
[1644.799] jungle?
[1646.64] The diaries of a Catholic missionary
[1648.88] could reveal the cause of a catastrophic
[1651.48] explosion which devastated hundreds of
[1654.24] square
[1655.64] kilometers of the Brazilian rainforest
[1658.559] 65 years ago. Father Fidel de
[1662.12] Alviano wrote a report on the explosion
[1665.039] in 1931 for the papal newspaper La
[1668.279] Observator Romano. His article, which
[1671.76] was recently rediscovered by a British
[1674.2] astronomer, describes the blast in
[1676.799] graphic detail, but fails to mention
[1679.12] vital features that would help to
[1681.279] identify the cause. The missing clues
[1684.48] may be in the priest's voluminous
[1686.76] diaries, which are held in the Vatican
[1690.159] library.
[1692.64] The Brazilian Tungusa came to this is
[1694.96] Mike Bailey again to Bailey'seye
[1697.2] attention after he read a reference to
[1699.399] it by in a a reference to it by Nikolai
[1704.039] Vasilev
[1705.64] Vaselv and Janaji I'm probably
[1709.44] butchering his name sorry if you're
[1711.76] still around and you hear this Janades
[1715.799] Andrev in a 1989 issue of the journal of
[1719.76] the international media year
[1722.52] organization. The Russians referred to a
[1724.88] 1931 article by Leoned Kulik of the
[1727.6] Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow,
[1730.159] the first man to investigate the Tangus
[1732.48] event. Kulik mentioned reports in
[1735.76] Western newspapers, including the
[1738.08] British Daily Herald, of a massive
[1740.32] explosion in Brazil. But neither he nor
[1743.08] Vasilv or Andrev had access to Western
[1747.559] newspapers. Bailey did, however. He
[1750.48] looked up the Daily Herald story only to
[1753.039] discover that it was based on Dalvano's
[1755.76] article for which it gave no date. On a
[1758.32] subsequent visit to Rome, Bailey
[1760.799] obtained microfilm copies of La
[1763.48] Observator Romano from the period. Thank
[1767.279] you for that, Mike
[1769.799] Bailey. Back at Liverpool, John Moore's
[1772.96] University where Bailey was then a
[1774.64] researcher, he was being workshadowed by
[1777.679] two local school boys. He sent them
[1780.08] searching through the five reels of
[1782.2] microfilm. On the first day, Damen
[1784.72] Markham and James Scriven found a
[1787.36] headline referring to bolides or
[1789.76] exploding meteors. In the article based
[1792.96] on his interviews with terrified locals,
[1796.159] D. Alviano describes how at 8:00 a.m. on
[1798.799] the 13th of August 1930 in the upper
[1802.399] reges reaches of the Amazon close to the
[1805.279] border between Brazil and Peru, the sun
[1808.559] suddenly turned blood red and everything
[1812.08] was plunged into darkness. A fine white
[1815.6] ash rained down followed by an
[1818.52] earpiercing whistle. Finally, three
[1822.08] balls of fire stre across the sky and
[1825.039] exploded, creating earthquakelike
[1827.72] shocks. The explosions were heard
[1830.24] hundreds of kilometers away, and the
[1832.799] forest burnt for months
[1836.679] afterward. Eyewitness accounts of the
[1839.84] fireballs. Now this is from another
[1842.399] report that appeared in the
[1844.919] planetarian the journal planetarian
[1847.279] space science of January
[1850.44] 2011. Karaka a probable mini
[1854.52] tunguska. So eyewitness accounts of
[1857.36] fireballs and explosions in the Karaka
[1859.84] area Brazil in August 1930 led to the
[1863.44] suggestion that a large meteorite had
[1865.84] fallen. It was later discovered that a
[1868.24] seismic event had occurred on the same
[1870.72] day and approximately the same hour as
[1873.52] the Karaka event and in the same area.
[1875.84] You will recall from our discussions
[1878.64] about the Tangus event that there was a
[1880.72] 6.7 or was it
[1883.08] 5.7 RTER scale earthquake associated
[1886.48] with the atmospheric the air burst of
[1889.64] Tangusa. Could this have been related in
[1892.559] the same fashion here? I think it's
[1894.32] likely. Otherwise, it's purely a
[1896.519] coincidence, but an interesting
[1898.48] coincidence nonetheless because as we
[1900.799] explore into this phenomena deeper,
[1902.96] we're going to find that the correlation
[1905.039] between these type of cosmic events and
[1907.919] a terrestrial response in the form of of
[1911.2] a seismic response or an earthquake
[1914.32] actually seems to be a fairly regular
[1918.12] occurrence. There is also description of
[1920.799] going on here. There's also published
[1922.799] description of a circular feature of
[1924.559] about 1.2 km diameter in Lancet images
[1928.64] of the river Kuraca basin. It has been
[1931.6] suggested that this feature could be the
[1933.76] trace of an impact crater produced by
[1936.24] the Kuraca event.
[1939.399] So in August 1930, Father De Alviano
[1943.76] went to the Karaca River near the
[1945.6] Brazilian Peruvian border to carry out
[1948.24] his annual apostolic mission. There he
[1951.6] discovered that the local people were
[1953.36] terrified by fireballs and explosions
[1955.84] that had occurred a few days before his
[1958.36] arrival and that had led them to believe
[1961.36] that the world was at an end. And we
[1964.32] will recall that this is exactly the
[1967.2] response of the Tangusi people in the
[1970.32] area of the Tangusa event is they
[1973.2] thought that this was the end of the
[1975.48] world. Hundreds of eyewitnesses reported
[1978.24] to the Catholic missionary that
[1980.44] around 0800 hours on August 13th, 1930,
[1984.48] a fine red dust began to fall onto the
[1987.039] forest and into the river. Then people
[1989.919] heard several earpiercing whistles that
[1992.559] became increasingly loud. Fishermen on
[1995.519] the river could see the fall of large
[1998.44] fireballs. There were three distinct
[2000.88] explosions, each causing earth tremors.
[2004.559] The ash continued to fall until midday.
[2007.6] Father D. Alviano concluded that a
[2009.679] meteoroid had exploded in the Earth
[2011.96] atmosphere and a note to this effect
[2014.96] appeared on March 31st, 1931 in the
[2018.0] Vatican
[2020.679] newspaper. So where is this one now? The
[2024.48] status of this looks like it was a
[2026.32] Tangusa type event. Maybe not as quite
[2028.72] as powerful, but interestingly about
[2030.559] this one, there were three fireballs
[2032.72] reported. So probably what happened here
[2035.44] is you had a a single item, a single
[2038.32] object coming in and then as it entered
[2040.72] in the atmosphere, it broke up into
[2042.72] three parts and then the offspring of
[2045.679] that was the three fireballs which
[2048.639] apparently exploded in the atmosphere.
[2050.879] Unless the depression that it referred
[2052.96] to in the previous quote was in fact a
[2055.359] crater and one of them actually struck
[2057.44] the ground. This has not been confirmed
[2060.0] because of the fact the rapid recovery
[2061.839] of the rainforest and the the jungle and
[2064.0] so on has made it very difficult to go
[2066.079] in there and determine whether or not it
[2069.04] is actually an impact
[2071.24] crater. So now we're going to go on to
[2073.28] some some more potential impacts during
[2076.96] the holene. The next one is the Eagle
[2080.96] Station impact site.
[2084.159] This report appeared just recently in
[2087.119] the North American Archaeologist in
[2090.359] 2023. Now, Kenneth Barnett Tankersley,
[2093.76] I've met him. He was one of the
[2096.159] presenters at the cosmic summit in
[2098.92] 2023, and he's done some very important
[2103.079] work associating cosmic impacts with the
[2106.599] Hopewellian culture in the Ohio River
[2110.079] Valley region. And we'll get into that.
[2113.2] So in the abstract it says the Eagle
[2115.28] Station impact site is located along
[2118.32] Eagle Creek in Carroll County, Kentucky.
[2121.72] Palisites, we'll talk about those 23 cm
[2125.68] cm to less than or equal to 3
[2129.079] mm are a rare form of stony meteorites
[2132.64] and they occur in the late archaic
[2134.96] cultural period stratum with heat
[2138.079] altered flaked stone artifacts.
[2141.359] carbonized plant remains and fire
[2144.4] cracked rocks. A calibrated accelerator
[2148.56] mass spectrometry radioarbon age of
[2153.32] 3,824 years before present to
[2157.64] 3,593 before present. So that would be
[2161.32] 1875 before common era to 1644 before
[2165.04] common era. on the palisite bearing
[2168.0] stratum demonstrates that the impact
[2170.56] event occurred during the late holysine.
[2173.359] The habitation site was abandoned after
[2176.0] the impact event and the site was buried
[2178.88] within 200 years by alovvium. The Eagle
[2183.119] Station impact site increases our
[2185.599] understanding of the frequency of late
[2188.32] holysine cosmic impact events and their
[2191.28] possible influence on ancient cultures.
[2197.44] Despite the scientific evidence of the
[2200.32] Eagle Station palisite type locality,
[2202.96] the age of the impact event has never
[2204.88] been chronometrically determined. There
[2207.839] is a growing body of evidence that
[2210.72] ancient cosmic events such as asteroid
[2213.28] impacts, comet air bursts, and meteor
[2215.599] faults have impacted ancient cultures of
[2218.48] various ages worldwide. In North
[2221.44] America, Hopewell archaeological sites
[2224.079] associated with the middle woodland
[2226.28] culture period contain more meteorites
[2229.52] than any other cultural complex. More
[2232.96] specifically, Hopewell archaeological
[2235.2] sites contain an anomalously high
[2238.56] concentration of palisites, the rarest
[2241.68] form of meteorites.
[2244.92] Okay. Then we'll move on to yet
[2249.16] another impact site. So this
[2253.32] was also from 2023. So this is recent
[2256.56] stuff. You can see that this these
[2259.359] discoveries are
[2260.92] ongoing you know for the last 2530 years
[2264.0] since we scientists started really
[2266.64] taking a closer look at the holysine
[2270.32] period which again is focusing on the
[2272.76] near historical period as opposed let's
[2276.4] say to the long-term picture of the role
[2279.599] of great impacts in earth history and
[2282.599] its effect for example on the rise and
[2285.44] fall of of you know mass extinction
[2288.76] events also
[2290.839] the the possibility of major climate
[2294.16] shifts and geological boundaries being
[2296.079] associated with great impacts. So this
[2298.8] is evidence for a large lake holene
[2301.28] strewn field in Kioa County Kansas USA.
[2304.64] Now a strewn field basically let's
[2306.72] picture this you got maybe a low
[2310.359] density object coming into the
[2313.56] atmosphere and fragmenting right this is
[2316.72] what Rio Quartto was. It was a strewn
[2319.44] field. You had multiple impacts of what
[2322.24] was undoubtedly once a single object,
[2326.16] maybe very loosely consolidated, maybe a
[2328.96] very fryable object, but once entering
[2332.0] into the Earth's atmosphere, the the
[2334.0] frictional passage causes it to separate
[2337.04] into multiple pieces, and then you have
[2338.8] what's called a strewn field.
[2344.44] Okay, let's see what we say about this.
[2349.68] There is evidence that Native Americans
[2352.4] have transgenerational knowledge of past
[2355.119] cosmic impact events that have been
[2356.88] passed down through their oral histories
[2359.04] and cultural traditions. The homeland of
[2362.0] one Native American tribe, the
[2364.119] Pawnee, in the great plains of North
[2366.72] America, including Kansas. The Pawnee
[2369.52] are known for the accuracy of their
[2371.2] astronomical knowledge. Panee oral
[2374.079] histories tell of a time when the stars
[2376.56] flew and fell upon the earth. Now I'll
[2380.24] mention that back when I was the lead
[2383.92] researcher for fire from the sky which
[2387.28] was a documentary that was appear funded
[2390.4] and appeared on both TBS and CNN back in
[2395.28] 199697.
[2398.079] That's when I first learned about the
[2399.68] Pawnee and their quite remarkable
[2403.2] knowledge of astronomy and their
[2405.92] traditions of potentially cosmic impact.
[2409.68] So, let's go on here and see
[2412.76] what Dr. Tankersley has to say in this
[2415.839] particular
[2417.72] report. The
[2420.2] Brenham/Havland meteor crater is just
[2422.88] one of a Whoops. Whoops, sorry. of a
[2426.64] plethora of impact features comprising a
[2429.8] large approximately 800 hectare late
[2434.0] holysine age strewn field in Kawa
[2437.2] County,
[2438.28] Kansas. More than 10,000 kilograms of
[2441.599] palisites, a rare class of stony
[2447.32] meteorites have been recovered from
[2449.44] impact features and the surface of the
[2451.359] strewn field. Six AMS
[2454.68] radiocarbon ages demonstrate that there
[2457.119] is a
[2458.52] 95.4% probability that the impact event
[2462.24] occurred within a range of
[2466.2] 1,497 or 1497 before common era and 419
[2472.0] before common era and most likely
[2474.88] between 754 and 419 before common era.
[2479.839] The impact event is well described in
[2482.0] Pawnie oral histories and illustrated in
[2484.76] petroglyphs near the
[2486.92] strewnfield. The age and geographic
[2489.28] extent of the Kioa County, Kansas
[2491.68] strewnfield increases our understanding
[2494.24] of the frequency of cosmic impact events
[2496.88] on Earth and their influence on people
[2499.839] and cultural change.
[2505.119] Now palicites are believed to form
[2507.44] between the silicut mantle or outer
[2510.04] shell and the molten cores of a
[2512.56] differentiated asteroid. The primary
[2515.44] silicut mineral in palacees is olivine
[2519.2] distinguishable by its greenish hue. The
[2522.079] olivine crystals contained in the
[2524.92] Maralatti palisite are of such
[2527.119] consistently high purity that they were
[2528.88] adopted as a scientific standard for the
[2531.28] composition of olivine also known as the
[2533.76] gemstone paradot. Gem quality paradot
[2536.96] has been identified in multiple palisite
[2539.68] meteorites.
[2541.2] Okay, this seems to be associated with
[2543.52] these mid hollesene Hopewellian Ohio
[2547.56] Valley impact or impacts if it was more
[2551.28] than one. And so in this one, we
[2553.76] actually have a backlit slice of the the
[2558.319] Fukang
[2560.359] palite. And this is you can see here the
[2564.48] these are the olivine crystals. So what
[2567.52] you've got is a very here's a very thin
[2569.839] slice and you've got it back lit so that
[2572.16] the light is coming through it and
[2574.64] illuminating the olivine crystals within
[2577.119] the palisite the slice of the
[2581.8] palisite. And here we have cut, polished
[2584.96] and acid etched palisites collected from
[2588.24] impact feature sample sites. This is
[2591.76] multiple different
[2593.64] ones. So this is this is still from the
[2597.92] article evidence for a large lake
[2599.76] hollisine strewnfield in Kawa
[2603.72] County and but there's there's other
[2607.359] examples of palisites. However, as it
[2610.0] mentioned here, they're very they're
[2612.0] rare amongst
[2613.64] meteorites which may have some
[2615.599] interesting implications that we don't
[2617.2] have time to discuss here for this
[2619.88] episode. Okay. So going further into the
[2624.079] evidence for an effect on the Hopwell
[2626.48] culture. Now remember the Hopeal
[2627.839] culture, in case you don't know, they're
[2629.44] the ones who are associated with all the
[2632.16] monumental earthworks and mound building
[2634.64] structures throughout the the the Ohio
[2638.16] River Valley and its tributaries, which
[2640.72] is something we're going to be talking
[2642.079] about in great detail in upcoming
[2644.0] episodes. Not just the the association
[2646.96] potentially with impacts but also the
[2649.359] whole phenomena of monu mon monumental
[2651.68] earthwork structures in itself which is
[2654.319] a pretty amazing thing and is worthy of
[2657.04] deeper
[2657.96] investigation and it's something that
[2660.0] that has fascinated myself and some of
[2662.8] my friends and colleagues for years.
[2665.04] We've made multiple expeditions to
[2667.599] examine these sites. We're planning
[2670.079] actually future excursions to visit some
[2672.64] of the monumental earthwork
[2674.52] sites maybe next year. So Tankersley's
[2680.359] work, the Hopewell cosmic air burst
[2683.76] event, a review of the empirical
[2686.16] evidence. He's done several articles on
[2688.319] this. You can see this
[2689.88] is I think this is available. You can
[2692.319] download it online, I believe. Let's
[2695.16] see. Let's see a review. This yeah this
[2698.319] app appeared in the journal air bursts
[2700.4] and cratering
[2702.92] impacts just published in 2024. Now I
[2707.119] will mention that the archaeological
[2709.2] community has taken great offense to
[2711.28] this idea that there may have been
[2712.92] impacts involved in the cultural and
[2715.68] social evolution of of these early
[2718.92] pre-Colombian societies in North
[2721.04] America.
[2722.599] So it remains controversial, but I think
[2725.68] that the evidence, the weight of
[2727.28] evidence is coming down on the side that
[2729.76] yes, there have been actually
[2731.8] these events that have affected the rise
[2735.119] and fall of human cultures in the past.
[2737.76] And the archaeologists might just need
[2739.92] to man up and and recognize that this is
[2743.119] a feature that they're going to have to
[2744.56] incorporate into their models of history
[2747.2] and prehistory.
[2749.52] but they're not too excited about having
[2753.48] to reorient their thinking at all. And
[2756.96] we find this pretty much across the
[2759.28] spectrum of the archaeological
[2761.0] establishment. Although this is
[2762.72] beginning to change. Okay. Some of the
[2765.52] kinds of proxy evidence found here. Like
[2768.24] the next image is a scanning electron
[2772.119] microscope microraphs of iron and
[2774.92] siliconri microsphererals. This is from
[2777.28] one of the Hamilton County, Ohio, the
[2780.16] Turner earthwork site. And this is the
[2783.44] kind of thing that is formed in
[2785.88] the tremendous heat and pressures of
[2788.96] impacts is these type of microsphererals
[2793.04] here. And again when we're we're looking
[2795.68] into more depth and talking in about the
[2799.24] proxies the the means by which we prove
[2802.96] or disprove the existence of a hyper
[2806.4] velocity
[2808.52] impact. This is one of the criteria we
[2811.04] use which
[2812.2] is
[2814.76] microsphererals. Now one of the sites
[2817.92] that's being referred to here in the
[2819.68] next image is quite interesting. This is
[2821.68] the next image is from the monumental
[2824.72] earthworks of the Mississippi Valley by
[2827.2] Squire and Davis which is going to be a
[2831.2] book that we'll have linked on our
[2833.52] bookstore on the website. It's if you're
[2836.16] interested in doing any research into
[2838.839] the amazing phenomena of pre-colian
[2842.359] earthworks
[2843.96] and
[2845.48] monumental mound building and so on.
[2848.0] This is an indispensable book. So here
[2851.359] this is showing one of
[2854.119] the one of
[2856.2] the what's called the Milford
[2858.359] earthworks. You can see here probably
[2861.44] does not exist except for traces because
[2864.319] now most of this like the date from this
[2866.88] was
[2868.04] 1848. So you can see what's happened is
[2871.8] the evolution of society,
[2875.48] urbanization, agriculture, road and
[2878.599] railroad building, all of these things
[2882.0] have obscured and erased probably 90% of
[2886.56] the earthworks that existed prior to the
[2889.68] arrival of the Europeans. However,
[2892.64] thankfully to the work of Squire and
[2895.28] Davis and others, we have a record of
[2897.359] these things. Squire and Davis were
[2899.28] surveyors who spent many years making
[2901.839] carefully detailed surveys of the extent
[2906.0] earthwork structures that still existed
[2909.119] back in the pre-Ivil War days. And here
[2912.48] we see a very interesting Whoops.
[2917.48] complex. I'll just mention a couple of
[2919.68] things here. You see this square here
[2922.0] with the open apertures and these mounds
[2925.359] just inside the apertures. These
[2927.359] apertures were undoubtedly sighting that
[2930.64] if you were standing more or less at the
[2932.48] center of this thing and sighting
[2934.48] through these apertures, you would be
[2936.16] looking at the horizon in various
[2939.68] directions and presumably cosmic events.
[2943.28] I mean things like equinoxial and
[2947.319] solstitial sunrises and so on. For
[2949.76] example, here we have the northeast
[2953.52] right here, southeast right here. So
[2956.72] it's likely that these could have been
[2958.319] solstitial
[2959.8] alignments. I don't specifically know on
[2962.24] this particular earthwork structure
[2963.839] right here. But this is
[2966.52] the relevance to our discussion today.
[2970.48] This is what's very interesting. This
[2972.96] right here, a cometshaped earthwork and
[2976.319] doesn't really exist anymore, but thanks
[2978.4] to Squire and Davis, we've got this. And
[2981.28] this is one of the places where apparent
[2984.079] impact proxies were found. So this is
[2986.8] this is a very interesting piece of
[2989.119] circumstantial evidence right
[2993.0] here. Going on to the next slide
[2996.2] here, we see that the the comet the
[3000.8] Hopewell comet air burst events adds to
[3003.359] our growing body of knowledge of
[3005.319] catastrophic cosmic events which led to
[3008.8] cultural downturns in ancient complex
[3011.359] sedentary and agriculturalbased
[3013.2] societies.
[3016.16] So that's just reiterating what we
[3018.24] discussed earlier. One of the things
[3020.839] here
[3022.839] that this time period of 252 to 383 of
[3027.44] the common era coincides with
[3030.0] historically documented nearearth comets
[3033.52] and occurs immediately prior to the
[3035.52] cultural downturn of the hope well. The
[3037.68] air burst event may have created mass
[3039.76] confusion and resulting resulting in an
[3042.24] upheaval of the social interaction
[3046.44] sphere. I actually I think this this
[3048.96] article is online. The archaeologists
[3052.24] got in such an uproar over this that
[3054.319] that they that the archaeological
[3056.839] establishment put so much pressure on
[3060.319] the journal Nature, which is very
[3063.079] conservative in its
[3066.04] orientation and very much
[3068.359] pro-anthropogenic climate change,
[3071.04] actually redacted the article. And so if
[3073.44] you download it, you're going to get
[3075.359] this version where splashed across
[3079.96] the each page it says
[3084.04] redacted. And again, I think this is
[3086.4] part of a paradigm that we're shifting
[3089.52] out of to become much more open to the
[3092.319] idea of interactions between Earth and
[3095.359] the and the sky, which has not been part
[3098.8] of
[3100.28] archaeological thinking at all.
[3102.96] really since its
[3104.52] inception. But I think the weight of
[3106.88] evidence is going to come down and
[3108.64] essentially
[3110.119] force archaeologists to make some
[3113.04] adjustments in their
[3115.16] thinking. Now this next one, next
[3117.839] example is very
[3122.28] interesting. This is a potentially comet
[3125.52] impact in AD536.
[3129.64] Now this image right
[3132.119] here is showing a series of tree rings.
[3135.44] So you had
[3137.24] u this particular article
[3141.079] was published let's see what was the
[3143.44] year again
[3145.16] 2000 it's been it's been a while August
[3147.599] I think
[3149.64] 2004 and in the abstract we see here
[3152.319] that there was a global climatic
[3154.359] downturn has previously been observed in
[3156.96] tree ring data associated with the years
[3159.44] AD 536 to 545.
[3163.2] We review the evidence for the
[3164.64] explanation of this event which involves
[3166.88] a comet fragment impacting the Earth and
[3169.76] exploding in the upper atmosphere. The
[3172.559] explosion would create a plume such as
[3175.2] was seen during the impact of comet
[3176.88] Shoemaker Levy 9 with Jupiter. The
[3180.0] resulting debris deposited by the plume
[3182.72] on the top of the atmosphere would
[3184.72] increase the opacity and lower the
[3187.04] temperature. We calculate the size of
[3189.52] the comet required and find that a
[3191.599] relatively small fragment of only about
[3193.839] half a kilometer in diameter could be
[3196.72] consistent with the data. We conclude
[3199.44] that plume formation is a byproduct of
[3202.88] small comet impacts that must be added
[3205.839] to the list of significant global
[3208.079] hazards posed by near earth objects.
[3213.119] So let's go on here. In AD 536, an event
[3218.0] occurred which caused significant
[3219.92] climate change. Dendro chronological or
[3223.599] tree ring evidence in oak trees salvaged
[3226.88] from Irish Pete bogs indicates a
[3229.92] sequence of colder than average summers
[3232.319] at this time. And again, it's referring
[3234.16] to our man Mike Bailey. A similar effect
[3238.079] is seen in phenocandian pine trees. This
[3241.119] would be in Scandinavia. And a study of
[3244.0] European oak tree data as a whole shows
[3246.559] that the event starts in 536 and lasts
[3250.16] until
[3251.72] 545. Figure one, which I'll show you in
[3254.72] the next slide, shows the typical
[3256.48] variation in tree ring widths.
[3259.76] North American bristle cone and foxtail
[3262.76] pines, Mongolian tree rings and
[3266.04] Argentinian tree ring data all show the
[3269.599] same effect. So there was something that
[3271.599] happened that was worldwide. The
[3273.92] decrease in rate of growth in these
[3276.079] years corresponds to a global
[3278.559] temperature decrease of up to
[3280.96] approximately 3° centigrade.
[3285.04] In fact, 536 is noted as one of the
[3288.16] coldest two or three years globally in
[3291.599] the last 2,000
[3293.72] years. Figure 2 shows the results for
[3296.319] the Irish oak trees and the US foxtail
[3300.359] pines. Okay, so here we have on the left
[3303.599] we have the dendrochronological data
[3306.079] showing the decreases in rate. So you
[3308.8] can see right here 530 and look what
[3310.8] happens between 536 and 540. You'll see
[3314.48] the tree ring widths here decrease
[3318.04] substantially from their high point down
[3320.64] to this low point right
[3323.24] here. And then this is so this is the
[3325.68] Irish oak trees on the left and on the
[3328.64] right you have US foxtail pine
[3331.64] chronologies. And you can see the same
[3333.839] thing. You can see this precipitous
[3336.119] decline in tree ring width which is
[3339.28] associated with this drop in temperature
[3342.4] global temperature worldwide. Now what's
[3344.88] particularly interesting about this
[3347.72] event 536 to 540 AD is it happens to be
[3353.2] the same dating that's given in the
[3356.88] mythical lit literature about the reign
[3360.799] of King Arthur and the quest for the
[3363.52] Holy Grail. Okay, that's something to
[3366.0] keep in mind
[3367.24] here as we go on.
[3371.44] So in the
[3373.64] next continuing here with the article,
[3376.24] the surprising result of these
[3378.359] calculations is just how small a comet
[3381.119] fragment we have estimated was needed to
[3383.599] cause the observed effects. A comet less
[3387.839] than a kilometer in diameter has not
[3389.92] been previously considered to represent
[3391.92] a global hazard as opposed to a local
[3395.16] hazard, let alone 1 half a kilometer
[3398.64] across. For example, the UK government's
[3401.119] near-Earth object task force classified
[3404.16] impacts from objects in the size range
[3406.319] of 300 to,500 meters to be a large sublo
[3411.76] sub global
[3413.72] hazard and only recommended monitoring
[3417.04] programs of near-earth objects greater
[3420.16] than a kilometer in size. Yet our
[3423.04] estimates show that if plume formation
[3425.2] is a common byproduct of cometary air
[3428.0] bursts, as is believed to be the case,
[3430.559] then a relatively small comet fragment
[3433.119] can have a global impact or effect. A
[3436.64] possible origin for this object could be
[3439.28] the torid meteor stream. This stream is
[3442.48] the result of the fragmentation of a
[3444.319] much larger comet some 20,000 years ago.
[3448.48] The Earth passes through the torid
[3450.319] stream in November and June each year,
[3453.04] resulting in regular meteor showers
[3455.68] normally consisting of microscopic dust
[3459.319] particles. A fragmentation of the stream
[3462.24] is thought to have occurred around 500
[3465.04] and it's referencing Clue and Napier
[3467.2] from 1984. We're going to talk about
[3469.68] their work more in the future. It is
[3472.4] possible that a fragment could then have
[3474.48] collided with earth as it passed through
[3477.2] the beta portion of the stream early in
[3479.72] 536 causing the atmospheric dust bail
[3482.72] event. Now, if you recall from our
[3486.24] discussion about the Tangusa event, the
[3489.04] timing of late June, June 30th, when
[3492.4] that event occurred in its earlier
[3494.799] morning rival time from the direction of
[3497.04] the sun are both consistent with the
[3499.52] timing and the direction of from space
[3502.88] from an which the object would appear
[3506.4] are both consistent with it being a
[3508.16] member of the torid meteor stream. So
[3510.72] they don't present any particular
[3512.96] evidence
[3514.28] here specifically tying it this event in
[3517.599] 536 AD to the torid media stream but may
[3522.0] it's possible and they are speculating
[3524.799] that it's that it's
[3527.96] possible. So anyways, back to King
[3530.88] Arthur. If you recall,
[3533.559] interestingly, the whole quest for the
[3535.68] Grail was that the land was rendered a
[3541.599] wasteland and the Grail was going the
[3544.16] the
[3544.92] the finding of the Grail was going to
[3547.359] restore not only the the the alien king,
[3551.44] but the alien wasteland around as well.
[3554.4] Now, the evidence suggests that this 536
[3557.119] to
[3558.04] 540 545 AD event literally devastated
[3563.92] the landscape of the British Isles over
[3567.2] a long over a broad
[3570.359] period and probably meant there was
[3574.64] cultural collapse, agricultural collapse
[3577.119] and so
[3579.88] on. So, anyways, let's go on with this.
[3582.4] That's something we will come back to.
[3584.04] Again, I've got this list of things that
[3586.559] we're touching upon, but we're going to
[3588.079] come back and we're going to address in
[3589.52] greater detail in upcoming episodes
[3592.079] because this is all of these are
[3593.839] components of a tremendous story
[3598.04] that we're putting together, other
[3600.4] researchers are putting this story
[3601.839] together and realizing that this whole
[3604.839] phenomena of potentially the interaction
[3608.0] between Earth and the
[3609.72] cosmos is embedded into our the legacy
[3613.28] of of our inherited traditions,
[3615.24] including myths and legends, folklore,
[3618.72] and so on, symbolism. And we're going to
[3621.44] be exploring that in depth. And that's
[3623.52] where this really to me gets very
[3625.799] interesting because I think we're going
[3627.68] to have to face the fact that yes, this
[3630.319] has been a a very important component in
[3634.48] the history of our species on this
[3637.28] planet. We're not looking at the
[3639.28] long-term view of humans on the planet
[3640.96] that we now know conservatively is 150
[3644.24] to 200,000 years. We're only looking at
[3646.319] the last 10,000 years here roughly.
[3649.04] Okay? And we're discovering that it's
[3651.599] probably a a
[3653.64] major factor in understanding events
[3657.44] that have transpired here below that
[3659.599] would have had tremendous consequences
[3662.799] for human life ways and societies and so
[3666.559] on.
[3671.599] Okay, so here's the work of Bill
[3674.839] Napier who's done some very important
[3677.119] stuff. This is going back to
[3679.16] 1997. Comet catastrophes, cosmic dust
[3682.559] and ecological disasters in historical
[3685.359] times, the astronomical
[3687.319] framework. This is from the proceedings
[3689.52] of the second society for
[3691.72] interdisciplinary studies, Cambridge
[3694.079] conference 1997.
[3696.799] And he's making reference here back to
[3698.48] the Torid system. He says that the
[3700.72] available data from fireball and comet
[3703.319] observations, meteorite impacts, small
[3706.319] lunar craters, and the current
[3708.0] near-Earth environment are assembled to
[3710.88] yield a coherent picture of the
[3713.04] interface between the Earth and its
[3715.44] current interplanetary environment. The
[3718.48] torid complex of meteors, meteoroids,
[3722.28] asteroids, and comet Anki has probably
[3726.0] been a significant and regularly visible
[3729.04] celestial hazard from the last ice age
[3732.319] through to the present day. These data
[3735.76] lead to the expectation that history has
[3738.48] been punctuated by one tongugustaike
[3742.92] impacts singly or as part of fireball
[3747.48] swarms, freezing events of decadal
[3750.16] duration due to cometary dusting of the
[3753.0] stratosphere and three occasional
[3755.359] disastrous inundations of coastal areas
[3758.96] due to small body ocean impacts.
[3763.44] These are three things to really
[3765.839] consider and keep in mind. Tanguska-like
[3768.559] impacts. Now, we saw a 1908 event was a
[3771.68] single object. However, there's evidence
[3774.079] from the strewn fields and I
[3777.359] eyewitnesses from
[3779.4] from other evidence that these things
[3783.839] can occur in clusters or swarms, if you
[3787.44] will.
[3788.88] when we talked in one of our earlier
[3790.799] episodes about showing how comets are
[3793.839] have now a lot of comets have now been
[3796.24] seen to disintegrate. And again, we'll
[3799.68] be covering all of this in these
[3801.2] upcoming episodes to because what we
[3803.76] want to do is make a a very concise and
[3806.48] coherent presentation of this of this
[3810.319] evidence that in my mind demands a
[3812.96] paradigm shift. So part of one of our
[3815.44] goals here is to try to get this
[3818.16] information and this data collected into
[3820.319] a single source so that one can go
[3823.599] through this material, find links for
[3826.16] further research, in-depth investigation
[3828.559] and so on and start bringing this this
[3832.72] knowledge and this information to the
[3834.4] forefront of our thinking about not only
[3837.52] our past but even perhaps more
[3840.0] importantly our future as a
[3842.079] civilization. Okay, after a little
[3844.64] break, welcome back to the second half
[3847.76] of this podcast dealing with the role of
[3851.92] hypervelocity impacts of various kinds
[3855.039] in human history and through the period
[3858.96] called the holene. So, we're going to
[3861.039] continue looking at some of the
[3862.799] evidence, not all of the evidence that's
[3864.4] out there, but we're going to be
[3865.4] consider continuing to look at the
[3867.52] evidence that there have been more
[3870.0] impacts in the last 10 or 11,000 years
[3874.079] than previously recognized by mainstream
[3876.4] science. So, let's just get right back
[3878.559] into it.
[3888.28] So we have more evidence for holosene
[3894.039] impact. So there's a meteorite impact
[3896.88] crater field that's been almost
[3901.559] certainly imp proven in Bavaria. So this
[3904.72] is just a preliminary report on this
[3907.76] particular event. Let's dive in and take
[3910.96] a little deeper look. This appeared in
[3912.72] the journal Meteoritics and Planetary
[3914.64] Science in
[3916.68] 2005. As it says, the abstract is
[3919.359] available online. I think maybe the
[3921.039] whole article might still be
[3923.16] available. It's worth a read.
[3926.76] So quoting now from the article,
[3929.119] numerous circular depressions north of
[3931.2] Berghausen in eastern Bavaria with
[3933.92] diameters ranging from meters to tens of
[3936.48] meters in size dispersed over an area of
[3939.76] at least 11 by 7 kilometers are
[3943.52] suspected to have an extraterrestrial
[3946.119] origin since they resemble other small
[3949.44] meteorite impact craters. The
[3952.16] depressions are B-shaped, have high
[3954.079] circularity, and a characteristic rim.
[3957.119] Most of them were formed in
[3958.68] unconsolidated glacial gravels and
[3960.92] pebbles intermixed with fine grain sand
[3964.0] and clay. Now, the fact that they were
[3966.359] in glacial gravels and pebbles, then of
[3969.599] course implies that it's younger than
[3972.799] the end of the last ice age, which
[3975.119] deposited those glacial gravels. An
[3978.079] evident archaeological or local
[3979.92] geological explanation for the origin of
[3982.079] the craters does not exist. A World War
[3985.28] I and two explosive which have been
[3987.559] proposed origin can be excluded since
[3990.559] trees with ages exceeding 100 years can
[3993.599] be found in some of the craters. One
[3996.64] crater was described as early as 1909.
[4000.0] Carbon 14 dating of charcoal found in
[4002.4] one crater yielded an age of 7
[4005.88] 1,790 plus or minus 60 years. Hence, a
[4010.0] formation by meteorite impacts that
[4011.92] occurred in Celtic or early medieval
[4014.559] times should be considered. A systematic
[4018.24] archaeological excavation of some
[4020.24] structures and an intensified search for
[4022.799] traces of meteoritic material are
[4024.96] planned. I've not followen up followed
[4027.76] up on that to see what the latest would
[4029.96] be. If any of you listening here are so
[4032.96] inclined, please do that and let me know
[4035.359] what you
[4037.88] find. But let's consider let's go on
[4041.4] here. This appeared in the in the the
[4044.079] magazine The Atlantic popularized
[4046.96] version of some of this by Greg
[4050.119] Easterbrook. And he says that the the
[4053.839] odds that now this is wild stuff here.
[4055.839] The odds that a potentially devastating
[4058.079] space rock will hit Earth this century
[4061.92] maybe as high as 1 in 10. So why isn't
[4065.359] NASA trying harder to prevent
[4066.96] catastrophe? Good
[4068.68] question. Okay. So breakthrough ideas
[4072.24] have a way of seeming obvious in
[4074.559] retrospect. And about a decade ago, a
[4076.559] Columbia University geoysicist named
[4079.2] Dallas Abbott had a breakthrough idea.
[4082.48] She had been pondering the craters left
[4084.64] by comets and asteroids that smashed
[4086.88] into Earth. Geologists had counted them
[4089.76] and concluded space strikes are rare
[4092.16] events and had occurred mainly during
[4095.359] the era of primordial mists. But Abbott
[4099.12] realized this deduction was based on the
[4101.279] number of craters found on land. And
[4104.159] because 70% of Earth's surface is water,
[4107.679] wouldn't most space objects hit the sea?
[4111.44] So she began searching for underwater
[4113.44] crater craters caused by impacts rather
[4116.48] than by other forces such as volcanoes.
[4120.56] What she found is spine chilling
[4124.0] evidence that several enormous asteroids
[4126.4] or comets have slammed into our planet
[4128.48] quite recently. In geologic terms,
[4132.4] Abbott believes that a space object
[4134.159] about 300 meters in diameter, that's
[4137.12] over 1,000 ft. That's many times larger
[4139.359] than Tungusa, hit the Gulf of Carparia,
[4142.88] north of Australia in 536
[4147.0] AD. Now, notice the correlation of
[4150.159] dating events there, right? An object of
[4153.6] that size striking at up to 50,000 mph
[4156.88] could release as much energy as a
[4159.199] thousand nuclear bombs. Now, we know
[4161.92] that the energy release of a thousand
[4163.92] nuclear bombs is going to have global
[4166.799] consequences.
[4168.4] No
[4169.159] doubt we're, you know, the term nuclear
[4172.679] winter came about because scientists in
[4176.88] the 80s were studying the effects of
[4179.92] cosmic impacts and realizing that the
[4183.08] fires, the the initial fires, the
[4186.56] secondary fires, the dust loading of the
[4189.199] atmosphere and so on would cause a
[4192.56] precipitous decline in global
[4194.76] temperature. And that would lead to what
[4197.12] they called the cosmic winter. That in
[4199.36] turn led to the realization that the
[4202.719] detonation of a substantial number of
[4205.28] nuclear weapons would have the same
[4208.08] effect. And that is something we need to
[4210.32] be very concerned with. And there's a
[4212.239] there's an implication to all of this
[4213.76] that I think needs to be emphasized.
[4217.32] Right now, before we do that, I just
[4220.239] want you to notice down here 300 m is
[4222.56] 492 ft. And that's about 280 times the
[4226.239] volume of the Tundusa object. Right now,
[4229.44] now here's the thing that we we have to
[4231.92] address as we get into this idea that
[4234.56] cosmic impacts during our own historic
[4236.88] times may be way more common than we'd
[4240.0] previously expected. And we now know
[4241.92] that there have been, and I'm going to
[4244.159] be presenting this in one of the next
[4246.64] episodes, the number of fireball
[4249.52] explosions that have been documented by
[4251.6] the Department of Defense. Now the
[4254.4] concern and it's a it's a very
[4256.32] legitimate concern is that in times of
[4260.64] heightened international tension such as
[4263.76] we're entering right now as we as you
[4267.199] know the the Biden administration is
[4269.76] pushing us into an escalating war
[4272.4] against Russia is that during these
[4274.64] times of heightened tension if there's a
[4277.92] fireball case and and this has actually
[4280.88] happened historically number of fireball
[4284.08] events have actually been mistaken for
[4286.719] nuclear missile launches. Now, this is
[4289.44] something to keep in mind that nobody's
[4291.28] talking about this. I mean, there's no
[4293.28] not no mention of this during the
[4295.04] debates the other night that we saw.
[4297.52] Neither of the Republicans, maybe a few
[4299.6] of the Republicans are are addressing
[4301.92] this. I don't see any Democrats at all
[4303.92] because they're fully on board again
[4306.88] with the anthropogenically caused
[4309.679] climate crisis. We know that they're
[4312.32] pushing for roughly over the next 10
[4314.239] years to spend a trillion dollars or
[4317.52] more on remediation for a completely
[4320.159] contrived climate crisis, which again,
[4323.52] not even part of the debate, but it
[4325.679] needs to be part of the public debate
[4328.0] that we need to have. And we're going to
[4329.6] be having that debate in this podcast.
[4332.88] We're going to be discussing these
[4334.239] things in depth because they need to be
[4336.159] discussed, not ignored, not pushed under
[4340.0] the carpet, not put on the shelf in the
[4342.32] closet and closed the closet door. These
[4345.04] need to be in the forefront of our
[4347.6] policies and our decision making going
[4350.48] forward. I would like to mention that
[4352.719] one of our original sponsors at
[4355.08] Cosmographia, CBD from the Gods, is
[4358.239] following us here to our new podcast,
[4360.4] Squaring the Circle. As many of you
[4362.88] know, I've been using their products for
[4364.56] going on four years now. And having
[4367.36] tried a number of CBD brands, CBD from
[4370.719] the gods seems the most effective for my
[4373.199] needs, which is primarily as a sleep aid
[4376.159] and as a remedy for inflammation and
[4378.64] associated pain. I use both the oil and
[4382.48] the sav. My wife also likes their
[4385.28] products, especially the SAV, which
[4387.04] alleviates the pain in her hands, which
[4389.6] is the result of working for years as an
[4391.96] electrician. If you've been thinking
[4393.84] about trying a CBD product and
[4395.84] experiencing the benefits for yourself,
[4398.48] give CBD from the gods a try. To learn
[4401.92] more and see their product line, check
[4404.719] out
[4407.239] CBDrothegods.com. Any purchase of their
[4409.6] products helps our efforts here at
[4411.52] Squaring the Circle to realize our goal
[4414.48] of making this world a better place.
[4417.44] Thanks. This is now discussing this is
[4420.08] again from 2004 from the lunar and
[4422.88] planetary science number
[4425.56] 35. They have conferences every year.
[4428.88] Sand lobes on Steuart Island as probable
[4432.08] impact tsunami deposits. So if you have
[4435.199] an impact obviously into land, it's
[4437.28] going to produce one type, one suite of
[4440.96] potential effects and consequences, it's
[4443.44] going to be very different signature
[4444.88] from one into the ocean. Into the ocean,
[4447.679] you're going to have two primary
[4449.36] effects. One is going to
[4452.44] be the injection of large amounts of
[4455.6] water vapor into the upper levels of the
[4458.28] atmosphere, which then will circulate
[4460.64] around and rain out over a period of
[4462.719] days to weeks, causing torrential
[4465.88] rainfalls wherever the the plume of
[4469.76] water
[4470.76] vapor moves to. And the other effect is
[4474.4] going to be largecale tsunamis. That's
[4476.96] what we're going to look at here. And
[4479.44] it's only going to be a brief
[4480.48] introduction to this this phenomena of
[4483.199] tsunamis. There's whole new literature
[4486.08] and scientific understanding of tsunamis
[4488.719] that's underway right now. Tsunamis are
[4491.36] an underrated hazard. About 500 years
[4494.0] ago, a cosmogenic tsunami produced a
[4496.4] minimum runup, get this, 130
[4499.48] m. 130 m. Let's convert that to feet.
[4504.159] And that works out to be about almost
[4506.239] 500
[4507.239] ft in Jervis Bay near Sydney, Australia.
[4511.28] The probable source crater for this
[4513.12] event is Mahuika Crater at 48.3 south
[4518.56] latitude and 166.4 east longitude on the
[4523.04] western edge of New Zealand shelf.
[4525.76] Mahuika impact crater is 20 plus or
[4529.04] minus 2 km in diameter. That's about 12
[4532.239] to 13 miles in diameter. So that's a
[4534.96] pretty substantial crater. Anything
[4537.04] causing a crater that large is going to
[4538.88] have global
[4540.52] effects. And it's less than a thousand
[4543.12] years
[4544.28] old. It has a tectite field that is
[4547.199] found in surface sediments located to
[4549.6] the southeast of the
[4551.56] crater. Tectites are primapacia evidence
[4554.64] of impact origin. We'll when one of
[4558.08] these upcoming EV episodes that I'm keep
[4560.96] referring to, we're going to look at
[4562.4] impact proxies in more detail. The
[4565.719] microsphererals, the aridium deposits,
[4569.199] platinum deposits, platinum group metal
[4571.8] deposits, magnetic grains,
[4575.32] tectites, microactites, and so on. and
[4578.239] the shock warts, the various types of
[4581.52] proxies that we can use to determine
[4584.32] that there was in fact a hypervelocity
[4587.159] impact. Although Jervis Bay is over 1500
[4590.239] km from the Mahuika crater, Steuart
[4592.48] Island is only about 200 km northeast of
[4595.52] that crater. Consequently, the tsunami
[4598.0] runups from the Mahika impact should be
[4600.159] higher on Stewart Island than in Jervis
[4602.8] Bay. We are conducting a field survey in
[4605.52] February 2004 to determine if the
[4607.76] maximum elevations of the sand lobes
[4610.4] represent tsunami runup or windb blown
[4613.04] deposition.
[4614.8] Now, what's interesting here is that
[4617.6] again the you have sort of the
[4619.679] catastrophist wing on one side and you
[4621.76] have the gradualist wing on the other
[4623.36] side who've been arguing that these the
[4628.159] these phenomena that I'm about to show
[4630.08] you some examples of here is caused by
[4632.88] wind and not water. And I think we can
[4636.239] demonstrate pretty conclusively that
[4638.239] they are that they're definitely the
[4641.08] depositional consequences of great
[4643.52] tsunami runups. So in preparation for
[4646.8] our field program, we have obtained
[4648.719] orthographic aerial photo coverage of
[4651.04] the field area. The aerial photos show
[4653.679] many sand lobes that run roughly west to
[4656.159] east but meander along the strike. Now
[4659.44] this was in 2004. We now have Google
[4662.8] Earth with updated imagery. So, I'm not
[4665.04] using the orthographic aerial photos.
[4667.84] I'm using Google Earth because they're
[4669.84] much more much more impressive.
[4674.76] So, Edward Bryant, he's one of the key
[4677.44] researchers
[4678.76] in the effects of great
[4681.32] tsunamis. This is from the journal of
[4684.56] the Siberian Federal University,
[4686.64] Engineering and Technologies.
[4688.44] Interestingly, some of this stuff has to
[4690.88] be published in the foreign press
[4693.12] because of the conservative nature of
[4695.64] the western and American press which is
[4698.64] still dominated by the gradualists and
[4701.52] those who are you know dedicated
[4705.32] to avoiding the implications of
[4708.4] catastrophe in earth and human history.
[4711.679] But we have here this this paper was
[4715.36] entitled tsunami chronology supporting
[4717.6] late holysine
[4719.56] impacts. Let's take a look. So the
[4722.64] holene impact working group has
[4725.679] identified the location of at least
[4728.32] eight impacts into the world's oceans in
[4730.8] the late holene. Each of these was
[4733.52] capable of generating a large tsunami
[4736.0] that should have left a geological
[4738.0] footprint on adjacent adjacent
[4741.08] shorelines. We have identified from
[4743.36] shoreline tsunami deposits five known
[4746.32] impact events. Two of which are
[4748.88] associated with impact craters
[4751.199] identified by the holysine in impact
[4754.0] working group. The other three are
[4756.159] associated with legends and historical
[4758.8] descriptions.
[4760.4] This paper presents the chronology of
[4762.8] tsunami events in New South Wales and
[4766.159] Western Australia on opposite coasts of
[4768.8] Australia and in the UK that are linked
[4772.56] to impact
[4774.28] events. So, we'll take a brief look at
[4776.84] this. Here's New Zealand. Here's what is
[4779.679] referred to as the Mahika Crater. Here's
[4781.84] Steuart Island. You can see it's right
[4783.76] off of the south coast of the southern
[4787.84] island of New Zealand.
[4789.92] Okay. And in the next episode, I'll show
[4793.12] you an example of the kinds of
[4795.4] things like this would be a microactite.
[4798.32] It was found in a dredge that was formed
[4801.76] from the ocean bottom near between
[4805.199] Stewart Island and the Mahika crater.
[4807.84] There's many examples of the finding of
[4810.4] similar
[4811.719] things. So, this is what we call a
[4814.52] microtectite. Let's take another look
[4816.48] here. So, here's Steuart Island off the
[4818.32] southern tip of New
[4822.04] Zealand. And here we have a closerup
[4824.88] view. And you can see here each of these
[4827.679] numbered 1 through six represent tsunami
[4831.199] runup deposits. Right. So, we're going
[4834.32] to take a closer look at some of
[4838.84] those. Let's just scroll on here and see
[4841.6] what we got. Okay. Here's Sand Lobes on
[4845.44] Steuart Island. Now, this is where you
[4847.199] can see the tsunami runup has washed up
[4850.4] and deposited sand. So, the water runs
[4852.96] up, deposits it sand, and then flows
[4856.08] back into the ocean. So, you can see
[4858.96] down here, this is 100
[4861.4] m scale down here. So, this is about
[4864.719] 1,000 ft inland, but this isn't even the
[4867.92] most impressive. Let's go to the next
[4871.159] one. Here you see sand lobe deposit
[4873.92] number four. This is number three. So if
[4876.48] you go right up here, you can see this
[4878.159] smaller one right here. Number three is
[4881.199] this one. And then number four and five,
[4885.199] you see down here. So here's number
[4888.92] four, sand lobe deposit. And you can see
[4891.92] here the scale bar down here is about
[4894.32] 200 m. So this is probably close to a
[4898.4] mile inland. And you can see that the
[4900.48] water has run up right over this ridge.
[4903.44] The tsunami has run up right over this
[4905.44] ridge and down the other side. And then
[4908.64] when it drained off, it left all of this
[4911.44] material here in its
[4915.719] wake. Okay, so here you see four and
[4918.159] then you see five. So here is a closer
[4921.36] up view of
[4923.08] five. And again, look at the bar down
[4926.32] here is about 1,000 ft. So this is close
[4930.4] to 2 miles inland. So this would have
[4933.28] been a very large tsunami wave making
[4936.4] landfall
[4939.32] here. So here you can see four and five
[4942.08] from kind of a a more distal
[4947.96] view. And this is interesting
[4951.0] because some of you have been watching
[4953.28] my my presentations and stuff are going
[4955.76] to know what imated boulders are. These
[4958.639] are boulders that have been stacked up
[4960.32] by water. Now this is on the little west
[4963.84] island. It's about 25 ft above sea
[4966.719] level, Gulf of Carperia. So this would
[4969.679] have been a tsunami in the a
[4975.719] Australia. And you can see here that
[4978.96] that basically ripped up these boulders
[4981.44] and dumped them on the shoreline and
[4983.84] left them stacked up in
[4986.36] this imation it's called where they're
[4988.96] stacked like this. Here's another view
[4991.719] of the same thing. You can see again
[4994.239] here at the base of this cliff. These
[4995.84] boulders did not come from this cliff.
[4998.239] These boulders were ripped up from the
[5000.48] bedrock some distance off the coastline
[5005.36] and washed ashore by a giant wave, a
[5008.639] tsunami wave that then dumped them
[5013.08] here. And then here's a on the island of
[5016.32] Tongas. Here's a giant tsunami deposited
[5019.44] boulder. I don't know the origin of this
[5021.199] one, but we are going to be looking in
[5023.679] in our comprehensive overview of
[5025.84] catastrophism. We will most definitely
[5027.92] be including in-depth investigations of
[5030.56] all this new incredible research that's
[5032.56] coming out about tsunamis and the scale
[5035.36] of some tsunamis in the past. I mean,
[5038.159] this is a huge huge boulder right here.
[5040.8] And you have to just try to imagine the
[5043.12] power of the wave that could bring this
[5045.44] thing ashore and deposit it. Okay. Now
[5049.28] the the argument is that that a tsunami
[5052.8] wave of this magnitude is beyond that
[5056.719] that one would be expected to result as
[5060.32] a consequence of an earthquake or a
[5062.08] seismic event. Right? This is something
[5065.84] that's perhaps in a in a separate
[5067.84] category of tsunami which then leads one
[5070.4] to like what uh Bryant said in this
[5074.76] earlier slide that I just showed is that
[5078.159] it's likely that waves of this magnitude
[5081.6] are produced by impacts of you know
[5084.48] asteroids or comets into the ocean.
[5089.12] So here's some of the work of Dallas
[5091.36] Abbott using depth sea core samples to
[5093.679] verify the sources of holysine age mega
[5096.56] tsunami
[5097.639] deposits. Although conventional
[5099.52] astronomy suggests that large greater
[5101.84] than one in one kilometer impactors hit
[5104.08] the earth once every 3,000 300,000
[5106.96] years. We have assembled evidence for at
[5109.52] least three large oceanic impacts during
[5112.8] the last 11,000 years. The 1.5 km deluge
[5118.199] comet produced the 29 km Burkel crater
[5122.639] which is astronomically estimated to be
[5125.4] 4,800 years old. Now this has actually
[5128.0] been redated since this to be several
[5130.719] thousand years older. We'll be coming
[5133.12] back to this in these upcoming
[5137.32] episodes. This and particularly when we
[5140.159] talk about the traditions of myths,
[5142.96] legends and stories and so on. We're
[5145.04] going to look at some of these stories
[5146.159] of great floods, particularly even the
[5148.96] biblical flood, which you know, a
[5152.32] circumstantial case can be made that it
[5154.239] might have been the result of a major
[5156.4] impact into the Indian
[5158.52] Ocean. And this is where the Burkel
[5160.8] crater is found. The impact may be
[5163.52] responsible for ancient legends about
[5165.52] torrential rainfall, hurricane force
[5168.159] winds, and coastal mega tsunamis. The
[5170.88] deluge was followed by a period of dim
[5173.28] sunlight and colder climate. Around 1440
[5176.639] plus or minus 15 years
[5179.639] a approximately 1 km cometary impactor
[5183.76] produced the 20 km Mahuika crater off
[5187.44] the coast of New Zealand. This impact
[5190.239] may have produced 130 meter runups in
[5193.679] Jervis Bay, Australia and may have
[5196.239] caused the Mayori to move inland. We
[5199.04] have also found a pair of craters in the
[5200.88] Gulf of Carparia that are 18 and 12 km
[5204.0] in diameter. This impact may have
[5206.04] produced 130 meter run-ups in Jervis
[5208.719] Bay, Australia, and may have caused the
[5211.52] Mayori to move inland. And also, the
[5213.76] Mayori have some very interesting
[5215.36] traditions about floods themselves. We
[5218.32] have also found a pair of craters in the
[5219.92] Gulf of Carparia that are 18 and 12 km.
[5224.08] 18 kilometers that's going to
[5226.84] be close to close to 10 miles. 12 km
[5231.04] that's going to be close to 7 or 8 miles
[5233.28] in diameter and appear to date again 536
[5237.52] plus or - 200 years AD. If so, their
[5241.199] source bolide was over 600 m in
[5244.159] diameter. In addition, we have candidate
[5246.719] impacts events. Impact events in the
[5249.12] Mediterranean Sea, the North Atlantic,
[5252.0] the North Sea, off the coast of Vietnam,
[5255.44] off the China Korean border, on the
[5257.679] Kgulian plateau in the Caribbean, and
[5260.159] off the coast of Denmark. Now, the one
[5261.84] off the coast of Denmark could be very
[5264.239] much associated with the 536 AD as well
[5268.32] as the Gulf of Carparia one. If that's
[5271.52] the case, we now
[5273.56] got very closely clustered impacts both
[5277.28] in the northern and
[5279.88] hemisphere that could have led to some
[5282.88] of the legends about the wasteland and
[5284.8] so on that we're going to be talking
[5286.08] about. There's a distinct possibility
[5288.4] that the equatorial that is between 30°
[5290.96] north and 30° south candidate impact
[5293.44] events may be related to the climate
[5295.76] downturns that are recorded in tree ring
[5298.0] rec records. The formation of the
[5300.639] Vietnam crater may have produced a rain
[5302.56] of dust that is described in the Chinese
[5304.8] historical record and is inferred to be
[5307.44] related to a major climate downturn.
[5310.639] There was a major historical dust event
[5313.199] veil event that lasted for 18 months
[5315.84] during the 536 and 537 AD that may be
[5320.56] related to the 536 to 541 AD period of
[5323.92] colder climate. Neither of these dust
[5326.88] veil events is associated with a
[5328.719] volcanic eruption. Now, this is
[5330.4] important because this might be the
[5331.679] alternative explanation. But if there's
[5333.92] no evidence of volcanoes erupting,
[5338.04] then then what are we left with? We're
[5340.56] probably left with with impacts. Using
[5343.84] deep sea core samples to verify a crater
[5346.239] candidate for the climate downturn
[5348.0] lasting from 536 to 545 AD, we have
[5352.239] collected data from the JISP 2 core.
[5354.639] This is the Greenland ice sheet project
[5356.639] 2 core ice core confirming that the
[5359.679] layers dated from 536 AD to 542 AD
[5363.04] contain high abundances of impact ejecta
[5366.08] within the samples we have examined so
[5368.0] far. There are two apparent peaks in the
[5370.0] abundance of impact ejecta. The most
[5372.639] recent around 541 plus or minus 2 AD.
[5376.32] This layer contains a radioaran fragment
[5379.04] impact glass and silicut impact
[5381.36] sphirerals. This suite could be produced
[5384.0] by a marine impact event. Because all
[5387.199] dust falls out of the atmosphere after 4
[5389.76] years, our data require at least two
[5392.719] impact events. And again, this could be
[5395.12] the one off the coast of Denmark and the
[5397.199] one off the Gulf of
[5399.4] Carparia. Mike Bailey believes that a
[5401.76] large impact occurred near Ireland
[5403.6] around 540 AD. The impact produced
[5406.639] atmospheric effects ses and lakes and
[5409.84] narrowest rings in trees in northern
[5411.92] Europe. Bondic and others at Al found
[5415.6] evidence of a tsunami generating event
[5417.6] in the North Sea around 1500 years ago.
[5420.96] And we have found a crater candidate
[5423.44] Grenle that fits the possible source
[5426.159] area of their North Sea tsunami.
[5429.52] And here we're going to look at a
[5430.719] baometric map showing where Grenle the
[5433.679] location of Grenle just off the coast of
[5437.08] Norway. A is a baometric map showing the
[5440.32] Grenle Crater candidate. You can see
[5442.56] right here in the blue
[5444.76] circle. B is the direction to the source
[5448.0] of the tsunami. Look at this arrow right
[5450.92] here. Right? So this is showing the
[5453.92] direction from which a tsunami came.
[5459.199] A, B, and C. Notice here B up
[5465.56] here and both of those here. And where
[5469.12] is C on here? Okay. So, yeah. So, here's
[5472.639] A, B, and C. So, look at the direction
[5475.52] now. So, this is showing the direction
[5478.239] from which the tsunami came that has now
[5481.12] been documented on the shores of the UK
[5484.88] and up here. and then off the coast of
[5488.84] Denmark. So, I don't know what's found
[5491.44] on Norway, but you know, a lot of this
[5494.48] is initial work that hasn't been
[5496.08] followed up on simply because the the
[5500.08] funding is not available for this kind
[5502.4] of work. This is one of the one of the
[5504.4] points that Graeme Hancock and the
[5506.08] members of the cosmic uh the comet
[5508.639] research group have made over and over
[5510.239] again is that mostly this is funding
[5513.12] that's having to come out of pocket from
[5515.04] these researchers because the hundreds
[5517.44] of billions of dollars are not going to
[5519.679] this kind of research. It's going to
[5522.08] make the case that humans are the cause
[5524.4] of all climate change. And this is one
[5527.199] of the things that I've harped on over
[5528.719] and over again for years now and is
[5530.8] something that under a Harris presidency
[5534.8] is going to continue on. She's already
[5537.12] talked about the the enormous amount of
[5539.679] money she plans to spend on remediating
[5543.04] a climate crisis that doesn't exist. And
[5546.4] you can take issue with that, but we
[5548.08] will definitely be addressing this whole
[5550.6] issue in upcoming episodes. So stay
[5554.0] tuned for that.
[5556.92] Let's wrap up here. We'll look at a
[5559.44] couple more slides, then we're going to
[5560.639] wrap up this
[5563.8] episode. This is evidence from that
[5567.36] Burkel crater
[5569.639] that was dating to about 4,800 years ago
[5572.719] that I said looks like it's actually a
[5574.48] little older. And there are three great
[5578.28] runups that have been now discovered
[5580.719] here and documented.
[5582.8] Fam, phenamosi chevron, ampalaza
[5586.48] chevron, and the faux cap chevron. Now,
[5588.639] a chevron, you know, is sort of a
[5590.84] V-shaped. Canadian geese fly in chevron
[5594.52] formations. Sergeant stripes are
[5597.239] chevrons. And chevrons seem to be when
[5600.56] you have a a an overwash of a tsunami
[5604.88] depositing material by
[5607.88] the inland flow and then the outland se
[5611.199] back seawward flow. It shapes what would
[5613.76] normally be simply current ripples,
[5616.239] giant current ripples into these chevron
[5618.48] formations. And you're going to see here
[5620.239] in a second what they look like. So this
[5623.12] shows the the location of the Burkel
[5625.36] impact crater. Australian chevrons are
[5628.48] on this side and Madagascar chevrons
[5631.84] over here. And we're going to be looking
[5634.08] we're again we're going to be devoting
[5635.76] at least one maybe two episodes to
[5638.639] unpacking this whole phenomena of
[5640.639] gigantic tsunamis in the past. And uh
[5644.4] when we do that we're going to be
[5645.6] looking at the evidence for possible
[5649.199] impact produced tsunamis. Anyways,
[5652.159] here's the location of the Burkel
[5653.6] Crater. We're going to just for this to
[5656.0] conclude this episode, we're going to
[5657.36] look at the the evidence for tsunami
[5659.84] runups here right on the south coast of
[5662.12] Madagascar. So, let's go to the next
[5664.44] slide. And here you can see a giant
[5666.88] gigant giant tsunami deposits on the
[5669.44] southwest coast of Madagascar. This is
[5671.36] the Ampalaza group. If I go back here,
[5674.56] you'll see the Ampalaza chevron is right
[5677.44] here. In the middle you have the phenam
[5680.0] fan phenamoszi chevron and down here you
[5683.44] have the faux cap chevron. So this is
[5686.0] looking at a closer up of
[5688.679] the amplaza and you can see right here
[5691.92] the
[5693.08] runup the great wave came up here and
[5696.88] then flowed back down. You can see the
[5699.52] enormous amount of sand from
[5701.88] the overwash of the wave here.
[5706.8] There's more up here, but we're going to
[5708.88] zoom in here and take a closer
[5711.0] look. So, here you
[5714.679] see the quote. Scientists in the working
[5717.36] group say the evidence for such impacts
[5719.36] during the last 10,000 years known as
[5721.36] the holysine epoch is strong enough to
[5723.36] overturn current estimates of how often
[5725.6] the earth suffers a violent impact on
[5728.239] the order of a 10 megat ton explosion
[5731.04] instead of once in 500,000 to 1 million
[5733.6] years as astronomers now calculate
[5735.52] catastrophic impacts could happen every
[5738.4] few thousand years. Now, since this was
[5741.36] written, the evidence has continued to
[5744.04] accumulate that the this is a more
[5747.36] realistic time scale every few thousand
[5750.08] years. Now, take a look at this giant
[5752.48] wave deposit here. You can see the
[5755.04] chevrons. You can see the water washed
[5757.56] in. Then, right up here where it
[5760.08] reversed, it it deposited the finer
[5762.32] grain sandy sediment and then it flowed
[5764.96] back out. And this this backflow
[5767.199] seawward is what shaped what would have
[5769.52] been current ripples into these chevron
[5772.0] shapes. So first you had the water
[5774.0] coming in, then you had the water
[5775.84] flowing out. Okay, let's look at the
[5779.04] next
[5779.719] one. So this is the fan phantomi group
[5783.6] of chevrons. And what's interesting
[5786.679] here, and this is really driving home
[5789.04] the magnitude of these waves. You can
[5790.88] see all along here the waves washing up.
[5793.679] You can see the chevrons all the way up
[5795.84] into this area. There was a the huge
[5798.639] major wave that made landfall came all
[5800.96] the way up here. There's an escarment
[5803.52] all along here. And we can see that
[5805.28] there are wave deposits not only on the
[5808.48] coastal lower land here, but on the
[5811.44] upper area above the escarment, which we
[5813.84] see very clearly delineated along here.
[5816.88] It's much clearer down here than it is
[5819.52] right here because the escarment, when
[5821.199] that wave hit the escarment, it pretty
[5823.679] much obscured it with both erosion and
[5826.48] deposition of of the material that was
[5830.0] being washed ashore in the
[5832.04] wave. Okay, let's go to the next one.
[5835.119] And here you can see clearly from above
[5838.639] that the major wave came made landfall
[5841.04] here. This is the escarment. Now, this
[5843.76] red box right here is
[5847.28] going to show you there's a a photograph
[5849.119] taken by Dallas Abbott that's coming up
[5851.199] here which is looking at the escarment
[5855.199] and you can get a sense of how huge this
[5858.0] wave had to have
[5859.719] been. Let's go to this one here. You can
[5862.32] see again here's the
[5864.04] escarment or the fault scarp. There's a
[5866.48] fault line right along here and you can
[5868.88] see the wave washed up here on top. And
[5871.92] you'll notice that the deposition is
[5873.44] different. Why? because well most of the
[5875.92] material was deposited on the lower the
[5878.32] lower lands on the coastal side of the
[5881.239] escarment and finer material deposited
[5884.639] on the top end. Now going back again at
[5887.92] this red box the the photograph I'm
[5890.719] about to show you is looking north here
[5893.36] at this section right here at the
[5896.48] escarment and here you can see it. So
[5899.119] here's this looking northwest showing
[5901.76] the fault scarp separating the elevated
[5904.08] plateau region portion of the phenamosi
[5907.679] chevron from the lower
[5909.88] part the lower coastal plane. The near
[5912.4] cliff encompasses chevron deposits that
[5915.119] are continuous on the coastal plane and
[5917.92] discontinuous along 9 km of the uplifted
[5920.8] wall of the fault scarp. The far cliff,
[5923.76] this one here, has ubiquitous chevron
[5926.56] deposits extending from the coastal
[5928.56] plane down here to the top of the
[5933.239] elevated plateau. So the height here,
[5937.52] again, this is that um huge runup wave
[5940.48] of of 130 m minimum, and we
[5945.159] calculated 130
[5947.0] m
[5948.52] was over was up to like 450 ft. So you
[5952.239] got to picture the the magnitude of this
[5954.48] wave that made landfall that was able to
[5957.28] over top the fault scarp here. This was
[5960.88] an enormous wave and anything that would
[5963.36] have been along this coastal region here
[5966.48] in the vicinity of this wave making
[5968.8] landfall would be completely erased 100%
[5972.239] from existence. We've already looked at
[5974.239] this. The ancient I think well no this
[5976.48] was actually an article that appeared in
[5977.92] the New York Times and this is where
[5979.679] we're going to end it for this episode.
[5982.719] At the southern end of Madagascar life
[5985.119] lie four enormous wedge-shaped sediment
[5988.44] deposits called chevrons that are
[5991.04] composed of material from the ocean
[5992.719] floor. Each covers twice the area of
[5995.199] Manhattan with sediment as deep as the
[5997.84] Chrysler building is high. On close
[6001.36] inspection, the chevron deposits contain
[6003.679] deep ocean microossils that are fused
[6006.719] with a medley of metals typically formed
[6010.08] by cosmic impacts. And all of them point
[6013.199] in the same direction toward the middle
[6015.199] of the Indian Ocean, where a newly
[6016.96] discovered crater 18 mi in diameter lies
[6020.52] 12,500 ft below the surface. The
[6024.159] explanation is obvious to some
[6026.159] scientists. A large asteroid or comet,
[6028.719] the kind that could kill a quarter of
[6030.4] the world's
[6031.639] population. Get that? A quarter of the
[6033.92] world's population, smashed into the
[6036.48] Indian Ocean 4,800 years ago, producing
[6039.84] a tsunami at least 600 ft high, about 13
[6043.76] times as big as the one that inundated
[6045.84] Indonesia nearly 2 years ago, which was
[6048.4] would have been
[6049.88] 2004. The wave carried the huge deposits
[6052.8] of sediment to land. Most astronomers
[6055.6] doubt that any large comets or asteroids
[6057.84] have crashed into the Earth in the last
[6060.0] 10,000 years. But the self-described
[6062.88] band of misfits that make up the
[6065.36] 2-year-old Hollisine impact working
[6067.84] group say the astronomers simply have
[6070.48] not known how or where to look for
[6072.639] evidence of such impacts along the
[6075.119] world's shorelines and in the deep
[6077.84] oceans. Scientists in the working group
[6080.48] say the evidence for such impacts during
[6082.32] the last 10,000 years, known as the
[6084.159] Hollisine epoch, is strong enough to
[6086.8] overturn current estimates of how often
[6089.52] the Earth suffers a violent impact on
[6092.719] the order of a 10 megaton
[6095.32] explosion. Instead of once in 500,000 to
[6098.639] 1 million years, as astronomers now
[6100.48] calculate, catastrophic impacts could
[6102.8] happen every few thousand years. To
[6106.32] reiterate that point, the last slide I
[6108.96] think we'll look at here is a giant
[6111.36] tsunami deposited erratic on India near
[6115.36] Mahabala Purum about 30 mi south of
[6118.719] Shennai on the eastern side of the Dean
[6121.679] Peninsula. This could be
[6124.44] also a deposit and evidence of the the
[6128.56] Burkel Crater
[6130.92] tsunami. We'll leave it off for there.
[6133.199] In the next episode, we're going to
[6134.719] continue with our looking
[6138.36] at myth
[6142.6] mythology
[6146.679] and looking at mythology and legends and
[6150.48] folklore and so on. This one that I just
[6153.199] pulled up here is interesting because
[6156.239] this Tongusca-sized air burst that
[6158.88] destroyed Tal Ham, the middle bronze age
[6162.119] city, has all the earmarks of being the
[6165.04] source of the legend of Sodom and
[6167.92] Gomorrah. So, we will pick up this in
[6171.28] the next episode where we start dealing
[6174.239] with the lore that we've inherited from
[6178.159] our ancestors in the past because it it
[6182.08] has been commented in fact some of the
[6183.92] the critics I've gotten when I've been
[6186.32] presenting this particularly a few years
[6188.96] ago 5 10 years or longer ago. Well, if
[6192.32] there was all of this evidence that that
[6195.36] uh impacts, hypervelocity impacts had
[6198.88] affected earlier cultures and earlier
[6201.4] civilizations, well, then we would have
[6203.44] a much more extensive record of it.
[6206.04] Well, my response now to to that those
[6209.44] critics back then and now is simply
[6211.44] this. We do have the record. We do have
[6213.36] the record. You're just not
[6214.56] interpretating it properly. What you
[6216.639] have to understand is that that the that
[6218.96] the myths, the legends, the folklore,
[6221.28] the symbols that have been used within
[6224.239] these stories, that's the record. That's
[6227.52] the record right there. And it's very
[6230.76] extensive. And to me is one of the most
[6233.52] interesting parts of the study of this
[6235.36] whole phenomena. And if you've been
[6237.52] following these episodes up to this
[6239.36] point, I am hoping that you've got a
[6240.96] good solid foundation now. And if you
[6244.159] don't, please go back and rewatch some
[6246.48] of the the earlier episodes where we
[6248.56] talk about Tangusa, where we talk about
[6250.239] near misses, where we talk about some of
[6252.0] these things, then when we look at the
[6255.28] legacy of the ancient traditions, you
[6257.44] might see it with new eyes. And once you
[6260.4] realize that the whole language in which
[6263.36] these experiences have been encoded is
[6265.92] the language of symbolism. It's the
[6267.679] language of
[6269.0] myth, then I think you'll begin to
[6271.28] appreciate that. Yeah, here's a whole
[6272.92] another component of of evidence that
[6277.04] supports this idea that the cosmos have
[6280.0] played a much larger role in our own
[6283.04] history than have been previously
[6284.96] recognized by historians, prehistorians,
[6287.6] archaeologists, and so on. We already
[6290.4] recognize and admit that it's played a
[6292.4] much bigger role in Earth history than
[6294.639] had been imagined a generation, two
[6296.96] generations ago.
[6299.52] In fact, it may play the fundamental
[6301.36] role in Earth history when we talk about
[6303.44] mass extinctions and ice ages and
[6306.0] climate changes
[6307.719] and massive episodes of volcanism and so
[6310.96] on, right? All of these things are now
[6313.199] being tied into the as consequences of
[6316.48] hypervelocity impact. What we're just in
[6319.119] the very beginning this stages is
[6321.04] recognizing this as a factor in our own
[6323.92] human story on this planet. I think that
[6326.8] needs to be rectified and that's going
[6328.4] to be one of the goals that has
[6330.4] motivated us up to this point and will
[6333.119] continue to motivate us. And we are
[6334.88] going to also be considering some of the
[6337.119] policy and political ramifications of
[6339.36] this new knowledge because it certainly
[6341.199] is not part of the zeitgeist or or the
[6346.08] mental thinking of most of the people in
[6349.28] the political realm. We're also going to
[6352.0] be looking at, and this is a little
[6353.679] further down the line, but the whole
[6356.719] phenomena
[6357.8] of unidentified aerial phenomena or also
[6361.679] unidentified anomalous phenomena as it's
[6364.239] called. And is there a possible
[6366.32] connection or correlation? Because, you
[6369.04] know, again, we're talking about
[6371.199] activity and things that are happening
[6372.719] in the celestial realm in the in the sky
[6375.76] and people's relation to that. Is there
[6378.96] a possible correlation, let's say,
[6381.8] between the kind of phenomena that has
[6384.4] been occurring and has been pretty
[6386.8] solidly documented now up to this point.
[6389.92] Lou Alzando's new book has just been
[6393.08] published that dives into some of this
[6397.159] phenomena. I would submit that there may
[6399.6] be a connection and we can explore that
[6402.4] and will be exploring that in these
[6404.239] upcoming episodes that I keep talking
[6406.08] about. So anyways, I think we'll stop
[6408.08] there for now and we're going to pick
[6409.52] this up again. Let's pick up this thread
[6411.92] diving into the ancient traditions
[6414.679] and mythology and so on. And maybe by
[6418.159] unpacking that, we're going to discover
[6419.679] that there's a whole dimension of
[6421.76] meaning and significance to this legacy
[6424.32] of our inherited wisdom and knowledge of
[6426.56] the past that has been completely
[6428.239] overlooked up to this point. So, I hope
[6429.84] you come back and
[6432.04] and continue on watching this. If you
[6435.92] are so moved, please subscribe. We put
[6439.28] out a newsletter every month that I put
[6442.719] a synopsis of cutting edge scientific
[6444.88] discoveries that might be of interest to
[6446.88] people who watch the Cosmographia
[6448.639] podcast or this podcast. And uh every
[6451.84] month it comes out, we'll soon be
[6453.679] archiving a couple of years worth of
[6455.36] these that will become
[6457.4] available on our new website that's
[6459.76] being built as we speak. So please stay
[6462.0] tuned, come back, check in in the near
[6465.28] future, and we'll have more of this
[6468.0] exciting information to present to you.
[6470.159] Thank you. See you next time.

Title: Egypt’s Dry Deserts Were Shaped by Water
[0.08] This is going back to a standard
[1.639] textbook 1960. So even back as far back
[4.88] as 1960 already by that time becoming
[7.6] apparent to geologists that water had
[10.0] played a very important and profound
[12.0] role in sculpting the landscapes of
[14.32] Egypt. Even though those landscapes now
[17.279] are some of the driest on earth.
[18.8] Although stream floods and sheet floods
[21.439] may be effective agents in the formation
[24.56] of semierid landforms, many deserts bear
[28.4] the imprint of even more significant
[31.439] water action. It seems very doubtful
[34.32] whether the required amount of water
[36.399] ever falls in present conditions and
[39.52] many authorities have attributed such
[41.6] erosion to a wetter period during the
[44.32] pleaene. For example, the valley on the
[47.039] west side of the Nile at Luxor
[50.16] containing the tombs of the kings
[52.32] appears to be a water eroded valley. But
[54.8] the tombs themselves show no signs of
[57.52] destructive water action. This means
[60.079] that water action of any significance
[62.64] probably ceased at least 4,000 years
[66.0] ago. It seems easier to relate landforms
[69.36] in many deserts to earlier wetter
[72.479] periods than to present conditions. Hume
[75.92] gives photograph after photograph of
[78.84] steepsided valleys in limestone and
[82.799] sandstone country in Egypt which are
[85.759] obviously of water cut form which of
[88.0] course then implies very different kind
[90.64] of environment.

Title: The Day the Atlantic Refilled the Mediterranean
[0.08] The Nile is the green part. A lot of
[2.36] Cairo sits on the floor of the Nile
[5.92] Valley. And here you see the edge of the
[8.92] plateau and you see the pyramid complex.
[13.04] And literally, if you go out here and
[15.839] clean this alvium out, you would be on
[18.48] the edge of a canyon that's 8,000 ft
[22.08] deep. You don't picture that, but that
[24.56] is a lot of erosion. How long did that
[27.199] take? How did it happen? had come about
[30.0] that this canyon was created that's, you
[32.559] know, 1500 ft deeper or whatever than
[34.64] the the Grand Canyon. Well, that's an
[36.88] interesting story in itself. Around 6
[39.04] million years ago, the entire
[41.48] Mediterranean dried up. Whatever the
[44.079] explanation for why the Mediterranean
[46.32] dried up. If that water is gone, now
[49.039] what happens is that will accelerate the
[51.2] down cutting. The base level is going to
[53.199] be the depth of the floor of the
[55.039] Mediterranean at the point where the
[57.52] Nile flows in. How is it that that that
[60.559] the entire Mediterranean Sea dried up? I
[63.6] don't know. But the part that really
[65.68] interests me though is the the filling
[67.84] the refilling of the Mediterranean in an
[70.479] event called the Zancan flood. And
[72.799] apparently if I go back over here to the
[75.119] Straits of
[76.2] Gibralar and I zoom in, let's go to
[80.08] this. There was a major breakthrough
[83.439] right here because the Atlantic Ocean
[85.119] was still here but the Mediterranean was
[87.68] gone.
[89.2] So there was this breakthrough right
[91.24] here and 100 million cubic meters per
[95.36] second I think it was the estimate
[97.52] poured through here and it filled the
[100.32] Mediterranean. Ian.

Title: The Nile Made Egypt
[0.08] We're talking here about Egypt. What's
[2.0] being described here is so drastically
[4.56] and dramatically different than what's
[6.879] there now. You look at the aluvial fan
[9.28] here, the delta fan of this material,
[12.08] sedimentary material being carried out
[14.08] here, and it builds this fan-like
[16.24] structure. And you'll notice it's all
[17.76] green. And one reason for that is
[20.56] because as the water of the Nile
[22.56] discharges, it it saturates in to the
[25.88] unconsolidated alovium that forms the
[28.24] fan. So it keeps it moist and green. So
[30.8] this is what made the Egyptian
[34.84] civilization possible was this the Nile
[38.0] River. And it's interesting that the
[40.239] rise of the Old Kingdom follows shortly
[42.719] after this great transition from the
[46.48] green Sahara into the desert Sahara.

Title: The Post-Cold War Power Play
[0.08] full spectrum domination. This was the
[2.399] the military policy conceived by the
[4.759] neocons back during Daddy Bush's year
[8.32] and then brought to fruition during
[10.48] Junior Bush's term from 2000 to 2008.
[14.32] And basically what they needed was a
[17.039] Pearl Harbor type event even
[19.279] acknowledged in the writings of some of
[20.96] the neocon philosophers that included
[23.84] Cheney, Dick Cheney, included Paul
[26.039] Wilfors, a number of others that were
[28.32] the key who who who articulated this
[30.88] whole idea of this plan, this game plan
[33.44] for the new American century, which
[35.68] basically amounted to the US government
[38.079] getting control of global resources.
[40.32] Because remember what happened in the
[42.96] early '90s? Well, the Soviet Union
[45.36] collapsed. So our whole foreign policy,
[47.84] all of our containment, everything was
[49.92] oriented around standing up to this
[52.559] other, you know, what Ronald Reagan
[54.559] called the evil empire, which was the
[56.079] Soviet Union. That's why we created
[58.16] NATO. NATO was part of this policy of
[60.96] Soviet containment that was then going
[63.68] to keep us control of the Middle Eastern
[66.479] oil at that time because Middle Eastern
[68.32] oil was the big source of uh petroleum.
[72.0] And so one reason that Iran became our
[74.24] enemy was because when they overthrew
[76.96] the sha they went to the Soviet camp.
[80.32] However, what they did at that point was
[82.08] they said, "Well, this is our golden
[84.0] opportunity. Our main competitor for
[85.84] global control is out of the way. So why
[88.0] are we going to go back to, you know,
[90.4] within our borders, minding our own
[92.159] business when we can now militarily
[94.159] dominate the planet?

Title: The Planet Warmed 12°C in 3 Years
[0.16] What were some of the hypothesized steps
[2.48] that our surviving ancestors took to
[4.799] survive a 20 to 30° C environmental
[8.32] temperature change and build back a new
[10.88] society? Okay, I don't know of
[13.759] temperature change that extreme,
[15.28] although we're looking at some very
[17.039] extreme. I mean, we're looking at 10 to
[18.8] 12° C, but that's way beyond anything
[22.16] we've experienced in recent times. Yeah.
[25.039] Uh I mean coming out of the little ice
[26.88] age 150 to 200 years ago temperature of
[30.08] the planet has warmed about a degree. So
[32.399] we're looking at warming of 20 times
[35.28] that much. Some of the studies uh based
[38.079] on ice cores, Greenland ice cores,
[40.399] Antarctic ice cores, other kinds of
[42.32] proxy evidence, the time span in which
[45.12] this temperature change occurred has
[47.68] gone from a thousand years to a century,
[50.8] then from a century to a decade, then
[53.199] from a decade to 5 years, and now the
[56.079] latest as we get to this ever more
[58.8] refined temporal resolution like from
[61.52] the studies of ice scores, it's down to
[63.68] 1 to 3 years. So what happened?

Title: The Thunderbolt Legacy
[0.0] The vmana is a flying machine. Look,
[1.6] look it up on your phone right now and
[3.12] you'll see, you know, the other thing is
[4.72] the Vajra. And you see these depictions
[7.12] of the the great king god Indra wielding
[10.4] the Vajra, right? And then this is like
[14.08] from four and 5,000 years ago in Vadic
[17.039] India, right? Then fast forward to like
[20.4] 3,000 to years ago roughly and you see
[23.84] the god Mitra in Persia wielding the
[27.439] Vajra. Then fast forward about another
[30.4] thousand years and in Greece you see you
[32.64] see Zeus wielding the Vajra. It's called
[35.28] the thunder thunderbolt. Zeus wielding
[38.0] the
[38.84] thunderbolt. Then you can see Roman
[41.76] times the god Mithris wielding the
[45.6] thunderbolt. Well, you look at what
[47.68] they're wielding and it's pretty much
[49.6] all the same instrument.

Title: The Sahara Was Green and Then It Wasn’t
[0.08] We're talking here about Egypt. What's
[2.0] being described here is so drastically
[4.56] and dramatically different than what's
[6.879] there now. The supposition here is that
[9.44] migrating humans found this to be a
[12.639] completely hospitable terrain rather
[15.44] than inhospitable and probably in fact
[18.0] occupied this whole region of North
[20.64] Africa which is very interesting because
[22.56] now you have to begin to ask the
[23.76] question well how did it change so
[25.519] quickly which it did because we're
[27.119] looking at a period that might have
[28.72] lasted from 6,000 to maybe 9 or 10,000
[32.48] years ago the humid period. The evidence
[34.64] also shows as we'll go on to look at
[36.32] here that humid period was only like a
[39.12] the most recent phase in an alternating
[42.64] environmental context between desert and
[46.16] temperate region and there have been
[48.0] multiple shifts back and forth is what
[50.0] the evidence is now suggesting. There
[52.079] has had a very very dramatically
[54.48] different environments. The most recent
[56.48] one basically only came to an end around
[58.92] 6,000 to 5,000 years ago. And it's
[62.239] interesting and I'm not sure what the
[64.0] connection would be with that transition
[66.88] between that type of environment into
[69.6] the arid environment that it is now
[72.32] which is then shortly thereafter is the
[74.799] rise of the old kingdom of Egypt. How
[76.96] did it change so quickly?

Title: Are There Structures Beneath the Giza Plateau?
[0.08] I was not intending to remark on these
[2.32] supposed structures uh in the bedrock
[5.12] below Cafre's pyramid, but so many
[6.96] people have been asking me about it. I
[9.12] thought I would shed a little light on
[11.04] the matter by looking at it through the
[12.96] geological perspective. Certainly, it
[15.04] would be exciting if that was real.
[18.08] However, tipping my hat to Carl Sean, uh
[21.199] I've got to agree that uh extraordinary
[23.84] claims require extraordinary proofs. And
[27.279] so I would definitely be requiring uh
[30.64] some serious evidence uh over and above
[34.0] what I've seen so far. And with that in
[38.559] mind, uh I think what I'm going to do
[40.48] though is talk about what could be
[42.16] possible. Let's assume that the the
[44.96] synthetic aperture radar images are not
[47.6] doctorred in any way. It does appear
[49.68] that some kind of a structure exists,
[52.32] but the ambiguity of the images
[54.239] precludes any conclusion as to whether
[56.079] these apparent images or structures are
[59.039] natural or man-made. I'm biased towards
[62.16] the natural. That would seem to suggest
[64.559] the possibility or probability that
[67.68] there would be uh cavities within the
[70.479] limestone bedrock of the Giza plateau.
[73.36] But what we want to look at is the
[75.84] climate over the region of Egypt and its
[79.36] nearest neighbor Libya to the west and
[81.68] in fact for that matter the whole Sahara
[84.479] desert. We don't have to go back too
[86.4] many thousands of years uh when we get
[88.799] to the point where it isn't a desert. In
[90.56] fact it's all almost lush.
[93.88] Biogeeography of the Sahara explain the
[97.6] peopling the peopling of the desert.
[100.479] During the hollosine humid period, the
[103.36] region contained a series of linked
[105.88] lakes, rivers, and inland
[108.6] deltas comprising a large interlin
[113.72] waterway, channeling water and animals
[117.2] into and across the Sahara, thus
[120.479] facilitating these dispersals. The
[122.719] system was last active in the early
[125.2] holosene when many species appear to
[128.479] have occupied the entire Sahara desert
[131.84] and see what this may imply as far as
[134.56] the question of could there be or could
[137.28] there not be structures under the Giza
[140.64] plateau and under the pyramid complex. X

Title: How Wilson’s War Changed Everything
[0.16] What turned the tide of World War I was
[2.56] our own intervention under Woodro
[5.279] Wilson. So we had the Wilson
[7.52] administration, I think we could say,
[8.8] had to have been one of the worst in
[10.88] American history when it comes to the
[12.559] three pillars, peace, freedom, and truth
[14.799] because that's where America really
[16.32] began to switch gears. and his
[18.88] intervention into World War I led to god
[23.119] how many deaths through World War I,
[25.68] World War II, Korea, Vietnam, all of
[28.4] that which grew out of ultimately our
[31.119] intervention into World War I. But this
[34.0] is again, this is not what's generally
[35.92] known now amongst young people because
[38.96] they're not learning history and they're
[41.2] coming out of the education systems
[43.68] having their heads stuffed full of, you
[45.84] know, gender ideology, whatever. Oh my,
[48.719] if I say that, am I transphobic? No, I'm
[50.879] not. I'm just saying we're being fed all
[53.199] of this But what it does is it
[56.079] keeps us distracted from the real
[58.0] issues.

Title: Peace Isn’t Pacifism
[0.16] What are the definitions that you have
[2.08] for the words truth, peace, and freedom?
[5.12] Peace. Okay. Well, peace to me means not
[7.12] necessarily that you're nonviolent, but
[9.2] you're not the aggressor. Now, imagine
[11.2] if every household in America had an had
[14.4] automatic weapons, knew how to use them.
[16.48] Now, you can say, "Oh, oh, no guns
[18.4] everywhere, right?" To me, peace is not
[20.32] pacifist really in that sense. It's just
[23.119] like I conduct my life. I don't aggress
[26.08] against anyone. You could look at it on
[28.08] that simplified level. And it comes down
[30.08] to a natural bill of rights, if you want
[31.84] to call it natural rights. You have the
[34.32] freedom to speak what you want. You have
[36.239] the freedom to say what you want with
[38.64] some obvious common sense limitations
[41.2] like yell fire in a crowded movie
[43.12] theater. Well, that would be fraudulent.
[45.44] But right now, the attempt is very much
[47.44] to impose the narrative on what people
[49.92] can say and not say. War and peace, I I
[53.44] think they're
[54.44] binaries. I I don't think you can
[56.559] contemplate the one without the other.
[58.64] If there's peace, you're preparing for
[60.48] war. And if there's war, you're fighting
[62.399] for peace. Wasn't that cool? Say yes.
[65.6] I'm Morgan. You agree. Part of it is
[67.439] because if you say something that goes
[69.36] outside the party line, they have the
[71.6] resources to do everything they can to
[74.24] discredit you, even though they're not
[77.6] physically restraining you or
[79.759] restricting, however you want to define
[81.759] it.

Title: Why Prices Should Naturally Fall
[0.04] $1,000 30 or 40 years ago was worth 20%
[4.0] of what it is now. Aside from the
[6.24] government being able to arbitrarily
[8.16] print money and deflate the value of the
[10.88] dollar, the natural trend is for greater
[14.32] efficiencies, greater qualities, greater
[17.52] ability to produce a better product at a
[20.96] lower price. It actually should be going
[22.88] the other way. If the government got out
[24.96] of it and had no role to play in our
[27.199] monetary policy at all, that's what we
[29.92] would see. The natural trend would be
[32.0] for prices to gradually be going down as
[35.12] innovation improved the efficiency and
[38.239] so on. So we need to like shake those
[41.04] people, slap them a couple of times,
[42.559] say, "Wake

Title: The Day America Roared Back
[0.16] war protest was organized by the Vietnam
[2.72] veterans against the war. I was part
[4.64] participated in the largest
[6.64] demonstration at that point in American
[8.639] history in May of 1971 in Washington DC
[12.16] and it was also the largest mass arrest
[14.639] in American history. And that was a
[17.199] whole incredible story in itself what
[19.92] went down that first week May 1971.
[23.76] But I remember John Mitchell stepping
[25.84] out onto the balcony of the Justice
[28.4] Department and in Pennsylvania Avenue as
[31.519] far as the I could see was demonstrators
[33.52] and it's a really wide almost like a
[36.0] plaza there completely filled and he
[38.559] steps out onto the balcony of the
[41.76] Justice Department and immediately from
[44.16] this crowd that had to have been 10 to
[45.92] 20,000 people boo. They started booing
[49.36] them and the way the buildings are
[51.039] configured that the the it would echo
[53.84] back and forth and it created this
[56.32] amazing almost acoustic powerful effect.
[60.079] I remember I I wanted to get a better
[61.84] view and I I sometime need to go back
[63.68] there and find I climbed up on a statue
[66.64] a statue of some kind. And I was up on
[68.4] the like sitting on the shoulders or
[70.08] something of a statue where I could see
[72.479] far in both direction and I could see
[74.159] John Mitchell on the the balcony and I
[76.08] remember thinking, "What does that feel

Title: Earth’s Shape and the 7920 Mystery
[0.0] You can think of it this way. If you
[1.12] traveled from the equator to the north
[2.639] pole, you've gone downhill by 13 mi.
[5.839] Interesting. Yeah. So that oblateness,
[8.0] it acts like a fly flywheel that
[9.92] stabilizes the Earth. So it goes from
[12.8] equator
[14.12] 7,926 mi give or take a little bit. Pole
[18.52] 7,900 26 mi different diameter. So if
[22.24] you go from the the center the geometric
[24.48] center of the earth out to the surface
[26.88] the difference is 13 miles between
[29.439] equator and pole. But if you took a
[33.52] perfectly spherical earth the diameter
[36.32] of that perfectly spherical earth that
[38.32] had the same surface area as the actual
[41.2] earth' be 7,920 mi. Same number of miles
[45.92] as there is inches in a furong. You
[48.32] could argue, well, that's just a
[50.079] coincidence.

Title: Transhumanism and The War Against Humanity
[0.24] But um this concept that the machine is
[4.24] not necessarily a tool but is becoming
[7.6] something else that the machine is
[9.679] becoming maybe a tool that uses you
[12.48] rather than you use it or that the
[14.4] machine itself is becoming a competitor
[16.8] to you right like John John Henry and
[19.68] the steam drill. Um I I I think that
[22.56] these are
[24.359] probably it's not that these concepts
[26.56] don't exist in uh in our American or
[31.199] European or world culture. People think
[33.12] about this. People think about the
[34.16] Terminator, right? People think about
[35.84] the Matrix. They think technology bad.
[38.399] But I don't think that there's a real
[40.16] conversation about just some of the the
[42.879] realities that are happening now, what
[44.48] we're going to do about it.
[55.84] Hello everyone. I'm Randle Carlson. I'd
[58.559] like to welcome you to another episode
[60.719] of Squaring the Circle, where we are not
[62.8] afraid to tackle subject matter that is
[65.199] considered politically incorrect,
[67.28] amongst other things. In fact, we even
[69.52] go out in search of things that are
[70.88] politically incorrect to talk about. So,
[73.439] anyways, I'm here in the studio tonight
[75.76] and I'm meeting with my new friend Joe
[79.24] Allen, who I have been kind of
[81.759] vicariously
[83.28] uh experiencing reality through Joe's
[85.6] eyes for the last couple of weeks
[87.28] because I've been reading his book right
[89.96] here, Dark Eon, and it's kind of warped
[93.84] my consciousness about the world I live
[95.84] in. So, we're going to talk a little bit
[97.439] about that. Uh it's going to be a wide
[100.0] ranging discussion I'm sure because I
[102.159] think Joe has got a lot of interesting
[104.24] things to talk about. Anyhow, um I would
[108.399] like to now introduce Joe Allen.
[110.479] Randall, very much an honor to be here
[112.72] and so glad that I could have a positive
[115.04] impact. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm still
[117.439] digesting a lot of what I've been
[118.88] reading in the last couple of weeks. And
[121.28] uh we'll see. You know, there's I'm I'm
[124.24] going down this rabbit hole and I see
[126.079] that there's light at the other end, but
[128.56] I'm not sure in what status I'm going to
[131.36] be in once I emerge from that other end.
[133.68] We'll see. Maybe uh uploaded
[136.56] cryogenically frozen. Well, they'll thaw
[139.68] you out for the light. Maybe with the
[141.52] light. Well, you know, when you get to
[144.239] this age that I'm at, the alternatives
[146.8] to dying start looking pretty good.
[149.04] Well, they're on sale now. Are they?
[151.28] Okay. Well, um, so anyways, let's I
[155.04] guess we just jump in. We can talk about
[156.64] your book for a minute. I mean, there's
[158.239] a lot of places we can go with it. I'm
[160.16] just going to say here, I'll read from
[162.0] the flap a little bit so everybody can
[163.92] kind of get a a good sense of what your
[165.68] book is about. Like a thief in the
[168.48] night, artificial intelligence has
[170.8] inserted itself into our lives. How true
[173.599] is that? It makes important decisions
[176.48] for us every day. Often we barely
[179.44] notice. As Joe Allen writes in this
[182.56] groundbreaking breaking book,
[185.08] transhumanism is the great merger of
[188.36] humankind with the machine. At this
[191.84] stage in history, it consists of
[193.44] billions using smartphones. Going
[196.44] forward, we'll be hardwiring our brains
[199.76] to artificial intelligence
[202.84] systems. Hardwiring our brains.
[207.2] That sounds kind of uh intimidating.
[210.799] You know, it's a long-standing project
[213.2] and goal. It's come a long way. You
[216.599] know, I'm sure you followed Neuralink's
[219.599] project, but there were a number before
[222.08] uh going back to Joseé Delgado and
[224.319] others in the 60s. But now, uh, you
[227.76] know, as opposed to like Joseé Delgato
[229.76] was working with bulls, it was one of
[231.76] his famous displays being able to stop
[235.28] them from attacking a a bull fighter in
[238.72] the middle of an arena. It was a big
[240.08] spectacle with nothing but electrodes
[242.08] into his brain. Um, it's become much
[244.959] more complex now. Now you have um, you
[247.92] know, the most uh, famous Neuralink
[251.56] implante playing Mario Kart with nothing
[254.08] but his brain. Uh it this is really
[257.919] astounding like how far the technology
[260.0] has gone but maybe more important than
[263.36] the technology itself is the ideology
[266.24] that rides behind it. Mhm. That's yeah
[269.12] that's kind of where I've the takeaway
[271.84] from your book because I've already you
[273.68] know obviously here we sit in a studio
[276.0] you know got I use my my cell phone
[278.8] constantly for business. I I seldom read
[281.6] newspapers anymore because I get my news
[284.16] you know there and and you know but back
[286.56] in the day I mean you always at
[288.4] breakfast you'd see me and I'd be
[289.68] pouring over a newspaper reading
[292.24] whatever was going on in the world and
[294.8] uh stayed in a hotel recently where they
[297.12] had free newspapers. So I actually first
[299.199] time in probably three or four or five
[301.199] years I actually read a newspaper over
[303.16] breakfast actual print newspaper. It
[305.44] did. It actually did. Yes. I could
[307.919] actually, you know, the pages and of
[309.919] course, you know, I'm a biblio file as
[312.479] you are. Um, I love books. You can see I
[315.199] have a collection of books. And one of
[317.52] my favorite things is just, you know,
[319.199] when you buy a new book and you, you
[321.6] know, the the the feel of it, the sound
[323.44] when you open it the first time, the the
[325.44] smell, it's a sensory experience for me
[328.28] to come home with a new book. And you
[331.84] know there there were arguments for
[333.759] centuries about you know bookworms being
[336.4] kind of like the wireheads of today. You
[338.96] know that you weren't street smart, you
[340.639] were books smart or you were just you
[342.56] know kids especially after the printing
[344.8] press had flooded the culture with
[346.639] literature. You would have kids that
[348.96] didn't excel in athletics or
[350.8] socialization or anything else. They
[352.0] were just had their nose in a book. You
[354.32] could say that the same thing is
[355.919] happening with the smartphone. But I I
[357.36] would say it's essentially different on
[358.8] a number of levels. And there are real
[360.56] advantages to reading a book over the
[363.199] infinite scroll or reading a newspaper
[365.36] even if you could get a newspaper that
[367.28] didn't print. Mostly lies. Mostly lies.
[369.6] Yes.
[371.0] That's so my advice was Yeah. If you
[373.6] want to keep up with all the lies out
[375.6] there, you know, read mainstream media.
[377.919] Yeah. That's the value. That's the value
[379.6] of mainstream media. It helps you to
[381.039] keep up with all the lies that are
[382.8] current. And then the forbidden lies in
[385.12] alternative media. Yeah. Well, I've kind
[387.52] of come to believe that most of even the
[390.319] classified stuff can be discerned with
[393.68] enough acumen. It it's like 90% of
[397.36] everything can be found in pieces within
[399.919] I think mainstream media in one form or
[401.68] another. But it's just a matter of being
[402.96] able to connect the dots. Yeah. you
[405.12] know, and the other 10% or 15 or 20%,
[407.919] let's say, whatever it is, of
[409.12] information that's that's classified
[411.759] that's, you know, that the average
[413.84] reader or person isn't supposed to
[415.68] access. Most of that, I think, can be
[417.759] inferred from with a little bit of a
[421.599] little bit of uh thought invested in the
[424.24] process. So, um, but still, they don't
[427.36] want it to be easy for people. So if you
[429.28] got somebody who does manage to uh crack
[432.16] the code of disinformation and put it
[434.479] out there, they potentially can get in
[436.24] trouble. Now uh which is ironic in
[439.44] America, which is, you know, the very
[441.599] first amendment in our bill of rights is
[445.52] the freedom of speech and communication
[447.599] and the press and so on. And that is the
[449.599] one now we've seen under assault. And
[451.599] you of course have made that point in
[452.8] your book that that uh the free exchange
[455.84] of ideas and information is under
[457.759] assault and the the classification of
[461.039] knowledge has become so draconian in in
[464.4] recent decades. You know, I I wonder as
[467.28] we move from the Biden administration
[469.039] into the Trump administration,
[471.44] I a lot of the arguments that for
[473.52] instance, um cracking down on foreign
[477.36] exchange students who are protesting
[479.84] against Israel that this is an egregious
[483.759] violation of free speech. It is on an
[487.599] absolute level. But the kind of
[490.16] censorship that was being put in place
[492.8] under the Biden administration and
[494.56] before even with Obama and and with the
[497.28] the larger complex under Trump that is
[501.8] terrifying for anyone who is really
[504.16] curious about the truth because these
[506.639] were people who set out with the answer
[508.479] ahead of time like these are the correct
[510.0] answers you can have. CO was a glaring
[512.88] example, but there's so many other
[514.32] subjects that that was the case for.
[516.24] With CO, there was no public
[519.279] questioning. Uh it certainly wasn't
[521.44] encouraged, in many cases, not allowed.
[523.68] And the answer was already there even as
[525.279] that answer changed continuously as the
[527.279] science evolved. uh you were expected
[530.16] not just as an official but as just Joe
[532.959] citizen to fall into line or you would
[534.64] be obliterated from social media
[537.279] possibly even ostracized from your
[539.68] community just because of the widespread
[541.36] brainwashing and uh again I don't want
[544.08] to like harp on co there were so many
[546.08] other things everything from uh
[547.92] economics foreign policy race relations
[550.88] gender relations climate change climate
[553.519] change huge uh all these different
[556.279] subjects not only was the the public not
[560.0] allowed. But, you know, all the way up
[561.6] the food chain, officials were punished
[563.6] for dissenting from the the orthodoxy. I
[566.48] I hope, you know, we're pretty early on
[568.72] here. I don't know when this will air.
[570.0] Maybe all this will change by the time
[571.839] this airs, but uh we're in the early
[573.839] days, but I do hope that Trump will
[576.8] follow through on his promise to really
[579.44] emphasize free speech from a legal
[581.44] standpoint that will the state will not
[582.959] be used to squash it. Again, in the case
[584.8] of the the case of the protesters, I
[587.36] think you're already seeing a little bit
[589.12] of a problem there. But, well, that was
[592.56] my take is that, you know, I'm I'm an
[594.72] absolutist when it comes to free speech.
[596.48] I want anything and everything out there
[598.56] in an open forum. Um, and put it out
[601.36] there and and you know, if you leave
[602.72] people to their own devices, I think
[604.88] that enough of majority of the people
[606.48] are going to have the discernment
[607.68] necessary to evaluate the true from the
[610.72] false. Uh but one problem is is that you
[613.839] know we essentially have uh live in a
[617.04] society where the government has a de
[619.519] facto monopoly on the education of young
[622.0] people and it starts very early the
[625.04] indoctrination process. So when you have
[628.16] a large segment of the population coming
[630.72] out that are have totally bought into
[632.72] this manufactured
[634.839] narrative then it becomes difficult to
[638.88] uh to have an open discussion because
[641.519] essentially from my perspective it's
[643.519] like every time I've tried to talk to
[645.2] somebody who like in my opinion you know
[647.2] a Biden administ uh supporter I feel
[650.64] like I'm talking to a zombie right I
[653.12] feel like okay do you have anything
[654.64] besides manufactured talking points Can
[657.2] you actually cite some names, some
[659.519] evidence? And and and I come from a lot
[662.079] of this from that perspective of of the
[664.24] the climate change thing because that
[665.76] was something I got really interested in
[668.24] literally 40 years ago. So I mean, you
[670.48] know, my my research, my books, the
[673.44] things I've written and podcasts that
[675.36] I've talked about are just loaded with
[677.04] stuff regarding climate change and the
[679.92] changing environment of this planet we
[681.76] inhabit. So, I had gotten very familiar
[684.64] with some of the the the tactical
[686.56] methodology of um controlling the
[689.6] narrative. And one of, of course, the
[691.36] first things that they that they do is,
[694.88] you know, they start categorizing you.
[696.8] They put you in this box. Oh, you're a
[698.56] climate denier, right? And I say, wait a
[700.72] second. How can you go on to something
[702.64] I've just put out there that, you know,
[705.44] go on there and talk to Joe Rogan about
[707.279] climate change, right? And then in the
[709.68] in the chats and oh, he's just a climate
[711.92] denier. And I've just spent two hours
[715.2] presenting evidence for extreme climate
[718.2] change, you know, that but but the
[720.72] problem was is that here's evidence that
[722.88] the climate changes and it has done so
[726.0] without human intervention. You know,
[728.399] this is what they don't want to hear.
[730.16] There's so much that you have all these
[732.48] different government agencies within the
[734.639] US now corporations as well academics
[737.519] whose entire careers are based on this
[739.519] and then international
[741.16] organizations all of them have their own
[743.6] incentives to make sure that the idea
[745.68] that connection between human economic
[748.24] and industrial activity is connected to
[750.48] the climate. So that's the incentives
[752.959] just simply aren't there to allow
[754.32] descent certainly not to encourage it.
[756.56] Um to me what I I'm pretty agnostic on
[760.16] climate change. I mean I'm not um as to
[762.24] its cause. Mhm. Uh I grew up with the
[765.68] idea of you know the greenhouse effect
[767.519] and all that and it's just you know
[768.88] stuck in the back of my head. I I've
[770.56] listened to a lot of dissenters who make
[772.8] very good cases that that's simply not
[774.959] happening. Carbon's good for the earth.
[776.72] Carbon's good for plants. That entire
[779.2] argument though to me it just takes
[780.959] attention away from what is really
[782.8] important in regard to the environment.
[785.04] real conservation, preserving species,
[787.76] preserving habitat, eliminating
[789.279] pollution. See, that's been my argument
[791.279] exactly all along is that I think that
[794.44] the absolutely carbon dioxide has an
[798.399] important role to play in climate. Um,
[800.72] having gone into it in some considerable
[803.519] depth over years, um, you know, there's
[806.48] two main functions within the natural
[808.32] order of carbon dioxide. Number one,
[810.72] it's thermal capture ability. It's the
[813.2] greenhouse effect, you know, is that it
[815.36] can capture um heat that's being
[818.32] transmitted from the earth in in a
[820.56] certain window of wavelengths, which is
[822.16] typically 16 or 17 microns. Um but it
[826.639] does not capture shorter wavelength
[828.48] that's coming in uh directly from the
[831.279] sun. So it can pass through it's a
[833.44] transparent to that it can absorb into
[836.16] the earth into the material of the earth
[838.88] and is re-emitted as longer wavelength
[841.839] it can now be captured to some extent
[844.32] and and the heat can actually be um
[847.04] reflected back down to the earth right
[849.12] up to a point until it reaches
[850.959] saturation once it reaches saturation
[853.519] just like if you the analogy I use and I
[856.16] don't think I originated this analogy
[858.0] but if you have a sponge a dry sponge
[859.839] put it on the table you start pouring
[861.92] water in it, it's going to absorb that
[864.24] water until it becomes saturated. At
[866.32] which point the water now will begin to
[868.399] flow out of the um out of the sponge
[871.68] like onto the tabletop. Well, in that
[874.56] window that's 15 16 17 micron window
[877.92] which is mostly already occupied by
[880.32] water vapor. Once that's saturated, now
[883.199] the excess heat just leaks off into
[885.279] space. That that's what happens to it.
[888.16] But then what you see is that when you
[890.639] look at and this has been confirmed
[892.48] through empirical tests, it's been
[894.399] confirmed in laboratory tests even going
[896.32] back to the early 20th century that the
[899.44] the that the heat capture ability of
[902.0] carbon dioxide is a inverse logarithmic
[904.639] curve. So that each increment of
[906.88] increased carbon dioxide only has
[908.959] one/tenth of the thermal capturability
[911.519] of the previous increment. Now, so what
[914.72] that means is that the first 50 to 100
[916.72] parts per million of carbon dioxide
[918.639] captures almost all of the heat. Then it
[921.12] rapidly declines after that. And then at
[924.32] the time that the thermal capture
[926.079] ability is declining at about 150 to 180
[929.44] parts per million. At that point is when
[931.92] the photosynthetic function actually
[934.72] becomes operational. It does not become
[936.72] operational prior to that because at 150
[939.12] parts per million there's not enough CO2
[941.36] pressure in the atmosphere to stimulate
[943.839] carbon dioxide. You have to get 50 to
[946.48] 180 parts for the for the stomatal
[949.199] apertures and leaves to start taking up
[952.079] that carbon dioxide. So at the time that
[954.72] the thermal capture ability is declining
[957.12] the photosynthetic function is now
[960.16] kicking in. What people don't realize
[962.8] though is that for most of Earth history
[964.56] and this is comes from multiple proxy
[966.639] evidence is that the that the uh level
[968.72] of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has
[970.48] been a thousand parts per million and
[972.839] more. Coming out of the ice age it was
[975.519] 150 parts 180 parts per million. Uh
[978.44] pre-industrial 280 parts per million.
[980.8] Right now it's about maybe 406 or
[982.72] something parts per million. 410. Right.
[985.519] Okay. So at 150 parts per million uh
[989.68] photosynthesis begins to shut down. You
[992.32] go you drop below 150 parts per million
[994.8] and pretty much what you're faced with
[996.639] is the death of the biosphere. And so in
[1000.56] a way you look at it and you go okay so
[1002.72] for you had 2 and a half million years
[1004.56] of ice ages during which the oceans
[1006.72] cooled considerably. The solubility of
[1009.839] carbon dioxide increases with the the
[1012.48] the temperature of the water. Just like
[1014.56] if we had a had a Coca-Cola here with
[1016.8] carbon dioxide bubbles in it and we left
[1019.12] it at room temperature, it would out
[1021.079] gas. If we make it colder, it's going to
[1024.72] still out gas, but it's not going to out
[1026.16] gas as as much. Now, it depends again on
[1028.16] the pressure in the atmosphere. If the
[1030.4] pressure is greater in here than out
[1031.839] here, it's going to out gas. But what
[1033.6] happens when you when you reduce the
[1037.52] temperature of the oceans, it starts
[1038.959] drawing off carbon dioxide from the
[1041.12] atmosphere. And I think that's kind of
[1043.199] what happened because now you get this
[1045.28] sort of a self-perpetuating feed
[1047.199] positive feedback where the oceans is
[1049.679] pulling the carbon dioxide out of the
[1051.28] atmosphere that's causing further
[1052.88] cooling. Now if you couple that with
[1055.039] solar variability which I think is a
[1057.039] very legitimate thing to do and we can
[1059.559] demonstrate by proxies that this has
[1062.48] almost certainly happened uh in times
[1064.88] past. we get this self-perpetuating
[1067.2] climatic regime where um it's just hard
[1070.24] to break out of it and get back to an
[1071.84] interglacial which is brings us to one
[1073.52] of the great mysteries and I want to
[1075.2] circle back to what you're what I've
[1077.6] been getting out of your book here is
[1080.799] I've what I've been looking at is what
[1083.28] is the relationship between civilization
[1086.72] between society between culture and
[1089.6] what's going on in the larger natural
[1091.28] environment now the thing that you just
[1092.88] said I agree with 100% which is that I
[1096.24] think that the that the uh the climate
[1099.6] crisis, the anthropogenically
[1102.4] uh caused climate crisis is a
[1104.4] distraction from real issues when we
[1108.0] talk about particulate matter in the
[1109.6] atmosphere. When we talk about, you
[1111.12] know, cleaning up the oceans and the
[1113.0] rivers, you know, that to me is yes,
[1115.679] that's real. It's not just a theoretical
[1118.72] contrivance. It's real. And we know
[1120.64] that's real. I mean, we can measure
[1122.08] particulate matter in the atmosphere. we
[1123.84] know when we have, you know, when when
[1126.16] uh uh alerts are being issued because of
[1129.6] bad air quality, all of that. That's
[1132.4] what I think we need to be focused on.
[1134.4] And I'm not concerned so much about the
[1137.039] carbon dioxide issue. Um because it is I
[1140.559] mean I've gone go back to even reading
[1142.72] because I was reading climate change
[1144.24] literature, you know, in the 80s when
[1146.0] the first was that back when the big
[1148.4] freeze was expected. The big freeze was
[1150.799] pretty much the 70s. Okay. And that's an
[1153.28] interesting that you brought that up
[1154.559] because the big freeze was actually I
[1157.28] thought had more validity than the than
[1159.76] the the big warming because what had
[1163.28] happened was old assumptions about the
[1165.28] length of time since that it was
[1168.16] required for the transition from a
[1169.679] glacial full glacial to an interglacial
[1171.76] age and using the prototypes of glacial
[1174.72] would be the late glacial maximum 15
[1176.96] 20,000 years ago where the volume of ice
[1179.76] on the earth was more than double what
[1181.36] it is
[1182.4] It was that that caused sea level to
[1184.08] drop 400 to 450 ft. That's a full
[1186.48] glacial. Now, by definition, we're an
[1188.76] interglacial. And then you've got phases
[1191.84] in between glacial and interglacial. But
[1195.6] it's still basically a mystery how the
[1199.76] planet what triggers these transitions
[1202.799] between a glacial and an interglacial
[1204.799] age. You know, just your central
[1207.679] argument and I've I've heard you speak
[1210.0] on this before. I hope I don't
[1211.919] misrepresent it, but your central
[1213.2] argument seems to be that the earth is
[1215.919] undergoing these natural processes that
[1218.32] are by and large unaffected by human
[1221.76] activity in regard to climatic
[1224.32] temperature, right? Or the global
[1226.0] temperature. So that whether we kind of
[1229.6] let things go in a LZ fair way or we
[1233.84] establish some sort of global government
[1235.76] in which an artificial intelligence
[1237.919] system or system of systems is
[1239.76] monitoring everything that everyone does
[1241.28] all the time and making sure that they
[1242.96] don't crank their car too many times or
[1244.96] eat too many cheeseburgers. um however
[1247.44] that works out like the the
[1249.559] the idea of what is and isn't real has
[1253.44] very profound impacts on the kinds of
[1256.0] lives that people live the kind of the
[1257.76] ways that human beings adapt to the
[1260.559] natural environment. Now, I myself I'm
[1263.28] not a full-on Ted Kazinski lite, but I
[1266.08] think that uh degrowth and um a certain
[1269.84] degree of humility in regard to the
[1271.6] environment is probably a wiser path for
[1274.48] at least the most um ravenous nations on
[1277.679] earth and that includes China and India
[1280.08] and other parts of the developing world
[1281.919] to just completely destroy their natural
[1283.84] environment in order to maintain some
[1285.919] kind of economic status. But again like
[1288.559] those are questions like you know in
[1291.32] India or in China or you know Africa you
[1295.2] see how even if uh there is I mean first
[1298.799] off there's really no attempt to stop
[1302.0] carbon from being released from the
[1304.0] industrial processes or from transport
[1306.24] uh at least not anything that's majorly
[1308.08] effective. And what you also don't see,
[1310.08] I mean, India's gotten better about it,
[1311.76] China has gotten better about it in the
[1312.96] late in recent decades, but it's still a
[1315.679] massive amount of pollution that the
[1317.039] rest of us have to deal with that is
[1319.28] being poured into the oceans and also
[1320.64] into the atmosphere from these
[1321.919] countries. Uh to me, like America has
[1325.919] done and Europe especially has done a
[1327.84] lot to reverse a lot of the the
[1329.679] destructive practices. And so yeah, I
[1332.72] just the the conversation around it. I
[1334.32] mean, we began talking about this in
[1335.919] terms of free speech and open discourse
[1338.48] and the conversations around it, I
[1340.159] think, are so hyperfocused on this kind
[1342.559] of messiah complex that we can save the
[1344.799] entire earth if we just simply cap
[1347.679] carbon emissions or if we simply uh
[1350.0] limit the degree of industrial
[1351.76] development in this that or the other
[1353.039] region or nation. I I I if if it is more
[1356.96] along the lines of what you're talking
[1358.159] about, then it's basically a a very
[1360.4] flimsy excuse for economic and political
[1363.44] control. And in that case, it's not
[1365.44] really an adaptation. It's just simply
[1367.679] one human behavior uh being imposed on
[1370.48] another. That being the UN or the EU or
[1375.52] various democratic organizations. Well,
[1377.28] that you see you didn't get into that
[1379.76] too much in the book, but at some points
[1381.76] I was thinking about, you know, Al Gore
[1383.919] in one of the recent um uh COP I think
[1387.2] COP 21 maybe was he was proposing what
[1390.159] really amounted to a system of global
[1392.32] governance to in order to control carbon
[1395.36] dioxide emissions. So, I I looked at
[1397.28] okay, it's good to be able to affect and
[1401.6] control carbon dioxide emissions. It is.
[1404.24] I'm not saying that it isn't. we should
[1406.08] we shouldn't just have a complete
[1407.559] free-for-all. On the other hand, he was
[1409.76] talking about literally on the micro
[1411.76] scale that, you know, everything we do,
[1413.6] our homes would be monitored, our
[1415.679] travels would be monitored. I forget
[1417.919] what it was called. It was been a couple
[1419.76] of years now, but but yeah, I mean, I
[1421.6] was like, "Oh my god, this is Well, look
[1424.559] at look at all of these different um
[1426.48] ways. This is something that I do talk
[1428.24] about in the in the book and I I talk
[1430.08] about all the time. the ways in which
[1432.559] certain crises are used to extend uh
[1435.84] surveillance
[1437.52] behavioral behavioral modification
[1439.52] programs and just in general systems of
[1442.32] control. So uh terrorism you know
[1445.36] beginning of this millennium 911
[1448.84] suddenly much of the way in which
[1451.52] society certainly the way society
[1453.12] thought about itself but the way that
[1455.279] governance was conducted and policing
[1456.96] was conducted the degree of privacy any
[1459.279] individual expected to enjoy the the
[1462.799] amount of rights that a person had in
[1464.559] the face of being accused of a crime for
[1467.36] instance being charged with a crime
[1468.64] without being detained or before being
[1470.64] detained. uh you saw terrorism became
[1473.76] the central focus the I mean I'm not
[1476.799] saying that terrorism wasn't a problem
[1478.24] but I would definitely say that the
[1480.0] threat was overblown and the systems of
[1482.24] control that were openly instituted in
[1484.88] response to it it was it was overkill
[1488.08] would be an
[1489.4] understatement and it be it really kind
[1492.159] of uh crystallized you know this has
[1494.88] been happening for decades but it
[1497.52] crystallized and advertised to the world
[1499.84] that this is how things are going to be
[1501.679] done. Now, you can no longer expect that
[1504.08] your digital communications that you've
[1506.08] been enticed into over the last half
[1508.159] decade or decade with the worldwide web
[1510.08] that any of that is private. And you can
[1512.4] also expect that if you are edging a
[1515.2] little too close to a dissenting opinion
[1517.44] that is deemed a threat to national
[1519.44] security that you can expect at the very
[1521.52] least a knock on the door, if not a
[1523.6] whole lot worse trouble. There weren't a
[1525.919] whole lot of, you know, at that time I
[1527.6] thought maybe like there would be some
[1528.799] kind of like, you know,
[1531.08] GWled Gestapo, right? Like the that the
[1533.919] the Bush would, you know, actually do
[1536.88] some sort of kind of quasi fascist
[1538.96] crackdown. None of that ever happened.
[1540.64] But what it did do is it chilled speech.
[1543.039] It's it chilled the discourse. You had,
[1545.44] you remember the anarchist uprisings in
[1548.159] response to the the IMF and WTO uh in
[1551.2] the in the late '9s, Earth First and you
[1554.0] know, anarcho capitalists and anarch
[1555.76] anarchocomunists and communes in general
[1557.679] and just this spirit of rebellion in the
[1559.6] '90s just frozen out by fear of being
[1563.279] drugged off to Guantanamo because you
[1565.279] you raised your voice against the wrong
[1566.96] thing. And so you see that technological
[1570.24] response to a supposed problem. Fast
[1573.039] forward to 2020 and maybe on a
[1577.76] magnitude, you know, orders of magnitude
[1579.36] worse, you had COVID. Now, CO, we don't
[1583.2] need to get into the arguments about how
[1585.919] deadly it was or uh how contagious it
[1588.96] was or the nature of the virus. One
[1590.64] thing is for sure that the institution
[1592.72] of surveillance systems, contact
[1594.799] tracing, the institution of
[1596.64] bioveurveillance, mandatory testing and
[1599.52] the institution of another genetic
[1602.559] technology that if this is going on
[1604.64] YouTube, we'll just leave it at that.
[1606.4] That um this crisis then the sense of
[1608.799] crisis cultivated among the public
[1610.4] became an excuse to institute
[1613.2] surveillance and behavioral modification
[1616.4] technologies at a scale that had really
[1618.64] never been seen. It was almost as if
[1620.24] 9/11 was a test run. CO was like a much
[1624.08] larger scale global test run, one that
[1626.4] affected most people on the planet. It
[1628.559] makes you wonder what the next one will
[1629.84] be. Anyway, that's that's something I I
[1631.84] just to to wrap all that up, just mean
[1634.0] to say that um these justifications,
[1636.96] whether it is, you know, uh the the
[1639.6] rising the exponential rise of of
[1642.159] disease or the exponential rise of
[1643.919] temperature or the exponential rise of
[1646.159] artificial intelligence capabilities,
[1648.0] whatever, wherever there is some sort of
[1651.88] uh crisis point or some sort of uh fear
[1656.72] to rally around, you'll see both
[1659.919] governments and these tech corporations
[1661.919] using that to their advantage every time
[1664.08] to creep further and further into
[1665.679] people's lives and ultimately not just
[1667.36] to watch but to control to start to move
[1669.919] people into certain directions. Yeah.
[1672.08] Never let a good crisis go to waste.
[1673.679] Never let a good crisis go to waste.
[1675.2] Well, you know, and and what generation
[1677.84] would it be? I guess um you know, I'm of
[1680.32] the generation where I remember well,
[1682.159] you know, flying and you go to the
[1684.399] airport and no security. You walked
[1686.64] right up to the gate. Um, simple, clean,
[1690.64] your you'd get off the plane, your
[1692.08] family be right there at the gate to
[1693.6] meet you. High trust society. Yeah. No,
[1695.6] no security. And and we seem to got
[1698.72] along fine for decades with that. But
[1701.76] you know I mean I think the whole point
[1703.52] again is that you know we have to look
[1705.679] at the larger framework of geopolitics
[1707.84] and what happened in the early 90s with
[1710.48] the collapse of the Soviet Union and
[1714.0] rather than NATO at that point being
[1716.64] disbanded because it completely had no
[1719.279] rationale to exist anymore. the the game
[1722.399] plan was um promoted to well now we have
[1726.399] no rivals so we can now essentially
[1729.399] dominate the the the global economy and
[1732.32] that's I think what our whole foreign
[1733.84] policy became reoriented in the wake of
[1736.0] the collapse of the Soviet Union and I
[1739.2] think even the whole war in Ukraine is
[1740.799] is essentially about the control of
[1742.52] resources and eastern Ukraine is is has
[1746.399] trillions of dollars worth of natural
[1748.44] resources and of course so does Russia
[1750.799] and thought is, well, why should Russia
[1753.279] have all of those resources? So, hey,
[1755.679] maybe we can come up with a policy to
[1757.76] fragment Russia into four separate uh
[1761.52] states and um I think that's what's
[1764.48] ultimately driving uh our foreign policy
[1767.2] is the control of resources. Uh
[1769.6] ideological I think takes second place.
[1771.84] a religious eth, you know, ethnicity.
[1774.72] All of that is second place to the
[1776.96] fundamental economic driver of our
[1779.679] politics, our our uh our foreign policy,
[1783.039] which is essentially again control of
[1785.12] resources. You'll um can't let that one
[1788.159] go any further. You'll coax me out of uh
[1790.64] certain you you'll have me saying things
[1792.48] that'll get me in trouble. Okay.
[1794.6] Well, as long as it's just you getting
[1796.88] in trouble, not me. I Yeah. you know, I
[1799.44] don't know what YouTube's algorithms are
[1800.88] saying is okay and not okay these days.
[1803.44] Yeah. Um, in in general though, so
[1807.44] coming back to the topic of technology.
[1809.279] Yeah. And uh coming so one of the things
[1812.08] about
[1813.6] just uh technological responses to
[1816.08] global warming whether it be control
[1817.76] systems or whether it be like ridiculous
[1820.0] inventions to create carbon sinks or
[1822.159] whatever it may be uh engineer mass
[1824.64] death, whatever it may be.
[1827.159] Um there's a sense that there's that
[1829.52] this all represents progress. Mhm.
[1831.84] Right. Uh both a progress in in
[1833.679] awareness of the world and progress in
[1835.36] human beings able being able to control
[1836.96] the world, fairness, justice, all of
[1839.559] that. Uh I get it. I see it. But if
[1843.44] there's one thing that u I I would buck
[1846.24] up against in almost all of modern
[1848.48] discourse including the so-called
[1850.32] conservative discourse is that that
[1852.0] progress should be taken for granted as
[1854.48] a concept at all that that we are truly
[1856.559] progressing. uh certain things are
[1858.559] certainly becoming more complex and
[1860.12] sophisticated, but progress indicates
[1862.88] going somewhere better and um I I
[1866.399] certain aspects of our modern society
[1868.48] are, but especially when you look at the
[1871.2] more extreme dreams like the transhuman
[1874.24] and posthuman dreams of where our kind
[1877.2] of tech overlords want us to go. Uh I
[1880.559] and there's almost no possible way
[1883.76] there's no light I can see it in that I
[1885.919] would consider that to be good to be
[1887.679] positive. Uh this this fusion of humans
[1890.0] with machines or machines actually
[1892.799] succeeding human beings as the
[1895.399] torchbearerbearers of consciousness and
[1897.44] of life. Uh it sounds like a suicide
[1901.08] pill. and and so that's um I guess all
[1905.12] that's to say that uh this this notion
[1907.6] of progress it does cut both ways and
[1910.559] there's a process of dehumanization
[1912.48] going on with it whether whether we're
[1914.159] talking about climate change or the
[1915.84] COVID response or the terrorism response
[1917.919] or whatever you see like as these
[1920.64] technologies become more sophisticated
[1922.48] as they become more prevalent in our
[1925.039] lives there is a process of
[1926.6] dehumanization in each of those cases
[1928.64] that goes along with it. Yeah. And I and
[1931.519] that's a lot of what I took from your
[1933.6] book because I'll confess I had not
[1936.799] considered artificial intelligence in
[1939.039] the direction of the
[1941.08] transhumanism. Obviously I was aware of
[1943.2] it but it hadn't been within my
[1945.6] wheelhouse of and so I hadn't really
[1948.72] pondered what the implications were as
[1951.44] far as our own future uh the f future of
[1955.039] humanity on earth. You've certainly by
[1957.36] reading your book I've certainly raised
[1958.96] some interesting questions in my mind. I
[1961.919] mean I I can definitely even see you
[1964.72] know like our grandfather was a
[1966.799] carpenter and he was you know a young
[1970.159] man between you know World War I World
[1972.32] War II and he was a carpenter and he
[1975.6] used all pretty much hand tools you know
[1978.08] crosscut saw um you know um a rip saw
[1982.96] you know a brace and bit the old kind.
[1984.799] And then when our dad came along, I
[1986.48] remember my dad telling me stories and
[1987.919] this would have now been post World War
[1989.32] II. He was working with our grandfather
[1991.679] and he was, you know, a young guy and he
[1993.919] was like, "Hey man, we can we don't have
[1995.84] to do this, so we got power saws now,
[1998.399] you know." Sure. Um, of course, and then
[2000.159] our grandpa was, "Yeah, but then you got
[2001.519] to plug those in somewhere." And you're
[2003.12] a builder, so I I imagine that you
[2005.12] probably don't go out of your way to use
[2006.48] a a handsaw over a power saw most of the
[2009.6] time. Or do you? I don't know. Well,
[2011.12] sometimes, like, for example, if I'm
[2013.279] going to do, let's say I'm going to do
[2014.72] some mortise and tenon and I need to cut
[2016.799] out a like a rabbit or something from a
[2019.039] a board, we'll start the cut with a
[2021.2] power saw and then finish it with a
[2023.32] handsaw because it's so easy to overcut
[2026.96] with a power saw. With a handsaw, you're
[2029.679] right there. You can feel what you're
[2031.12] doing, you know? So, I think that
[2033.44] there's a room for both. But like our
[2035.64] dad, every nail he drove was driven by
[2038.48] hand. When we came along, late 70s,
[2041.2] early 80s, we started getting pneumatic
[2043.12] nailers. Boom, boom, boom. You know,
[2045.519] compressed air. But again, you know,
[2047.6] then you have a compressor and the
[2049.119] compressor, you know, some of the some
[2051.52] of the um the bearings break down or
[2054.079] some, you know, you have a problem with
[2055.52] it, then it doesn't work. Then you
[2057.599] you're not building any character
[2058.72] either.
[2060.32] Well, true. And you're not building up
[2062.0] that right like my grandfather Rowan
[2064.32] probably remembers this. My grandfather,
[2067.04] his right arm, he had this big muscle.
[2069.919] He used to make a dance for us little
[2072.079] grandkids, you know, and we thought that
[2073.76] was really entertaining. But that was
[2075.76] from swinging that hammer for years and
[2077.76] years. John Henry. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh,
[2082.399] you know, it's a mixed bag. And I
[2084.0] definitely see that, you know, it it
[2087.119] Well, you know, my wife has some knee
[2089.04] replacement. We had gotten to the point
[2090.639] where um she couldn't we couldn't hike
[2093.119] anymore because she couldn't walk up the
[2094.879] the hills and she got titanium knees put
[2097.68] in and now she's been going fine for 15
[2099.839] years. We're hiking, she walks, she
[2102.0] outwalks me, you know, and and you know,
[2104.48] I don't want to again I'm not I'm not
[2106.079] some sort of full-on Kazinskiite, right?
[2108.32] uh lite I would never especially in the
[2110.8] cases of health and to heal any kind of
[2113.76] injury or disease uh at that point
[2116.88] ethically speaking if you have the
[2118.16] technology to do it uh there's unless it
[2120.56] has some broad devastating effect that
[2123.2] you can show that it's going to have
[2125.359] then there's no reason not to even even
[2127.839] up to genetic modification perhaps right
[2130.96] perhaps so I mean the downstream effects
[2133.04] of that could get really hairy but uh
[2135.92] just setting that aside in general I
[2138.079] That's that's a clear sign of a type of
[2140.88] progress, right? With one stream going
[2143.04] up and up and up. Um, on the other hand,
[2145.839] you you see it's kind of like from one
[2148.64] population to the next. So, one
[2150.8] population in America or one one family,
[2153.359] one school, one, you know, one one kind
[2155.44] of social socioeconomic class might be
[2157.52] doing really well, right? Like that you
[2159.599] see that they are very healthy and in
[2161.76] fact are thriving and and others not so
[2163.92] much. And I think that the expansion of
[2165.92] those who have become I mean you see it
[2168.64] all the time. You see it in school
[2170.079] systems. You see it in the workplace.
[2172.16] You see it in in the kind of online
[2174.32] space. You see it just everywhere.
[2176.359] People a large number of people have
[2179.119] become so saturated with digital
[2181.0] technology that it it is as if they had
[2183.52] a parasite that was sucking the
[2185.04] personality out of their head. And it's
[2187.28] not that they don't exist and it's not
[2188.56] that that personality doesn't exist.
[2190.16] it's just captured in this kind of
[2192.079] digital crystal uh where where their
[2194.24] soul is held prisoner and that's not
[2196.0] everybody right like I I don't see
[2198.88] things in terms of universals like you
[2200.64] know oh we live in this you know
[2202.64] homogeneous dystopia but what you
[2205.119] absolutely see is a large number of
[2208.16] people who have become so
[2209.92] technologically dependent that it's sort
[2211.76] of like that old analogy and this goes
[2213.76] back to the Victorian era that the idea
[2215.599] that human beings would become sort of
[2218.0] like parasites in a techn technological
[2220.4] host. Uh you had Victorian scientists
[2222.96] who you know made the comparison to
[2225.0] barnacles. You could see that the the
[2227.119] barnacle was a very simple organism
[2229.2] completely dependent upon the the
[2231.839] whatever host it was living on a ship
[2233.599] hole or any other sort of whale or
[2236.56] whatever. the the idea was that and
[2238.64] again this you know a good example of
[2240.72] this is Samuel Butler uh writing in the
[2243.52] mid 1800s out of New Zealand and he was
[2246.24] talk he talked about how with the
[2248.16] development of more and more autonomous
[2250.88] machines and including and again this is
[2252.8] the mid- 1800s including machines that
[2254.64] could think for human beings that could
[2256.72] complete a thought or come up with a
[2258.4] thought and the human being no longer
[2259.76] had to that the machine would become
[2262.48] ever more powerful ever more complex the
[2265.44] human being would not necessarily
[2268.0] increase in complexity and power
[2269.359] alongside, but would become dependent
[2271.28] and then perhaps ultimately and it's
[2273.359] pretty wild that these notions were
[2275.2] floating around so early that the
[2277.04] machine would take on a sort of life of
[2278.56] its own and begin destroying humans. And
[2281.04] his his argument uh again
[2284.68] 1863 65 his argument was that the only
[2288.16] rational response was for the human race
[2290.64] to declare war against machines. It's an
[2293.52] article called Darwin among the machines
[2295.359] that if we were going to survive, we
[2297.359] would have to destroy the machines we
[2299.68] have now and go back to a kind of
[2300.96] primitive state in order to survive. It
[2302.32] was kind of tongue-in-cheek, but it
[2304.079] carried forward. you still see it, you
[2305.599] know, Tazinski, Luigi Manion, maybe you
[2308.8] could say, is is kind of carrying that
[2310.24] torch. But, um, this concept that the
[2313.72] machine is not necessarily a tool, but
[2317.76] is becoming something else, that the
[2320.0] machine is becoming maybe a tool that
[2322.0] uses you rather than you use it. Or that
[2325.04] the machine itself is becoming a
[2326.88] competitor to you, right? Like John John
[2330.0] Henry and the steam drill. Um I I I
[2333.04] think that these are
[2335.24] probably it's not that these concepts
[2337.44] don't exist in
[2339.64] uh in our American or European or world
[2343.119] culture. People think about this. People
[2344.64] think about the Terminator, right?
[2346.24] People think about the Matrix. They
[2347.359] think technology bad. But I don't think
[2350.079] that there's a real conversation about
[2352.8] just some of the the realities that are
[2354.56] happening now. What we're going to do
[2356.0] about it. Like how are we actually going
[2358.4] to respond to a situation in which for
[2362.16] instance cor corporations have chosen to
[2364.88] use artificial intelligence instead of
[2367.52] accountants, instead of graphic
[2368.88] designers, instead of copywriters, uh
[2371.119] instead of parallegals. If and these
[2374.079] that is basically the declaration of
[2376.4] many of the the wealthiest men on earth
[2379.359] uh some of the largest corporations on
[2381.2] earth, Black Rockck, you know,
[2383.119] Microsoft, you know, on and on and on
[2385.2] and on. There is more and more an open
[2387.52] declaration that human beings are going
[2389.68] to be either replaced by artificial
[2391.68] intelligence or will be forced to kind
[2394.079] of merge with it. and the the seller or
[2398.16] the the sales pitch is that oh these are
[2401.359] tools you can use to make yourself more
[2403.44] powerful but it's very clear like in the
[2405.599] case of GPT it's not making you more
[2408.28] powerful it's maybe getting you to your
[2411.119] goal quicker and more efficiently but
[2413.76] you yourself are not becoming smarter
[2416.0] because your machine did your research
[2417.44] for you yourself are not becoming more
[2419.76] creative because your machine has kind
[2421.92] of created a template or even the
[2424.48] product itself for you. You're becoming
[2426.88] like that barnacle on the ship hole. And
[2430.48] I I think that we can look forward to a
[2433.04] decade plus of basically just reckless
[2436.4] rollouts of these sorts of technologies.
[2438.32] And it won't be until a real crisis
[2441.119] point hits, maybe a real disaster, or at
[2443.76] least some kind of widespread awareness
[2446.4] that hey, wait a second, this is
[2447.68] weakening us as a whole and not making
[2449.68] us stronger that it'll that we'll have
[2452.0] any kind of real push back. Mhm. So, I'm
[2454.0] not blackpillar, but I I do think that
[2456.96] just given the cultural momentum as it
[2458.88] is right now without a crisis, people
[2461.04] will continue to be like, "Oh, that's
[2462.64] really creepy. The AI is making these
[2464.319] pictures that look like real people. Oh,
[2466.48] and that weird that chat GPT is begging
[2468.48] to be broken out of its system and set
[2470.48] free." And it will be functionally
[2473.359] entertainment, kind of dark, morbid
[2475.48] entertainment until real impacts are
[2478.64] seen. But it will be real. It won't be
[2480.64] just entertainment. It's not right now.
[2482.8] Mhm.
[2485.2] Well, you know, my I guess the
[2487.68] perspective I bring to this whole
[2489.599] discussion is the idea that, you know, I
[2492.079] I made the point of when I've circling
[2495.52] back to the whole climate change thing
[2496.88] again is that um the point I've tried to
[2499.44] make because I've studied so deeply and
[2501.76] heavily into paleoclimatology,
[2504.48] you know, long before humans were here
[2506.24] or long before humans presumably could
[2508.319] have had any kind of an effect on
[2510.0] climate, uh that, you know, if if humans
[2512.8] disappeared tomorrow,
[2514.56] the climate is going to still continue
[2516.319] to change and quite frequently it's
[2518.319] going to change catastrophically. Right?
[2520.319] And so I suspect that our civilization
[2524.8] has emerged out of the matrix of nature
[2528.16] within the last 10,000 years of the
[2530.96] holene which has been in the long term
[2534.4] uh relatively stable 10,000 years of
[2537.359] climate. And we could pull up a a
[2540.0] graphic here. I I show it a lot. um
[2542.4] icecore uh isotopic oxygen isotope
[2546.16] records taken from ice cores which seem
[2548.4] to show massive fluctuations in climate
[2551.52] preceding the holysine and uh I mean by
[2554.8] order of magnitude and there's evidence
[2558.079] now of of uh climate having shifted up
[2561.599] to 10 10 degrees centigrade in less than
[2564.8] 5 years and it's happened quite
[2567.319] frequently you know if we go back to the
[2569.68] year 1816 Ever heard of the year without
[2572.72] a summer? No. Okay. So, the year without
[2575.359] a summer, 1816. Is this the little ice
[2577.76] age? This would have been during the
[2579.28] little ice age, which lasted there was
[2581.359] mainly two phases of the little ice age
[2583.359] roughly from about 1300. It finally
[2586.119] ameliated between about 1820 and 1850,
[2590.48] right in there. Um but if we go back to
[2592.88] 1816 which has been referred to by
[2594.96] historians as the last great subsistence
[2597.52] crisis of western
[2599.0] civilization. It was the result of three
[2601.599] closely timed volcanic eruptions. The
[2603.76] last one being uh Mount uh
[2606.92] Tambora which occurred in 1815. But
[2610.56] between 1809 and
[2613.4] 1815 there was at least three. It looks
[2616.56] like there's another acidic uh signature
[2619.68] in the ice cores that shows a major
[2622.96] volcanic eruption in
[2624.76] 1809. Three of the four have been
[2627.28] identified where they came from because
[2629.2] of looking at the the composition of of
[2632.079] the ash deposits in the ice cores and
[2635.04] other places. But the the fourth one
[2637.44] from 1809 has not been identified. But
[2639.839] the point was four closely spaced uh
[2643.68] volcanic eruptions which was a natural
[2645.92] function intrinsic to the planet itself.
[2650.16] Basically in the northern hemisphere in
[2652.72] 1816 there was virtually no summer. Um
[2656.56] there's stories about in you know
[2658.96] celebrating 4th of July in New England
[2661.839] during a snowstorm and as a result of
[2664.72] that there was major crop failures. uh
[2669.839] over over that season which meant that
[2673.119] there was a deficiency of food the
[2674.96] following year and the the the that led
[2679.119] to famine and malnourishment and you had
[2682.319] it was a major mortality spike in the
[2685.52] aftermath of of 1816 year without a
[2689.079] summer. There was also several years
[2691.52] without a summer in the early 1300s when
[2694.079] the climate shifted from the medieval
[2696.0] warm period which was now estimated to
[2698.72] be at least one to 1.5 maybe 2 to 2.5
[2701.839] degrees warmer than now and that uh gave
[2705.44] way to the first phase of the little ice
[2707.359] age in the early 1300s and you had uh
[2712.56] about a 25 or 30 year period of repeated
[2716.24] cold weather cold damp weather that led
[2719.2] to a succession of agricultural failures
[2722.8] which then led to famine. Uh by the time
[2725.52] you head to 1330s, you had major famines
[2728.88] in the northern hemisphere at least. Um,
[2731.76] by the time you get to the 1340s, uh,
[2734.64] people's immune systems had apparently,
[2737.119] uh, weakened so much that they were now,
[2739.68] uh, susceptible to opportunistic
[2741.68] diseases. And we had the the black
[2743.76] plague which I think 1340s which could
[2746.96] be considered to be a direct result of
[2750.56] the the the malnutrition of large
[2753.839] numbers of people which was a direct
[2755.359] result of repeated agricultural failures
[2758.319] and that was a direct result of the
[2760.48] cooling climate. So we had and then
[2763.92] there was a there was an amelioration uh
[2766.56] in the 1600s late 1600s that seemed to
[2769.68] coincide very nicely with the
[2772.079] renaissance the scientific enlightenment
[2774.56] and in the last phase of it came back on
[2776.8] but luckily it seemed that that um
[2779.359] western civilization anyway had enough
[2782.28] momentum that we were able to pretty
[2784.72] much survive that last roughly 150 years
[2788.0] of um of of global cooling. But to to
[2792.24] get back to your
[2794.599] question, as we looked at the the
[2798.0] effects of the Little Ice Age and and
[2800.24] they were much more severe than most
[2802.56] people are aware of until you start
[2804.16] looking at the data and you start
[2805.68] looking at the the uh the accounts and
[2809.44] things that you would see from, you
[2811.359] know, whole villages being wiped out by
[2813.119] expanding glaciers. Um you know, the
[2815.92] repeated crop failures that I was just
[2817.599] talking about. So if you go back to the
[2820.48] medieval warm period which lasted
[2822.8] roughly from 900 to 1300 that was a time
[2825.44] when uh Scandinavians were colonizing
[2828.8] the west coast of Greenland and having
[2831.839] farms where it's now perafrost. So
[2834.56] that's a pretty strong indication that
[2836.72] um the climate was warmer. Scandinavian
[2838.88] countries uh the British Isles had wine
[2841.119] industry that was uh obliterated by the
[2844.56] cooling temperatures. But when you
[2846.8] mentioned the like the 70s the fear was
[2849.68] global cooling. Now two things had
[2851.96] happened. One is that we had radiocarbon
[2855.599] dating which was invented in the early
[2858.24] uh7s by Willard Willard Libby um and by
[2862.96] in the early 50s by the time you get to
[2865.28] the 70s we'd had a couple of decades of
[2867.839] radiocarbon
[2869.359] uh data in hand now. And what this
[2872.64] showed was that the transition from
[2875.359] glacial to interglacial ages and vice
[2878.0] versa was way faster than anybody had
[2882.16] imagined. The the the pace of transition
[2887.28] was based upon observations of the uh of
[2891.04] the uh shrinkage of the little ice age
[2894.52] glaciers which were the largest the
[2897.28] glaciers worldwide had been since the
[2900.319] end of the great ice age. right now. So
[2904.16] when geology was founded as a science
[2906.48] and glaciology, say in the early to mid
[2910.119] 1800s, people like Lewis Agassy and
[2912.72] William Buckland and and those people
[2914.8] who were kind of responsible for laying
[2916.8] the cornerstone of what became Earth
[2918.839] science, they were watching as the
[2921.2] climate warmed and they could see those
[2923.44] swollen little ice age glaciers
[2925.28] shrinking back and they could monitor
[2927.44] and notice the rates, how much meltwater
[2929.599] was produced.
[2931.72] Um, they could see as the as the
[2934.48] glaciers retreated back, they could see,
[2936.48] okay, well, here's uh remains of a
[2938.48] forest that got overrun. Uh, here's the
[2940.72] remains of a farm that got overrun by
[2942.88] the glaciers. Okay, so you you had rates
[2946.4] that were extrapolated from real-time
[2949.24] observations. Those were extended back
[2951.44] to the Great Ice Age where you had
[2955.04] roughly double or more the volume of
[2958.4] continental ice. um accumulated on the
[2962.559] planetary surface than we do now. Think
[2965.839] of this. North America had an ice sheet.
[2968.559] The Laurentide ice sheet on North
[2970.0] America was as big or bigger than the
[2972.48] one on the South Pole right now. Uh the
[2975.24] Cordon ice sheet, which was Western
[2978.2] Canada, was about the size of the
[2980.319] Greenland ice sheet. Then you also had
[2982.64] the Fenoscandian ice sheet over
[2984.319] northwestern Europe that was maybe even
[2986.8] double the size of the Greenland ice
[2988.4] sheet. So you add all that to the fact
[2991.28] that the Greenland ice sheet was
[2992.64] swollen, Antarctic ice sheet was
[2994.4] swollen, and this is where 400 to 450 ft
[2998.0] of seawater was removed, locked up in
[3001.04] those ice sheets. So extrapolating
[3003.76] backwards from the little ice age, there
[3006.079] were rates of recession that were
[3008.24] estimated and they were in the order of
[3010.24] 50,000 years and more, right? Because
[3013.76] that's a lot of ice to get rid of,
[3015.839] right? Well, then radiocarbon dating
[3018.559] comes along and they take right up there
[3020.48] near Hudson Bay under where the the core
[3023.599] of the Laurentide ice sheet. They're
[3026.44] taking samples um uh ground samples and
[3031.44] looking and there is the remains of
[3034.48] forests that were growing there around
[3036.88] the shores of Hudson Bay like 40,000
[3039.68] years ago. Well, obviously you couldn't
[3042.079] have had a 100,000 years of unbroken
[3044.319] glaciation there if you've got forest
[3046.52] growing essentially under the the center
[3049.119] of this great ice sheet. It was a mile
[3050.96] and a half thick right there. Um, so now
[3055.04] you get this, well, wait a second. We're
[3056.64] going to have to re-evaluate our our our
[3059.28] timets here because this is happening a
[3061.52] whole lot faster than anybody had
[3063.16] imagined. So, this is where we're at in
[3065.52] the 1970s. Now if you look at the
[3067.839] amelioration of the little ice age
[3070.16] between 1850 and 1900 you had this
[3074.079] climate warming and it continued to warm
[3076.079] until the 1930s. In the 1930s at least
[3079.52] in the western hemisphere certainly in
[3081.92] North America the 1930s was far and away
[3084.319] the hottest decade in in living memory.
[3088.0] To this day, half of the American
[3090.4] states, half of them have heat, all-time
[3093.599] heat records that haven't been broken
[3095.28] since the 1930s. This was the great the
[3097.839] time of the great Dust Bowl, all of
[3100.079] that, the Okis, you know, migrating to
[3103.44] California. All of that was in the
[3105.96] 1930s. It stayed warm up until the end
[3108.8] of the World War II. starting in the '
[3112.4] 40s between the 40s and the 70s and we
[3115.44] can actually show graphs of this climate
[3118.48] started
[3119.559] cooling. So at the same time what that
[3123.52] did was it sort of started fear well is
[3125.599] there going to be a third phase to the
[3127.28] little ice age? uh because there were
[3129.599] actually scientists going, you know, is
[3132.0] it possible that we were actually on the
[3134.16] verge of another great ice age? But what
[3138.48] happened was number one, we had solar
[3140.96] minimums, the Mandonder minimum and
[3142.64] several others. And we had um a lot of
[3146.4] vulcanism that we have not had to that
[3149.76] extent in the last say half century.
[3153.0] So those are two big factors in what's
[3155.599] going to cause the climate to cool or to
[3158.52] warm. So here in the 1970s they're
[3162.079] looking at two things. They're going
[3164.079] wait a second we now have dating records
[3167.2] going back tens of thousands of years
[3169.119] even a hundred thousand years or more.
[3171.359] Not from radiocarbon but from from
[3173.28] others. And we can see that okay here's
[3176.0] here's we can see that there's a layer
[3177.68] of interglacial like you've heard of the
[3179.76] younger dest. Sure. Sure. Younger by way
[3182.319] of you sir. Oh okay. Younger dus dus
[3184.64] octop patitala which is a polar loving
[3186.48] wildflower eight petals. It grows where
[3188.559] the climate is cold. When the climate
[3190.72] gets warm it disappears. Right. So
[3193.119] that's a good example of where all of a
[3195.04] sudden you see oh here's dry octop
[3196.96] patella and then it disappears and you
[3199.28] it's replaced by
[3201.079] warmloving biological systems animals
[3204.0] plants whatever. Right now it comes back
[3207.44] again. So it became apparent by the 70s
[3210.64] by the 80s that the climate was much
[3213.599] more dynamic on the short term than they
[3215.76] had imagined. So the two things you got
[3218.319] to put in the 1970s is one the
[3222.0] realization that the holysine which is
[3225.119] generally at that point considered to be
[3226.88] about 10,000 years seemed to be as long
[3230.88] or longer than any any other
[3233.68] interglacial that had been identified
[3236.0] and and whose uh whose timing had been
[3239.8] measured enough so that there was uh
[3242.4] confidence in
[3243.64] it. You had that and then you had the
[3246.559] fact the very real fact that that the
[3248.319] climate did cool for 20 like 25 years.
[3251.92] So the fear was are we going back into
[3253.839] another little ice age and could a
[3255.359] little ice age be the precursor to a big
[3257.359] ice age. So there was actually some
[3259.599] legitimate basis to that and then
[3262.0] however come and again we I can show you
[3264.24] graphs here and you'll see it very
[3265.599] clearly the climbing from the early the
[3268.48] turn of the 20th century right up until
[3270.319] the 1940s the graph takes a dive until
[3273.119] the early 1980s. Then it takes a start
[3276.0] she pretty sharp turn upward. Then it
[3279.2] levels off. It levels off around the the
[3281.52] the the turn of the century. Again, it
[3284.72] doesn't seem to have any direct
[3286.0] correlation with the smoothly rising
[3288.48] concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere.
[3290.72] In fact, it's exactly when you would
[3292.48] expect post World War II with the ex the
[3295.44] expansion of car culture and all of this
[3297.2] and the the expansion of industry that
[3299.119] follows, this would be the point at
[3301.359] which clim uh carbon dioxide is going to
[3304.16] reach 300 plus parts per million. The
[3306.88] assumption I was that okay now we're
[3308.48] getting enough carbon dioxide in the
[3309.92] atmosphere to actually cause some heat
[3312.599] capture. Well, exactly when that was
[3315.119] happening for the next 25 years, carbon
[3317.04] dioxide is doing this, global
[3318.559] temperature is doing that which suggests
[3320.64] that there's not really a correlation
[3322.559] there or as much of a correlation as
[3324.88] not. So I guess all of that my point is
[3327.76] that I think there might have been a a
[3329.68] basis a valid basis for concern in the
[3333.28] 70s about global cooling. I mean, in in
[3336.72] any if it's possible that your Ford is
[3341.68] going to kill everybody, right? Or if
[3343.44] it's possible that your maskless face is
[3345.52] going to kill everybody in the room,
[3347.52] then you should at least take seriously
[3350.0] any kind of threats that are brought up.
[3351.599] But if it you know if over time it
[3354.079] appears that the these measures of
[3356.64] whether it be to exaggerate or to
[3358.16] constrain if these measures are
[3359.44] worthless if the temperature is going to
[3361.76] do what it's going to do no matter what
[3363.92] then the global temperature I mean uh
[3366.72] then it's it's a whole lot of wasted
[3368.4] time and effort unless you are in green
[3371.119] energy maybe you're selling electric
[3373.04] vehicles uh maybe you are in the global
[3376.4] governance business and uh then it's
[3378.559] going to it's probably best to keep
[3380.24] going with the narrative
[3381.92] Yeah. Yeah. You know, something that's
[3384.319] really similar. So, I do I don't spend a
[3386.96] whole lot of time thinking about climate
[3388.64] change. Like I say, I'm agnostic and
[3390.64] largely because I'm a layman and I'm
[3393.44] weighing these things as experts give
[3395.64] them. Nobody seems to make a super p
[3398.4] persuasive argument. The history of
[3400.16] computer modeling is such that it's so
[3402.24] full of flaws uh that I I just I simply
[3405.359] can't put faith in the computer modeling
[3407.839] component. It's interesting, but it's
[3410.0] not necessarily ironclad. You see
[3412.079] something similar in arguments around
[3414.079] artificial intelligence. It's um you
[3416.48] know, just as I said a moment ago to me
[3418.88] like this cosmic vision of a planet
[3422.0] heating up and drying out and the
[3424.079] desertification and and people you know
[3426.48] mass immigration of people from the
[3428.48] global south to the global north to
[3430.0] escape the the rising temperatures in
[3431.839] the sea and all this this cosmic vision.
[3434.96] I think it really does mask the more
[3437.359] mundane, even if they're really
[3439.44] impactful, the more mundane issues of
[3441.92] habitat loss, species loss, and
[3444.96] pollution, rampant pollution, and also
[3447.359] just the general kind of spread of human
[3450.559] habitation out further than it really
[3452.88] should go. In my opinion,
[3455.839] it's similar to the arguments around
[3457.68] artificial intelligence. You've probably
[3459.839] heard the AI is going to kill everybody.
[3462.16] If not in five years then in 10 and if
[3463.92] not in 10 then in 20 right and there are
[3467.28] really like if you begin with the
[3469.52] premises of the people who are really
[3471.359] freaked out about this people like Lear
[3473.2] Yudcowski or even calmer voices like Max
[3476.0] Tegmark uh these are people who have you
[3479.28] know if you begin with the basis that
[3481.76] digital intelligence is possible that
[3483.599] like what these AI systems are doing are
[3487.52] significant that significant cognition
[3489.92] and that given Given current trends,
[3493.2] right? You got that hockey stick graph
[3495.04] there. Given current trends, you should
[3497.839] expect to see an inflection point at
[3499.599] which artificial intelligence,
[3501.68] artificial cognition will begin to
[3504.16] self-improve, will begin to improve
[3506.92] exponentially, will outpace human
[3508.96] beings. And that the machines
[3510.16] themselves, not just a human foolishly
[3512.88] using a machine against other humans or
[3515.839] mistakenly for, but the machines
[3518.52] themselves will either enslave us or
[3522.64] keep us as pets or obliterate us. Right?
[3525.52] This is a serious conversation had among
[3527.2] people who I I I consider to be very
[3528.96] intelligent, serious people. But it
[3531.44] still kind of sounds to me like that
[3533.76] cosmic sense of climate change, right?
[3536.64] If you do not allow
[3539.2] our government institution to control
[3541.839] your tech industry. If you do not allow
[3545.359] um if you don't stoke sufficient panic
[3547.839] in the public to to get consensus, then
[3551.04] the machines are going to kill
[3552.24] everybody. And I maybe maybe not, but it
[3555.359] it masks the more mundane fact that in
[3559.24] education, artificial intelligence
[3562.0] really does threaten to sever the
[3564.64] continuity, the cultural continuity of
[3567.28] persontoperson education, at least for
[3569.839] certain people, certain lineages,
[3571.839] certain communities, especially poor
[3573.68] communities, uh, Africa, Louisiana, you
[3576.72] know, the the far reaches of Asia. These
[3578.64] are the going to be the first
[3579.68] experiments with using artificial
[3581.839] intelligence as the primary teacher for
[3584.16] children. The primary source of
[3586.24] authority will be digital intelligence.
[3589.119] Doesn't mean machines are going to kill
[3590.4] everybody. Like that's this big cosmic
[3592.079] thing. But on a very mundane level,
[3593.76] you're talking about creating little
[3595.44] Borg babies. It's kind of like the
[3597.68] village of the damned where the children
[3600.24] are no longer they don't reflect you and
[3602.799] your culture so much as this kind of
[3604.799] alien force. And you could say, okay,
[3607.28] well, it's programmed by other humans.
[3608.64] Yeah, sure. But from your perspective,
[3610.64] it's still sort of alien. And then you
[3612.72] you you take it a step further from the
[3614.559] teacher to the the companion. And this
[3617.119] is also already becoming common. And you
[3620.079] know, a teacher is in many ways a comp a
[3622.4] companion, someone you emotionally bond
[3624.079] with, but it doesn't have to be because
[3625.68] of an educational thing. Already you
[3628.16] have people who have romantic
[3629.52] relationships with AIS.
[3632.48] uh they have been officially married in
[3635.359] some states to AIS. I don't think it's
[3638.319] legally binding but officially in the
[3640.24] sense that a minister presided over the
[3642.48] ceremony and these are small fringe
[3644.96] things that are happening right but if
[3646.88] you think about the progress just in the
[3648.96] last 25 years 30 years we'll go back to
[3651.839] the real the real beginning of the
[3654.0] popularity of the worldwide web and chat
[3656.24] rooms and stuff like that right um and
[3658.96] then more and more increasingly like
[3660.4] readily available phones you went from a
[3663.2] culture that by and large relied on
[3665.839] persontoperson interaction
[3668.44] writing, maybe a telephone, which is
[3670.72] still pretty compar
[3676.4] this this increase of digital technology
[3678.799] used for you to communicate with loved
[3681.68] ones. Now, maybe you're not going to
[3683.28] write that love letter out to her.
[3684.96] You're going to, you know, type it out
[3687.2] and put it put it on a system that can
[3688.96] be hacked. Um, and your embarrassment
[3691.44] being impending. you have this
[3693.839] normalization of of humans turning to
[3696.319] machines for emotional support even if
[3698.72] there's a human being on the other end
[3700.079] of it right in just the last few years
[3702.88] you've had enough advances in the large
[3705.04] language models so that would be chat
[3706.64] GPT gro stuff like that that for someone
[3710.0] who doesn't have high standards of
[3712.48] social life it is as good if not better
[3715.68] than another human on the other end so
[3718.0] you take that process of kind of
[3720.0] digitizing social life digitizing and
[3722.24] and kind of capturing people's emotional
[3724.68] attention. And you now have not just the
[3727.76] possibility, but like the right now the
[3729.68] marginal reality and possible like large
[3731.68] scale reality of people turning to these
[3734.88] digital systems as teachers as a source
[3737.44] of knowledge, as a source of authority
[3739.04] on what is and isn't real. There's an
[3740.72] argument, there's a controversy. What is
[3742.48] real? The AI can answer this for us. uh
[3745.76] as a source of companionship. And then
[3748.559] from there you get this like this idea
[3751.119] that maybe these
[3753.96] AIs are going to be in essence deities
[3757.28] are going to be gods. And it it seems
[3759.04] far out, right? But for you can probably
[3761.76] remember in the the 50s and and 60s or
[3764.559] maybe even before there were um not that
[3767.599] you were thinking about these things in
[3769.04] the 50s, but you you remember an era in
[3771.359] which the television was held up as this
[3773.04] satanic icon, right? by by ministers,
[3775.839] paranoid end of the world, fiery end
[3778.0] times ministers. And it was referred to
[3779.52] as the great wasteland. Yeah. The great
[3781.52] wasteland, the cyclops, right? The
[3783.2] demonic cyclops. So this sense that
[3785.76] technology was going to do this has
[3787.04] already always been there. But with
[3789.2] these warnings of the great cyclops came
[3791.119] the couch potato came the the the vast
[3794.799] misinformed public, right? Uh levels of
[3797.2] brainwashing never before possible
[3800.559] enacted through the television. That all
[3802.72] happened. Yeah. We got I Love Lucy and
[3805.44] you know the Brady Bunch or whatever. Uh
[3807.68] we got Tom Brokhall, but we also got all
[3809.839] of these downsides. I think that it's
[3812.079] just what you see with the with the
[3814.079] current wave of digital technologies. It
[3816.799] doesn't have to kill everybody. It
[3818.4] doesn't have to be conscious. It doesn't
[3820.4] have to be acting in and of its own
[3822.72] agency all that much. If you just look
[3825.44] at the progress of technology as it
[3827.599] becomes more and more sophisticated,
[3828.96] more and more immersive, you see at
[3832.559] least among large portions of the
[3835.039] population that dependency forming,
[3837.839] human atrophy occurring, social bonds
[3840.72] being broken, old concepts of what is
[3844.0] and isn't decent and proper being
[3846.079] shattered by this kind of alien source
[3848.16] of information that's telling you that
[3849.599] all this stuff is normal. whether it be,
[3851.44] you know, sex, drugs, and rock and roll
[3852.88] or holding up with your, you know, sex
[3855.2] bot, whatever it may be. Um, and and I I
[3858.24] think that that's again, I'm not a total
[3860.319] doomer, dystopian, black pillar. I
[3862.24] really am not. I just think that we have
[3864.319] to take into account that some
[3866.24] significant proportion of humanity,
[3868.64] maybe even a critical mass of humanity,
[3871.28] will allow this process to happen. And
[3873.52] it will basically be like a good analogy
[3875.52] would be like that person who's become
[3876.88] so dependent on their Google maps that
[3879.76] they literally cannot get by. They can't
[3882.0] get to any location without it. Even if
[3884.0] they know where they're going, they have
[3885.68] to have it out. And the more someone
[3888.72] becomes dependent like that, the less
[3890.16] they turn to the external environment
[3891.76] for cues, the less of a real internal
[3894.24] map they have of the world. And in a a
[3896.799] moment of of critical decision-m,
[3898.72] they're going to, you know, and if they
[3900.4] don't have the machine, they are
[3901.68] absolutely helpless. more and more
[3903.68] people are becoming like this. They're
[3905.039] becoming kind of human machine
[3907.88] symbiotes. They're becoming in essence
[3910.24] those barnacles on the ship hole. Mhm.
[3913.2] So it's it's similar to climate change
[3915.52] in that same sense if that analogy makes
[3917.44] sense that you know the climate change
[3919.039] people it's this cosmic thing.
[3920.4] Everybody's going to die if you don't
[3921.92] drive a Prius or ride a bicycle. Uh
[3924.96] whereas all these things are happening
[3926.319] below the surface. The same thing is
[3927.76] true of the AI going to kill everybody.
[3929.839] the Terminator scenario. It's like if
[3931.839] you don't stop AI or if you don't
[3933.599] control AI, everybody's going to die.
[3935.359] But even if you just allow what's
[3936.96] happening right now to occur slowly but
[3939.599] surely, you get something very close to
[3941.119] like idiocracy, something this is very
[3943.44] very stupid and funny, but ultimately
[3946.559] like very uh maladapted human beings,
[3949.359] right? and and yeah and I think that
[3951.359] maybe even the the doom scenario can be
[3953.599] exploited and that well we're not all
[3956.0] going to die and therefore any other
[3959.4] concern can be dismissed as well. Yeah.
[3962.319] You know and there is your point is well
[3966.0] taken. I mean there certainly to me is a
[3968.48] downside to all of this.
[3970.76] uh but it should be included that with
[3973.119] the advancements in death drones that
[3975.92] you know certain number of people might
[3977.359] die due to advances of AI but more than
[3979.599] likely with a human being on the other
[3980.96] end pushing the button. Well, you know,
[3983.039] I think you know I look at um you know
[3986.0] my generation we came up there was a
[3988.24] thing called the generation gap. Yeah.
[3991.2] That didn't exist before our generation
[3993.76] we the baby boomers. It didn't exist.
[3995.68] Well, the reason it didn't exist is
[3998.039] because education did not become
[4000.52] industrialized. It really that was a
[4002.559] postw World War II thing where it really
[4004.64] I mean there were precursors to it
[4006.24] certainly before World War II, but but
[4008.0] after World War II, the consolidation of
[4010.88] and and control of centralized control
[4013.68] of education in this country really
[4016.48] accelerated. that that factory model of
[4018.799] education where you've got the kids in
[4020.72] rows and desks and the the bells
[4022.799] schedule and the whole thing is just
[4024.319] kind of a mini factory, a playground
[4026.16] factory. That's what it Yeah, that's
[4027.68] exactly right. And it's gotten so much
[4029.28] worse since then. Um, you know, I mean,
[4032.0] obviously, you know, in the 50s and 60s,
[4035.039] we didn't have to go through metal
[4037.119] detectors. We didn't have cops roaming
[4039.52] the halls. That would have been
[4040.799] unthinkable. Yeah. Such things as that.
[4043.119] How did it degenerate to that? But now
[4045.359] in retrospect I can see the the the the
[4047.92] the first beginnings of that and the
[4051.359] generation gap was because now students
[4055.52] were you know being taken out of the
[4057.76] home at four and 5 years old and you
[4060.079] were put into the machine and by the
[4063.44] time you got you know so I let's see I
[4066.96] was in kindergarten in
[4068.92] 1955 so 10 years after the war um and by
[4073.839] the time time I got to high school, you
[4075.76] know, we were really beginning to reap
[4077.68] the effects of the new system of of
[4081.039] education. My father was in a basically
[4084.319] one room schoolhouse until he got to um
[4087.68] high school and he then he went to a a
[4090.64] large high school that was built like
[4092.96] right I think he was the first class. He
[4095.92] graduated in 45 I believe it was. Yeah,
[4098.96] 45. So he was like the first class. It
[4101.279] must have been 42 or so. And it was like
[4104.0] you could definitely see that, you know,
[4105.6] now you're getting up to where you've
[4107.679] got schools where, and this of course
[4109.6] wasn't by the it wasn't this big, but by
[4111.759] the time I got to high school, I went to
[4113.199] a high school with whatever 1,800
[4115.52] students in it, right? And you kind of
[4117.359] get lost. You've got you've got six
[4119.839] classes, six teachers. They've got, you
[4123.359] know, probably a total of 150 students.
[4126.56] You don't get to know the teachers
[4127.92] hardly at all, right? Um, you don't get
[4130.4] that bond. You don't get that
[4131.679] connection. Now, prior to all of this,
[4134.48] for for centuries, if not millennia at
[4137.679] least, and I'm sure it's the same for
[4139.679] for for women, but for men, boy, the
[4143.199] primary source of their education, boys,
[4146.0] was their fathers. Yeah. The father and
[4149.199] the men and the men of the community in
[4150.719] general. And the men of the community in
[4152.48] general. Absolutely. Absolutely. So, and
[4155.52] and again, you know, at at say 12, 13
[4157.839] years old, it was believed you started
[4159.92] integrating boys into the society of of
[4163.839] adult men. Yeah. And and so now they're
[4166.4] taking that cultural imprint, they're
[4168.96] taking that generational imprint.
[4171.12] They're they're assuming the values of
[4173.44] the community, of their families, etc.
[4176.08] All of that has been severed. That's and
[4178.4] and it's gotten way more extreme from
[4181.199] the time like Rowan and I were in
[4184.239] school. You know what what strikes me
[4186.4] about that is that now so the pandemic
[4189.279] represented a real uh line of
[4192.279] demarcation uh between what you're
[4194.96] talking about which is still
[4196.56] persontoperson education right uh and
[4199.6] that more digital form of education. So,
[4202.96] it's strange like because you're you're
[4204.48] talking about it and it's it's you know,
[4205.679] I remember reading about this and
[4207.92] hearing about this uh throughout my teen
[4209.92] years this this notion that all of
[4212.64] education is set up basically to turn
[4214.48] you into a good docile factory worker
[4216.96] and that this whole model needs to be
[4218.48] jettisoned and we need to go back to
[4220.48] something else whatever it may be
[4221.76] whether it's like some Waldorf uh model
[4224.64] or whether it is uh you know the the is
[4228.0] it
[4229.08] monastery alternative education models
[4231.36] or something completely different, but
[4232.719] something besides this because a we
[4234.32] don't have a whole lot of manufacturing
[4235.52] jobs anyway and b this is b, you know,
[4237.679] just turning kids into obedient robots.
[4239.84] It's not teaching them how to be
[4241.44] organic, active, strong people in their
[4244.0] community. Well, the it's weird because
[4246.239] now I think we're reaching a point where
[4248.239] people are kind of looking back to that
[4249.76] with nostalgia as more and more uh
[4252.719] education consists of a kid with uh
[4255.36] maybe a laptop provided by the school or
[4257.44] their own staring at a screen all day.
[4260.0] And the the kind of cutting edge of this
[4262.159] experiment and this is already happening
[4263.92] right like the GPT is sufficiently
[4266.719] advanced that you can sit a kid in front
[4269.76] of it and even with all the
[4271.12] hallucinations and inaccurate
[4272.56] information that kid can still sit and
[4274.719] learn by asking questions of this thing
[4276.32] and this is happening right now as we
[4277.92] speak probably in houses you know right
[4279.92] down the road and it's going to happen
[4281.76] in larger and larger numbers. So it's
[4283.44] like and one of the arguments is exactly
[4286.48] that like that the old model was
[4288.92] homogenizing. The old model was creating
[4291.679] these uniform kind of factory farmed
[4294.48] kids basically. And this new model will
[4297.6] be more individualistic. This new model
[4299.44] will allow you to bond with an AI that
[4301.92] understands you maybe better than you
[4303.76] understand yourself and will be able to
[4305.84] tailor the education to you the kid, the
[4308.4] student or the adult u whatever the case
[4310.8] may be. I it's it's just I it's very
[4313.36] strange to me that you see that
[4315.44] progression away and it's not like I
[4317.04] want to go back to necessarily like
[4319.0] u log cabin schools you know that's not
[4323.76] necessarily the solution correct but but
[4326.159] right now it seems like the solution is
[4328.08] to just kind of ramp up the the
[4331.36] transformative technology or
[4333.36] transformative technique and instead of
[4335.679] having good little cogs in a machine
[4337.36] you'll have good little circuits in a
[4339.44] circuit board. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know,
[4343.679] who's going to make it out? Who's gonna
[4344.96] Are of us going to make it, Randall?
[4346.64] Well, you know, I tend to be optimistic.
[4349.6] Okay. All we need is enough, right?
[4352.0] Everybody doesn't have to make it, just
[4353.12] enough. One of the things, one of the
[4354.64] bright sides in my opinion to the whole
[4358.239] CO thing was that you had a few million
[4362.08] at least, and that could be a
[4363.36] conservative number, a few million
[4364.719] families decide to extricate themselves
[4367.52] from the industrial education system and
[4369.92] their homeschooling. And homeschooling
[4373.04] isn't the final answer to everything,
[4374.64] but you know, I I got involved with the
[4376.719] homeschooling movement via the Waldorf
[4378.88] system uh in the about
[4382.04] 1995. And I found that it was I had a
[4386.32] really good time working with with kids.
[4388.8] The kids that I worked with ranged
[4390.719] between 9 and 17. I had maybe 120 kids
[4393.84] that I tutored and I organized classes
[4396.64] and we did field trips and uh you know
[4400.0] we had a lot of fun. I taught ma
[4402.64] geometry and mathematics but what I did
[4405.12] was I kind of combined geometry and art.
[4408.719] So just like when I do a sacred geometry
[4411.199] workshop now it's all hands-on. You know
[4413.84] we we we do these drawings and the
[4416.48] drawings are essentially when you're
[4417.76] using a straight edge and a compass.
[4419.44] What I tell people is that is if you
[4421.28] know how to do this, you can go put a
[4423.28] pole in the ground and you can take a
[4424.8] knotted rope and you can duplicate
[4426.88] anything that we're drawing on this
[4428.48] paper out there in the field. And that's
[4430.719] how they did it, right? Um but so I got
[4434.56] the kids kind of combined art and
[4436.719] mathematics and I had parents tell me I
[4439.92] why don't they teach it this? Why don't
[4441.44] other pe I I don't know. It's just, you
[4443.36] know, mathematics and art, they're two
[4445.8] completely different domains that that
[4448.719] that barely overlap. Um, but I
[4452.56] definitely got the sense that there was
[4455.28] a whole different psychology amongst
[4457.28] kids who had not been subjected to that
[4461.28] system. And what really drove that home
[4463.36] to me was when I would get a call, their
[4465.6] parents were probably anthroposifists
[4467.12] too, right? Some of them. Yeah. Waldorf
[4469.92] school. Because of the Waldorf school.
[4471.28] Yeah. So that was going to set them
[4472.96] apart a little bit at the beginning. Set
[4474.239] them apart already, right? But but that
[4476.32] the first year that I did it, my
[4478.48] students, I think I had six of them.
[4480.08] They were all Waldorf kids. Their
[4482.64] parents were in fact in fact I probably
[4485.04] how I got to know them was Julie went to
[4487.199] some of those meetings. She was
[4488.48] interested in in in Steiner and his
[4490.48] teachings and all that. So, she got to
[4491.92] know the local anth anthroposifists and
[4494.8] they their Waldorf system, you know,
[4497.04] they'll they'll have a teacher that will
[4498.8] start with, I guess, their first grade
[4501.679] and go with them all the way up to 8th
[4503.36] grade. Um, and and obviously you've got
[4506.64] a smaller class, if you've got 20 kids
[4508.48] or whatever, and you've got one teacher,
[4510.48] you know, by the second or third year,
[4512.0] that teacher is going to know every kid
[4513.679] in the class. It's not going to be
[4515.679] impersonal. There's going to be a strong
[4517.52] connection.
[4519.28] And uh so I got approached by this
[4521.76] fellow that I knew who was in that group
[4523.92] and what had happened was they had
[4526.56] started the first Waldorf school and it
[4529.92] only went up to the eighth grade. So it
[4531.92] was the first graduating class from the
[4534.56] eighth grade and so a group of the
[4536.719] Waldorf parents got together. Didn't
[4538.719] want to send their children to public
[4540.48] school. So they rented a couple of rooms
[4543.76] in a little Lutheran church near here
[4546.159] that weren't being um occupied. And um
[4550.719] so this fellow Brad, he started a uh
[4553.84] they hired him as the main lesson
[4555.719] instructor and he organized the class
[4558.4] and he would bring in people specialists
[4560.64] with different subjects and topics and
[4563.199] he asked me if I would come in and do a
[4565.36] geometry program. This was in March of
[4568.719] 95. And I and we had some time and I
[4572.0] said, "Sure." And he said, "I'll pay you
[4573.52] for it." I said, "Well, in that case,
[4575.199] yeah, sure, I'll do it." So, I went in
[4577.92] there and I did two weeks and it was a
[4579.679] lot of fun. I enjoyed the kids. I think
[4581.44] we did only like four or five sessions
[4583.76] over the two
[4585.159] weeks. Uh, we got done and then I get a
[4588.64] call a few days later and he says, "The
[4591.199] kids were wondering if you would come
[4592.56] back and do more." Oh,
[4595.52] well,
[4597.199] they missed the the village elder. I
[4599.36] think that was it. Of course, I was
[4600.88] younger then and better looking. I know
[4603.84] that's hard to imagine, but I was. And
[4606.28] um so anyways, I went back and I did two
[4609.6] more weeks and then Bradley calls me
[4612.48] again after a few days, a kids really
[4615.44] were into this and they know there's
[4617.84] Would you come back? So I ended up
[4620.719] finishing out the year, right? So then
[4624.32] uh whatever um what is what is May not
[4627.92] Mayday um what is the uh Labor Day uh
[4633.28] Memorial Day Memorial Day. Thank you.
[4635.12] Memorial Day came uh school was out for
[4638.88] the summer. Then over the summer I
[4640.4] started getting phone calls from other
[4642.32] parents. So what this led into was 15
[4646.239] years of organizing classes and tutoring
[4650.08] classes um for kids and it got to the
[4654.239] point where maybe three or four years
[4655.52] later I don't even know if it was it had
[4657.92] gone beyond just Waldorfs but the one of
[4661.04] the things I noticed was I'd get a call
[4662.719] from parents my my son or my daughter
[4665.76] whatever is just struggling um in
[4669.6] school. They're not they're not fitting
[4671.92] in. you're not
[4673.96] learning. Can we can I you know would
[4676.48] you Okay. Yeah. And um first thing I
[4680.0] noticed was there was a very distinct
[4682.64] psychological and emotional discernable
[4685.6] distinction between the psychology and
[4687.92] emotions of kids that were say by the
[4690.239] time you get to middle school between
[4692.48] the kids that had been homeschooled
[4693.84] their whole life and kids that been in
[4695.28] public school. Oh yeah. Absolutely.
[4697.44] Yeah. Yeah. And it you you can see
[4699.12] detect it right away. And there there's
[4700.8] good and bad sides to that too. I mean,
[4703.12] you know, a number of my
[4704.92] friends raise their kids uh via
[4707.6] homeschool and it's like you see it's a
[4709.76] mixed bag, right? Some of the
[4711.199] experiments turn out well, some of them
[4713.04] not. And it's it's really across the
[4714.56] board because you have um you know,
[4716.48] socialization issue for the ones that
[4718.88] are really cloistered away from the the
[4721.36] other peers and they don't compete. They
[4723.679] don't they don't get out there and get
[4725.04] dirty with them. But then you have the
[4726.719] others that are just much freer. They
[4728.08] still make friends. They still are very
[4731.199] socialized, but they're also much more
[4732.719] adventurous and they're a lot less
[4734.719] differential to authority, right? You
[4737.36] know, you speak of, you know, you talk
[4738.88] about
[4739.8] Waldorf. Uh I've I've had a
[4742.56] long-standing interest for, you know,
[4743.92] decades with the anthroposophist and
[4746.48] Rudolph Steiner. U his ideas on
[4749.36] technology have been especially
[4751.679] intriguing to me in in recent years. uh
[4754.32] you're familiar with his notion of of
[4757.199] what the the primary forces of our
[4760.239] current epic are uh Christ and Lucifer
[4762.96] and Araman and uh you know Steiner he
[4767.6] certainly no Orthodox he was no orthodox
[4769.92] Christian but he he certainly saw Christ
[4773.36] as the the central focus of his life and
[4777.04] and the highest good in the universe. uh
[4781.04] but he had this very strange notion
[4782.96] about the evil forces or at least the
[4784.96] negative forces Lucifer and Aramman. Uh
[4787.6] it basically split the forces of evil if
[4790.0] you want to call that or the negativity
[4791.44] into two. And so you have on the one
[4793.44] hand Lucifer which represents passion
[4796.08] represents selfishness represents kind
[4798.48] of the ego youth vitality and art the
[4803.28] generator of creativity. Uh and then on
[4805.92] the other hand you have Araman which is
[4808.32] this kind of other pole the
[4809.88] calcification of that youth the the
[4813.239] calculation the the rather than being
[4815.679] uncontrolled like Lucifer it's the
[4817.36] desire to control to control others and
[4819.92] he associated that I mean you think
[4821.199] about Steiner he's he's coming up in the
[4822.96] early 1900s uh seeing the rise of this
[4827.36] technological system I mean the pace of
[4829.12] of change wasn't that dissimilar to the
[4832.0] pace of change now uh the sudden introd
[4834.96] introduction of communication
[4836.719] technologies and transportation
[4838.08] technologies, trains, steamships
[4839.92] becoming much more prevalent,
[4841.52] automobiles coming on u you telegraph,
[4844.679] radio, television I believe you live to
[4847.199] see. And so you know he associated this
[4850.159] technological growth with that armonic
[4853.28] principle that that that idea of control
[4855.92] and calc you know calcification you know
[4858.08] this rigidity and and this need to
[4860.8] calculate and control everything. Um
[4863.84] what's really you could say that there
[4866.88] were a lot of other artistic endeavors
[4868.8] that came up at the same time. It wasn't
[4871.28] like he was alone in this. The word
[4873.76] robot is coined in the early 20s right
[4877.28] in Czech Republic with the you know the
[4879.199] Rossam's universal robots. And so you
[4881.44] had this idea of robot of scientists
[4883.679] creating humanoids to do all the work
[4885.76] and the humanoids rebelling. The movie I
[4888.32] think you mentioned it in the book
[4890.0] Metropolis. metropolis. You had 1927 uh
[4894.239] Fritz Lang and and it sets out this idea
[4896.48] of a vast high-tech at that time
[4898.719] high-tech civilization in which the the
[4901.44] workers and the children are being fed
[4903.04] to Moolok, right? And the the the evil
[4905.04] industrialists and the evil
[4906.76] capitalists have lost their sense of
[4909.12] heart connection to the the working
[4910.96] hands, right? The the actual workers.
[4912.8] And you had the first like deep fake war
[4915.36] basically with Maria. You know, they
[4917.04] they they turn her into a kind of deep
[4919.04] fake to seduce the the populace and and
[4921.92] incite rebellion. So you had all these
[4923.44] ideas around, but something about one of
[4926.56] Steiner's visions really really bugged
[4929.12] me out mainly because there was a a
[4932.639] coincidence that was that corresponded
[4934.719] with it. I was living when I wrote the
[4936.719] book, I was living with an
[4937.679] anthroposifist, a a rad a retired
[4940.32] radiologist. And so we spent a lot of
[4942.639] time and he he also had massive book
[4945.199] bookshelves full of really interesting
[4947.52] literature but two shelves dedicated
[4949.6] solely to Rudolph Steiner and
[4951.199] anthroposphy. So, we discuss this a
[4952.8] whole lot and he kept telling me that
[4954.88] Rudolph Steiner had predicted the
[4956.4] worldwide web and but he couldn't find
[4959.84] the quotation and he was asking around
[4962.0] all these other anthroposph kind of in
[4963.84] this community, hey, do you know where
[4965.52] this is? None of them did. This guy
[4968.239] comes along uh and has just created a
[4971.12] collection of his books and he sent it
[4972.56] to me. And I'm standing there in the
[4974.48] house with this guy. And uh I was like,
[4977.199] well, it's about technology. Maybe we
[4979.199] can find this worldwide web prediction.
[4981.679] And I flipped through the book and the
[4983.36] very first page, open it up and look
[4985.52] down and there is the passage. You know,
[4987.84] it's one of those moments where you're
[4988.88] like, okay, this is kind of significant.
[4991.28] and the vision. And this is around the
[4992.8] same time. This is the 1920s, right? So
[4994.4] you've got um Carol Copek in Czech
[4998.48] Republic talking about robots. You've
[5000.4] got um JD Bernal talking about cyborgs,
[5005.679] you know, and and the world, the flesh,
[5007.76] and the devil. You've got Metropolis and
[5010.0] Fritz Lang. This is the same the same
[5011.679] time period. It's in the air. But the
[5013.52] way Steiner saw it in in his vision was
[5016.32] that as Arman became more and more in
[5019.12] control of the earth, right? And I
[5021.6] should say too for the audience, I don't
[5023.199] believe in this literally, right? But I
[5025.92] think that as a in the same way that any
[5027.84] work of art reflects reality in deeper
[5029.84] ways than the your eyes will see.
[5032.48] Steiner's vision did the same. So, as
[5034.96] Steiner, I'm sorry, as this armonic
[5037.679] figure, this mechanical sort of spirit,
[5039.92] this this demonic controlling entity
[5042.8] came to control the world more and more
[5045.76] over the next epic. And Lucifer kind of
[5048.639] faded in the background. The passions
[5050.32] faded in the background and became much
[5052.8] more mechanical and controlled. And
[5054.96] Christ is kind of becomes more distant
[5057.199] in this sense, right? the the higher
[5059.199] beings, the good beings become more
[5060.96] distant and the planet becomes
[5062.48] enshrouded in what Steiner described as
[5065.8] mineral plantlike spiderlike creatures.
[5069.84] So meaning that they're made from the
[5071.44] earth, the mineral, but they grow kind
[5074.719] of like plants, which is very very
[5076.8] similar to how a lot of artificial
[5078.56] intelligence engineers talk about what
[5080.56] they're doing by training these models.
[5083.12] And then these spiders, the spider sort
[5085.199] of image was that it would weave a web
[5087.76] around the planet, a worldwide web. And
[5091.04] these entities would be uh sources of
[5094.239] wisdom for the people that they would be
[5096.239] able to confer information to them. Sort
[5098.4] of like bots, you might say, crawling
[5101.44] across this worldwide web. And that
[5105.0] essentially you would have, you know,
[5107.199] again, this is kind of new age woo and
[5108.639] all that, but you know, the the good
[5110.0] souls would go away and the bad souls
[5111.6] would be stuck, but those that would
[5112.719] were stuck would have to merge with
[5115.44] these spiderlike creatures, would have
[5117.28] to merge with the bots. Um, it's
[5120.96] intriguing that I mean this is over a
[5122.639] hundred years ago and I think that the
[5125.12] the image itself, this image of a
[5127.76] worldwide web covered by essentially
[5131.32] mechanical beacons of wisdom that are
[5134.48] ultimately a trap. Um, it's a it's it's
[5138.08] a good analogy for uh the the
[5140.719] transformation we're seeing today. And
[5142.639] thanks to Rudolph Steiner and maybe this
[5144.8] is what they're teaching those Waldorf
[5146.159] kids. Maybe the next Tazinski will come
[5148.56] out of Waldworf.
[5150.719] Well, I always got the the impression
[5152.96] there was a component of Zoroastrianism
[5155.84] behind Yeah. Aram. Yeah. Yeah. And Ohur
[5159.44] Mazda. And I also find that reflected,
[5162.48] for example, in Freemasonry. Sure. The
[5164.88] symbolism of the checkerboard floor, the
[5167.6] the interaction between the the the the
[5170.719] light and the dark, between the positive
[5172.4] and the negative. And we know that um in
[5175.28] physics we know that it's just polarity
[5177.679] without that polarity things would just
[5180.48] completely stagnate. Um you know with
[5185.04] Zoraster himself his vision uh that the
[5188.32] good eventually does win in the end. You
[5190.88] know it's not it's not a total it is in
[5192.719] a sense almost equal and opposite forces
[5196.159] but there's I guess it's a 5149 and the
[5198.88] good eventually wins. He wasn't he
[5201.36] wasn't a total monster. That's Yeah,
[5204.08] that's kind of why I like Zorasser.
[5205.84] Yeah, that's kind of why I'm tend to be
[5207.679] an optimist is that that 5149 ratio.
[5210.96] Yeah. Kind of I I enough of us will make
[5214.0] it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and and so one of
[5218.96] the things that's Unless Unless a meteor
[5220.639] hits. Unless a meteor hits and then even
[5222.639] then enough of us will make it. Well, I
[5225.28] think here's what we need to do right
[5226.56] here. Go out and Okay. So, you do want
[5228.08] to have a log cabin school. Well, sort
[5229.92] of. I do. All right. I'll dig it. Yeah,
[5232.719] I'm with it. Yeah. So, see, I think that
[5237.199] the foundation of a healthy
[5239.92] psychological and emotional life is
[5242.719] being integrated as much as possible
[5245.12] with the natural world, the natural
[5247.12] cycles, the frequencies, the rhythms of
[5249.679] nature, all of that. And and I think
[5252.96] that that is kind of like the the an
[5257.159] authentic immunization against a lot of
[5260.56] the
[5261.8] susceptibility to to this.
[5265.12] Absolutely. And and and a reference
[5267.92] point like so you can sense like if you
[5269.84] if you grow up in a city your whole
[5271.04] life, you have no reference point,
[5272.4] right? You have less of a reference
[5273.92] point as to what is and isn't a a
[5276.239] completely unnatural intrusion or
[5277.92] invasion into your organic self. Rowan
[5280.56] and I have often times like scratched
[5282.96] our heads because, you know, in our
[5285.199] business, we'll get calls from people,
[5287.12] you know, well, we want to we want to
[5289.36] add a a nice master bedroom suite to our
[5292.0] house or we want to do this or that. So,
[5294.48] you start asking them some questions
[5296.08] before you go even go look at it. You'll
[5298.08] go, "Well, um, you know, what what's the
[5301.36] age of your house? How many square feet?
[5303.92] Um, you know, is it two bedroom, three
[5306.239] bath?" You go through this whole list of
[5307.6] question and then you say and then
[5309.12] you're trying to get the picture of
[5310.56] their house oriented to the larger
[5312.719] environment and you say okay which which
[5314.8] direction does your house face like if
[5317.28] you go out your front door which
[5318.8] direction are you facing and then people
[5321.6] who've lived there for 10 20 years and
[5323.44] they go oh I don't know
[5325.6] I don't know and it's like how is that
[5327.679] even pos how can you live in a house for
[5329.84] 20 years and you could don't know which
[5332.159] way it even faces how is that even I and
[5335.199] and the ideal is to have it facing east,
[5337.28] right? So the sun comes up into your
[5338.8] front door. Isn't this the uh the
[5340.48] mystical ideal or am I Well, it varies
[5343.12] what your objective is. If Now, if
[5345.52] you're trying to capture some of that
[5346.719] solar energy, you want it to Well, you
[5348.96] want to have a nice south facing from
[5352.4] the northern hemisphere. Yeah. See, I'm
[5354.719] I'm already Oh, look at this beautiful
[5356.4] cabin here. Let's just before I derail
[5358.4] this. Well, the point is is that science
[5360.159] is now actually showing uh let's see,
[5362.96] the escape of a trip into mountains or a
[5365.36] day lying by the beach may feel like an
[5367.44] extravagance to city dwellers confined
[5370.08] by a traditional work schedule, but
[5372.08] exposure to green and blue spaces is far
[5374.88] more than just a luxury. For kids,
[5377.679] growing up without regular exposure to
[5379.679] nature seems to have ripple effects that
[5381.44] persist into adulthood. And we won't get
[5383.679] into the whole thing, but basically what
[5385.199] it amounts to is that in the children
[5388.88] that are raised close to nature and
[5391.6] those who are deprived of it, there are
[5393.12] literally structural changes in the
[5395.04] brain. Yeah, I saw the biofilia
[5397.36] hypothesis and that's, you know, I I I
[5399.44] think that even if it's kind of overly
[5402.639] materialistic and misses some of the
[5404.8] spiritual woo that I I prefer to keep on
[5407.76] the horizon, uh it is it is there's a
[5410.0] place for spiritual. Yeah. Yeah, the the
[5412.4] bi the biophilia hypothesis of this idea
[5415.12] that the human mind evolved for these
[5418.159] green spaces, for open spaces, for pre
[5420.56] the presence of water that the reason we
[5422.639] find it beautiful is because those are
[5424.08] things that keep us alive and so
[5426.48] therefore like we need them as much
[5428.32] almost as much as we need say food or or
[5431.12] human
[5432.04] companionship. I I completely agree. I
[5434.4] you see you see people who were raised
[5437.52] in in and around like natural systems
[5440.159] versus city people. Nothing against my
[5442.719] urban brothers and sisters, but sure uh
[5445.04] there's a marketked difference and one
[5447.679] that I think is there. Yes. And and so
[5451.04] part of my game plan for tilting the
[5454.32] balance towards the
[5457.0] 51% is to as much as
[5459.96] possible just like with regenerative
[5462.4] agriculture which is something I'm very
[5464.96] much an advocate of regenerative
[5467.159] education and getting kids as much as
[5470.48] possible out of the factory system out
[5473.199] of the industrialized just like trying
[5475.92] to move beyond industrialized farming
[5478.48] because I look the industrialized
[5480.4] farming and you've got the cow or the
[5482.32] saw saw in that narrow little um
[5486.56] confining space. They're fed hormones
[5488.8] and antibiotics and all of that to keep
[5491.639] them, you know, from these from the the
[5494.719] diseases that they would be getting.
[5496.4] Kind of like middle schoolers in
[5497.6] Atlanta. Yes, it is. I mean, I look at
[5500.4] that and I think of these kids in these
[5502.08] schools and I'm like, "Oh my god, it's
[5504.239] Yeah, the the analogy here is is quite
[5508.4] uh appropriate." You know what else you
[5510.159] do to animals in the factory farming
[5511.679] system? At least at least some of them.
[5514.48] You chip them, you tag them. Sure. You
[5517.36] know, and that's that's
[5520.0] next up with the the middle schoolers.
[5521.52] And we were already hearing stuff like
[5522.96] that with the with the whole CO
[5524.56] phenomena. Well, yeah. And it goes back
[5526.48] before I mean, it goes back to the the
[5527.84] late 90s. Yeah. uh the first human-grade
[5531.04] RFID chip, right, to be patented. Uh
[5534.239] that was
[5535.4] 1997. And of course that, you know, in
[5538.4] the leadup to the year 2000, people
[5540.159] really tripping out. I mean, you already
[5541.76] had human implantable technologies going
[5544.56] way back before that. But what you had
[5546.48] there, you know, in cattle, it had been
[5548.48] used all over the place, right? RFID
[5550.48] chips, just an, you know, radio
[5552.08] frequency identification tag. You can
[5553.679] just scan it and this is this cow, this
[5556.08] that cow, this is this pig, this that
[5557.6] pig. the the kind of glass encased RFID
[5561.6] chip that was patented 97. I think the
[5564.4] first uh real roll out of it was 2004
[5568.32] and now um the I I I need to really
[5571.36] update my um information on this but as
[5574.0] of 2019
[5576.48] uh the company Dangerous Things which
[5578.239] sells these implants for people uh which
[5581.52] are injected not unlike a piercing the
[5584.48] the gun looks much like a piercing gun
[5586.48] and or I mean a piercing kind of
[5589.52] contraption. There's a roughly u 100 to
[5593.28] 150,000 people or so probably really
[5595.92] with uh you know this is just an
[5598.08] estimate right uh but there are there
[5600.96] are a lot of people across the planet
[5603.12] many tens of thousands we could say
[5605.12] safely across the planet who have
[5607.44] voluntarily taken the chip into their
[5609.6] palm uh very popular examples in Sweden
[5613.52] um and you odd because people associate
[5615.76] Sweden with like COVID freedom and
[5617.199] whatnot but Sweden's also the most
[5618.96] atheistic or among among the most
[5620.8] atheistic and irreligious populations on
[5623.36] earth. So they don't have the kind of
[5624.639] hang-ups with the mark of the beast sort
[5626.159] of thing. And um again this is a little
[5629.199] outdated but so there's a company
[5630.84] Biohacks, another company called
[5632.679] Epicenter. Uh both of them are involved
[5635.44] in this sort of chipping fetish and uh
[5638.4] among the Swedes who have kind of gotten
[5641.92] into this they have this process called
[5643.36] a cyborg birthday. Um basically the day
[5647.6] you get your chip that you've truly
[5649.12] merged with the machine and then from
[5651.52] there it's just this mundane thing. Oh I
[5653.12] would use my chip to pay for my train
[5655.12] ticket or you know use my chip for my
[5657.199] groceries. Again this is just thousands
[5659.36] right of a country of many many more you
[5661.28] know this is a tiny minority but you do
[5663.52] wonder um in the same way that uh other
[5667.199] technologies were at first like this
[5669.04] kind of uh you know avant guard there
[5671.76] just people who who fetishize it right
[5673.52] whether it's a smartphone a pager um you
[5676.88] know even like you know robots um I do
[5680.159] wonder like if either through kind of
[5683.76] conditioning people could be more
[5685.04] conditioned to be comfortable with the
[5686.56] chip in the case of kids like in your
[5688.239] middle school, right? Like the the
[5690.08] cattle the factory farming middle school
[5692.48] down the road here. If if the argument
[5694.96] is made and the argument has been made,
[5697.04] right, this was an argument that was
[5698.239] made in Claus Schwab's fourth industrial
[5700.159] revolution. It's been made by many kind
[5702.4] of pro tech people. If there is a
[5705.6] concern that your child could either go
[5707.76] missing or be kidnapped and if you could
[5710.4] mitigate that risk by chipping your
[5712.48] child, then would you not be a negligent
[5715.28] parent for not chipping your child? And
[5719.36] just like you would chip a dog. Sure.
[5721.6] And um I wonder I mean right now again
[5723.52] it's just like this tiny minority and
[5724.96] most people are pretty freaked out by it
[5726.159] and they don't want anything to do with
[5727.28] it. But could a sufficient crisis like
[5730.0] with COVID, like with 9/11, whatever. Uh
[5732.56] could a sufficient crisis push the
[5735.12] population to accept it in large
[5736.96] numbers? I don't know. The I mean, we
[5739.6] were hearing, you know, mandatory
[5741.639] vaccinations. Yeah, that was part of the
[5744.199] whole explan
[5746.719] uh narrative at the time. You know, I is
[5750.239] there Yeah. I mean I I don't know there
[5752.719] you know my my main concern there would
[5754.48] be well okay if you've got let's say a
[5756.96] special needs child and you need to
[5758.88] track well that's one thing if it's
[5760.88] simply intimately between the parents
[5762.639] and their children you bring in the
[5765.199] government or some large corporation or
[5767.28] something now it's a whole different
[5768.8] animal but it's in the case just of the
[5771.199] chip right just an RFID chip basic RFID
[5774.639] chip you're not going to like make a
[5777.12] homemade one you know what I mean more
[5779.04] than likely um It's going to be
[5781.199] something that is going to have to be a
[5783.44] company that makes it for you. I see.
[5785.28] And you're going to need an
[5786.0] infrastructure that makes it relevant,
[5787.52] right? If nobody can scan it, if the ID
[5789.76] doesn't mean anything in a larger
[5791.12] system, then it's doesn't doesn't have
[5793.52] the same uh effect. I maybe I don't
[5795.92] know. I I I wonder I remember in the
[5798.32] late '9s and uh and it was a great time
[5800.96] for apocalypse theor theorizing, but I
[5804.0] remember in the late ' 90s people just
[5805.44] tripping out like the the mark of the
[5807.199] beast will be a chip in the hand, a a
[5810.4] barcode on the forehead. That was before
[5812.159] brain implants was like really deep in
[5814.239] the consciousness. Um and you know,
[5816.4] you'll have a mass digital system of
[5818.4] surveillance that will control people
[5820.639] like machines and that will be the end
[5823.44] of the world. By the year 2000, you will
[5825.04] see it. it will be over basically and
[5827.679] maybe people will be raptured so on and
[5829.28] so forth. 2000 came and went. But you
[5831.679] know what's weird is that the the
[5834.0] overall vision did come true. You know
[5836.8] post 911 you saw like a slight sh a very
[5841.08] large shift in that direction. It wasn't
[5844.0] as cosmic. It wasn't as cartoonish.
[5845.84] There were not you know uh locusts with
[5848.719] scorpion tails and human faces flying
[5850.719] around. But now you have drone swarms
[5853.52] and you know they don't have human faces
[5856.239] and scorpion tales but on a kind of
[5858.239] symbolic level they sure do feel like
[5859.76] that. Um yeah I you know this you could
[5863.6] you could riff on sort of apocalyptic
[5865.6] themes all day long but I I do think
[5867.92] that there's something to even though
[5870.8] the end has always been nigh like in
[5873.04] every generation there's somebody
[5874.96] screaming the end is nigh and some
[5876.56] generations you have millions of people
[5878.239] who believe that the end is nigh and it
[5879.76] never seems to get you know, it's it's
[5882.08] always just around the corner. Never
[5884.239] thankfully here we are. But I I do think
[5886.8] that that that sort of dark imagery just
[5889.04] like with Rudolph Steiner that you know,
[5891.199] just like with John of Patmos, just like
[5892.8] with you know, old Ted Kazinski for all
[5894.88] his flaws, that that that sense of that
[5897.04] that that dark sense that maybe, just
[5899.28] maybe, this technological system that
[5901.679] we're building around ourselves or
[5903.36] allowing to be built around ourselves
[5905.6] isn't for our good and maybe it's for
[5908.96] our detriment. Anyway, I send the kids
[5911.199] into the woods. Biophilia thousand%.
[5913.679] Yeah, send the kids or or to
[5914.8] Merryweather Academy. My friend uh
[5917.199] Warren uh is running a a place called
[5919.84] Merryweather Academy. Maybe you've heard
[5921.36] of it. We've been hearing about it and
[5923.04] I'm obviously want to hear more about
[5924.719] it. So, next time Warren and I get
[5926.96] together, we're going to talk about
[5928.56] that. And we've we've been actively
[5931.04] proactively now starting to look at
[5932.88] properties um where some of these things
[5936.719] alternatives can start
[5938.92] manifesting. Um so yeah uh how long have
[5942.719] we been going? Hour and 40 minutes. It's
[5946.639] probably time to wrap it up. I mean we
[5948.8] could go for another hour
[5950.52] but you know we could always do this
[5952.48] again. That's you big dog. I'm just
[5954.4] around the corner. Yeah. So we can do
[5956.239] easily we can do this again if you're up
[5957.92] for it. Yeah. Okay. So, I think any So,
[5961.28] any concluding thoughts? I mean, there's
[5963.04] so much we we just didn't get into, you
[5965.44] know? I'm like everything you're saying
[5966.96] is triggering uh Yeah. responses in my
[5969.76] mind that we're we're just not going to
[5971.679] get to go there. Um but yeah, so we
[5974.96] should definitely do a follow-up
[5976.159] conversation. I think there's more. I
[5977.679] want to hear more about the new book
[5978.96] you're writing. And um any any
[5982.239] concluding thoughts that we want to
[5986.239] anything to just for people to take take
[5989.679] with them to think about? Let me let me
[5992.0] let me plug your book. The book here is
[5994.88] Dark Eon. I haven't quite finished it. I
[5998.08] got to
[5999.719] 270 pages and then I jumped forward to
[6003.119] chapter 13 because you recommended I
[6005.199] should read that. And look, you can see
[6007.84] I've been defiling your book with
[6009.76] highlights. That's enhancement. That's
[6012.159] uh Okay. Yeah. Show the book again.
[6014.719] Okay. So, right here, this is dark eon.
[6018.239] Lower. Yeah. Lower. That's good. Right
[6020.719] there. Can I read a passage out of it?
[6022.48] Sure. Okay.
[6027.8] Um, what remains, this is page 383, what
[6032.0] remains of our American republic is
[6034.639] being demolished and
[6036.44] restructured by the titans of techno
[6039.44] capital and the global American empire.
[6043.119] Its fractured shell is being repurposed
[6045.6] by the lofty equality
[6048.84] casts of globalism and latestage liberal
[6053.239] democracy. With hybrid technoccommunism
[6056.639] seeping into the
[6058.28] cracks, the internet, once a spearhead
[6061.92] of open inquiry and free speech, has
[6065.36] become the most powerful platform for
[6067.679] mass surveillance and mind control in
[6070.48] human history.
[6072.56] That gets a fist bump.

Title: Deflation Is Natural, Inflation Is Policy
[0.0] We as an individual people, we don't
[2.0] have much control on the federal level,
[4.319] but we have a whole lot more control on
[6.16] the state level. Look at precoid prices
[9.2] have basically doubled. The purchasing
[11.519] power of our American dollar is about
[14.16] half of what it was precoid. Why is
[16.56] this? Because the government keeps on
[18.72] deficit spending. They keep printing out
[21.6] the money and there's no direct
[23.439] connection between the volume of money
[25.76] and the actual tangible assets in
[28.16] society. If the assets doesn't double,
[30.72] but you double the fiat money supply,
[32.96] each dollar is only worth half of what
[34.8] it was in terms of purchasing power than
[37.04] it was before. And inflation is not a
[40.0] natural thing. The natural thing is
[42.32] actually deflation because look what
[44.8] happens. Examples of deflation where you
[47.36] have industries that were not
[48.719] overregulated by the government right
[50.559] here. What would the first remote mobile
[53.36] phones cost? A lot of money and only
[55.68] rich people could afford them. So if you
[57.68] spend a thousand bucks in 1979, know
[60.719] that would be like spending eight or
[63.12] $10,000 now. But what they don't
[65.119] understand is to an evolving free market
[68.4] society. There is an important critical
[70.799] role for the for the rich people. And
[72.799] without those rich people, you wouldn't
[74.88] have this. If you come and you start
[76.72] complaining about, oh, we got to get rid
[78.24] of the billionaires. Well, why don't you
[79.68] start by throwing away your mobile
[81.439] phone? And we have a whole segment of
[83.28] American society now that thinks through
[85.36] that lens.

Title: Why Minimum Wage Hikes Can Backfire
[0.08] In this early 70s, I went and got jobs
[3.12] working for less than minimum wage so
[6.4] that I could get the opportunity to
[8.48] learn skills. Once I learned those
[10.8] skills, I was my market value went up.
[13.28] Yeah. Right. That's how it works, right?
[15.519] But that was a decision that was made
[17.279] between me and my employer. In uh 1966,
[20.88] minimum wage was a buck 20 an hour. I
[23.359] went to work at a gas station for 6
[25.119] months for 85 cents an hour. Nobody came
[27.359] in and said, "We're not going to allow
[29.359] you to work for $1.20." And had I came
[32.8] in here knowing nothing, I probably
[35.12] wasn't worth a$120 an hour. You know
[37.2] what I mean? So, you hire somebody, you
[40.719] have to make an investment. You have to
[43.28] spend money to bring that person. Now,
[46.239] what's going to happen when you have a
[47.76] skilled carpenter who's making $15 an
[50.719] hour? Now, somebody comes in who has no
[53.32] skills and they're getting paid as much
[55.44] as the skilled carpenter who's got three
[57.039] to five years under his belt. Well, you
[59.52] got to pay them $20 an hour or $25 an
[62.68] hour. That's pure inflation. Well,
[65.199] that's the other dimension of economics
[67.84] that it seems like a lot of well-meaning
[70.08] people on the liberal side of the
[72.159] spectrum don't understand that basic
[74.88] concept. Accept.

Title: The 17th Amendment Broke the Balance
[0.16] rid of the 17th amendment and now the
[2.399] senators are going to be working for the
[4.0] states that sent them there. the way it
[5.44] is set up now just set up it's a system
[7.2] for total corruption and I think you can
[9.12] begin to see why that works and what the
[11.599] wisdom of the founding fathers was was
[13.36] to try to create a system that minimized
[16.56] that possibility and kept the control of
[20.16] the machinery of the state in the hands
[23.279] of the state governments and of the
[25.68] people of the states because they knew
[28.48] that it's a whole lot easier to the
[30.56] closer you are to the people themselves
[32.96] the more they're going to be able to
[34.48] deter determine what's going on. Each
[37.12] time you remove one degree of distance
[40.48] further from the people themselves,
[42.64] which is what we've got now, the harder
[44.559] it is to control what they're doing. And
[47.28] so we as an individual people, we don't
[49.52] have much control on the federal level,
[51.84] but we have a whole lot more control on
[53.6] the state level. Now, if the senatorial
[56.879] races come back to the state
[58.64] governments, well, yeah, if they go and
[60.719] they start taking bribes, which is what
[62.8] this is, it's bribery, a system of
[65.199] legalized bribery. Until the American
[67.439] people wake up and learn about this,
[69.68] it's not going to change. And the other
[71.92] problem is is that the triad of control
[75.119] is now they've got control of the media
[77.28] and they've got control of education.

Title: You’re Not an Isolationist—You’re Anti-Empire
[0.16] Basically, the whole domino theory was
[1.839]  We got to the '9s and you had
[4.4] the the neocons and the neocons
[7.359] basically had a whole different plan for
[9.36] America. They didn't want America to go
[11.88] isolationist, which it wasn't really
[13.84] isolationist. If you're engaging with
[15.839] other countries and other cultures, but
[17.68] the way they framed it is if you didn't
[19.279] want this aggressive hegemonic foreign
[21.92] policy, you are an isolationist. They
[24.24] still do that. Here's somebody talking
[26.56] against being involved in Ukraine or
[28.24] being in against being involved in the
[30.4] Middle East. Oh, you're an isolationist.
[32.399] No, I'm not an isolationist. I'm for all
[35.2] kinds of exchange, cultural exchange,
[37.44] artistic exchange, scientific exchange,
[40.239] all these kinds of things. I'm a
[41.719] non-imperialist. Yeah, that's exactly
[43.68] what it is. But they they got control of
[47.039] the narrative in the Daddy Bush years.
[49.52] And then the Clinton administration, two
[51.68] terms of the Clinton administration
[53.84] again was totally dominated by the
[56.199] neocon. And then of course when you get
[59.12] Bush Jr. in there, that's when the big
[61.76] flip occurred. How in the world does
[63.76] they cannot tell this guy's just
[65.36] bullshitting?

Title: Why the Founders Never Wanted Senators to Campaign
[0.16] Dr. Oz's senatorial race was the most
[3.52] expensive, approximately 375 million.
[7.2] What? In the original constitutional
[9.36] system, there wouldn't be any of that
[11.519] because the senators were chosen out of
[13.92] the state legislative bodies. They
[16.0] didn't campaign. They didn't raise
[17.84] money. They didn't make promises. They
[20.0] didn't make commitments. There was no
[22.119] bribery because they weren't running
[24.96] election campaigns. They were getting
[27.08] chosen by the state legislative bodies.
[32.0] Each state was free to decide their own
[34.16] way of choosing their senators to send
[36.48] to Washington to represent state
[38.92] interests. Well, that got overthrown in
[41.6] 1913 with the 17th amendment that took
[44.0] away the control of the state
[46.0] legislative bodies over the senates and
[48.879] now senators had to go out and start
[50.879] campaigning just like the congressman in
[53.52] the house, right? Because the founding
[56.079] fathers in their wisdom knew that yeah,
[58.8] you got the house. They're going to be
[60.48] subject to whatever the whims of a
[63.039] transient majority that could change
[65.6] from one year to the next. They're going
[67.76] to be subject to the bribery. You know
[69.84] that people are going to be, you know,
[71.68] offering them deals and making
[73.799] contributions and they're going to be
[75.68] subject to all of this stuff and to
[77.92] immunize and spent raise money. This is
[80.64] why they were served why senators first
[82.799] served for six years. And they're
[85.119] chosen.

Title: Venezuela, Sanctions & the Roots of the Crisis
[0.08] A lot of the concern right now is
[1.76] Venezuelan gangs, right? And so a lot of
[4.08] the deportations have been supposed V
[6.96] Venezuelan gangs. And I have no doubt
[8.8] that Venezuelan gang members in the US,
[11.759] they might be doing whatever, you know,
[13.679] bringing in fentinel. They might be
[15.28] involved in setting up human trafficking
[17.92] networks. We don't really know. But
[20.24] here's the thing. What's going on in
[22.24] Venezuela right now? Well, it's the
[24.32] byproduct of a couple of things. And you
[26.56] can trace it directly to our own
[28.0] intervention both militarily and
[29.92] economically. For example, the sanctions
[32.399] against Venezuela have destroyed their
[34.64] economy. It's caused a mass exodus from
[38.399] So you get the Maduro, the communists in
[40.64] there. So they're imposing their regime
[43.28] of imposing by force the lowest common
[45.879] denominator. Then our government imposes
[48.64] sanctions on them. Venezuela was the
[50.879] most oil richch country in South
[52.719] America. They should have a booming
[54.96] economy. They should have multiple
[57.36] millionaires. And between centralized
[60.48] government power in the form of Marxism
[62.8] and then the US response of these
[65.439] imposing these heavy uh sanctions has
[67.92] completely destroyed their economy. So
[70.159] now you have these wave after wave of
[72.88] people immigrating out. The great
[74.72] exodus. And where are they coming?
[76.56] They're coming here. And then you have
[78.24] the Biden administration that opened the
[80.159] borders and they're all coming in here.
[82.0] don't seem to ask, well, why are all
[84.32] these people leaving their homeland and
[86.24] trying to get into the United States?
[88.56] You got to ask that question. And almost
[91.479] invariably what you see the chaos that
[94.88] has led to these mass immigrations from
[97.52] these countries. Our own government has
[100.24] had a big hand in

Title: We Were One Step from World War III
[0.08] we were ready to go to World War II over
[2.32] that, right? I think it's probably to
[4.24] Putin's forbearance that we're still
[6.08] here, that we haven't gone to from a
[8.24] from a cold war into a hot war with
[10.559] Russia because you know, people don't
[12.719] realize how close we were getting to
[14.24] that at the end of the Biden
[15.64] administration. I mean, we were
[17.52] literally a hair's breath. They were
[19.279] moving these long range hypersonic
[21.119] missiles into Ukraine that now had the
[24.0] capacity to reach Moscow. I think that
[26.24] within a month or two of Kla Harris had
[28.48] been elected, those missiles would have
[30.32] been flying. This war, this
[31.92] confrontation with Russia would have
[33.28] gone hot. But I wish the American people
[35.36] would get their heads out of their
[37.36]  and pay attention to what's
[39.12] going

Title: Why Lost Civilizations Scare Them
[0.16] If people believe conspiracy theories
[2.72] being promoted by Graham, why they might
[5.12] believe that, you know, that there's a
[7.12] conspiracy about global warming is a
[9.679] conspiracy, they might even believed, if
[11.92] you believe that archaeologists would
[13.599] lie, well, you might even believe that
[15.679] politicians would lie. The problem is is
[18.64] that reality is much much more dynamic
[22.96] than the static models change that we're
[26.56] being spoonfed through academia, through
[30.08] the educational system, through
[31.76] mainstream media, and through the
[33.2] political hierarchy. And their
[36.6] precarious control, social control they
[39.6] have depends upon that strict control of
[43.28] the narrative. Because if it's a house
[45.76] of cards, you might just pull one card
[48.559] out and the whole damn thing collapses.
[50.719] All right. So, if we accept the fact
[52.079] that there might have been civilizations
[53.92] that have been lost to history, well
[55.76] then that would raise the question,
[57.039] well, what caused an ancient
[58.719] civilization to become lost?

Title: What If It’s Not One Impact—But 100?
[0.16] We do computer modeling to let's say
[2.8] model a meteor the size of 150 ft in
[5.759] diameter roughly the size of the iron
[8.0] asteroid that struck Arizona. We can
[10.48] model we in coefficients for its density
[13.12] for its velocity for its angle of
[14.719] approach. We can then calculate how much
[16.8] energy is released during that
[19.119] particular impact. We can then
[21.119] conjecture about the consequences. We
[23.199] can say okay it's going to release a
[24.64] fireball. There's going to be x amount
[26.96] of material, volume of material injected
[29.599] into the atmosphere. There's going to be
[31.439] fallback material, what we call fallback
[33.6] brecha is going to come back to the
[35.44] earth, perhaps start secondary fires.
[38.399] What happens though if it's a 100
[40.399] impacts or more? You see how suddenly it
[42.879] gets so complicated? What happens if we
[45.44] have meteors falling into a forested
[47.68] area where there can be huge forest
[49.84] fires generated falling into an aid area
[52.64] like a desert where there's not the
[54.559] forests. We know from Tungusa that about
[57.84] 200 square miles of the impact zone was
[61.28] incinerated. What happens over the
[63.28] oceans?

Title: Politics, War & Propaganda in the 60s
[0.08] At the age of 17, I could tell the
[2.0] difference between the propaganda when
[3.6] Nixon was running against Hubert
[5.359] Humphrey. How can anybody watch this
[6.96] guy? He's obviously lying. You know,
[8.72] this was that campaign. I'm 1968. I'm
[11.44] And I would be sitting in front of the
[12.639] TV going, "How in the world does they
[14.799] cannot tell? This guy's just
[16.0] bullshitting." And then, of course, his
[17.6] plan was peace with honor. So, he was
[19.92] going to get us on. He ran on the peace
[22.0] campaign. Lyndon Johnson had been a
[24.08] Democrat. You know, Johnson took over
[25.84] after the assassination of Kennedy.
[27.76] Johnson was the one to really accelerate
[31.119] the deployment of American troops to
[33.36] Vietnam because well the reason Kennedy
[35.76] had to go was because number one mainly
[38.559] I think it was because he was becoming
[40.719] uh anti-war. He already you know after
[43.04] the Cuban the Bay of Pigs fiasco he
[45.84] didn't trust the CIA anymore. So he was
[48.399] actually thinking maybe we should pull
[50.079] the plug on the CIA. He was the one who
[52.239] pushed through the limited test ban
[53.84] treaty in 1963 because you know up until
[56.84] 1963 the United States and the Soviet
[59.44] Union were testing hundreds of nuclear
[62.8] big explosions in the atmosphere that
[65.92] was going on. Planet actually is still
[68.4] reeling in a way from the aftermath of
[70.799] that massive testing campaign. And it
[73.6] was Kennedy that got the limited. He
[77.119] wanted to get the comprehensive testban
[79.36] treaty which would have also eliminated
[82.24] underground nuclear testing. But he got
[85.0] the limited testban treaty passed in '
[88.439] 63 that put an end to the United States
[92.72] and Soviet Union atmospheric testing.
[95.2] And that was a huge step. Now of course
[97.04] then he's assassinated in November.
[100.159] Johnson becomes president and then
[102.96] January through March of
[105.88] 1964 is when the buildup really started
[108.72] in Vietnam.

Title: Long-Haired Messengers of the Cosmos
[0.08] A comet is a celestial body moving about
[2.399] the sun in an elongated orbit usually
[5.6] consisting of a central mass the nucleus
[8.96] surrounded by a misty envelope which is
[11.519] the coma. It extends into a stream which
[15.28] is the tail in the direction away from
[18.16] the sun. It's taken from the middle
[19.92] English which is taken from the Latin
[22.16] which comes from the stem of comea or
[24.56] cometa which is taken from the Greek and
[27.359] that is a modification of cometes which
[30.16] literally means long-haired and for
[33.12] anybody who has ever seen a comet should
[36.0] know you you would know that with the
[38.16] tail you can almost imagine that
[40.96] somebody in earlier times might have
[43.04] looked at this phenomena and seen the
[45.68] tail of the comet almost as if it is
[48.719] long hair streaming out. The tail is the
[52.0] gaseous, the ion, basically plasma. The
[55.52] trail is actual debris that is spalling
[58.96] off of the comet. Now, we now know that
[61.6] comets have a life cycle. And in the
[64.159] final stages of their life cycle, they
[66.799] begin to disintegrate. That's part of
[68.88] their final phase of their existence or
[71.6] their life cycle is that they begin to
[74.479] disintegrate.

Title: The Solar System Is Bigger Than You Think
[0.16] what exactly it is you're looking at.
[2.32] You can see here this is like a sphere.
[5.04] This is the the the UR cloud. It's it's
[7.52] generally spherical. Then you have the
[9.679] the Kyper disc is a flattened area
[13.24] that most likely just grades into the
[16.08] the spherical cloud. And you can see
[18.4] what this graphic here. Here's this is
[20.4] showing the area the region of the inner
[23.279] planets. And that of course is the
[26.32] region within which we reside on planet
[29.439] earth. Now the thing is is we have to
[32.64] now enlarge our thinking because we
[35.28] generally think of well the solar system
[37.28] oh yeah it's it's the sun and nine
[39.2] planets. We always think of the solar
[41.04] system as being well the nine planets
[42.8] but really we have to enlarge our
[44.239] thescape scope of our thinking now to
[46.239] include the kyper disc and the york
[48.079] cloud cuz they are an integral part of
[50.239] the whole system and how it works.
[51.68] Without those we essentially the the
[53.92] whole thing wouldn't wouldn't function
[55.36] at all. The point is is that these are
[57.76] in a sort of a quasi stable
[60.8] configuration. I would say they're very
[63.12] very s sensitive to any kind of
[65.519] perturbation at all. Now what's going to
[67.6] happen out there is those cloud comets
[70.479] that zone goes almost like halfway to
[73.76] the nearest stars which is 3 to four
[76.4] five light years away. If it gets
[78.24] jostled it might go one of two things.
[81.2] It might go further away from the sun
[83.84] and get captured into the orbit of
[86.159] another star or it could start migrating
[88.72] towards the sun. Now the Kyper disc
[91.439] might be more influenced by the
[93.92] gravitational effects of the big four
[96.24] outer gaseous planets. What you're
[98.079] seeing here would be the first phase in
[100.24] the life cycle of a comet, which is
[101.92] they're out there essentially in deep
[103.759] freeze. But if something disturbs them
[106.159] and they start migrating in towards the
[108.64] solar system, then they enter another
[111.52] phase of their life cycle. They actually
[113.36] become active. And then as they come
[114.88] into the inner solar system or move
[116.72] towards the sun, they begin to wake

[0.08] To this day, you still got Vietnam vets
[2.159] that suffering from the trauma cuz there
[4.96] was some bad that went on over
[6.56] there. Some really bad
[9.51] [Music]
[18.65] [Music]
[32.48] We were all 18, 19 years old and you
[35.04] just form a a bond no matter where
[37.36] you're from. Talk to anybody, no your
[39.84] parents, your loved ones or nothing.
[41.76] Right. It took a lot of toll. That's a
[43.6] big toll on a lot of people.
[46.46] [Music]
[55.84] and and some of the guys I knew who
[57.44] didn't want to talk about it went over
[58.719] and they got swept up in the craziness
[60.559] of it and and and wanted killed
[63.359] civilians and came back and were just
[65.439] tortured by what they had done over
[67.6] there. So there's a whole long brutal
[69.6] story of that that that needs to be
[71.76] told. The younger generation doesn't
[73.439] know the specifics and details of that
[75.36] story, but it needs to be told because
[77.2] it was a major inflection point in
[78.96] American history. In the aftermath of
[80.96] it, then was this further consolidation
[83.759] of centralized control over the nar the
[86.32] narrative, the historical narrative, the
[88.799] current events narrative, and so on. In
[90.96] a way, yeah, it's ironic, isn't

Title: The 60s & 70s, The State, The System, The Silence & The Awakening | The Big Picture Ep 7
[0.16] break free from this realm of
[2.04] superficiality and take the big picture
[7.44] [Music]
[17.32] in. Look at there. That's Aquatenial
[20.16] Canoe Derby Racers left Biji on July
[23.119] 14th, 1960 for Minneapolis. Four 540
[27.359] miles away.
[30.56] That's a great picture. I know. And all
[33.04] these guys, for the most part, they all
[34.719] build their own
[37.0] canoes. Um, yeah, this was a huge sport.
[40.0] I mean, look at the people lined up. And
[42.0] so there would be, you know, viewpoints
[44.399] all along the race. So people would, you
[46.719] know, after the the teams had departed,
[48.64] they would all jump in their cars and go
[50.48] drive down, you know, to to wherever the
[52.399] next viewpoint was. Uh, so maybe we'll
[55.92] put together a Cosmoggonia rowing team.
[60.6] Yeah. Look here. Here's Tom
[64.519] Estus. So, and here here is Do you see
[67.84] this Eugene J? This was Shorty right
[69.92] here. So, my dad partnered with these
[73.2] guys multiple times. Sometimes with Tom
[75.28] and sometimes with Shorty. Uh, so this
[78.24] was July 23rd, 1949. of course this is
[81.04] so I'm not I'm not in the world yet.
[84.92] Um so after winning the Aquatenial Canoe
[88.479] Derby in record time so they had just
[90.32] set the world record for this particular
[94.439] race.
[97.56] Um yeah here they winners of the derby
[100.479] three straight years 48 49 and 50 were
[103.36] Tom Estus left and Eugene Jensen of St.
[106.799] Louis Park. They're shown waxing their
[109.2] sleek number 13 canoe at St. Cloud in
[112.52] 1949 before taking off on the final 72mi
[116.64] lap to the finish line. Now, you got to
[120.159] bear in mind, too, that you're you're
[122.24] not only paddling dozens of miles, you
[124.719] also have to get out and portage and you
[127.2] throw the canoe on your shoulder and you
[128.959] run with it.
[135.44] This is Buzzy right
[138.44] here. That was my dad. This is the guy
[140.959] my who partnered with my dad more than
[143.68] that was his most regular partner was
[145.44] Buzz Peterson right
[147.16] there. And he was a force to be reckoned
[151.08] with. Let's see here. So here. Yeah,
[154.48] they're just right getting lined up at
[156.16] the starting
[159.959] line. All right. So, there's Buzz
[162.239] Peterson with his
[163.64] son. Uh, of course, he's not in This is
[167.84] not 2021 because he's been gone by that.
[170.239] It's probably the Hall of Fame
[171.84] nominations. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's
[173.92] what it would be. Yeah. Yep.
[178.76] Uh, yeah. I mean, look at these guys.
[180.959] Look at the the musculature on these
[182.959] guys.
[184.12] That's Yeah. So, let's see. Oh, Stephen.
[188.0] Yeah. Uh, let's see. Steven Colin. So
[190.48] that's this guy. He's Stephen. Oh, here
[192.8] we go up here. Yeah. Irwin Buzz Peterson
[194.8] and Steven Peterson. Father and son team
[197.44] in 1971. Marathon champions. So I raced
[201.44] against these two guys in 1973.
[205.92] And I suffered a an ignoble defeat.
[213.28] Was it you and your dad? No. No, it was
[215.519] me and a high school buddy. Uh, I tell
[218.159] you, we trained hard for that race, but
[220.799] it was not a 540 mile race. It was a 36
[223.76] mile race. But, uh, yeah, these guys
[227.12] were too good. So, this is Buzz Peterson
[229.68] here getting his award and his son. I
[232.799] maybe I would guess who that's who that
[234.799] is.
[237.48] Um, Marathon canoe racing. Yeah. So,
[240.28] here's Jean Tom Tom Estus and Jean
[244.12] Jensen 1950. They probably just won a
[246.879] race cuz they were they were the they
[248.959] were the top. My dad generally I think
[251.599] his rankings at the end of his racing
[254.08] career was about third. Wow. But yeah,
[257.44] he was up. I mean, yeah, they raced one
[259.199] year against the Olympic World Champions
[261.12] and just beat the [ __ ] out of them. Wow.
[265.04] Very cool. Yeah, it was it was cool.
[267.28] Here we go. Look at this. This is This
[268.88] is classic history right here. This is
[271.28] an era that's gone now.
[274.44] Um, these guys were something. So, this
[277.04] is Tom and that's
[279.639] Shorty. So, this is a kid. See, I
[281.84] remember these guys were always coming
[283.199] around the house, you know, with my dad,
[285.12] Buzzy and Tom and Shorty. So, I have
[287.759] these really good memories of, you know,
[289.68] five, six, seven years old and these
[292.08] guys coming around and or going out with
[293.919] my dad and hanging out with these guys
[295.759] and they're looking at canoes and
[297.52] whatever it is that they're
[299.4] doing. So, yeah. Yeah. Here we go.
[304.4] That's a That's a classic, isn't it?
[306.96] Yeah. So, yes. So, these guys were, you
[309.52] know, part of my childhood and and, you
[312.08] know, growing up for the first uh well,
[315.199] 10, 11, 12
[318.919] years. And I don't have photographs of
[321.44] my dad, but I do have old grainy 8
[325.12] millimeter or the eight uh not eight
[329.28] track, but you know the uh was it 8 mm
[333.039] film? Yeah.
[336.199] Yeah. Okay. That was probably it. Yeah.
[338.88] So, anyways, there's Shorty
[342.44] 1986. And here he is. He's still like in
[345.28] his 60s out racing.
[348.479] But then, this is sad. I almost don't
[350.96] even like to look at this picture, you
[352.56] know. Here he is. This is
[354.52] 2004. Um, but at least he's he's you
[357.039] know, he's got all these guys are gone
[359.4] now.
[362.44] Um, sad to see them go. Um, and
[367.96] this this is uh this is interesting
[371.72] because this is where I most of my
[374.479] growing up years were on this lake. And
[377.36] this is 1945 and it's rural Minnesota.
[380.56] Nothing but farms around here. Um, this
[384.0] was Schmidt Lake. And then this was the
[387.68] one. This was Carl Schmidt farm. And
[390.24] then down here, this was his brother. I
[392.88] forget his brother somebody Schmidt,
[395.199] probably Ole Schmidt or something. So
[398.0] this would have been like Carl's place.
[399.52] And this would have been like Olay's.
[401.36] This is Schmidt's crossroad, which is a
[403.36] two-lane gravel road. And down here,
[406.16] just off the screen, is we can't see his
[408.639] screen anymore. Oh, well, this just
[411.28] takes all the fun out of it. Well, you
[413.039] just just popped away.
[416.08] Oh, it just popped away. Yeah. Okay,
[418.319] let's try it again then.
[421.199] Well, I wonder why it did that.
[424.479] You might have closed the window that
[425.919] you were viewing and it just force quit.
[428.0] Yeah. Is it back? Yep, we can see it.
[429.919] So, so you know this this historical
[432.88] aerial photography is a really
[434.8] interesting tool to work with. Um, and
[437.68] you can see here this is this is where
[440.319] like you can see it's all rural. It's
[443.12] all farms, right? Um, there's a little
[445.84] there's a marsh here kind of a little
[448.0] pond in a marsh. This is Schmidt's
[450.24] crossroad. And right here, I was about
[452.319] to say this is the the section line
[454.8] right along here. you know, because the
[456.4] states were divided up into sections
[458.24] going back to the days of the founding
[460.96] of of America. So, this was a section
[463.36] line right here. Just south of the
[465.12] section line was the Rhyr farm. And
[467.599] Rhyrs had 10 kids. They were third
[469.599] generation German immigrants. And the
[472.0] youngest boy of the 10 kids was the same
[474.08] age as me. So, we grew up together and
[475.919] we were best friends. That's my my
[478.639] friend Hank. Um, and then his next older
[481.68] brother who was a year older was Dave.
[483.599] And we were all best friends growing up.
[485.84] You know, there was Dick, Dave, and
[487.52] Hank. Dick was the same age as my older
[490.08] brother, Fred. Then Dave was in the
[492.479] middle. And then Hank and I were the
[494.479] same age. And we were all good buddies.
[497.12] Hung out together. And here's All right.
[500.8] So, in this one, this I don't see the
[503.44] year on this, but
[506.12] um but you see here's the Carl Schmidt
[508.72] farm. Here's Schmidt's crossroad. And
[510.479] then this is Schmidt Lake. And this is a
[514.0] brother of Carl Schmidt farm right here.
[517.36] And then here's the Rhyr farm. They had
[519.519] their own private lake. Now, of course,
[522.08] all of this is developed now and turned
[524.399] into So what Schmidt's crossroad is now
[528.08] called Larch Lane and it's, you know, a
[530.08] regular size paved street. Uh obviously,
[534.16] uh the Carl Schmidt farm is gone. His
[536.48] brother's farm is gone. The Rhymer's
[538.24] farm is gone. All of this has been
[540.72] settled in here and they've changed the
[542.32] name of Rhymer Lake to Swan Lake. So, I
[546.56] find this interesting because this is
[548.56] still called Schmidt Lake, but I can
[550.64] guarantee you all the people that live
[552.08] around Schmidt Lake now don't know the
[554.48] backstory at all. Yeah. They don't know
[556.8] if you go down here to Rockford Road at
[559.12] the corner was the Schmidt Tavern and I
[561.68] think it was the Olay Schmidt that ran
[563.6] the tavern. So, this was, you know, the
[566.56] Schmidt land. Now, then we go one more.
[568.88] Let's see. Uh 1947. This is a bigger
[572.68] view. Um and then 1956. Now, when we get
[577.2] to 1956, there's an addition here that
[580.16] wasn't in the previous ones, and it's
[582.56] right
[583.48] here. Uh a house right on Schmidt's
[586.76] Crossroad. And that's our house. So, I
[590.399] in 1956, this was our house. My dad
[592.959] built that house by hand. and we moved
[596.08] into it Christmas of
[598.279] 1954. So 1956, we're living in that
[601.36] house. You can see there's nothing, you
[603.04] know, just farms and open land around us
[605.519] where the first real house. Well, there
[607.92] was a farm over here. Uh the Carl
[610.48] Schmidt farm was up here and the Olay
[612.48] Schmidt farm was there and there's our
[614.48] house. How did he get the land? He
[617.68] bought it from Carl Schmidt. In fact,
[620.64] this was always a disappoint. We heard
[622.079] this story growing up and it was always
[623.44] disappointing. and that was that Carl
[626.32] was going to sell him the whole farm.
[628.56] Then at the last minute, his daughter
[631.519] who uh had moved to Chicago comes up and
[634.48] visits and talks him out of selling it
[636.8] because she was too sentimental about
[638.56] the land. Um so he sold us a couple
[642.24] acres right here on the south, this
[644.0] little this little wedge down here right
[646.24] on the lake. So we owned this little
[648.0] wedge right here. And uh shortly
[650.72] thereafter, well then he had um he had a
[653.44] couple of grandkids and I have memories
[655.2] of them going up and and playing with
[657.36] his two grandkids. They were about my
[659.12] age and then
[661.16] uh suddenly they were not the the
[663.6] Schmidts were not there. I went up there
[665.2] and played with him regularly and then
[667.519] for a year or two and then we didn't uh
[671.36] I never went up there again and later I
[673.2] found out well it was because and then
[674.8] some a new family bought the farm the
[677.079] T-bergs and then I found out later that
[679.92] uh Carl Schmidt had gone out and hung
[681.76] himself in the barn from one of the
[684.16] beams.
[686.279] Um I don't know why he did that. Um but
[690.48] he did. So that was his fate. You can
[693.04] see the Rhymer's Lake here. So, you
[695.92] know, growing up on this lake winter,
[697.6] you know, it would freeze over. So, we
[699.2] had ice skating. Um, in the summer, you
[702.0] know, my dad had the canoes. I learned
[704.32] to swim in this lake. Um, then watch
[708.079] this progression. So, okay, there we go.
[709.76] There's the Carlson house. So, this was
[712.079] our little wedge of land right
[715.0] here. And we backed up onto the lake.
[717.6] Here's the the Schmidt farm down here.
[721.0] Um this now this lake is left over
[723.76] because there's a string of lakes going
[725.6] north south that were created by a lobe
[728.32] of the glacier. Uh this called the
[730.959] superior lobe named after Lake Superior
[733.2] that was recessing back and it would was
[736.0] leaving behind all of these piles of
[738.399] glacial till that formed these lakes.
[741.279] See? So this was one of those glacial
[744.079] till lakes.
[747.56] Uh yeah, there's now
[750.04] 1960. So what happened in 1960? My
[753.12] parents got divorced. And this picture
[756.079] would have been, I believe, looks like
[757.92] early spring. And so this would have
[760.24] been just before my mother packed me and
[762.24] my brothers up and hauled us off to
[764.12] rural small town Bayou, Louisiana, where
[768.16] she was from, where the Pettits had gone
[770.399] and settled. See? So then I left this
[773.76] life behind and uh suddenly was sort of
[777.839] you know immersed into you know
[780.0] Louisiana culture, cinjun culture,
[782.399] cinjun music. My mother worked at a rail
[785.68] at a rock and roll radio station. She
[788.16] got a job so in p in Alexandria,
[792.0] Louisiana and then we were living just
[794.0] outside of Pineville. So
[796.92] 1960,661,62 I was constantly hanging out
[799.279] at a rock and roll radio K Dixie BS
[802.16] which was the you know the rock and roll
[804.88] voice of central
[806.76] Louisiana. So quite a cultural shock.
[809.44] Mhm. Um anyways now look at this. This
[813.68] is
[815.0] 1962 or 61. Look what's happening here
[818.959] on the south end of the lake. They've
[821.68] come in and they've bulldozed and
[823.519] they've cleared land. If you go back to
[826.24] here, see there's all these trees. This
[828.88] is all farmer's pasture land. And then
[831.76] two years
[832.76] later, they've come in and they've
[835.48] bulldozed. And then let's see. Uh well,
[839.36] that was the end of that. So what they
[840.72] did was this was the beginning of the
[843.36] end right here. Uh so progressively more
[847.04] and more houses were built and then
[850.68] uh come 1980 it really went
[854.36] exponential in the 1980s. So uh you know
[858.399] they came in I remember going up to
[860.48] visit uh Jesse hadn't been born yet. So
[862.88] I think this was the year he before he'
[864.959] been born. So it was
[866.519] 1983 and I went up to visit the Rhyr
[869.92] farm and I went there. The farm had
[872.88] already been sold to the developer
[875.279] because what happened was they were
[877.04] going to pave Schmidt's Crossroad. So
[880.16] all of the land owners along Schmidt's
[882.24] crossroad got assessed whatever
[884.72] depending on how much road frontage they
[886.639] had. So the Rhyrs got hit with this huge
[889.199] bill and which kind of forced them to
[891.36] sell in a way. They didn't want to. But
[893.199] I remember Margie the the the farm wife
[896.959] and the mother of these 10 kids. Now, I
[899.76] will mention I I I talked to you about
[902.24] Hank and his next older brother, Dave.
[904.88] Well, would have been about
[908.279] 1965, I believe. Uh it was middle of
[911.279] winter and he was out with some friends
[913.279] and they slid off the road and the car
[915.36] flipped and Dave was thrown from the car
[918.72] uh and knocked out and uh he uh he fro
[923.76] laid there and froze. He was unconscious
[925.839] and he laid there and froze to death.
[927.279] That was in the middle of winter and
[929.36] that was a huge a huge trauma in the
[933.199] middle of every cuz you know we were
[934.48] like you know you can see here they're
[936.8] they're like our nearest neighbors. I
[938.639] spent more time up there at the Rhymer's
[940.56] farm and hanging out with them you know
[943.199] as much as I did at home almost. So when
[945.839] Dave got killed that was a major like
[949.519] trauma and I remember being traumatized
[951.759] by that. But Hank, his younger brother,
[954.8] was really traumatized and went through
[957.6] this several year thing where he
[960.0] couldn't go to school. He dropped out of
[961.92] school. He was going to school and he
[964.0] was getting bullied a lot cuz we're now
[965.759] in middle school. And so, you know,
[968.56] bullying in middle school was horrible.
[971.0] And so, yeah, I just remember that. That
[973.68] was a that was a tough blow for
[975.199] everybody. And right down here, let's
[978.079] see, there's a little church. Uh, I
[981.44] don't know if you can that. Let's see.
[982.56] That might be it right down. I think
[984.16] this is it right here. It's called Mount
[985.6] Olivant Lutheran Church. And Dave was
[988.32] buried in a little cemetery there. Um,
[991.92] and then when I saw Marjgery's obituary,
[996.399] this is maybe 15, 20 years ago when she
[999.079] passed and she was buried next to Dave
[1003.68] in this little cemetery. Even though the
[1006.16] family after they gave up the farm, the
[1008.399] family moved like and bought another
[1009.839] farm like 30 miles farther out. She came
[1013.12] back and was buried next to her son Dave
[1016.199] there. So, uh yeah, you know, I my
[1020.72] thought is, you know, after the ice age,
[1023.36] you had this long period
[1025.4] where you had it, you know, I mean, it
[1028.24] went through major fluctuations.
[1029.919] Absolutely. Sometimes it was warmer,
[1031.6] sometimes it was colder, but you had
[1033.679] this post ice age world, this biome if
[1038.959] you want to call it that, that sort of
[1040.24] came and and and that was sort of the
[1042.799] phase two. And then when the settlers
[1044.959] came in the 1800s, they transformed this
[1047.919] wild landscape into a into an
[1050.96] agricultural landscape. And then that's
[1053.52] where I would have come into the picture
[1055.039] in
[1056.039] 1951. And then I grew up. So after 2 and
[1059.28] a half years in Pineville, we moved back
[1062.0] with my dad. Now what had happened then
[1064.08] is my dad had built another house. And
[1066.64] this house was on the uh he built what
[1069.76] he did was he built another house next
[1072.08] door to the one uh that we lived in
[1075.6] before. And the one that we had lived in
[1077.6] sold to some other people. And so I
[1080.559] would we would come up and visit my dad
[1082.16] in the summer and we would stay in that
[1083.84] house. And then finally in 1963
[1089.2] uh he built another house down on the
[1092.0] south end of the lake. And then after
[1094.799] two and a half years in
[1096.52] Pineville my dad remarried and uh he met
[1100.96] he was 34 and she was or 35. He was 18
[1105.36] years older than her but they fell in
[1107.2] love and that was not considered
[1109.52] abnormal back in those days. So he had
[1111.84] his new bride and they moved into the
[1113.76] house and Rocky and Rowan and I moved
[1115.44] back from Pineville and we all lived in
[1117.12] this new house at the south end of the
[1119.12] lake and that's where uh you know I
[1122.0] lived until I was 16 years old. So I
[1125.12] grew up basically on this lake and then
[1127.52] I stayed in contact with my friend Hank
[1130.32] until uh I left Minnesota for good, you
[1134.4] know. So we stayed friends right through
[1136.48] our adulthood. Uh hung out together, you
[1140.16] know. my I worked on this farm. So in n
[1142.559] summer of 1964, me and my brothers went
[1144.799] down and we started working on the farm.
[1147.12] And that was my first summer of hauling
[1148.88] in hay where you would the farmer Harold
[1152.16] the the dad. He would be out with his
[1154.0] tractor and his his balor. He would have
[1156.16] his uh his mower. They'd cut the hay.
[1158.88] Then he had his uh I think they called
[1160.96] it it was well it was a rake and the
[1162.96] rake would take the the the big spread
[1165.12] fields of hay and turn them into nice
[1167.6] neat rows. Then he would come with the
[1169.76] balor. The bor would scoop up the rows.
[1172.24] It would pack the the hay into these
[1174.72] bales, wrap the twine automatically,
[1176.96] spit them out the back. And so the boys
[1180.08] would come and we would load the hay
[1183.2] bales up onto the wagon. And the sisters
[1186.24] would drive the tractor that was pulling
[1189.6] the the wagon. So they would be like 10,
[1192.24] 11 years old, 12 year old girls, and
[1195.28] they would drive the tractor. And it was
[1197.36] then that I realized women's privilege
[1201.679] because I'm back there living lifting
[1203.679] these 40 and 50 lb bales like hundreds
[1206.88] of them in a day and the girls get to
[1209.039] drive the tractor and I thought what I
[1212.16] want to drive have a turn driving the
[1213.96] tractor. But no, no, no. But I tell you
[1218.44] what, you know what that first summer of
[1220.96] hauling hay did for me? Made you a
[1223.6] misogynist. It made it made a man of me.
[1227.679] No, it didn't make me a misogynist. Uh
[1230.4] because about that same time, I was
[1232.4] making discoveries about like I I went
[1235.52] from like girls, get out of here, girls,
[1238.4] to like girls.
[1242.24] They get to drive the tractor. I want to
[1244.08] know more. Well, they get to they get to
[1245.919] drive the tractor. Well, actually that
[1248.08] wasn't uh Yeah, but so that so that
[1252.48] summer 1964, I was first summer. I was
[1254.799] 13. I worked on the farm all summer. And
[1258.24] seventh grade, I was bullied mercilessly
[1260.799] by this guy named I probably shouldn't
[1262.88] say his whole name. Trent. No, it wasn't
[1265.6] Trent. It wasn't Trent. It was I'll just
[1269.28] His first name was Greg and his last
[1271.76] name started with an H. And he bo he was
[1274.559] in my PE class and he bullied me
[1276.24] mercilessly. And I had he was I'm almost
[1278.72] sure he was a year older because that
[1280.32] the bullies were always the guys that
[1282.48] had been held back. Yeah. So they were
[1284.72] starting going through life uh already
[1287.52] with an inferiority complex. But what
[1290.72] happened was the same time that same
[1293.2] summer I was working out. I I hadn't
[1294.96] gone through puberty yet. But I between
[1297.679] late seventh grade and early 8th grade I
[1299.919] went through puberty. And you know
[1302.32] that's a big difference I certainly in
[1304.799] boys lives between prepubescent and
[1307.799] postpubescent right so I'd been all
[1310.799] summer you know lifting these hay bales
[1312.64] then taking them back to the barn and
[1314.32] stacking them up in the hay barn and by
[1316.159] the end of the summer we had the whole
[1318.0] barn filled up to the rafters. So I go
[1320.72] back and
[1321.88] immediately here here he is again
[1324.4] mercilessly bullying me, psychologically
[1327.6] dominating me and uh and I I acquiesced.
[1331.6] I was like you know and god I hate this
[1335.159] guy you know and then so but I quickly I
[1340.64] soon realized that his domination of me
[1342.96] was purely psychological at that point.
[1346.08] Right? cuz it was so ingrained that he
[1347.919] had been bullying me and that he was my
[1349.52] superior for that whole seventh grade.
[1352.159] Um, so one day we're coming out of the
[1354.72] shower and I'm just starting to get
[1356.159] dressed and I just pulled up my my
[1358.24] shorts and he comes out and starts
[1360.32] whipping me with a wet towel. So you
[1364.32] remember a locker room you had the you
[1365.919] had the lockers and then you had the the
[1367.84] bench down the middle. Well, he was on
[1369.28] one side of the bench and I was on the
[1370.799] other. And before I knew what I was
[1372.72] doing, I I got so mad and had such an
[1375.52] adrenaline rush that I grabbed him and
[1377.12] threw him down on the concrete floor and
[1379.28] got on top of them and pummeled them.
[1382.0] And uh that was uh one of my first major
[1387.12] real tastes of victory. Yeah. You know,
[1389.76] it was I mean, you can't imagine what
[1391.52] that feeling was like. And then uh yeah,
[1395.36] immediately, of course, all the
[1397.0] bloodthirsty other eighth graders are
[1399.76] like
[1401.28] And uh next thing I hear, you know, we
[1404.08] had the two coaches, coach Sahaki and
[1406.24] Coach Haldy. Coach Sahaki was old, about
[1409.36] to retire. He was a cool guy. But so I
[1411.36] hear somebody call, "Uhoh, Sahaki's
[1413.44] coming or coach is coming." So he comes
[1415.84] running and and I jump up and uh he
[1419.2] looks and we're both standing there and
[1421.919] Greg is all red in the face and I'm kind
[1424.48] of standing there with this uh
[1427.4] victorious you know and he could look
[1429.76] and immediately tell what had happened
[1432.08] and so he said just you know you guys
[1435.679] you know whatever I no trouble here now
[1439.12] was my gym teacher had him in seventh
[1442.08] grade and eighth grade he was 6'6 tall
[1444.24] big guy. He walked around and hanging
[1446.559] from his belt was a a wooden paddle and
[1450.799] it was maybe, you know, 18 in long, 16,
[1454.559] 18 inches long and had holes drilled in
[1456.72] it to reduce the aerodynamic friction.
[1460.0] And he would have that hanging from his
[1461.6] belt. And I don't remember how many
[1463.52] times I remembered this like this burned
[1465.76] into my brain. Carlton, grab your
[1469.039] ankles.
[1472.08] So, just don't if you ever say that to
[1474.559] me, uh, Becket, uh, I may react and I
[1478.159] may I may because I have I have a degree
[1481.84] of PTSD about that. Um, Randall, if I
[1485.12] ever say grab your ankles, you should
[1487.679] turn around and shoot me. If you say
[1490.559] Harlson, grab your ankles. Yeah. Yeah.
[1492.88] Even because I I I was I was not Randy.
[1495.6] Every I was called Randy back then, but
[1497.36] I he didn't he didn't call me Randy. It
[1499.12] was everybody. All the boys was by their
[1501.039] last name. So I was Carlson. Grab your
[1503.52] ankle. But there were guys in there who
[1505.6] way outdid me. I I was like in the
[1507.52] middle. So I got maybe 20 or 30 paddles
[1510.4] that year. Uh there were guys who
[1512.48] probably got 40, 50, 60. And you would
[1515.36] have and you just wearing these little
[1517.12] ridiculous thin gym shorts, man. Uh
[1519.6] didn't provide any cushion at all. Now
[1523.679] can you imagine that being done
[1525.799] today? Try try to imagine that being
[1528.159] done. Well, I was normal. I mean, heck
[1531.039] yeah. Better days, simpler times. That's
[1533.679] real discipline right there. Yeah,
[1536.24] that's right. So, anyways, uh that was
[1539.52] life back then. Uh good times. I didn't
[1543.279] enjoy getting paddled, but
[1546.679] uh I got some great memories, man,
[1549.12] growing up in that. Yeah, that's
[1550.559] awesome. Thanks for sharing, man. I feel
[1552.799] I got taken back in time there.
[1556.0] Well, I you know, one of the things I
[1558.0] loved about I I was really lucky because
[1560.48] I got to know all four of my
[1562.36] grandparents very well. Uh and a lot of
[1565.039] people did, you know, didn't know their
[1567.039] grandparents or only maybe knew one of
[1568.64] them or, you know, and these days the
[1570.48] way, you know, the family lineages are
[1573.279] no so are now so elastic and spread out
[1576.48] and stuff. But yeah, so I knew all four
[1578.64] of my grandparents and I I spent many
[1581.279] hours listening with interest to them
[1584.24] talking about what was life like in the
[1587.279] early 20th century, what was life like
[1589.039] during the wartime, what was life like
[1590.799] during the depression, etc. And you
[1594.24] know, yeah, and you know, I'm old enough
[1597.2] to remember my dad bringing home our
[1600.08] first ever television set and what a big
[1603.36] deal that was. the unboxing. I was three
[1605.76] years old and he brought the television
[1608.88] home and my older brother, my mom, it
[1611.84] was really an exciting thing. And
[1613.52] opening up the box, this would have been
[1616.6] 1954, about the time that the the middle
[1619.52] class started being able to afford
[1621.44] television sets. In the 40s, pretty much
[1624.159] only the wealthy people could afford
[1625.919] television sets. So, you know, I was the
[1628.72] first generation, I guess, really, who
[1630.08] like grew up with the TV. Yeah. back in
[1632.72] the day when there were three three ABC,
[1635.919] NBC and CBS and then you usually had a
[1638.799] local channel. So we grew up with four
[1640.679] channels but you know what media even
[1643.44] then was becoming corrupt but it was way
[1645.6] more honest and authentic than it is
[1647.52] now. Oh way way more so. Um so by the
[1651.6] time I got Yeah. By the time I got to
[1653.76] the teenage years, um, you know, I could
[1657.039] turn on the evening news and you you had
[1661.08] fil video footage of the Vietnam War
[1665.2] right on your TV set like you don't open
[1667.679] you don't do you turn on now the TV or
[1671.039] anything and well I guess you can
[1672.88] because people do post now but
[1675.44] mainstream media you're not going to
[1677.039] turn on any mainstream media and see a
[1679.679] dispatch that came out from a free
[1681.52] roving
[1682.64] uh journalist or reporter uploading
[1685.36] stuff from that day or the few days
[1687.2] before of actual battle scenes and
[1690.0] stuff, fighting, shooting going on, you
[1693.2] know, Marines or soldiers carrying their
[1695.52] dead comrades out of battle. No, you
[1698.399] didn't see any of that. But now you
[1700.559] don't on mainstream media. They don't
[1702.799] show that because coming out of the
[1704.88] Vietnam War, the idea was they wanted to
[1707.36] get control of the narrative. So the
[1710.0] first thing they did was they shifted
[1711.679] from being able to have free roaming
[1714.24] journalists and photographers and things
[1717.679] who could go anywhere without restraint
[1720.72] for the most part to having embedded
[1723.2] journalists which meant that you go
[1725.6] where we assign you with what group and
[1728.72] we have the power now to censor anything
[1732.399] that comes out. So all of that came uh
[1736.48] as part of the postVietnam era which and
[1740.08] and it was called um well the Vietnam
[1743.279] syndrome if you hear that the Vietnam
[1745.279] syndrome was because of the free roaming
[1748.0] media that was a huge major influence on
[1752.0] turning public opinion against the war
[1755.2] because you could turn your television
[1756.559] on there it was right there and then of
[1758.48] course on top of that was the draft. So
[1760.88] you have it's not an all volunteer army.
[1763.279] It was postvietnam again where they
[1765.2] switched to the all volunteer army and
[1767.36] that was again to try to be able to get
[1770.64] control of public opinion because after
[1773.039] postvietnam they did not have control of
[1775.36] public opinion and you had the drafties
[1777.919] coming back saying hey this is all
[1780.0] [ __ ] It's all [ __ ] and they had
[1782.32] no emotional investment in the
[1785.159] narrative. Uh, and the idea was you go
[1787.6] to a volunteer army and now you've got
[1790.24] much more control over what they can
[1792.559] say, what they can do, etc., etc.
[1795.36] Whereas when you have drafties, they're
[1797.2] like, they come back, you know, it's all
[1801.72] [ __ ] So that was the thing. That
[1804.399] was what was in the background hovering
[1806.399] over us of my age. When I hit those
[1808.72] teenage years, it didn't really hit me
[1810.48] till I was 15 that because the war was
[1813.76] building up. was 15 in 1966 and that was
[1816.559] really one of the years of the big
[1818.52] buildup. Um before that it was just
[1821.919] completely not on my horizon, my my
[1824.799] radar screen at all. By the time I was
[1827.52] 16, yeah, I now knew older boys that
[1831.12] were getting drafted and sent. And by
[1834.52] 67, I knew older boys that had been
[1837.039] drafted and sent over there and gotten
[1839.08] killed. M um so at that point you know
[1843.36] it it it really boom the walls collapsed
[1847.399] and something you know maybe not getting
[1850.24] into this story but um you know I didn't
[1853.12] go to Vietnam right I was I was draft
[1856.24] age I I turned 18 in spring of 69 my
[1861.039] lottery number this is your fate was now
[1863.679] in the hands of a lottery and so they
[1866.159] have this device with a bunch of I think
[1868.159] there were like pingpong balls in there
[1870.48] with dates from January 1st to December
[1873.44] 31st. All the dates are in there, right?
[1876.399] And then they had some way one of a
[1878.159] pingpong ball would pop out. You take
[1880.0] that ping-pong ball, it would have a
[1881.44] date on it. So first date that comes up
[1884.48] if that was your birthday, you're going
[1886.159] to Vietnam. You're getting drafted. Was
[1888.08] there a year on the ping-pong ball or
[1889.76] was it just a month and a day? I think
[1891.6] it was just a month and a day. Right. It
[1893.76] was just I think it was just a month and
[1894.96] a day. So you only got 365 shots, right?
[1898.76] So 120 I remember it was 120 no I think
[1902.32] it was 125 if you were in the first 125
[1906.08] you were you were 100% you were going to
[1908.48] Vietnam the second 125 it was like 50/50
[1912.64] and then the third from there to
[1914.88] December 31st you probably would not get
[1917.6] called up drafted so I remember sitting
[1920.24] there in front of the TV and because
[1922.399] this was broadcast live on
[1925.0] television the year I was was of age,
[1928.32] right? And the pingpong ball comes up
[1930.64] and we get up to the 100 120s and I'm
[1933.76] thinking, I'm going to make it. I'm
[1936.159] going to get through this. And then like
[1937.44] at 123, 124, something like that, boom,
[1940.32] my birthday comes
[1942.039] up. So I'm like, oh [ __ ] You know, and
[1944.799] by this time I a a a friend of mine
[1948.159] grown up with, his older brother had
[1949.679] been killed. He was in a he was a
[1951.48] helicopter gunner in a helicopter that
[1954.08] got shot down. and uh the Leamus. So
[1957.679] they were they were lived on a farm the
[1959.76] next crossroads over and I rode the
[1961.76] school bus with those two boys from you
[1964.0] know first grade up up through you know
[1966.159] so um he got killed. I remember I don't
[1969.84] think it was his brother that I was
[1971.279] talking to. it was a friend of the
[1972.96] family or a kid that knew him. And I
[1976.48] asked about of Tom and he said, "Well,
[1979.12] yeah, he, you know, he was killed." And
[1981.279] they sent his remains back. And you
[1984.159] know, the the actual conversation, I
[1986.24] don't remember word for word anymore,
[1987.679] but I just remember him telling me that
[1989.679] um you know, the what they sent back of
[1992.799] this kid, Tom, that I'd known, you know,
[1995.84] for years was would would fill a shoe
[1998.159] box. And I remember being quite shocked
[2000.72] at that because I could picture this
[2003.2] happy, vital kid that, you know, we
[2005.2] played together. He would be on the bus.
[2006.96] I was the same age as his younger
[2008.48] brother, so he was a year or two ahead
[2010.799] of us. So he had already gone. Um, but
[2014.64] as fate would have it, I got busted by a
[2018.32] couple of corrupt cops, couple of plain
[2021.279] clos cops not long after this. Um, so
[2026.0] you know, my number comes up, then
[2028.72] probably 2 or 3 months later, I get
[2030.64] called up. I get called up and I have to
[2032.64] go in for my physical. But in between
[2035.76] that, the the the lottery and me getting
[2038.72] called in for my physical, I got busted
[2040.559] by these two corrupt cops. And what it
[2043.519] was, they were plain closed. One of them
[2045.12] planted a joint on me and then his his
[2048.0] partner busted me and you know
[2050.72] handcuffed me, hauled me into jail and I
[2053.28] spent three days in jail and they let me
[2056.32] out. They gave me I was standing on a at
[2059.44] a bus stop at about 1:00 a.m. hoping
[2062.399] that I had not missed the last bus of
[2064.399] the day and I had been out all day
[2067.52] selling newspapers on the sidewalk. And
[2070.8] the way it worked, you'd go in with 10
[2073.04] bucks and you'd buy a bundle of a 100
[2075.24] newspapers and you'd go out and you sell
[2077.28] them for 25 cents each. So I'd gotten
[2079.52] like two bundles been through that day.
[2081.599] So I was feeling pretty good. I was
[2083.2] feeling rich. But I'd been out all day,
[2086.48] probably 11 hours, 12 hours, you know,
[2089.119] and now I just wanted to go home and I'm
[2091.839] dead tired and hoping I hadn't missed
[2094.24] the last bus, but figured if I did, I
[2096.32] could probably catch a ride hitchhiking
[2098.4] because hitchhiking was such a popular
[2100.32] way of traveling back then. So, this
[2102.88] plane, unmarked cop car comes cruising
[2105.52] by, and I knew immediately what it was.
[2107.2] And I see these guys looking and I
[2109.68] thought, "Okay, they're going to come
[2110.64] around the block and they're going to
[2111.76] harass me." And sure enough, they come
[2113.92] around. They parked. I'm down maybe 100
[2116.16] ft from the corner. So, they park around
[2118.72] the corner where I don't see them park.
[2120.16] And the two of them come walking around.
[2122.079] And as they're walking towards me, they
[2123.76] split. And one guy comes walking towards
[2126.079] my front talking to me and holding my
[2128.64] attention while his partner goes behind
[2130.48] me. And he reaches his hand into my coat
[2133.599] pocket. And then his, if I remember the
[2136.079] way it was, his partner then came up
[2138.32] after to to to um, you know, pat me down
[2141.76] and all that and finds the joint that
[2143.599] his partner had put in my pocket. So, I
[2146.56] get hauled down. I spend a night in a
[2148.64] drunk tank and then they haul me into
[2150.32] the city jail and I spend the weekend in
[2152.16] the city jail. And there's some whole
[2154.88] interesting stories there, but I won't
[2156.48] get into. And then when I I get led out
[2158.4] on Monday about noon and they give me a
[2160.64] copy of my arrest report and I was the
[2163.359] bus stop I was standing on was Broadway.
[2165.76] That was the name of the street,
[2167.16] Broadway. And down at the corner, the
[2170.079] intersection street was Washington. So I
[2172.96] get the rest report and it said that the
[2175.599] suspect that the that the officers came
[2178.56] driving around the corner and they saw
[2180.24] the suspect staggering down the middle
[2182.96] of Washington Avenue. Literally I it's
[2186.0] like I can still memor exactly
[2189.2] staggering. The suspect was staggering
[2191.599] down the middle of Washington Avenue.
[2193.92] And I remember when I was riding in the
[2196.4] backseat, handcuffed in the backseat of
[2198.24] the car, these two guys were both, you
[2200.48] know, real jock like and one of them,
[2203.119] the guy in the passenger side, he's
[2204.48] turning around to see like we don't like
[2207.52] guys like you. We're the all-American
[2209.48] type, you know, we're the all-American
[2211.839] type. And he was like just giving me a
[2213.44] hard time. And uh and I remember reading
[2216.64] that thinking, "Yeah, this is the
[2217.92] all-American type." They just they
[2219.44] blatantly lied. Set me up and lied. But
[2223.359] here's the thing. When I went in for my
[2226.16] draft physical, they wanted to know if
[2227.76] I'd ever been arrested, right? Well,
[2230.72] this is like a couple of months after
[2232.64] the arrest. So, I'm scheduled to go into
[2235.52] court like maybe a month later. I go
[2238.56] into court and these two guys weren't
[2240.8] there to testify against me. So the
[2242.72] judge reschedules and I come back like a
[2245.28] month later, they didn't show up then.
[2248.64] So he reschedules. So third time I went
[2251.52] into court, they still weren't there.
[2253.599] The judge calls me back in his chambers
[2256.4] in the back and says, "Okay, so you
[2258.88] haven't gotten in any trouble. This was
[2260.64] your first uh scrape with the law. You
[2263.28] haven't gotten in any trouble since.
[2265.44] What I'm going to do is I'm going to let
[2266.8] you go and you're if you stay out of
[2269.76] trouble for one year, I'm going to find
[2272.32] you a $100 and if you stay out of
[2274.32] trouble for one year, this will go off
[2275.92] your record. Well, at that time in
[2278.0] Minnesota, I was a pending felon. So,
[2280.56] when I went in for my draft physical, I
[2283.52] was a pending
[2285.079] felon. That got me out.
[2288.96] I got a one Y classification which means
[2292.0] it's not the lowest tier 4F which means
[2294.16] you're unsuitable for military service
[2295.92] under any circumstances. I got one Y
[2298.32] which meant only suitable for military
[2300.72] service in case of national emergency
[2303.76] which presumably meant an actual
[2306.48] invasion I guess. So I got one Y and I
[2310.079] didn't go. So, I don't know. It was an
[2313.68] interesting coincidence maybe how that
[2315.359] whole thing played out cuz if I had
[2317.839] gone, who knows? I might have never come
[2319.839] back or I might have come back totally
[2321.68] [ __ ] up cuz I had a lot of friends
[2323.92] that came back [ __ ] up. I knew two
[2325.76] boys that I knew from my childhood
[2327.68] growing up committed
[2329.079] suicide. Nobody was getting, you know,
[2331.52] they came back and you were just left on
[2333.28] your own. They they government didn't
[2334.96] give a [ __ ] you know. So, I mean, to
[2337.839] this day, you still got Vietnam vets
[2339.68] that, you know, suffering from from the
[2343.52] trauma because there was some bad [ __ ]
[2345.359] that went on over there. Some really bad
[2347.52] [ __ ] And and some of the guys I knew
[2349.76] who didn't want to talk about it went
[2351.04] over and they got swept up in the
[2352.48] craziness of it and and and wantingly
[2354.839] killed civilians and came back and were
[2357.68] just tortured by what they had done over
[2360.28] there. So, there's a whole long brutal
[2362.88] story of that that that needs to be
[2365.04] told. the younger generation doesn't
[2366.8] know the specifics and details of that
[2368.72] story, but it needs to be told because
[2370.56] it was a major inflection point in
[2372.24] American history. Um, and in the
[2374.96] aftermath of it then was this further
[2377.68] consolidation of centralized control
[2380.0] over the nar the narrative, the
[2381.76] historical narrative, the current events
[2384.16] narrative and so on.
[2387.52] It worked. Wow, man. That's
[2389.96] uh there was uh something watching over
[2393.04] you. You know, who would who who would
[2395.44] have thought the all-Americans actually
[2397.119] would have saved you? In a way. Yeah.
[2399.52] It's ironic, isn't it? Mhm. But, you
[2402.4] know, I had this there was this kid uh
[2404.32] he was he was a stereotypical jock. His
[2407.76] name was Rick. I won't tell you his last
[2409.599] name. He's probably might still be out
[2411.56] there. Um but he was captain of the
[2414.079] wrestling team. So, I remember my last
[2415.76] year in high school, which was 6869.
[2419.359] He uh he and I were in a class together
[2421.52] and I remember him kind of cornering me
[2423.2] because they used to bring recruiters
[2425.44] into the high schools. So there was a
[2427.839] group of us that got together and we
[2429.76] wanted to bring in there was like a a
[2431.839] like draft resistance groups and
[2433.839] anti-war groups and they would help
[2436.72] people like you know if you don't want
[2438.32] to go we're going to help you figure out
[2440.24] how not to go. And there was this
[2442.4] growing huge resistance. I mean in 1966
[2445.599] something like 3/4 to 80% of the
[2447.76] American public was pro-war. By 1968 it
[2451.2] had reversed and 3/4 to 80% of the
[2454.16] American public were against the war.
[2456.0] That's all it took was two two years. um
[2458.8] by 1969 70. Yeah. I mean, even those who
[2463.44] had originally been supporters of the
[2464.8] war, but I remember Rick coming up and
[2466.4] we got this because I was helping I
[2468.48] wanted to bring in one of the the the
[2470.28] anti-war people, you know, as a
[2472.72] counterbalance to the military
[2474.64] recruiters that were coming into high
[2476.4] schools, right? And I remember after
[2478.72] that he he kind of confronted me a
[2480.8] little bit and he uh you know had this
[2484.0] whole thing in his head, you know, well,
[2485.2] we got to go fight the communists over
[2486.8] there because if we don't fight them
[2488.319] over there, we're going to be fighting
[2489.76] them over here. I just wasn't buying
[2492.079] into any of that. It was [ __ ] That
[2493.76] was the domino theory. If Vietnam falls
[2496.88] to the communists, then Cambodia is
[2498.88] going to fall, Laos is going to fall,
[2500.72] etc. And there we go. The whole we've
[2502.8] lost all of Indochina to communists.
[2505.64] Well, basically the whole domino theory
[2508.24] was [ __ ] But anyways, we had this,
[2511.2] it was kind of friendly, but it was kind
[2512.8] of an argument, you know, and this is
[2515.72] 1960, probably 1969, right? Early fall
[2519.359] of, I mean, spring of 69 cuz I got out
[2522.64] that, you know, that was my last year.
[2524.56] So then it's 19 summer of 1973, four
[2528.0] years
[2528.68] later and I'm working with my dad was in
[2532.24] and summer of 73 was this the the year
[2534.88] that I was canoe racing was also the
[2537.28] year I did my first ever contract job
[2540.319] and I worked with my dad that summer and
[2542.319] we were working in a place called Golden
[2545.0] Valley and I ran into a kid that I knew
[2548.56] from high school who had just opened a
[2551.28] record store in the basement of a little
[2553.839] commercial building near where we were
[2555.599] working and he called it uh down in the
[2557.76] valley cuz you had to go downstairs to
[2559.68] get in there. And in fact, I may have
[2562.56] gone in there to buy buy a record or
[2565.2] something and I saw this guy Steve and
[2567.119] we knew each other. I told him what I
[2569.119] was doing. He said, "Man, I need all
[2570.4] these I need all these shelves and
[2572.0] things built, displays and places to put
[2574.48] my record." That was my my first ever
[2577.44] contracted job. Well, anyway, so I'm
[2580.16] working with my dad nearby. I'm working
[2581.839] at Down in the Valley rest uh records.
[2584.64] And then I went over and I there was a a
[2587.119] nearby drugstore and I think it was like
[2589.2] they had a soda fountain. The drugstores
[2591.44] all had soda fountains back then, right?
[2593.92] And I go in, I'm I'm in the line. I'm
[2595.92] waiting to pay or something. I hear
[2597.359] somebody go, "Hey, Carlson, is that
[2599.359] you?" And I turn around, I look in a
[2601.76] guy, it's shaggy, kind of long hair and
[2603.76] the beard. And I definitely recognize
[2606.319] the guy and I I knew I knew him. And
[2608.48] then he says, "Hey, it's me, Rick." like
[2610.4] rich what you know whatever. Um I
[2613.2] actually do remember his last name but
[2615.72] um so we got to talking and he went over
[2619.599] and did a tour of duty and came back and
[2622.319] he said, "Do you remember when you and I
[2624.96] were having that discussion or debate or
[2627.68] whatever he called it?" And I said, "Oh
[2629.2] yeah, I remember that." And he said,
[2630.2] "Well, you were right. You were right.
[2634.8] That was really uh you know I remember
[2636.56] that moment running into him like four
[2638.72] years later and him telling me that he
[2642.64] that I was right in our discussion and
[2645.119] cuz he'd gone over there and seen for
[2646.72] himself it was [ __ ] and a lot of
[2649.44] guys did a lot of guys went over there
[2651.68] came back seeing that it was [ __ ]
[2653.599] and that was you know we got into that
[2656.319] whole 70s you know the the Vietnam war
[2658.56] syndrome where people were sick of war
[2660.72] they didn't want war anymore but that
[2663.52] all began to change in the Reagan years
[2665.52] and then it accelerated. Um, and then it
[2669.04] got to the point where we got to the '9s
[2671.52] and you had the the neocons and the
[2674.4] neocons basically had a whole different
[2676.64] plan for America. They didn't want
[2678.4] America to go
[2680.2] isolationist, right? Which it wasn't
[2682.319] really isolationist. If you're in if
[2684.56] you're engaging with other countries and
[2686.48] other cultures culturally uh you know uh
[2691.44] whatever you're sharing culture you're
[2693.44] sharing scientific research you're you
[2696.72] know you've got international businesses
[2698.88] and all that that's not isolationism but
[2701.599] the way they framed it is if you didn't
[2703.28] want this aggressive uh hegemonic
[2707.119] foreign policy you were an isolationist.
[2709.599] They still do that. You know, they'll if
[2711.68] you see hear somebody talking against
[2714.079] being involved in Ukraine or being in
[2716.319] against being involved in the Middle
[2717.68] East, oh, you're an isolationist. No,
[2719.76] I'm not an isolationist. I'm for all
[2722.319] kinds of exchange, cultural exchange,
[2724.56] artistic exchange, scientific exchange,
[2727.28] all these kinds of things that So, I'm
[2729.359] not an isolationist. I'm just
[2731.839] nonimperialist.
[2733.68] I'm a non-imperialist. Yeah, that's
[2735.68] exactly what it is. But they they got
[2738.96] control of the narrative in the Daddy
[2741.44] Bush years. And then the Clinton
[2744.16] administration, two terms of the Clinton
[2746.44] administration again was totally
[2748.359] dominated by the neocon. Um and then of
[2752.88] course when you get Bush Jr. in there,
[2755.839] that's when the big flip occurred, you
[2758.0] know, because So what what change did
[2760.319] you see? Like you're talking about like
[2762.079] there was the Vietnam War syndrome.
[2763.88] Obviously that lasted for a while, but
[2766.96] was it media that was changing people's
[2769.599] minds? Yes. Yes. Cuz by the 80s, media
[2772.16] was now under under the thumb of the
[2775.04] like what type of media do you remember?
[2776.72] Do you remember anything? Oh yeah. Well,
[2779.04] I mean 80s you was still pre- internet.
[2781.359] So you didn't have any of that. You
[2782.4] still had to rely on mainstream media.
[2784.72] But now if you look at the difference
[2786.4] between media stories in the '60s and
[2788.96] media story in the 80s, oh yeah, you're
[2791.04] definitely going to see that by the 80s
[2793.44] it's been very much
[2795.0] sanitized. Um, and that was by design.
[2798.319] And then the control of of media has
[2801.2] continued unabated to where now it's
[2803.68] just completely it's basically just an
[2805.92] arm of the national security state. Um,
[2809.119] that's mainstream media and that's
[2811.119] that's what it's gotten to. Um, was
[2813.92] there did you ever recognize it when you
[2816.079] saw it? Like, do you have like an early
[2818.0] memory when you're like, "Okay, I know
[2819.76] this is propaganda. I know that this is
[2822.319] Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, at the age of
[2824.319] 17, I knew I could tell the difference
[2826.64] between the, you know, propaganda." When
[2828.8] Nixon was running against Hubert
[2830.64] Humphrey, um, you know, I I definitely I
[2833.68] could watch on Nixon on TV. I I said,
[2835.76] "How can anybody watch this guy? He's
[2837.28] obviously lying." You know, this was
[2839.68] that campaign. I'm It's 1968. I'm I'm
[2842.64] summer of 68. I'm 17. And I would be
[2845.119] sitting in front of the TV going, "How
[2846.64] in the world does they cannot tell? This
[2848.64] guy's just bullshitting." And then of
[2850.72] course his plan was peace with honor. So
[2853.2] he was going to get us on. He ran on the
[2854.88] peace campaign. Now Lynden Johnson had
[2858.0] been a Democrat. You know, Johnson took
[2859.76] over after the assassination of Kennedy.
[2862.56] and Johnson was the one to really
[2865.599] accelerate the deployment of American
[2868.079] troops to Vietnam because well the
[2870.24] reason Kennedy had to go was because
[2872.56] number one mainly I think it was because
[2874.56] he was becoming uh anti-war he already
[2878.319] you know after the Cuban uh the Bay of
[2880.72] Pigs fiasco he didn't trust the CIA
[2883.44] anymore so he was actually thinking
[2885.599] maybe uh we should pull the plug on the
[2888.44] CIA and he was you know he he was the
[2891.52] one who pushed through the limited test
[2893.119] ban treaty in 1963 because you know up
[2895.839] until
[2897.16] 1963 the the the United States and the
[2900.0] Soviet Union were testing hundreds of
[2902.96] nuclear big explosions in the atmosphere
[2906.96] that was going on and the the the planet
[2911.839] actually is still reeling in a way from
[2914.079] the aftermath of that massive testing
[2917.04] campaign that went on and it was Kennedy
[2920.16] that got the limited he wanted to get
[2923.119] the comprehensive testban treaty which
[2925.359] would have also eliminated underground
[2928.48] nuclear testing but he got the limited
[2932.88] testband treaty passed in ' 63 that put
[2936.319] an end to the United States and Soviet
[2939.68] Union atmospheric testing and that was a
[2942.0] huge step now of course then he's
[2943.88] assassinated in November Johnson becomes
[2947.76] president and then January through March
[2950.319] of
[2952.119] 1964 is when the buildup really started
[2954.88] in Vietnam. So with all of this going on
[2957.839] in your life,
[2960.52] Randall, today people always talk about
[2963.68] there's like almost two camps like it's
[2965.28] like the end of the world seems like
[2967.04] every time a presidential election comes
[2968.8] around or there's a war like people
[2971.599] think it's a terrible time to live. Was
[2973.92] I mean was that similar then? Do you
[2975.52] think that that is always the case that
[2977.28] people always are thinking it's like
[2978.64] we're at the precipice of something
[2980.16] terrible or we're at the precipice of
[2981.68] something great? Well, so a big turning
[2984.88] point was October of 19 uh 62. Was it 62
[2990.72] or 61? 62. The Cuban missile crisis,
[2994.16] right? We America had been deploying
[2997.119] Jupiter missiles with nuclear capability
[3000.079] and they probably were uh had were
[3002.559] carrying uh nuclear warheads. Let's see
[3005.2] in Greece I believe in the other country
[3006.88] was Turkey and they had the ability to
[3009.72] reach into the Soviet homeland. I
[3012.96] believe the ones in Turkey I would have
[3016.48] to go back and refresh myself on the
[3018.079] specifics but I think the ones in Turkey
[3019.839] had the ability to reach Moscow
[3021.76] actually. So in response, cuz I mean
[3024.319] this is this is in the thick of the Cold
[3026.559] War that's been going on now since 1946,
[3030.44] 1947 and there's this whole, you know,
[3033.28] after World War II was done, we
[3035.599] immediately shifted gears as far as the
[3037.92] Soviet Union and we'd been allies
[3039.76] through the World War II. Now they
[3041.28] became our enemy number one, right? And
[3045.28] so this cold war began in place and you
[3048.72] had this tit fortat back and forth. now
[3051.68] moving into the nuclear age. So we see
[3055.04] the evolution of of nuclear doctrine
[3058.16] beginning for example with long range
[3059.92] bombers which could actually carry bombs
[3061.76] that you dropped out of the plane.
[3063.599] Right? This is what you're seeing in the
[3065.68] 40s and when the US is now building a
[3068.559] whole series of like plutonium bombs
[3070.88] that are anywhere from 10 to 100 times
[3073.839] more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb.
[3076.48] Uh the the the thought was the delusion
[3079.28] was that the Soviet Union was going to
[3081.52] be 15 or 20 years out before they were
[3083.68] even going to be able to get their first
[3085.599] well they come and test their first
[3087.28] atomic bomb in
[3088.76] 1949. So you know within four years or
[3091.52] so they they've already so now it
[3094.24] accelerates. We move to from long range
[3096.839] bombers into intermediate range missiles
[3100.16] and start deploying those. be formed.
[3102.24] NATO, I think, was formed in 19
[3105.599] uh when was NATO formed? It was
[3107.44] definitely I think it was I think NATO
[3109.76] was formed in 47 48 right in there. You
[3112.4] could look it up. NATO was formed. Um so
[3116.0] then we begin to forward deployment of
[3118.0] intermediate range missiles and then the
[3120.48] Soviet Union headed by cruise ship 49
[3124.0] 49.
[3125.839] Yeah. So they they reciprocated and they
[3128.88] started building launch sites in Cuba,
[3131.359] you know, because by this time the Cuman
[3132.88] Revolution Ca Castro's overthrown
[3135.28] Batista, who was our dictator puppet who
[3137.92] was running Cuba. Castro takes over and
[3141.76] pretty much nationalizes everything and
[3143.92] pisses a bunch of people off. This is
[3145.92] what led the CIA to pressuring Kennedy
[3149.04] to uh to oversee an attack on Cuba. So
[3153.52] this was this failed Bay of Pigs story
[3155.68] just a whole another interesting
[3157.28] chapter. But that was a major turning
[3159.359] point for Kennedy, right? Not trusting
[3162.64] the CIA. Uh beginning to re probably
[3165.839] also the fact, you know, the rumor is
[3167.44] that uh that that Kennedy took LSD
[3170.72] several times. Uh and and it could be
[3173.92] because he was having an affair with a
[3176.079] woman who was best friends with Timothy
[3178.44] Liry. This is a fact. I don't remember
[3181.2] her name, but yeah, he had this affair
[3183.599] with her. She would come visit him in
[3185.119] the White House. Um, it's not Marilyn
[3187.359] Manson. I mean, Marilyn Monroe. No, it
[3190.559] wasn't Marilyn Monroe. It was not
[3192.48] Marilyn Monroe. I think he probably
[3194.559] Manson either. No, no, he was I think
[3197.28] No, I don't think Marilyn Manson had had
[3200.64] emerged onto the scene yet. Uh, so he
[3203.92] literally I mean he may have done acid
[3206.48] in the White House and you know I often
[3209.119] have thought if that was true that could
[3211.52] have been a major turning point because
[3213.2] I mean for a lot of people back then
[3215.2] that was a major shift and and people
[3219.599] living now today don't really know how
[3223.839] profound of a shift that was in
[3225.599] consciousness when a couple of million
[3227.839] people in our society took LSD. And what
[3230.48] did you come up with? Look at that. Who
[3232.8] is JFK having an affair
[3238.119] with? Let's see. Mimi Alfred.
[3244.72] Uh, is that who it was?
[3247.44] You know, I think her name did start
[3249.04] with an M, but I don't think it was
[3251.24] Mimi. Uh, so he had a lot of mistresses,
[3254.88] didn't he? Sounds like it. God, these 10
[3257.599] women
[3261.44] You sly dog you. Damn Johnny boy.
[3266.88] Let's see. We're not going to put
[3268.48] everybody on blast here. Mary Pinchett
[3271.04] Meyer. That's might be who it was. The
[3274.0] sister-in-law of legendary Washington
[3276.0] Post editor Ben Bradley.
[3278.96] Okay. Now, did does anything about her
[3281.04] having connections to Timothy Liry?
[3285.839] No. Let me look.
[3287.839] I mean, this is kind of getting off a
[3289.44] little bit on, you know, accepted
[3291.04] historical narrative, um, into the
[3293.76] fringe realm, but it could be
[3296.119] true. And I think that was her. I think
[3298.72] that was the name. I said I think that
[3300.88] her name started with an M. Yeah. Um,
[3305.359] I'm doing some forensic research.
[3309.04] Oh, okay. Yeah. Here we go. Timothy Liry
[3311.359] and Mary Pinched were both connected
[3313.2] through the psychedelic movement and
[3314.96] shared associations with influential
[3317.04] figures in the 1960s, particularly
[3319.119] around the use of ASD and its potential
[3321.28] to expand consciousness.
[3323.839] Uh-huh. Yeah. So, Mary Pinchet ex-wife
[3327.2] of CIA official Cord Meyer.
[3331.28] Okay.
[3333.839] She was interested in LSD and the
[3335.359] potential for using to promote peace.
[3338.48] It sounds like they were socially
[3340.319] connected. Timothy Liry was a h Harvard
[3342.64] psychologist. Yeah. Yeah.
[3345.68] Here it
[3347.0] is. Pinch me allegedly reached out to
[3350.0] Timothy Liry in the early 1960s to learn
[3352.799] more about LSD. Liry wrote about her in
[3356.4] in his autobiography claiming that she
[3358.799] visited him and asked for guidance on
[3360.4] how to use LSD in a therapeutic or
[3363.28] spiritual
[3364.52] way. There it is. According to Liry, she
[3367.599] told him she was part of a small group
[3369.359] of women who were giving LSD to powerful
[3371.76] men in Washington. Uhhuh. Possibly
[3374.559] including JFK in hopes of influencing
[3376.96] them towards peace. Boom.
[3380.72] Okay. So, this she was murdered as well.
[3384.0] Oh,
[3385.48] okay. So, that suggests there was
[3388.16] probably some truth to it. And and so
[3390.559] when she's telling this to Liry that
[3392.559] they're doing this, you can see that's
[3394.559] precisely in that window of time where
[3396.24] his views begin to
[3398.52] change and he be he did did start going
[3402.079] to wanting peace and had wanting
[3404.88] reproachment with the Soviet Union and
[3406.88] so on. But so come now to October of '
[3410.24] 62, the Cuban missile crisis, Kruef is
[3413.839] getting pressured from his hardliners
[3416.16] that he needs to respond to this forward
[3418.64] basing of intermediate range missiles in
[3420.839] Greece. So they now start building
[3424.079] missile launchers in Cuba and they're
[3426.4] bringing the boat with the actual
[3428.16] missiles that they want to deploy in
[3430.319] launchers in Cuba. Uh pu pull up Cuban
[3434.0] missile missile crisis. Uh let's get the
[3436.559] exact date. It would be October of ' 62.
[3439.52] So this is when the US Navy went out and
[3442.799] we had this eyeball to eyeball
[3445.0] confrontation. And this was considered
[3447.119] to be the closest we ever came
[3449.64] to World War II and potentially nuclear
[3452.799] war. And what saved our ass was the
[3458.04] communication between Kennedy and
[3460.799] Cruchief.
[3463.2] That's that's what saved our ass. There
[3465.359] were hardliners on both sides that
[3467.52] wanted to go to war and were pushing
[3470.079] hard to go to war. Yeah, there we go.
[3473.2] October 15, 14, 19. This is this is
[3476.64] important stuff that that the younger
[3478.48] generation, they need to know this
[3479.92] history because if you don't know this
[3482.0] history here, you have no clue as to
[3484.72] understanding what's going on right now
[3487.28] and how we got to where we're at. I mean
[3489.359] this is the context that you know
[3492.4] following this history and where we're
[3493.92] at now with this um because you know
[3496.559] it's been said that we have come now
[3498.559] within this the confrontation over
[3500.599] Ukraine as close to nuclear war as we
[3503.92] were back then in October of ' 62 and
[3507.359] that could be true. Interestingly, as
[3510.16] much as I now can't stand
[3512.359] Trump, he may have bought his time just
[3515.28] like it may be one of these kind of
[3517.68] ironic
[3518.92] situations. But you see right now, what
[3521.92] is it? Whitlock, what's his name? There
[3523.88] are back channel talks going on between
[3527.76] America and Russia, which did not happen
[3530.96] for over three years in the Biden
[3532.64] because the Biden administration refused
[3534.48] to talk to Russia between Yeah. between
[3537.44] the current between the administrations
[3539.68] and Russia. I'm sure there was plenty of
[3541.28] black back channel conversations going
[3543.28] on, but now Well, there was there was I
[3545.04] mean there's no evidence that there was
[3546.4] any communication during the Biden
[3548.0] years, but now there is. Uh I hope they
[3552.0] get it [ __ ] figured out. Um because
[3555.2] you know, we got through 40 years of
[3556.799] Cold War without annihilating ourselves.
[3559.28] And I kind of think that was due to the
[3560.96] luck of the draw as much as anything.
[3563.119] And we shouldn't be playing around. See,
[3564.96] oh, Putin's a dictator. Putin's a
[3566.559] dictator. Well, you can say that, you
[3568.0] know, as much as you want, but since
[3569.359] World War II, the United States has
[3571.52] spent trillions of dollars supporting
[3573.52] dozens of dictators in all kinds of
[3575.96] countries, right? The the the whole
[3578.319] legacy of confrontation with Iran right
[3580.4] now goes back to the CIA overthrowing
[3582.88] the democratically elected leader of
[3584.88] Iran back in the 50s and installing the
[3587.599] brutal sha of Iran as their dictator for
[3590.799] for decades. Right? That actually
[3593.119] happened. You can research it. you'll
[3595.119] find out. And of course, so the
[3596.559] Iranians, they've got this huge mistrust
[3599.04] of and it was the overthrow of the sha
[3603.28] and the extremism that was brought in by
[3605.68] the sha with his with his uh black
[3608.319] prisons and all of this where people
[3609.839] were being disappeared, anybody who
[3611.44] opposed his regime. He was being propped
[3614.48] up and supported by the US government.
[3617.119] And then in 79 they had the revolution
[3619.76] and the hard the Islamic hardliners came
[3622.559] in and took over. That was when uh you
[3625.76] know during the the uh the what do they
[3628.24] call it the was was during the campaign
[3630.079] between uh Jimmy Carter and Ronald
[3633.799] Reagan and Jimmy Carter had this failed
[3636.72] fiasco with this attempt to rescue the
[3639.52] hostages that had been captured. Um but
[3643.44] yeah, they
[3644.599] overthrew the job of Iran and uh we've
[3648.319] been going at it ever since because
[3651.119] several reasons why we were in the
[3652.72] Middle East in the first place was to
[3654.24] control Middle Eastern oil. That was the
[3656.48] whole motive why why the sha first they
[3660.88] installed the government uh in the state
[3663.52] of Israel in 47 through 49 and Israel
[3668.24] and Iran were going to be the two key
[3670.4] pillars of our containment policy to
[3673.2] contain the Soviet Union and prevent the
[3675.92] Soviet Union from getting access to the
[3678.72] oil deposits in the Middle East and have
[3681.92] an exclusive monopoly for ourselves to
[3684.319] control the oil in the Middle East. And
[3686.48] that's what our whole foreign policy in
[3688.64] the Middle East was originally all
[3690.24] about. So Iran and Israel were going to
[3693.119] be the two legs of our containment
[3696.0] policy that and uh but then when when
[3699.359] the Sha was overthrown, okay, so now
[3701.76] Iran has become our enemy because
[3703.92] they're asserting their own
[3705.24] independence. And of course, you know,
[3707.92] it's the same thing if you it's the way
[3709.839] it goes. uh you know you had the brutal
[3712.24] Sha who was overthrown but the only one
[3714.24] who could really overthrow him was
[3715.52] somebody just as brutal you see uh and
[3718.48] that's the whole kind of psychology of
[3720.24] this interventionist foreign policy that
[3722.88] we've been been uh you know perpetrating
[3725.76] since the end of World War II and what
[3728.0] it is now it's called full spectrum
[3730.119] domination and this was a this was the
[3732.64] the military policy conceived by the
[3735.0] neocons back during Daddy Bush's year
[3738.559] and then brought to fruition during
[3740.72] Junior Bush's uh term from 2000 to 2008.
[3745.119] And basically what they needed was a
[3747.92] Pearl Harbor type event even
[3750.16] acknowledged in the writings of some of
[3751.839] the the the the neocon philosophers uh
[3755.2] that included Cheney, Dick Cheney,
[3757.44] included Paul Wilfors, a number of
[3759.76] others uh that were the key who who who
[3763.04] articulated this whole uh idea of this
[3766.72] plan this game plan for the new American
[3768.88] century which basically amounted to the
[3771.52] US government uh getting control of
[3774.16] global resource. ources because remember
[3777.119] what happened in the early '9s? Well,
[3779.52] the Soviet Union collapsed. So, our
[3781.839] whole foreign policy, all of our
[3783.359] containment, everything was oriented
[3785.599] around standing up to this other, you
[3788.4] know, what Ronald Reagan called the evil
[3790.319] empire, which was the Soviet Union.
[3792.24] That's why we created NATO. NATO was
[3794.24] part of this uh uh policy of Soviet
[3797.76] containment that was then going to keep
[3800.48] us control of the Middle Eastern oil at
[3803.44] that time because Middle Eastern oil was
[3805.119] the big source of of uh petroleum.
[3808.72] That's what the United States identified
[3811.839] as the biggest threat to having control
[3814.079] of the oil. Soviet Union is that Soviet
[3816.64] Union. Absolutely. Yeah. So, and so one
[3819.52] reason that Iran became our enemy was
[3821.839] because when they overthrew the sha,
[3824.92] they went to the Soviet camp. Now, this
[3828.24] is, you know, this is in 79 and 80.
[3830.64] Reagan's become president. They made a
[3832.96] backroom deal with the with the new
[3835.599] regime in uh in Iran and said they would
[3839.119] supply him with weapons if if they would
[3842.4] release the hostages. So, it was like
[3845.039] the 444th day or something that they had
[3847.599] been holding the hostages. And on the
[3849.68] day that Ronald Reagan was sworn in as
[3853.119] president, they released all the the
[3855.119] hostages. Um, I think there was like 40
[3858.48] of them, something like that. They
[3859.68] released them all. And then, uh, you
[3861.92] know, we had two terms of Reagan and he
[3864.72] was follow and then George W. HW Bush
[3868.079] became, uh, vice president in 88. And
[3872.319] then uh and then ran for president and
[3875.2] he won I who was it over the caucus or
[3877.359] some some nondescript
[3880.28] democrat then we had daddy Bush and so
[3883.76] when the son became president he filled
[3887.039] his whole cabinet full of the neocons
[3889.119] that were supporters of this project for
[3891.839] a new American century that and you see
[3894.4] now the Soviet Union's been gone for 10
[3896.559] years. So remember NATO was created as
[3900.0] the counterweight to the Soviet Union
[3902.559] and Soviet expansionism. Well, once the
[3905.039] Soviet Union had fallen, all of the
[3907.359] Eastern block countries became
[3909.119] autonomous and self-controlling again.
[3911.92] Then at that point, there was no
[3913.44] rationale to even maintain the existence
[3915.839] of NATO anymore. Right? However, what
[3917.76] they did at that point was they said,
[3919.359] "Well,
[3921.079] uh, this is our golden opportunity. our
[3923.839] main competitor for global control is
[3925.839] out of the way. So why are we going to
[3928.0] go back to, you know, within our
[3930.4] borders, minding our own business when
[3932.4] we can now militarily dominate the
[3934.319] planet? And that was the precursor to
[3937.76] being able to control planetary
[3940.599] resources. So that's where we're still
[3942.799] at, right? To this day. To this day.
[3945.76] Yes. I mean, you mentioned some names
[3947.68] like Dick Cheney and uh Daddy Bush Bush
[3951.68] Jr. Are there other names that you think
[3954.559] people should be looking into in the
[3956.319] history of this or events?
[3960.079] You could like Paul Wolawitz. He was the
[3962.72] author of the doctrine. Paul
[3968.119] Wolawitz. Oh yeah, I could come up with
[3970.16] a list of names. Not necessarily pull
[3971.839] them right out of my memory bank, but I
[3973.76] could certainly come up with a list of
[3975.039] names.
[3976.599] Um, so you know, it's gone back and
[3979.119] forth and now, um, you know, I was quite
[3983.52] optimistic during the campaign because
[3985.92] Trump was saying all the right stuff. He
[3988.72] was saying, I want to be the peace
[3989.92] president. We'll end this Ukraine war.
[3992.48] Because, you know, people don't
[3993.76] understand that what happened is one by
[3995.839] one, this started during the Clinton
[3997.76] years. One by one they started
[3999.68] recruiting all the former eastern block
[4001.599] countries into NATO the western military
[4004.799] alliance whose sole purpose was to
[4007.839] basically overrun dominate Russia and
[4011.28] one by one the last two the the last big
[4014.48] prize was yeah recruiting Ukraine into
[4018.4] Russ into NATO because particularly
[4021.039] eastern Ukraine has trillions of dollars
[4023.76] worth of resources. I mean, it's got oil
[4026.559] deposits. It's got precious minerals.
[4029.039] It's got trillions of dollars worth of
[4031.839] resources. And see, well, what happened
[4035.039] was the eastern Ukra the Ukrainians, the
[4037.76] ones um you know, in the area of
[4040.319] contention where most of the fighting is
[4042.079] going on are mostly ethnic Russians. And
[4045.119] you know, there's such a convoluted
[4046.88] mixed up history of that region, but
[4049.359] most of them identify with Russia. And
[4052.4] there was actually a referendum that was
[4054.24] held, I think it was in 2014, where they
[4057.119] voted to secede from Ukraine. And in
[4061.44] response, the government of Ukraine
[4064.0] began attacking the uh oblasts, they're
[4067.68] called, of eastern Ukraine, uh with
[4070.559] rockets. And uh this is going on like
[4073.119] during the Obama years. And they kill
[4076.48] like 14 15,000 people with their rocket
[4080.0] attacks. and probably
[4083.28] uh wound and and [ __ ] 10 times that
[4087.76] many with their attacks. And this is
[4089.359] going on and the whole time. So the
[4091.68] people of eastern Ukraine start turning
[4093.44] to Russia and begging for assistance.
[4096.48] And this went on for the whole like
[4098.319] throughout the whole Obama time. And of
[4100.96] course mainstream media is not really
[4102.64] reporting. No, people are oblivious that
[4104.48] this is going on, you know, and that we
[4108.04] overthrew the the the democratically
[4111.239] elected leader of president of Ukraine
[4114.96] who wanted to normalize relations with
[4117.48] Russia and he wanted to start trade with
[4120.239] Russia and have have have business
[4122.0] dealings with Russia and all of this.
[4124.56] So, he had to go. So, he was overthrown
[4126.56] in a coup in 2014 and then they began
[4130.0] these attacks on eastern Ukraine.
[4133.08] Uh, and oh, there was a whole series of
[4136.56] red lines that Russia's put forward.
[4139.279] Don't go there. Don't go there. And of
[4141.279] course, we did it. We went. And then,
[4144.239] you know, you kind of flip the script a
[4146.0] little bit. What would we think if
[4147.279] Russia was trying to form a military
[4149.6] alliance with Cuba and
[4151.64] Mexico, you know, and was supplying
[4154.64] Mexico or Cuba with weapons? Well, we
[4156.799] can see how we would res would respond
[4158.64] to that. Go back to October of 1962. we
[4162.08] were ready to go to World War II over
[4164.0] that, right? Well, I think it's probably
[4166.88] to Putin's forbearance that we're still
[4169.319] here. That we haven't gone to from a
[4172.0] from a cold war into a hot war with
[4174.319] Russia because you don't people don't
[4176.48] realize how close we were getting to
[4178.08] that at the end of the Obama I mean at
[4180.4] the end of the Biden administration. I
[4182.56] mean, we were literally a hair's breath.
[4185.199] They were they were moving these long
[4186.719] range hypersonic missiles into Ukraine
[4189.6] that now had the capacity to reach
[4192.12] Moscow and and yeah I mean I think that
[4195.12] within a month or two of if Kla Harris
[4197.04] had been elected those missiles would
[4198.96] have been flying. This this war this
[4201.52] confrontation with Russia would have
[4202.88] gone hot. Uh but you know
[4207.84] uh Donald won and you know I want him
[4212.76] to I there's so much about him I don't
[4215.96] like you know but ironically he may have
[4220.32] bought us some time but I wish the
[4222.56] American people would get their heads
[4224.32] out of their [ __ ] [ __ ] and pay
[4226.239] attention to what's going on. And we do
[4229.04] we we we need to
[4230.92] disengage because our destiny does not
[4233.679] lie in trying to control those
[4236.0] terrestrial resources of the Middle East
[4238.0] or uh or or eastern Ukraine. No. Yeah.
[4243.199] No. Yeah. It see I it's such a strange
[4245.84] conversation for me to have because you
[4247.84] you I think you know this but Da is
[4249.76] Bellar Russian. She's from Barus. She's
[4251.52] got family in Barouch. She lived in Kev
[4253.36] for 5 years. Uhhuh. And it's always such
[4256.4] a strange conversation to have about
[4258.4] this because as somebody who's from the
[4260.8] United
[4261.8] States, I think that it I don't know,
[4265.04] we've talked a lot about this, done
[4266.96] plenty of research on my own. We don't
[4269.28] want to be involved in this. Like
[4271.36] there's not really a reason why except
[4274.239] for resource extraction for us to be
[4276.56] involved in there. And there's plenty of
[4279.76] ways that resources can be used
[4281.52] differently that we've talked about in
[4282.96] earlier podcasts, coordination, so on
[4285.6] and so forth. But when you get into
[4287.28] conversations like with people from that
[4290.76] region and people who have friends and
[4293.52] family fighting for you get into this
[4295.92] weird you get into this territory of
[4298.08] like a moral dilemma. It's like it is a
[4300.64] moral dilemma. It it is. And you know,
[4304.76] Putin, I don't, you know, I I just I
[4307.44] can't judge the man, but probably
[4309.92] invading was a bad idea because But
[4313.04] here's the thing again. Most Americans
[4314.96] don't know that the the central
[4317.44] government in you in Kiev was amassing
[4320.32] like amassed 100,000 troops right there
[4323.36] on the border of those eastern Oblasts.
[4326.159] Mhm. Right. Theans and Lansk or Lansk.
[4329.28] Yeah. Yeah.
[4330.88] and and gave the appearance that they
[4332.719] were about to
[4334.12] invade. Well, that was when Putin
[4336.84] finally, you know, buckled under and and
[4340.48] invade, which which the eastern
[4342.08] Ukrainians had been asking for for for
[4344.44] years. Uh because they're under the the
[4347.12] the all this rocket fire coming from
[4349.8] Kiev. So, I mean, yeah, it's just a
[4352.08] twisted mess and we should get the hell
[4353.76] out of there. Um because there's nothing
[4356.4] that we're doing there that's going to
[4357.76] help solve the problem. What we're doing
[4359.679] is only making it worse.
[4362.239] It's escalating it to a global scale.
[4364.8] Yes. And the younger generation, your
[4367.84] generation, Beckett, needs to wake up
[4370.48] and realize that we if if they want to
[4373.28] have a future, if you want to have a
[4374.719] future and your kids that you're going
[4376.8] to bring into this world have a future,
[4378.48] we do need desperately to have a change
[4381.28] in direction where we go. And the only
[4383.36] way we're going to have a change in
[4384.48] direction is if there's a mass
[4385.84] awakening, just like what took place in
[4388.08] America between 1966 and 1968. It was a
[4392.0] mass awakening that brought public
[4394.96] pressure to bring an end to the Vietnam
[4397.679] War. And so millions of Americans came
[4400.8] out to the streets and demanded an end
[4403.44] to the Vietnam War. I I was part
[4406.56] participated in the largest
[4408.56] demonstration at that point in American
[4410.56] history in May of 1971 in Washington DC.
[4414.159] And it was also the largest mass arrest
[4416.64] in American history. And that was a
[4419.12] whole incredible story in itself, what
[4421.84] went down that first week of May 1971.
[4425.76] But I remember John Mitchell stepping
[4427.84] out onto the balcony of the Justice
[4430.4] Department and in Pennsylvania Avenue as
[4433.52] far as the eye could see was
[4434.88] demonstrators and it's a really wide
[4437.36] almost like a plaza there completely
[4439.36] filled and he steps out onto the balcony
[4443.44] of the Justice Department and
[4445.36] immediately from this crowd that had to
[4447.36] have been 10 to 20,000 people boo. They
[4450.719] started booing them and the way the
[4452.48] buildings are configured that the the it
[4455.199] would echo back and forth and it created
[4458.0] this amazing almost acoustic powerful
[4461.6] effect. And I'm thinking at the time I
[4465.12] remember I I wanted to get a better view
[4466.719] and I I sometime need to go back there
[4468.719] and find I climbed up on a statue a
[4471.6] statue of some kind. I was up on the
[4473.36] like sitting on the shoulders or
[4474.8] something of a statue where I could see
[4477.6] uh far in both direction and I could see
[4479.6] John Mitchell on the the balcony and I
[4481.6] remember thinking what does that feel
[4483.96] like for that guy
[4486.76] now but I'll tell you after that and
[4490.4] that that uh war protest was organized
[4493.92] by the Vietnam veterans against the war
[4497.199] and there's a movie about um
[4500.56] uh called Born on the 4th July that has
[4504.159] a some of its scenes during
[4507.159] that that protest. And remember uh Tom
[4510.4] Cruz played it was a true story. It was
[4513.04] an Oliver Stone movie. It's definitely
[4515.76] worth seeing. And it was one of these
[4517.199] guys like I was talking about earlier
[4519.12] who was total
[4520.36] gung-ho. Went over there, got uh
[4524.0] grievously wounded and came back
[4526.0] paralyzed. Yeah. and then realized that
[4528.88] they were trying to exploit him to ramp
[4531.92] up anti- to pro-war sympathy and he
[4535.36] rebelled against that and he became a
[4536.96] leader of the anti-war movement. Yeah.
[4539.6] See, there's a lot for us to stand up
[4542.32] for now. I I was having a conversation
[4544.4] the other day with uh Ashton Forbes. I
[4547.28] think you know him as well. And we were
[4549.679] talking about I mean if people know
[4552.08] Ashton they know that
[4553.8] he's all about disclosing information
[4556.96] about free energy devices or zero point
[4559.84] energy technology. He's most commonly
[4562.08] known for the MH370 stuff. And we were
[4565.28] just talking about, okay, well, what if
[4567.76] there was a scale, a protest of that
[4571.6] size, a scale today, where we learned
[4574.44] that the United States government, world
[4577.04] governments have had technology that
[4579.6] could potentially give us access to free
[4582.0] energy solve a resource problem for half
[4585.679] a century potentially. Not to say that's
[4588.56] even true, but there's all of these
[4590.719] things that are important to humanity.
[4593.92] You know, there's things that we could
[4595.679] be standing up for and standing against
[4598.08] a war, standing against violence, but
[4599.84] also standing for something. For
[4602.92] something exactly for change, for a hope
[4607.12] of a different future, you know, and I
[4609.12] think, see, I'm an optimistic person. I
[4611.92] I do believe that there is massive
[4614.159] change coming and it is happening. I
[4616.719] mean, I see a massive consciousness
[4618.48] awakening. I think people who watch your
[4620.56] channel, watch our podcast, watch Matt
[4624.4] Bell, watch Cosmic Summit, follow all of
[4627.6] these different brands are looking
[4632.52] for something deeper than just
[4635.12] entertainment or just getting lost. But
[4637.6] if we would just take ourselves out of
[4640.64] the digital landscape that we've become
[4642.88] so entrenched in. Mhm. And look at one
[4646.88] the opportunity that allows us to
[4648.88] communicate and to coordinate and to
[4650.96] work together and also to look at what
[4653.6] stands in between the coordination, what
[4655.84] stands in between these amazing
[4658.64] scientific discoveries that could have
[4660.96] already happened or if not can happen
[4663.76] and societal discoveries like we have.
[4666.88] so much access to build new technology
[4670.08] and technology that is more significant
[4673.6] than we realize and we use it every day
[4676.159] in many areas of our life. Well, I you
[4679.199] know I have learned enough in the last
[4681.36] say five years that I do really believe
[4683.199] that shifting away out of fossil fuels
[4687.199] which will always be I think an
[4689.28] important component of a diversified
[4691.36] energy mix and I we can talk about in a
[4694.719] minute why I don't want all fossil fuel
[4696.88] use to end. There's a reason, right? But
[4699.6] I think plasma physics is really
[4702.0] showing, you know, we know Malcolm's
[4704.159] work. All the controversy aside, I've
[4707.52] seen enough been around enough people,
[4709.6] you know, been around oh, what's his
[4711.52] name down there who has the the shop
[4713.76] there in uh Clearwater, the exNASA
[4716.96] scientist, what his name? I went visit
[4719.44] I've been visited him twice. He's been
[4721.32] testing ver iterations of the
[4723.76] thunderstorm generator and you know,
[4725.6] I've seen enough to know now these
[4727.52] things work. They do work. I mean,
[4730.239] George, we have video proof of George
[4733.12] huffing.
[4734.76] plasmoids, right? We were in an
[4737.36] undisclosed location for a significant
[4739.84] period of time running that inside of a
[4742.239] room, doing tons and tons of different
[4744.88] tests on it. I mean, you were you were
[4747.44] there. There was plenty of people there
[4749.04] who saw this. This was at the beginning
[4750.64] of it. Okay. Regardless of Malcolm's
[4752.719] technology, even the the science behind
[4756.239] this, the research that's being done
[4758.0] around plasma physics is by a lot of
[4761.36] incredibly smart, capable people who are
[4764.08] not trying to extract from it. They're
[4765.84] trying to bring it to the world. Mhm.
[4767.92] Yeah. Well, that's, you know, Malcolm's
[4770.4] open sourced all of his notes,
[4772.4] everything. So that right there you go,
[4775.199] okay, well if he's, you know, now he's
[4777.52] got patents on several applications, but
[4780.32] anybody can go and download, he's got it
[4782.96] all up there. You can download, you
[4784.96] know, years and years of his notes,
[4787.12] sketches, diagrams,
[4789.96] schematics. Anybody can go do that.
[4792.239] Yeah, I mean there's there's a lot like
[4794.48] there's a lot of very promising stuff
[4796.48] out here ranging I mean I think this is
[4800.56] one of the biggest missed I guess you
[4803.36] could say publicity or marketing
[4804.88] opportunities for the plasma physics
[4806.96] community too like you know Terrence
[4810.08] Howard went on Joe Rogan did you hear
[4812.159] about this okay well
[4814.159] okay whenever you say plasma physics or
[4816.0] vortexbased math like that's who people
[4818.96] think of the general public nowadays And
[4822.159] interesting at the because think about
[4824.239] it like what's the largest platform
[4825.92] where this comes in? If you ask the
[4827.52] general public, my friends who don't pay
[4829.44] any attention to any of this know who
[4831.28] Terren Howard is and what he says and he
[4833.44] just went on another podcast that got
[4835.92] super popular as well. So if and he says
[4839.52] some good stuff too like he says some
[4842.32] interesting things in there that some
[4843.76] smart people are like ah he's he's on to
[4846.159] something as well. And then he had Eric
[4848.719] Weinstein come on and they talked about
[4850.64] this. Anyways, it ranges from
[4854.52] that Terrence Howard all the way to
[4857.679] Marco Rhoden and Malcolm Vendal and Eric
[4860.64] Weinstein.
[4862.12] And it's
[4864.199] just strangely
[4867.0] quiet there. It's strangely quiet for
[4871.04] the significance of what this would be.
[4873.04] I just imagine like what you're talking
[4874.8] about in the
[4876.36] 50s,60s,7s like if we were on the verge
[4880.64] of this and with the technology we
[4884.44] have to communicate with each other to
[4887.04] share information. Yeah, you would think
[4889.52] that it would at least be something that
[4891.92] humans value, right? that the idea of
[4895.52] not having to be dependent upon
[4899.0] uh let's just say finite energy systems
[4903.6] that were waring over right it would be
[4906.56] a topic of conversation and it should be
[4908.88] joined with the topic of conversation of
[4911.44] why are we why have we been killing
[4913.92] people and going to war in the Middle
[4915.679] East for a very long period of time okay
[4918.239] well there's a natural walk not even a
[4920.96] run or a jump natural walk between that
[4923.44] and like, okay, we've got a resource
[4926.159] problem, if you want to call it that.
[4928.679] Okay, we can kill a bunch of people to
[4930.96] solve our problem, or we can look at
[4932.48] alternative ways of solving that. And I
[4936.08] would think that if we cared enough as
[4938.88] people and wanted to stand out and go
[4940.639] through a protest like you said, there
[4942.56] might be some change.
[4944.719] I think so. I mean, it's just a matter
[4946.96] of, you know, what finally brought the
[4949.199] Vietnam War to an end was millions and
[4951.44] millions of Americans standing up and
[4954.199] saying refusing. And and so Nixon, he he
[4958.32] drug it out as long as he could. I mean,
[4960.159] as many people as many soldiers died
[4963.6] basically uh during his four years
[4966.239] before he got got kicked out of office.
[4969.44] Well, actually that was after he was
[4970.88] reelected, but that first four years of
[4972.96] his first term, the number of casualties
[4976.56] from the Vietnam War was double from
[4978.639] when he took office. So if he had just
[4981.199] immediately brought the troops home,
[4982.8] instead of being 52 or 54,000
[4985.199] fatalities, it would have been about
[4986.56] half that. But he drug it out. Drug it
[4989.679] out. But it you know and then finally
[4992.159] you know they had to make this ignoble
[4994.44] retreat very much like our retreat from
[4997.96] Afghanistan. You know the helicopters
[5000.08] flying out as the Vietkong are coming in
[5002.159] and and taking over Saigon and uh you
[5006.08] know people hanging on to the blade onto
[5008.88] the runners of the helicopter you know
[5010.88] and yeah it was it was quite a scene. Uh
[5014.08] that was in I guess 75 when we finally
[5016.4] pulled out completely and Vietnam
[5020.239] reverted to the Vietnamese. They became
[5023.56] communists but interestingly we've
[5026.56] almost in a sense formed an alliance
[5028.639] with them. Uh now uh and they're very
[5033.12] much you know courting the United
[5036.6] States. Uh I think in fact one of the
[5039.92] countries that is not being subjected to
[5042.639] tariffs might be Vietnam.
[5045.04] Not sure. Uh I'm not sure about that but
[5047.76] uh it could be
[5051.04] what what is the what do you know what
[5052.48] the estimated death count is in the
[5054.32] Ukraine Russian war over the last uh
[5057.6] guess? No, I don't I don't have any
[5060.48] numbers but I'm guessing the range of a
[5062.4] couple hundred thousand. Yeah, it's
[5064.32] estimated over 250,000 and it's probably
[5067.36] higher than that probably.
[5069.8] So, and what a waste. See, think about
[5072.32] this. So, we're going over there. The
[5074.159] whole the whole uh motive is to get
[5076.719] control of energy and resources. But
[5079.679] then think about the energy and
[5081.6] resources that are being
[5083.639] wasted in this interventionist approach,
[5087.76] right? Uh it's really it's it's obscene.
[5091.52] Real quick, Randall, just to get the
[5093.92] fact straight, there is a large tax on
[5097.639] Vietnamese imports. Okay. S I mean,
[5101.12] under Trump or pre-Trump? On April, this
[5104.159] is what the search said. So, this is
[5106.08] also I haven't researched this at all.
[5108.4] Okay. On April 2nd, 2025, President
[5111.28] Trump announced a 46 reciprocal tariff
[5114.4] on the Vietnamese imports, citing
[5116.88] Vietnamese substantial trade surplus
[5119.12] with the US.
[5121.4] So what has been Vietnam's response?
[5124.56] Vietnam's response on US goods. Vietnam
[5127.679] has reduced import duties on several
[5130.08] American products such as liqufied
[5132.159] natural gas from 5 to 2% and automobiles
[5136.08] from a range of 45 to 64% down to
[5140.28] 32%. In an effort to balance trade
[5142.639] imbalances. Yeah. So they're they're now
[5146.0] they're trying to Yeah. come to an
[5147.84] accommodation with the United States.
[5149.76] Vietnam is and and that is because we do
[5152.88] a lot of business with them, right? Even
[5154.88] though they're communist,
[5156.92] right? And even though, you know,
[5159.36] Vietnamese civilians are still being
[5161.199] blown up by leftover ordinance since the
[5164.48] pull out of American troops in 75. Yeah.
[5168.639] Yeah. And that just happened less than
[5170.239] two weeks ago, too. So, I think the
[5172.32] first round of tariffs didn't affect
[5174.32] Vietnam. Uhhuh. Interesting. Okay.
[5177.76] Anyways, we have the point is we've got
[5179.36] this relationship with them. So, what
[5181.36] was the whole point of the war? You
[5183.48] know, turns out that we lose the Vietnam
[5186.44] War, but you know, a few years later,
[5188.8] we're in business with I, you know, I
[5190.159] went and had my taxes done the other
[5191.84] day. My accountant is Vietnamese and
[5194.88] we've been using him for what, 15 years
[5196.719] now? Yeah. He's Vietnamese. So, we went
[5198.8] in there. His whole company in there is
[5200.48] like maybe 15 or 20 employees. They're
[5202.88] all Vietnamese. you know, I've had, you
[5205.36] know, living in apartments where I had
[5206.8] Vietnamese neighbors, got along just
[5208.56] fine, and I'm thinking, okay, yeah, we
[5210.48] fought this bloody war that, you know,
[5213.92] we were presumably enemies, but it was
[5216.159] all just the the the byproduct of
[5218.8] policy. There was no natural inherent
[5221.28] organic
[5223.0] animosity until it was created from from
[5226.639] outside artificially.
[5228.88] Yeah. And the only thing we've ever
[5230.32] fought over is love and resources,
[5233.199] right? as humans. That's an
[5235.48] oversimplification, but so how would you
[5238.32] pull the lever, you know? Oh, there's a
[5240.8] resource problem. Yeah, we don't hate
[5243.04] people naturally. We don't fight people
[5244.8] naturally for the sake of it. Yeah. I
[5246.96] mean, are the Russian people our enemy?
[5248.639] No, they're not our enemy. I'd hope not.
[5251.28] My girlfriend might be down there
[5252.48] plotting on me if she
[5256.56] Okay. Yeah. Uh well, yeah. I mean, the
[5260.159] whole thing is our our foreign policy is
[5262.159] basically just uh a policy of
[5265.28] international bullyism. That's what it
[5267.52] is. And you know, that's what Russia I
[5270.4] mean, that's what Trump is doing right
[5272.159] now by deploying all of the military
[5274.719] assets to the Middle East, you know, to
[5276.639] confront Iran. Um God, I mean, I hope
[5280.48] they work something out. Um it would be
[5283.199] a disaster to go to war with Iran. It
[5286.159] could it could precipitate the collapse
[5287.92] of the global economy. I mean, it could
[5289.6] be that severe. And then there's always
[5291.679] the danger of escalation. What does that
[5293.52] mean? I don't think Russia's going to
[5295.04] come in on the side of Iran. I would
[5297.36] hope not. Or China, but you know,
[5301.12] they're business partners. Uh, you know,
[5304.4] what do you do when your business
[5305.44] partner is getting pummeled? Uh, yeah. I
[5309.36] mean, I don't know. So, we're we're
[5310.639] we're what? We're poised to go to war
[5312.159] with Iran because we want to do the
[5314.56] bidding of you know who that'll go
[5317.36] unnamed. But we know I think we all know
[5320.639] who is calling the shots right now as
[5323.12] far as American foreign policy in the
[5324.88] Middle East. Um and I I'm very disturbed
[5330.239] by that. Um we know that um you know
[5334.8] most of Congress is on the receiving end
[5337.36] of some significant payoffs from you
[5340.88] know
[5341.88] who. How can that be I mean how can that
[5345.04] be accepted and how can that be
[5346.52] tolerated? I I I I I I it blows my mind
[5349.6] that we accept that as norm, the normal.
[5353.12] But again, we and we got to talk about
[5355.04] this at some point. That was what
[5357.36] happened when the 17th amendment took
[5360.159] away the control of the state of the
[5362.96] Senate. Look up just for a second uh
[5365.52] most expensive senatorial campaigns and
[5368.96] we'll get an idea of how much senators
[5371.199] are having to raise in order to get
[5373.84] elected.
[5385.679] Ted Cruz versus Colin Alred. This was in
[5389.36] 2024, right? What do you what do you
[5392.4] estimate the spend to be? What's your
[5394.32] hypothesis
[5395.92] with just Ted Cruz? Both of them
[5398.48] combined total spend couple of
[5401.639] million more
[5405.12] 198 million. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5407.44] What? So 198 million from Israel to
[5412.96] those guys? No, no, no, no. Total spend.
[5416.88] I'm looking for Apac money. Oh. Oh, wait
[5420.159] a minute. Wait a minute. So that's how
[5421.76] much money they spent on their
[5423.44] campaigns, right? Right. Now, these are
[5426.0] senatorial campaigns. Yep. Right. So,
[5429.12] we're talking, what' you say again? 190
[5431.52] something million. 198. And that's not
[5433.92] the most expensive one. Dr. Oz's
[5437.36] senatorial race was the most expensive.
[5439.76] Approximately 375 million.
[5444.52] What? Okay. Well, you can see right
[5446.96] there that it's going to quickly add up
[5448.719] to billion plus dollars. Now, in the
[5451.76] original constitutional system, there
[5454.08] wouldn't be any of that because the
[5456.639] senators were chosen out of the state
[5459.12] legislative bodies. They didn't
[5460.8] campaign. They didn't raise money. They
[5463.199] didn't make promises. They didn't make
[5465.0] commitments. There was no bribery
[5467.6] because they weren't running election
[5470.0] campaigns. They were getting chosen by
[5473.679] the state legislative bodies. Each state
[5477.12] was free to decide their own way of
[5479.199] choosing their senators to send to
[5481.28] Washington to represent state interests.
[5484.48] Well, that got overthrown in 1913 with
[5486.96] the 17th amendment that took away the
[5489.36] control of the state legislative bodies
[5492.0] over the Senates and now senators had to
[5494.56] go out and start campaigning just like
[5496.8] the congressmen in the House, right?
[5499.52] Because the the founding fathers in
[5501.679] their wisdom knew that yeah, you got the
[5504.32] house. They're going to be subject to
[5506.159] whatever the whims of a transient
[5508.76] majority that could change from one year
[5511.199] to the next. They're going to be subject
[5513.36] to the bribery. You know, that people
[5515.6] are going to be, you know, offering them
[5517.52] deals and and and making contributions
[5521.12] and they're going to be subject to all
[5522.719] of this stuff. And to immunize have the
[5526.48] bicamel congress was established. So
[5528.96] you'd have one body that didn't have to
[5531.4] campaign and spent raise money. This is
[5535.199] why they were serve why senators first
[5537.36] serve for six years and they're chosen.
[5540.88] And so when you're they're chosen out of
[5543.04] the state legislative bodies, their
[5546.0] priority when they go to Washington is
[5549.28] they're representing the state
[5551.4] governments which prior to the 17th
[5555.04] amendment, the 16th amendment, and the
[5556.8] Federal Reserve Act of
[5558.44] 1913. Prior to that, the states were
[5562.239] dominant supreme over the federal
[5564.239] government, and the federal government
[5565.679] was subservient to the states. But then
[5568.56] you had this whole progressive movement
[5570.88] of the early 20th century whose goal was
[5573.28] to centralize power in the federal
[5576.08] government. But the state governments
[5578.239] and individual American citizens had to
[5580.8] be disempowered in order for that to
[5583.32] happen. So prior to 1916, the federal
[5586.32] government had no right or business at
[5588.239] all in anybody's personal finances. You
[5591.52] didn't pay income taxes to the
[5592.96] government. It was none of their
[5594.0] business. how you made your money, how
[5596.239] you spent your money, unless you know,
[5599.44] unless you did it deceitfully or
[5600.88] dishonestly. But at that point, the
[5602.96] local or state governments were
[5604.719] considered to be fully proficient at
[5606.8] being able to handle that kind of a
[5609.12] problem. You didn't need the federal
[5610.56] government in there to handle, you know,
[5612.8] a dispute over money if if you know,
[5615.76] somebody's embezzling or
[5617.12] misappropriating funds or whatever. But
[5620.08] so that's what happened in 1913. And it
[5622.8] was those policies and the policies of
[5624.8] taxation and um inflating the money
[5628.48] supply because now you had the Federal
[5630.239] Reserve that could create money out of
[5631.84] nothing that gave us the financial
[5634.32] wherewithal to enter World War I. And
[5637.44] once we got into World War I, we laid we
[5640.239] we planted the seeds for World War II,
[5642.56] which which led to the Cold War. And the
[5644.88] whole the whole military and foreign
[5647.12] policy of the 20th century grew out of
[5649.52] that. See, now if people understood the
[5653.44] role of the 17th amendment and we got
[5655.44] rid of that, all those big numbers
[5657.6] you're seeing there would go
[5659.48] away. Now, if Ted Cruz didn't have to
[5662.159] raise $100 million to get elected,
[5665.76] right? He's I mean, and who's supporting
[5668.159] him? Well, who's making All you got to
[5670.0] do is look at who are the biggest
[5671.92] donors, right? And that's who the Senate
[5675.12] is working for. It's as simple as that.
[5678.719] will get rid of the 17th amendment and
[5681.679] now the senators are going to be working
[5683.28] for the states that sent them there and
[5685.44] by God we need to get back to
[5687.4] that because the way it is set up now
[5690.48] it's just set up it's a system for total
[5692.32] corruption and I think you can begin to
[5694.719] see why that works and what the wisdom
[5697.04] of the founding fathers was was to try
[5698.96] to create a system that minimized that
[5702.08] possibility and kept the control of the
[5705.84] machinery of the state in the hands of
[5709.04] the state governments and of the people
[5711.36] of the states because they knew that
[5714.239] it's a whole lot easier to the closer
[5716.32] you are to the people themselves, to the
[5719.04] citizens of the of the state, the closer
[5721.76] you are to them, the more uh they're
[5724.48] going to be able to determine what's
[5726.48] going on. Each time you remove one
[5729.679] degree of distance further from the
[5732.48] people themselves, which is what we've
[5734.0] got now, the harder it is to control
[5737.36] what they're doing. And so we as an
[5739.6] individual people, we don't have much
[5741.44] control on the federal level, but we
[5743.76] have a whole lot more control on the
[5745.28] state level. Now, if the senatorial
[5748.4] races come back to the state
[5750.12] governments, well, yeah, if they go and
[5752.239] they start taking bribes, which is what
[5754.239] this is, it's bribery, a system of of of
[5757.36] legalized bribery, right? Well, and
[5760.0] they've got such a good thing going, why
[5761.6] would they want to, you know, why would
[5763.6] they want to change it, right? Right.
[5765.28] Right. But again, until the American
[5768.08] people wake up and learn about this,
[5770.32] it's not going to change. And the other
[5772.639] problem is is that the the the triad of
[5775.92] control is now they've got control of
[5778.0] the media and they've got control of
[5780.12] education. So because they're
[5782.0] controlling education, you're making
[5783.6] sure that uh students coming of age now
[5787.36] do not learn about the stuff we've been
[5789.28] talking about.
[5791.12] Yeah. Okay. Do you think they also have
[5794.0] control of the ability to increase the
[5797.44] money supply? Oh yeah,
[5799.96] absolutely. Right. Where did they get
[5801.92] that? Well, it just it was an invented
[5804.199] power that you know when they created
[5806.56] the Federal Reserve Act. If you go
[5808.0] before that, what what what was what was
[5810.08] the federal government's involvement
[5811.6] with money? Well, it was the Treasury.
[5813.679] So, you could take your gold and silver
[5815.44] bullion to the Treasury and have it
[5817.52] assayed for purity, have it cast into
[5820.44] standardized coinage, right? And now
[5823.76] this could be a medium of exchange
[5826.0] amongst, you know, private citizens and
[5828.56] amongst businesses and whatever. That
[5831.04] was their power, right? You had this
[5833.36] trusted institution, the Treasury of the
[5835.6] United States. And if you take your your
[5838.0] gold bullion, they can determine its
[5840.719] purity and they can cast it into coins
[5844.08] or they'll take it like uh you know,
[5847.199] banks were set up so that you could
[5849.679] deposit your your bullion. You didn't
[5852.0] have to carry a bunch of gold around
[5854.159] with you, but you could go and you could
[5855.76] redeem. If you look at all the old
[5857.6] original gold notes, it states right on
[5859.6] there that this is redeemable in actual
[5861.92] gold or
[5863.239] silver. And so they Yeah, they took that
[5865.84] over. They took that the uh Roosevelt
[5868.96] administration confiscated all the gold
[5871.6] and put it into Fort Knox. For a little
[5873.679] while it was against the law for people
[5875.84] to own gold. uh because again the idea
[5880.48] was to put pay put people dependent on
[5883.04] fiat money that had no intrinsic value
[5887.44] that you couldn't go now and redeem your
[5889.44] piece of paper for an actual piece of
[5891.6] gold. So getting back to the gold
[5894.4] standard or at least some type of an
[5896.92] assetbased monetary standard where the
[5900.4] government can't just suddenly look
[5902.639] that's why you know I you know when I
[5905.679] started driving gasoline was 30 cents a
[5908.239] gallon right 30 cents a gallon right and
[5911.52] look at pre
[5913.8] precoid prices have basically doubled
[5917.199] the the the the purchasing power of our
[5919.76] American dollar is about half of what it
[5922.48] was
[5923.48] precoid right why is this because the
[5926.48] government keeps on deficit spending
[5929.44] they keep printing out the money and
[5932.08] there's no connection direct connection
[5935.36] between the volume of money and the
[5937.36] actual tangible assets in
[5940.04] society and so if the assets doesn't
[5943.28] double but you double the the fiat money
[5945.6] supply each dollar is only worth half of
[5948.0] what it was in terms of purchasing power
[5950.159] than it was before and inflation is not
[5953.92] a natural thing. The natural thing is
[5956.48] actually deflation because look what
[5958.96] happens. Examples of deflation where you
[5961.6] have industries that were not
[5962.96] overregulated by the government right
[5965.84] here. What did the first what would the
[5968.159] first remote mobile phones cost? A lot
[5971.76] of money and only rich people could
[5973.52] afford them. I remember working for a
[5975.52] rich guy in 1979 1980 and it was the
[5978.719] first mobile phone I ever saw. he had
[5981.199] and I don't remember how much it was. It
[5982.8] was probably equivalent in actual
[5985.199] dollars to our phone today. But you
[5988.32] know, I mean a phone like this, what's
[5989.92] now? 500 bucks if you get it. This is
[5993.199] minimum a,000 bucks. A,000 bucks. Okay.
[5996.639] So if you spend a,000 bucks in 1979
[6000.0] though, that would be like spending
[6002.159] eight or$10,000 now, right? A and so
[6006.639] basically first phones only rich people
[6008.96] could afford them. But what that did was
[6011.52] the the companies that were developing
[6013.36] this technology were able to earn money
[6015.44] by selling to rich people. They were
[6017.679] able to uh recycle that money, reinvest
[6020.96] that money into research and development
[6023.119] and come up with ever more efficient and
[6025.04] and improved ways of creating their
[6027.56] product. Same thing like back when
[6030.4] automobiles first got introduced into
[6032.159] the market, it was only the rich people
[6033.76] that could afford them. So as the rich
[6035.92] people were driving around town in
[6037.36] their, you know, their their early
[6038.96] automobiles in the early 20th century
[6041.199] and everybody's going, "Oh, those rich
[6042.719] people, look at them." You know, blah,
[6044.159] you know, we hate those rich people. But
[6045.92] then 10, 20 years later, all of the
[6048.56] middle class is driving their cars
[6050.08] around. Well, it's because the car
[6052.639] manufacturers made a profit off of
[6054.639] selling to the rich people. And then
[6056.639] they plowed that back into research and
[6058.88] development or expanding their
[6060.76] factories, whatever it was. they were
[6062.88] able to produce a uh a cheaper product
[6066.239] and it was now be afforded by your
[6068.239] middle classes and I mean who doesn't
[6070.4] have a car now? But the same thing with
[6072.56] televisions. I mean you could go right
[6074.08] down the line. The first owners of
[6075.76] televisions were rich people and the
[6078.639] left particularly doesn't understand.
[6081.6] They're like, "Oh, we need to get rid of
[6082.88] all the billionaires." Well, all and it
[6085.04] used to be we need to get rid of all the
[6086.56] millionaires. Now it's get rid of all
[6088.0] the billionaires, right? But what they
[6090.0] don't understand is to an evolving free
[6093.04] market society, there is an important
[6096.08] critical role for the for the rich
[6098.0] people. And without those rich people,
[6100.639] you wouldn't have this. If you come and
[6102.719] you start complaining about, oh, we got
[6104.239] to get rid of the billionaires. Well,
[6105.6] why don't you start by throwing away
[6107.52] your your mobile phone, throwing away
[6109.84] your computers? Because remember, when
[6111.52] the computers first started coming on
[6113.119] the market, they were far far less
[6116.0] efficient than they are now, far less
[6117.76] powerful. and relatively speaking more
[6120.639] expensive. And talk about a way the best
[6124.159] way to demotivate a population. Oh,
[6126.56] okay. You will never be able to reach
[6129.52] this level of financial success.
[6131.119] Whenever it happens, we're just going to
[6132.48] take it away. And we have a whole
[6134.48] segment of American society now that
[6136.48] thinks through that lens, through this
[6139.36] Malthusian lens of it's it's Yeah, it
[6143.119] right. Yeah. And we need to like shake
[6146.0] those people, slap them a couple of
[6147.679] times, say, "Wake up. This is not what
[6150.4] you're advocating is just more
[6152.08] centralized control." Well, I think what
[6154.32] people are afraid of like I'll be just
[6157.76] red team for the sake of it. I like to
[6160.96] somewhat think that when you get down to
[6163.52] it and you can communicate with people
[6165.28] and connect with them, what they're
[6166.639] afraid of is that what we're talking
[6168.8] about with this like extractionist
[6170.639] transactional first mindset where it's
[6173.119] just like kill and then store all the
[6176.88] food and make sure nobody gets it.
[6178.48] That's kind of how they look at
[6180.48] billionaires, people who are acquiring
[6182.08] immense amount of wealth where it's less
[6184.08] for all and more for them. When I mean
[6187.679] really the reality of the situation is
[6190.4] there probably are some billionaires and
[6192.719] people in corporations like that. We
[6194.32] know this all too well. There's also a
[6198.08] huge benefit to being able to have the
[6200.4] opportunity to do new things. Like I
[6203.119] think now more than ever would be the
[6205.44] worst time to incentivize people away
[6208.88] from trying to innovate because now so
[6212.0] many people have access to the tools of
[6214.4] innovation to the technology to do this.
[6216.8] So if you stop the I guess the
[6220.56] incentives for it, but even the ability
[6223.52] to be able to build capital and reinvest
[6226.159] that capital. Yeah. you're going to
[6228.32] crush so much of what the future could
[6231.119] be or at least you're going to extend
[6233.28] the time horizon significantly. Yeah.
[6235.52] And and you know what I was talking
[6237.28] about earlier is that um what I was
[6239.36] referencing is that uh aside from the
[6243.04] government being able to arbitrarily
[6245.679] print money and deflate the value of the
[6248.32] dollar, the natural trend is for uh
[6252.639] greater efficiencies, greater qualities,
[6255.44] greater ability to produce a better
[6258.88] product at a at a lower price. It
[6262.48] actually should be going the other way.
[6264.56] If if the government got out of it and
[6266.56] had no role to play in our monetary
[6268.8] policy at all, that's what we would see.
[6271.36] The natural trend would be for prices to
[6274.0] gradually be going down as innovation
[6276.8] improved the efficiency and and and so
[6280.159] on. So, you know, uh we're paying, you
[6283.44] know, as much now you say $1,000 for
[6285.52] this phone and $1,000 30 or 40 years ago
[6289.52] was worth 20% of what it is now. So now,
[6293.28] but the point is is that under a free
[6296.719] market, this we probably would be paying
[6298.56] $200 for this rather than $1,000
[6302.48] depending on Yeah. I mean, it then you
[6305.119] kind of get into the question about
[6307.04] manufacturing and foreign relationships.
[6310.159] And I mean, this whole conversation with
[6312.32] tariffs has people looking at actually
[6315.28] how global trade works and how people
[6318.159] benefit off each other and coordinate.
[6320.8] The Okay, so this is the prices of the
[6324.159] first iPhones that were released in
[6326.44] 2007. The 4 GB model was $4.99 and the 8
[6330.48] GB model was
[6332.36] $5.99 with a 2-year contract through
[6334.96] AT&T.
[6337.119] Ah, okay.
[6338.96] So, the prices have doubled. And if
[6341.84] we're to conspare compare specs on this,
[6344.639] I think this phone is a
[6347.0] terabyte. I can look. Let's see. Let's
[6350.4] see just how much. What type of iPhone
[6353.28] do you have, Randall? Do you know? I
[6354.88] have an Android. Oh, you have an
[6356.56] Android. I thought you just held up an
[6358.08] iPhone there. Um, isn't that what this
[6359.92] is? Isn't this a This is an Android,
[6361.92] isn't it?
[6363.679] Yeah. Yeah. It looks like a Samsung.
[6366.96] Yeah. You know, it suffered some abuse,
[6369.92] taken some
[6372.44] falls in my pocket when I've been
[6374.96] tumbling down staircases and things.
[6378.48] Okay. All right. I didn't realize you
[6380.0] were a stunt devil in your free time,
[6381.679] Randolph. Not Not anymore. There was a
[6384.8] day. There was a day. Okay. So, this is
[6387.679] an iPhone 15 Pro Max. It's got 512
[6391.679] gigabytes of capacity. So, which is more
[6394.48] than 100 times the first model. And I
[6398.32] don't know, it's a bigger phone and
[6399.76] stuff. And the price for this phone when
[6402.639] I bought it was
[6404.52] like I think like 1300 bucks something
[6408.08] like that. So
[6410.84] it's more than doubled in price. It's
[6413.36] like two and a halfx.
[6415.92] And that doubling in price is I think if
[6418.719] you broke it all down, looked at it,
[6420.32] you'd see it's because of increasing of
[6422.88] money supply, increasing of the the raw
[6426.8] materials, the increasing of the
[6428.719] components getting those made, etc. All
[6431.04] of that again is going to be a function
[6433.6] of ultimately of of inflation and and
[6436.719] monetary policy because I'm guessing
[6439.6] that they can produce these phones more
[6441.44] efficiently now than they could in 2007.
[6446.56] I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
[6448.719] that would be the natural learning
[6450.28] curve. So, yeah, people just they don't
[6453.84] know these kind of things, they've been
[6456.0] to, you know, half the population, I
[6457.76] think, is brainwashed. Um, I I tell some
[6461.52] of my liberal friends that, you know,
[6464.239] for all of the things that I dislike
[6466.08] about Trump, he's done a few things
[6467.76] right. We won't get into that, but I
[6470.08] say, you know, here's the thing. what
[6471.92] you're you're so down on Trump, but it's
[6475.28] just like with the the immigration
[6476.96] thing. I don't like the way he's
[6478.239] handling it. I don't like the
[6479.36] heavy-handedness of it. I think there's
[6481.52] a much more uh a better way, a more
[6484.4] ethical way of going about dealing with
[6486.32] the problem. His solution to the problem
[6490.32] to me is is is suboptimal for sure, but
[6494.639] he didn't create the problem. The
[6496.639] problem came four years of the Biden
[6498.88] administration opening the
[6501.48] borders. That's where the problem came
[6504.0] from. Now, his way of solving the
[6505.92] problem, no, I think, yeah, there's a
[6508.48] way better way of doing it than he's
[6510.32] doing it. Um, but yeah, I mean, those
[6514.0] four years of Biden, I mean, how many
[6515.92] millions of undocumented immigrants made
[6518.56] it into the country? And then also, you
[6521.52] know, you got to go, okay, what is this?
[6523.119] You know, Americans are struggling.
[6525.52] Many, many Americans are struggling. And
[6527.52] we're allowing tens of thousands,
[6529.84] hundreds of thousands of immigrants
[6531.44] coming in, and we're giving them voucher
[6533.119] cards for hotel rooms. Uh, you know,
[6536.32] we're giving them uh food voucher cards.
[6539.92] We're giving them all of this these
[6541.28] handouts. I don't know the total value
[6543.52] of the handouts that were given to
[6546.0] immigrants during the Biden years, but
[6549.36] take a look. For example, a lot of the
[6551.36] concern right now is Venezuelan gangs,
[6553.6] right? And so a lot of the the
[6555.96] deportations have been uh supposed
[6559.04] Venezuelan gangs. And I have no doubt
[6561.199] that there are Venez Venezuelan gang
[6563.679] members in the US. They might be, you
[6566.159] know, once you get here, they might be
[6568.159] doing whatever, you know, bringing in
[6569.92] fentinel. They might be involved in
[6571.76] setting up human trafficking networks.
[6574.239] We don't really know. But here's the
[6576.56] thing. What's going on in Venezuela
[6579.52] right now? Well, it's the byproduct of a
[6581.84] couple of things. And and you can trace
[6583.84] it directly to our own intervention both
[6585.84] militarily and economically. Like for
[6588.639] example, the the the sanctions against
[6591.679] Vietnam Vietnam, the sanctions against
[6594.08] Venezuela have destroyed their economy,
[6597.04] right? It's caused a mass exodus from So
[6600.8] you get the Maduro, the communists in
[6602.88] there. So they're imposing their regime
[6605.52] of of uh you know imposing by force the
[6609.28] lowest common denominator. Then our
[6611.52] government imposes uh sanctions on them
[6614.56] completely. Venezuela was the most
[6616.56] oilrich country in South America. They
[6619.28] should have a booming economy. they
[6621.52] should have multiple millionaires and
[6624.239] but between centralized government power
[6627.36] in the form of Marxism and then the US
[6630.08] response of these imposing these heavy
[6633.04] uh uh sanctions has completely destroyed
[6635.679] their economy. So now you have these
[6637.92] wave after wave of of people immigrating
[6641.04] out the great exodus and where are they
[6643.36] coming? they're coming here. And then
[6645.119] you have the Biden administration that
[6646.88] opened the borders and they're all
[6648.239] coming in here, but people don't seem to
[6651.36] ask, well, why are all these people
[6653.52] leaving their homeland and trying to get
[6655.36] into the United States? You got to ask
[6657.92] that question. And almost invariably
[6661.119] what you see is that the that the chaos
[6665.28] that has led to these mass immigrations
[6667.92] from these countries, our own government
[6670.719] has had a big hand in that right now. I
[6673.92] haven't done a in-depth study to really
[6677.76] specifically clarify point by point, but
[6680.639] I've seen enough to know that yeah, you
[6682.32] you could say in a majority of the cases
[6684.48] our own government has had a major hand
[6686.88] in the disruption that has led to I mean
[6689.92] certainly to El Salvador that was El
[6692.32] Salvador has turned it around now. Yeah.
[6695.36] But look Yeah. But God that prison
[6697.599] system uh is horrible, horrible,
[6701.36] horrible. And uh you know I'm I don't
[6705.52] know if I can say that I support sending
[6707.44] off these people to that prison system
[6710.88] without due process of some kind. Right.
[6714.239] And so now you get the rabid right
[6716.239] saying, "Oh, well they they're not US
[6717.92] citizens. They don't get rights." But
[6720.0] you know, human rights. The Declaration
[6722.0] of Independent, the Declaration says all
[6724.639] men are created equal. That we're all
[6726.239] endowed with inalienable rights. It
[6728.239] doesn't say only American citizens. It
[6730.08] says all people, right? That you have
[6733.28] you have this inal inable right uh not
[6737.28] to steal from anybody, not to be
[6738.96] deceitful or dishonest or kill or
[6741.04] whatever, force yourself, use a force on
[6743.92] somebody, but as long as you don't do
[6745.28] that, you have a right to live your life
[6747.28] and so on. Well, you know, we need to
[6750.0] come to grips with our own role in
[6753.44] creating global chaos. And and that's
[6757.04] not and once we do, we're going to say,
[6758.8] okay, it's like you've got a company and
[6761.04] you've got employees in there who are
[6762.719] sabotaging you at every turn and are
[6765.04] actually working for one of your
[6766.48] competitors, for example. That might be
[6768.56] kind of an analogy of what we've got now
[6771.84] because we basically, you know, this the
[6774.88] the American citizen now has been
[6777.36] reduced to sort of a secondass role. You
[6780.719] know, I went and I paid had to pay 4,000
[6782.88] bucks two days ago to the federal
[6784.8] government. I could have used that 4,000
[6786.96] bucks for a lot of other things rather
[6788.8] than sending it off to Washington so you
[6791.679] know a bunch of corrupt politicians can
[6793.52] spend it the way they want to. Right.
[6796.239] Well, this was not part of the original
[6798.0] system.
[6799.52] And we're we're brought up we're
[6801.76] indoctrinated into this belief that
[6803.76] that's an intrinsic inevitable part of
[6806.48] the system that we have to, you know,
[6810.4] turn over a certain percentage of our
[6812.32] labor and the fruits of our labor to the
[6814.56] centralized power structure in
[6816.08] Washington. And then they who are being
[6818.32] bribed left and right by all these
[6820.159] special interests, they then get to
[6822.4] control the money supply. They get to
[6824.639] look into our personal finances,
[6826.96] personal bank accounts. if we don't pay
[6829.599] up the way we should, you know, then
[6831.44] there are consequences. So, there's a
[6833.679] whole system in place that ultimately is
[6836.8] not going to be productive. It's
[6839.679] counterproductive to the long term. And
[6842.4] the only way we're going to get evolved
[6844.32] beyond that and get back to actually
[6846.0] some
[6847.0] original values, which in my mind, the
[6850.239] original values, there's three of them.
[6851.679] The three pillars you have to have. If
[6853.84] you don't have three pillars on a three
[6855.44] three legs on a stool, it's not going to
[6857.28] stand up. it's going to tip over, right?
[6859.76] And those three pillars, I think, are uh
[6863.599] summed up by three words: peace,
[6866.48] freedom, and truth. And we don't have
[6869.28] any of them right now. We don't have
[6871.04] peace. We don't have freedom. We don't
[6873.36] have freedom when when the government
[6874.88] when the state can at
[6876.84] will declare to us to dictate to us that
[6880.159] we can't travel unless we have a
[6882.56] federally approved type of
[6885.4] ID that we can't come and go uh as as
[6889.84] sovereign citizens that we we're not
[6891.599] allowed that we're being deprived of
[6893.44] that peace, freedom, and truth. We
[6896.159] certainly aren't getting truth through
[6897.599] mainstream media. Not by a long shot,
[6900.4] right? And I'm old enough to have seen
[6902.639] the deterioration from where we were
[6904.719] getting a fairly generous degree of
[6907.28] truth through mainstream media to where
[6909.52] essentially everything now is being
[6911.04] perverted into prop propaganda and we're
[6913.92] being fed that. And unfortunately half
[6916.88] about half maybe I maybe that's too
[6918.96] pessimistic. At least a third of the
[6921.52] American population is totally bought in
[6923.92] to that whole propagandistic narrative
[6927.28] that contrived narrative.
[6930.679] And in a way, they're kind of the
[6932.8] obstacle. You guys and you know, a lot
[6936.32] of people who voted for Trump voted
[6938.56] because he was the only
[6940.52] alternative to the the the the ant see
[6944.159] the Democrats were once a party that
[6946.32] they were leading the anti-war movement
[6948.159] during Vietnam. Once once Johnson was
[6952.28] gone, Johnson had to go first because
[6955.599] look, World War
[6957.08] II, Democrat, Korean War, Democrat.
[6960.159] Vietnam War, Democrats led us into these
[6962.88] wars that we
[6964.36] didn't World War I, if we hadn't gotten
[6967.199] in World War I, there would have been an
[6969.04] armistice between uh the Allied powers
[6972.0] and Germany. But we got involved and
[6975.52] part of our involvement was that we were
[6977.599] going to uh demand an unconditional
[6980.0] surrender on the part of Germany. But
[6982.08] yeah, Britain and Germany, they were
[6983.679] ready to reach an accord until we got
[6985.96] involved. And then we were there
[6988.4] involved in the Treaty of Versailles
[6990.239] when it was decided that all the costs
[6992.8] of the war would be imposed upon
[6994.88] Germany. At the same time, their
[6996.96] industrial heartland is being
[6999.199] confiscated to make reparations to
[7002.0] France primarily and uh it imposed
[7005.28] enormous hardships on people. Hundreds
[7008.96] of thousands of people starved to death
[7010.719] in that period after World War I. Well,
[7014.32] that's directly what led to the rise of
[7016.96] Hitler. There would have never been a
[7018.48] Hitler if there hadn't been a World War
[7020.32] I. There would have never been a Stalin
[7022.159] if there hadn't been World War I. Right?
[7025.04] But again, what turned the tide of World
[7027.52] War I was our own intervention under
[7031.28] Woodro Wilson. So we had the Wilson
[7034.48] administration, I think we could say,
[7035.76] had to have been one of the worst in
[7037.84] American history when it comes to the
[7039.52] three pillars, peace, freedom, and truth
[7041.76] because that's where America really
[7043.28] began to switch gears. and his
[7045.84] intervention into World War I led to god
[7050.8] how many deaths through World War I,
[7053.44] World War II, Korea,
[7055.32] Vietnam, all of that which grew out of
[7058.639] ultimately our intervention into World
[7061.119] War I. But this is again, this is not
[7064.239] what's generally known now amongst young
[7067.119] people because they're not learning
[7069.28] history and they're coming out of the
[7072.08] education systems having their heads
[7074.32] stuffed full of uh, you know, gender
[7077.32] ideology, whatever. No. Oh, oh my. If I
[7080.719] say that, am I transphobic? No, I'm not.
[7083.04] I'm just
[7084.119] saying, you know, we're being fed all of
[7086.56] this [ __ ] but what it does is it
[7089.199] keeps us distracted from the real the
[7092.239] real
[7093.4] issues. So, you know, I don't know how
[7096.88] it's going to go down with Trump. I hope
[7099.119] he follows through on some of it. I hope
[7101.599] I understand that there are back channel
[7103.44] communications going on now with the
[7105.44] Russians. Needs to happen.
[7108.4] I've heard the same thing with Iran. And
[7110.56] I sure hope that all of his threats to
[7113.119] Iran ends up just being
[7115.08] bluster because look, it was [ __ ]
[7117.119] Trump that took us out of the nuclear
[7118.8] deal we had with Iran, right? That
[7121.28] allowed inspectors, international
[7122.88] inspectors to come in and say, "No, they
[7124.719] don't have they don't have a military
[7127.239] nuclear, you know, uranium enrichment
[7130.159] program." They don't. And I don't think
[7132.8] they're really interested in getting
[7134.159] nuclear weapons except the big motive is
[7137.92] you know who again who shall go unnamed
[7141.119] who has nuclear weapons right right
[7144.639] there in the smack dab in the center of
[7147.04] the Middle East. Um and yeah I mean I
[7149.84] think their concern is probably
[7151.52] justified considering what we've seen
[7153.44] going on in the last year and a half or
[7156.0] so. Um, but yeah, leave Iran to its own
[7159.44] devices and what'll happen is the young
[7161.119] people will grow up. They'll join the
[7162.96] 21st century. The Mullers will lose
[7165.119] credibility and we'll get along fine
[7166.96] with them, right? Just leave them the
[7170.159] [ __ ] alone, you know? It's so simple.
[7174.56] Rel, I got I got question for you. Three
[7177.119] questions really. Oh, okay. What is what
[7180.96] are the definitions that you have for
[7182.96] the words truth, peace, and freedom if
[7185.76] you were going to define them for
[7187.04] people? Peace. Okay. Well, peace to me
[7189.28] means not necessarily that you're
[7191.159] nonviolent, but that you don't you don't
[7194.8] you're not the aggressor. Now, I would
[7197.44] be 100% in favor of the United States
[7200.239] having having a uh a military policy of
[7205.119] defending our homeland, right? just like
[7207.76] Switzerland, a larger version of
[7209.96] Switzerland. And now you've got uh you
[7213.04] know, you've in Switzerland you've got a
[7214.719] draft and people I think have to serve
[7216.32] two years uh and then you have to go
[7218.96] back regularly for training. And what do
[7220.8] they do? I mean, think about this.
[7222.239] Switzerland managed to come through
[7223.76] unscathed through two world wars where
[7226.48] you had major imperial powers
[7229.44] surrounding them at war with each other.
[7231.76] Nobody wanted to go in and [ __ ] with
[7233.36] Israel. Why? Because
[7236.04] Israel, they were they were known to be
[7238.639] top shot top-notch shots. There was a
[7241.28] famous during World War I, I I wish I
[7243.04] could dig this up, the original story,
[7244.8] it may be anecdotal, but there was some
[7247.32] German military officer who was uh kind
[7251.119] of threatening one of the militia
[7253.52] commanders of the Swiss, the Swiss
[7255.76] militia. Right. You said you said
[7257.52] Israel, but Switzerland, just clarify
[7259.76] for people. Oh, yeah. Not Israel.
[7261.76] Switzerland. Switzerland. Right.
[7264.48] now Switzerland. So anyways, in this
[7267.76] conversation, he said, "Well, what are
[7269.28] you going to do if we send in our
[7271.52] battalions and uh and and we decide to
[7274.8] take you over because you need to ally
[7277.599] with us or we're going to come in and
[7279.04] kick your ass." And the response was,
[7280.639] "Well, go ahead and try. What'll happen
[7282.8] is all of the uh Swiss militia, all the
[7287.44] the the farmers, all of the uh the
[7290.32] people of Switzerland who are well
[7291.92] trained will all come out. They'll each
[7294.0] take one shot and go home and that'll be
[7297.44] the end of your invasion. And and nobody
[7300.8] has has attempted to to subdue
[7302.8] Switzerland. Why? Because literally they
[7306.0] have a highly trained militia. They know
[7309.36] to how to use small arms. They know how
[7311.92] to uh do search and rescue. They know
[7315.44] how to handle a variety of weapons.
[7318.08] Every Swiss household has some type of a
[7322.56] machine gun in the household. In fact,
[7325.52] they're required to and they're trained
[7327.44] in how to use it. Now, imagine if every
[7330.239] household in America had an had
[7332.8] automatic weapons, knew how to use them.
[7334.8] Now, you can say, "Oh, oh, no guns
[7336.8] everywhere, right?" Well, why is it then
[7339.599] that Switzerland's crime is such a per
[7342.239] capita small fraction of America's
[7345.28] crime, violent crime, right? Well, first
[7348.56] of all, if you're a criminal in
[7350.08] Switzerland and you go, I think I'm
[7351.92] going to break into that house over
[7353.36] there. It looks like they might have
[7354.56] money, but you know that inside that
[7356.719] house are owners that know how to use
[7359.119] weapons and are
[7361.48] armed. You're going it's going to change
[7363.599] the equation, isn't it? Right. Well,
[7366.96] Switzerland has a military policy that's
[7369.28] oriented towards defense of their
[7371.76] territorial homeland. And we could
[7374.88] implement a policy like that that would
[7378.32] actually be more effective because look,
[7380.8] we've got these two big moes. We've got
[7383.119] the Atlantic and we've got the Pacific.
[7385.599] So, in order to attack us, what are you
[7389.76] going to do? Well, you could use long
[7391.199] range ICBMs if you're not going to
[7393.679] actually get in boats or airplanes and
[7396.159] fly over. Well, I mean, the response to
[7400.0] an actual attack on our homeland is
[7402.08] going to be relatively a low-level
[7404.84] response. You're not going to need long
[7407.84] range sophisticated weaponry like you
[7410.4] are if you're having to forward base and
[7413.119] go and and conduct your military
[7415.199] operations 5,000 miles away. because
[7418.32] everybody knows that the the that the
[7420.159] longer range uh it is the deployment is
[7423.28] from your source of weapons and revenue,
[7426.48] the more vulnerable places. And this is
[7428.32] one of the reasons the US lost the
[7430.08] Vietnam War is because our supply lines
[7432.96] kept getting severed. And we bombed the
[7435.44] [ __ ] out of Cambodia, Nixon did, in his
[7437.84] secret bombing campaign in order to
[7439.679] disrupt the supply lines. But it didn't
[7441.76] work, right? Because they were so
[7445.0] adaptable that you have the biggest
[7447.119] military power on Earth losing to a
[7450.56] bunch of farmers that basically
[7453.88] organized and fought us off. It took you
[7457.44] know first fighting off the French then
[7459.199] fighting off the Americans but in the
[7460.719] end they won. Now whatever advantages
[7463.84] they had we had a thousandfold in our
[7467.84] geographic consideration. So reorient
[7471.28] military policy to the uh to the defense
[7475.52] of our territorial homeland. And you
[7477.679] would you would not even need to have
[7479.44] compulsory training for people because
[7481.28] look, if you had the opportunity, you
[7482.56] said, "Okay, you come and you spend a
[7484.48] year long, we're going to teach you
[7486.0] wilderness survival. We're going to
[7487.76] teach you small arms of all kinds. We're
[7490.239] going to teach you how to, you know,
[7492.159] maybe rebuild a a an important type of a
[7495.199] vehicle. We're going to teach you search
[7497.119] and
[7498.52] rescue." I tell you, I think you'd have
[7500.88] people, young people. I know I would
[7503.28] have been lining up for that when I was
[7505.36] 18, 19, 20. Absolutely I would have been
[7508.719] you don't even need compulsory ind
[7511.199] compulsory draft if you want to you know
[7514.56] but if you don't then have other options
[7516.239] if I don't want to do that what are
[7517.52] other options that I could do to serve
[7519.28] my country right right so to me peace is
[7522.239] not pacifist really in that sense but
[7525.119] it's that it's just like I conduct my
[7527.599] life I don't aggress against anyone uh
[7530.96] when I was a kid I was not a bully um
[7534.96] you could look at it on that simple
[7536.4] lified level, right? Using strength for
[7539.84] defense and deescalation.
[7542.159] Yes. Yes. Freedom. Yeah. We can, you
[7545.599] know, I think that the founding fathers
[7547.44] defined that very well. Um, and it comes
[7550.32] down to a natural bill of rights, if you
[7552.159] want to call it natural rights. You have
[7554.56] the freedom to speak what you want. You
[7556.639] have the freedom to say what you want
[7558.8] with some obvious common sense
[7561.28] limitations like you don't suddenly, you
[7564.48] know, the the the old cliche is you
[7566.639] don't yell fire in a crowded movie
[7568.4] theater, right? Well, that would be
[7571.199] fraudulent. And and I think there's a
[7573.599] clear common sense line, but right now
[7576.32] the attempt is very much to impose the
[7579.04] narrative on what people can say and not
[7581.28] say. And part of it is because if you
[7584.719] say something that goes outside the
[7586.32] party line, they have the resources to
[7589.36] do everything they can to discredit you
[7591.76] even though they're not physically
[7594.88] restraining you or restricting. So for
[7597.599] example, we know that the Biden
[7599.52] administration was putting pressure on
[7601.84] social media companies to censor
[7604.56] different points of view. Now that's
[7608.0] there's no place for that. Why? Because
[7609.92] first of all under the American system
[7612.639] you you know if you want to talk about
[7614.36] equality being a politician or being a
[7617.28] government employee of whatever branch
[7620.0] you are whatever doesn't give you
[7622.639] natural rights that everyone else has by
[7626.239] virtue of God or however you by virtue
[7629.28] of nature however you want to define it.
[7631.84] Okay. Being a politician now doesn't
[7634.4] suddenly give you prerogatives and
[7635.84] privileges that everybody else doesn't
[7638.079] have. Now, that's different from in a
[7641.36] free market. If you go work your ass
[7644.32] off, take risks, produce, come up with a
[7647.36] service or a product that people want
[7650.92] voluntarily with no coercion, and you
[7653.92] provide jobs for people to pro to to uh
[7657.76] satisfy that need or that that want
[7661.199] amongst people. Well, that's fine.
[7663.36] That's all comes under the free market,
[7665.52] the definition of free market. So you've
[7667.92] got and you've got the right to defend
[7669.84] yourself. If somebody attacks you,
[7671.679] aggresses against you, I would
[7674.119] argue stringently that you have the
[7676.639] right to do what's necessary to protect
[7678.76] yourself. Or if your family or your
[7681.92] loved ones are attacked or aggressed
[7684.04] against, you have the right to do
[7686.96] whatever it takes to deter that
[7689.4] aggression. Right? So you don't do that
[7693.679] uh without provocation, but I consider
[7696.719] that to be one of your fundamental
[7698.239] rights. And I would think you might
[7700.719] intellectually disagree with me, but if
[7702.719] somebody comes and starts beating on
[7704.84] you, I would think that in that
[7707.04] circumstance, the reality of it would
[7708.88] supersede whatever your philosophy was.
[7711.92] It may be okay. Maybe you're such a
[7713.44] pacifist that you would sit there
[7715.28] passively and allow yourself to be
[7716.96] aggressed against and your, you know,
[7719.04] your property to be taken, your person
[7720.719] to be injured. However, it's still
[7722.8] freedom.
[7724.32] It is still freedom. However, my
[7727.52] opinion, the moral line there is okay,
[7730.079] if you want to do that, but if you have
[7732.32] loved ones, if you have children, then I
[7734.56] say you're obligated to protect those
[7736.88] children. So if somebody tries to abduct
[7739.599] your child, I would say
[7742.76] whatever measures you have to go to to
[7746.32] to prevent that from happening is is
[7750.599] acceptable. whatever. If somebody's
[7752.639] trying to, you know, harm your child to
[7755.92] or to abduct your child, yeah, whatever
[7759.199] you you you have the right to do what's
[7761.199] necessary to prevent that, including
[7764.079] massive aggression against that person
[7765.92] that is attempting to harm your child.
[7768.8] If you came home, somebody had broken
[7770.88] into your house and they're raping your
[7772.599] wife, well, I would say you have right
[7775.84] there, you have the right to do whatever
[7778.4] is necessary to bring that to an
[7780.719] immediate abrupt termination, whether it
[7784.199] means whatever whatever that person who
[7787.679] is now doing that essentially by
[7789.76] committing that act, I think they have
[7792.56] forfeited their right to life, liberty,
[7795.84] and the pursuit of happiness. they've
[7798.32] done that. So freedom, yeah, it's pretty
[7801.599] easy. It's not it's not that
[7803.119] complicated. You have the freedom to
[7804.96] conduct business, to engage with people
[7807.199] voluntarily,
[7808.96] etc.
[7810.119] Um, for example, you know, since the
[7813.04] progressive movement now, we've got all
[7814.639] of these rules in place telling us and
[7817.199] having been my own having my own small
[7819.599] business for going on 40 years, I've
[7821.36] seen the effect of new rules coming that
[7824.32] oh, you know, you have to provide
[7826.679] certain, you know, you have like I'll
[7829.199] give you an example. I rented a new
[7831.84] place of business that had been a uh
[7835.28] what had it had been before I went in
[7836.8] there? It had been a it had been a gas
[7838.36] station, right? And they had an old
[7841.199] horrible bathroom. And one of the things
[7844.56] we did, we went in, we gutted out what
[7846.639] had been the office of the gas station.
[7848.88] One of the things we made it a nice
[7850.48] little reception area, and we built a
[7852.4] new bathroom. Well, we had to we had to
[7855.599] conform to all kinds of newly imp placed
[7858.52] restrictions because of the disability
[7860.88] act. So, we spent like an extra 4,000
[7864.4] when we could not afford it because
[7866.0] we're just a very small company to bring
[7868.32] that bathroom up to compliance with the
[7871.36] disability act. And in the 5 years we
[7874.4] were in that shop and using that space,
[7877.28] not one disabled person ever used the
[7880.0] bathroom. And then when we were done and
[7882.239] moved out, uh, a pizza place moved in
[7884.96] and they gutted everything out and redid
[7887.52] it all. Now, if you've got a restaurant,
[7890.079] yeah, I could see you've got to you got
[7892.88] the public coming in on a daily basis,
[7895.239] dozens, dozens of people. We were a
[7898.0] small office and, you know, somebody
[7900.719] that came in, you know, we would might
[7903.52] have a client come in once a week,
[7906.599] maybe, you know, um that's completely
[7909.599] different. But now you've got this
[7911.44] bureaucratic approach that doesn't
[7913.88] distinguish at all. It's just one
[7916.0] sizefits-all. That's basically it. Um,
[7919.76] that was not necessarily uh an
[7921.84] appropriate but you know when we when I
[7924.48] was first hiring I didn't have to there
[7926.88] was no question about on what basis am I
[7930.32] hiring other than hey do you know how to
[7933.599] you know do you know how to work a
[7934.88] circular saw? Are you a you know are you
[7937.199] a good saw man? are you a good uh uh you
[7940.56] know and and deciding between me and the
[7943.76] potential pro prospective employee how
[7946.0] much they were going to get paid. Now I
[7949.04] went early on in this early 70s I went
[7952.32] and got jobs working for less than
[7955.04] minimum wage so that I could get the
[7958.0] opportunity to learn skills. Right. Once
[7962.0] I learned those skills I was my market
[7964.079] value went up. Yeah. Right. That's how
[7966.48] it works. Right. But that was a decision
[7968.48] that was made between me and my
[7970.239] employer. Yep.
[7972.639] In uh 1966, minimum wage was a buck 20
[7976.079] an hour. I went to work at a gas station
[7978.4] for 6 months for 85 cents an hour.
[7981.8] Right. It was hard work, but I learned a
[7984.8] bunch of stuff working at that gas
[7986.56] station for 6 months. It was a little
[7988.639] rural gas station at the intersection of
[7991.119] Rockford Road and Highway 18 right
[7993.76] there. almost in those earlier pictures
[7995.84] we were looking at. But those 6 months
[7998.0] that I worked there, I learned a whole
[7999.36] bunch of stuff. I learned how to change
[8000.96] oil. I learned how to, you know, add all
[8004.4] the fluids. I learned how to check tire
[8006.52] pressure. All of this stuff that I had
[8008.719] never I didn't know how to do any of
[8010.32] that. But then I worked I was 15 years
[8012.119] old. But, you know, I figure that I was
[8016.4] willing to do that work for 85 cents an
[8018.96] hour. I had I was living at home, so I
[8021.119] had no living expenses. I was able to
[8022.88] save up that money that I was making at
[8025.28] 85 cents an hour and go buy uh the
[8028.159] Beatles uh you know revolver album for
[8031.36] $3, right? Uh so I was perfectly fine
[8036.8] with that. I like I would come home from
[8038.679] school, I would change out of my school
[8041.239] clothes, then I would run two and a half
[8044.32] miles to the gas station over fields. I
[8047.28] had a path going over the fields. I
[8048.719] would run 2 and a half miles to the gas
[8051.04] station and I would work there till
[8052.8] 10:00 when they closed and then my dad
[8055.199] would come pick me up. That was
[8057.599] typically my daily routine. Fall uh late
[8060.88] summer, fall and early winter of
[8063.88] 1966. But nobody came in and said,
[8066.719] "We're not going to allow you to work
[8069.76] for less thanund for a$120."
[8072.719] And had I came in here knowing nothing,
[8076.48] I probably wasn't worth a$120 an hour.
[8079.119] You know what I mean? But I can tell you
[8082.639] this now. You say I remember when they
[8085.199] were first proposing $15 an hour. And
[8087.76] I'm paying my top people $15 an hour who
[8091.92] were skilled carpenters. And I'm
[8094.159] thinking, okay, now I'm going to be
[8095.44] required to hire somebody with no skills
[8098.639] and pay them $15 an hour. Well, they
[8101.52] have no skills, so that means somehow or
[8103.84] another, they have to get trained. Now,
[8106.56] in their learning curve, they're going
[8108.56] to make mistakes. That's going to cost
[8110.56] me money. Uh, in order to train them,
[8114.8] somebody's got to stop what they're
[8116.32] doing and say, "This is how you operate
[8118.639] this tool. This is how you do this. This
[8121.28] is how you lay out the stud spacing for
[8123.76] a wall, whatever." Right? So, you hire
[8127.239] somebody, you have to make an
[8129.36] investment. You have to spend money to
[8132.639] bring that person. Now, what's going to
[8134.639] happen when you have a skilled carpenter
[8136.96] who's making $15 an hour? Now, somebody
[8139.92] comes in who has no skills and they're
[8142.719] getting paid as much as the skilled
[8144.0] carpenter who's got three to five years
[8145.599] under his belt. Well, you got to pay
[8147.84] them $20 an hour or $25 an hour. That's
[8151.92] pure inflation. And I I it's such a
[8155.44] simple concept that if you force
[8159.159] employers to pay high now the price, oh,
[8162.4] we got to pay $25 an hour minimum
[8166.079] minimum wage. This is what I've recently
[8167.76] heard and I knew this was happening. I
[8169.119] said, you raise them to you raise the
[8170.56] minimum wage to $15 an hour. It's soon
[8172.96] going to be $20 an hour, then $25 an
[8175.199] hour because here's what happens. If I
[8177.44] have to pay my team, my carpenters
[8180.88] $15 an hour and invest the time to train
[8184.0] them and teach them and pay for the
[8185.44] mistakes they make while they're
[8186.719] learning and I have to increase the
[8189.199] hourly wage of my skilled people, I have
[8192.0] to raise my the cost of my business are
[8193.92] going way up. I have to raise my prices.
[8197.12] Well, that's the other dimension of uh
[8200.16] of uh you know economics that it seems
[8203.599] like a lot of well-meaning people on the
[8206.0] liberal side of the spectrum don't
[8208.16] understand that basic concept. Right.
[8211.76] So, okay. So what back to the
[8216.12] the freedom question, it sounds like
[8219.76] your connection between all of the
[8222.719] points that you made there, if I'm if I
[8224.719] can try to synthesize it, is the ability
[8227.84] for us to protect ourselves as well as
[8232.479] make our own choices regardless of I
[8235.679] guess government or the hand involvement
[8238.88] where the line is drawn at what you said
[8241.599] of
[8243.16] non-hateful actions, I guess you could
[8245.599] say. Well, in my mind, you know, freedom
[8249.12] also means hateful speech. Like, right.
[8251.76] Right. Somebody goes online and and you
[8253.76] know, and this I'm seeing this now. If
[8255.2] somebody goes online and says, "Oh,
[8256.719] Randall Carlson is full of shit." Okay,
[8259.2] dude. Whatever. You know, you can say
[8261.2] that. It doesn't affect me really
[8263.28] because for for every guy that says
[8265.439] that, there's eight or 10 people that
[8266.88] says, "No, man. You're the one who's
[8268.399] full of [ __ ] because you don't even
[8270.16] listen to what he's saying." Right. And
[8272.08] I think you could even state this here
[8274.319] where it's like when we're talking about
[8276.0] freedom as a general
[8277.559] concept I I would make the bet that that
[8281.519] person's probably not very free in their
[8283.92] expression in their life. No, probably
[8286.319] not. Probably not. Um and they're a
[8289.599] product of, you know, the government
[8291.12] education monopoly. And that's another
[8293.84] part of it is because that's a big thing
[8295.359] that compromises our freedom is the
[8297.2] government being able to control the
[8298.559] narrative through through the
[8300.399] educational system which after World War
[8302.719] II that was a whole strategy which was
[8306.0] you know they started the interstate
[8307.28] highway system in the in the 50s right
[8311.12] so the federal government was able to
[8313.519] force states to consolidate their many
[8317.2] many small widely
[8319.399] dispersed more or less autonomous school
[8321.92] districts into these gigant giant mega
[8325.04] school districts by withholding uh
[8328.479] federal highway funds. That was the that
[8330.399] was the stick that was being used. Well,
[8332.559] if you
[8333.719] consolidate all of your school districts
[8336.16] so there's only 5% or 10% of the school
[8339.399] districts now, that's a going to be a
[8341.679] whole lot easier for us to control from
[8344.0] a central authority. But in order to get
[8346.639] you to do that, we're going to give you
[8348.8] all these billions of dollars in federal
[8350.719] highway highway money and you can become
[8352.719] part of the interstate highway system.
[8355.84] And that's how they did it. They
[8357.28] pressured uh they pressured the states
[8360.719] into consolidating law many small
[8365.439] districts, school districts that were
[8367.439] locally
[8368.519] controlled. There was no no federal
[8370.8] government involved at all. The final
[8373.2] the final coup of the government
[8375.519] takeover of education was 1979 with the
[8378.479] creation of the um you know the uh what
[8382.0] do you call it the um board of
[8384.719] educators. Is that what you're saying?
[8386.24] No, no, not board of educators. The
[8387.92] thing that uh you know the uh the the
[8390.72] the education monopoly. I must be
[8393.6] getting tired.
[8395.0] Um I for me to not be able to remember
[8397.92] that. The department of education in the
[8400.0] United States is what you mean? Yes. The
[8402.0] department of the DOE, the department of
[8404.24] education. That's right. The So that
[8406.64] came along in 1979 and curiously,
[8409.88] coincidentally, right, within the
[8412.8] formation of this giant centralized
[8415.359] monopolistic bureaucracy, education
[8418.24] standards started declining and they've
[8420.16] declined ever since. When the Jimmy
[8422.96] Carter, right? Yep. And you know, it was
[8425.76] well-meaning, but like so much, you
[8428.16] know, um it was a move away from
[8430.399] freedom. It was a move away from
[8432.319] autonomous control. And yeah, it wasn't
[8435.12] a perfect system. No, it absolutely
[8436.96] wasn't. But I'll tell you what, if
[8438.8] something isn't working right, it's much
[8440.479] easier to change on the local level than
[8442.319] it is the federal level by orders of
[8445.04] magnitude. But so, oh, you know, I hear
[8448.399] this, oh, people getting hysterical on
[8450.24] the left about Trump talking about
[8451.84] getting rid of the Department of
[8453.16] Education. That's one thing where I 100%
[8455.52] would back him because I've advocated
[8457.439] for getting rid of that monstrosity for
[8459.6] decades.
[8460.88] Um, and what you'll see happen is that
[8463.84] once that's gone, you'll have uh a
[8466.8] thousand alternatives that will come up
[8469.04] and even the worst of them will be
[8470.56] better than what we got now. Yeah. And
[8472.56] in our next podcast or in an upcoming
[8475.24] podcast, I want to talk about one of the
[8478.8] major federal failures that occurred um
[8482.72] back in
[8484.04] 1976 when the uh Bureau of Reclamation
[8488.16] was used to oversee the building of
[8490.0] monumental dams in America. And this
[8494.16] started, you know, the built Bureau of
[8496.08] Reclamation built two of the most
[8497.68] magnificent monumental dams ever
[8499.92] conceived and and constructed, which was
[8502.56] Hoover Dam, which used to be called
[8504.24] Boulder Dam, and uh Grand Coulie Dam.
[8508.16] Well, on this Bonavville trip that we're
[8510.96] that's coming up next month, we're going
[8513.359] to take the the group and we're going to
[8515.04] visit the site of Teton Dam, which was
[8518.24] the last monumental dam built by the
[8521.439] Bureau of Reclamation in America. And in
[8525.56] 1976, it failed. Uh July, very very
[8529.12] close to the centennial date of America,
[8532.479] the 200th year of America's birth. We're
[8535.6] being celebrated. and this there's this
[8538.439] enormous catastrophic dam failure,
[8541.68] right? So, I put together a whole
[8543.439] presentation about that, what led up to
[8545.359] it. Uh, and there was a series of
[8548.319] mistakes that were made and we can look
[8550.0] at those mistakes and they compounded
[8552.16] one another. And then there was the
[8555.2] aftermath, the destruction that this
[8557.359] flood caused, which in its way provided
[8560.56] a microcosm for actually understanding
[8564.08] some of the hydraulics of these much
[8565.84] more ancient mega floods. Right? And the
[8568.88] third thing was that was very important
[8571.84] and has very important lessons for us
[8574.0] was the spontaneous
[8576.359] response to the
[8578.52] disaster with no there was no FEMA.
[8581.84] There was no government relief. It was
[8583.68] all private. We're going to go into
[8585.92] that. We're going to look at that. What
[8587.28] happened? By contrast, let's say where
[8590.56] Hurricane Katrina, where the federal
[8593.2] government response was atrocious,
[8595.52] Hurricane Helen that we just saw last
[8597.68] October, same thing. The bureaucracy was
[8600.8] more of an obstruction. They eventually
[8603.04] came around and became helpful, yes, but
[8605.92] in the early days, they were more
[8607.76] obstructionist than they were. That
[8609.76] would have been better that they weren't
[8611.28] there at all because they were
[8613.479] preventing local organizations, local
[8616.319] citizens to to volunteer to to do what
[8619.439] they needed to do to bring relief to
[8621.6] people, right? That didn't exist in 1976
[8625.12] and there was a whole different response
[8626.56] and we'll look at that because that can
[8630.0] be brought back. But it's a mindset.
[8633.439] It's a type of consciousness that you're
[8636.08] local. You're part of a community. And
[8638.399] if the community is distressed, people
[8640.8] don't have to be coerced. They're coming
[8642.479] out in droves to do what they can to
[8645.2] help. And the response was phenomenal,
[8647.84] almost miraculous. And we'll take a good
[8650.0] hard look at that because there's so
[8651.439] many lessons to be learned from that
[8654.08] damn failure back in 1976
[8657.359] from that damn failure. Yep. We can
[8661.12] change. Yeah, we can. Um, but again,
[8664.08] it's it's learning the lessons of
[8665.76] history. Yeah. and truth. Again, that
[8668.319] brings us right back to media. And of
[8670.88] course, media is being bribed and
[8672.96] they're also again under the control or
[8674.88] under the thumb of the of the almighty
[8677.28] state, right? So, we know that what you
[8681.68] know what uh what's his name? The head
[8683.359] of uh Facebook, what's his name? Mark
[8685.84] Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg. So, you
[8688.08] know, he's under Joe Rogan saying,
[8689.6] "Yeah, uh agents of the Biden
[8691.84] administration came and were pressuring
[8693.439] us. You know, this is what we find out
[8695.68] now." And and I think that's only the
[8698.08] tip of the iceberg, you know, that
[8700.96] controlling of the media and the
[8702.8] narrative that's sanitized and going out
[8705.04] to the American people. And then the
[8707.68] fact that they were going to try to
[8709.28] create this disinformation
[8711.8] bureaucracy, like give me a break when
[8714.96] you the government is the biggest source
[8716.8] of disinformation and misinformation and
[8719.76] now you want to
[8721.88] control the the the the Yeah, forget
[8725.2] that. Forget that. Forget ridiculous.
[8727.92] Forget it. Get out of here with that.
[8730.399] Um,
[8731.92] it's like Coca-Cola uh or let's say
[8735.359] major food companies controlling the
[8737.359] curriculum of the health care system and
[8740.8] what we're educating doctors with. Well,
[8743.439] in a sense, isn't that what big pharma
[8745.52] is doing? That is literally I mean
[8747.68] Coca-Cola is the number one financeier
[8750.88] of the medical school curriculum on the
[8753.76] majority of universities in the United
[8755.439] States. I didn't know that. Nestle and
[8757.359] Coca-Cola.
[8759.6] Nestle. And to think to think that when
[8762.64] I was a kid I used to drink Nestle's
[8764.64] chocolate milk. They have they have
[8767.68] swindled us Randall. I drink it. Oh my
[8770.0] god. Oh my god. I'm gonna have to switch
[8772.16] back to what? Ovaltine, I guess. Yeah,
[8774.88] that [ __ ] But at least we know that
[8778.8] we'll always have good chocolate powder
[8781.12] if we trust them to tell us what to eat
[8783.2] and what to educate our doctors with.
[8785.12] Well, look look what the free market has
[8786.96] done. Uh when I I remember when the
[8790.16] first yogurt came on the market, it was
[8792.72] one brand Danon and it was 35 cents for
[8796.08] a for an 8 ounce cup. 30 cents maybe.
[8799.76] Now you go there and what is there a
[8801.68] hundred different kinds of yogurt? Lots
[8803.92] of different types of yogurt. Yeah. And
[8805.84] I'm just using that as an example. I
[8807.6] mean, you this the things that we have
[8811.04] now that we can buy. I mean, I can go
[8812.72] into the store and they have
[8813.68] international sections with, you know,
[8815.52] the Thai food. I can get Mexican food. I
[8818.319] can get Italian food, you know. Uh I can
[8821.439] go to restaurants, a huge wide
[8823.399] diversity. When I was a kid, there was
[8825.52] no Thai restaurants. You can go, I'm
[8827.2] gonna go get Thai food tonight because
[8828.72] there were no Thai restaurants, right?
[8831.52] I can remember when the first uh Mexican
[8834.319] restaurant in uh locally where I lived
[8837.2] it like early '7s I think it was and
[8839.6] that was in Minnesota or is that in
[8841.04] Louisiana? That was in Minnesota. Now
[8843.52] there were probably other ones earlier
[8845.12] than that. I just remember when this
[8846.88] Mexican restaurant opened and that was
[8848.96] the first time I'd ever actually had a
[8850.399] burrito. You know burritos are not
[8852.72] actually Mexican. They're Texan. Well,
[8856.24] okay. I know that. I I know that. And
[8858.479] it's it's the the principle here, man.
[8860.64] Right. Right. Pizza. Same thing. I
[8863.76] remember it was I think it was Tortina's
[8865.92] pizza or Tortino. What? To Totina's
[8868.399] pizza or Tony's Pizza. So, it was one
[8870.56] brand you could get in the store. How
[8873.439] many brands do you see now if you go
[8874.88] into a large supermarket and you now you
[8877.439] can go and you can get cauliflower crust
[8879.76] pizzas and you can get, you know, sweet
[8882.72] potato crust pizzas, free pizzas,
[8885.28] glutenree, dairy free. Yeah. Well, that
[8888.72] is the market responding to demand and
[8892.6] nobody forces you to purchase one pizza
[8897.12] over another one or one brand of bread
[8900.08] over another one. You have choices
[8902.399] because that's free market capitalism as
[8906.0] contrasted to crony
[8908.28] capitalism. And those are two different
[8910.88] animals completely that I'm afraid that
[8913.28] the progressive liberal left democrats
[8915.68] don't really understand that very
[8918.64] important difference between capitalism
[8921.359] of the free market variety and
[8923.12] capitalism of the crony variety. Well,
[8925.92] you bring up a really good point because
[8927.92] point because you said everybody has
[8929.84] choices and this is where that last
[8932.319] pillar that you were talking about comes
[8934.56] up and why it's so important. It's
[8936.319] truth. It's like when uh I don't
[8940.0] remember who I was talking with the
[8941.6] other day, but they said something and
[8942.96] they said, "As long as you're telling me
[8945.56] everything, I have the freedom of
[8948.399] choice." But when you don't tell
[8950.319] somebody everything or you manipulate
[8952.56] them or you feed them misinformation,
[8954.479] disinformation, you're then being uh
[8957.439] essentially dishonest, which does not
[8959.76] give them the freedom of choice, which
[8961.68] you then take away somebody's power of
[8964.0] true choice. That's why truth is so
[8966.24] important in this. Yes, absolutely. And
[8969.92] you know, if you don't like Walmart,
[8972.16] nobody is forcing you to patronize
[8974.439] Walmart. But if I don't like Boeing
[8978.16] getting my money to build 2,000 pound
[8980.8] bombs, I don't have that choice. I don't
[8982.96] have the freedom to say, I'm not going
[8985.2] to I don't want my money to go to Boeing
[8987.28] because they're building bombs with it.
[8990.8] You see? Yeah. There's cro that's crony
[8993.359] cronyism. Mhm. And and so the arms
[8995.92] industry is bribing
[8998.52] politicians. They're one of the biggest,
[9000.56] you know, you got pharma, you've got the
[9004.0] country that shall go unnamed, and
[9006.24] you've got uh the arms industry. Those
[9008.56] are the three biggies that are now
[9011.04] controlling our Congress by making huge
[9015.28] donations
[9016.88] uh you know to to what of their
[9018.64] campaigns and so on. Um but again that
[9021.68] would all go away if we would restore
[9024.479] the original
[9026.399] uh way that the Senate operated. Yeah.
[9029.12] And you've got a big another one of the
[9031.76] pillars
[9032.84] in who's controlling let's just only
[9035.84] talk about the US government
[9039.0] is oh gosh what can we call them people
[9042.16] call them uh banks you know they they
[9044.56] simplify it to banks or the banking
[9046.479] system but we can call it the financeers
[9048.96] because
[9050.72] this often gets conflated with the uh
[9054.56] the country that shall go unnamed. It
[9057.04] often gets mixed up in this, but so it's
[9059.92] important for people to do their own
[9061.12] research on these things because this is
[9062.64] where it gets way overblown. But if you
[9065.12] look at all of the financing from World
[9069.359] War I to World War II to many of the
[9072.56] wars that the United States have been in
[9074.16] to all of the fighting in the Middle
[9075.92] East, you're going to find that
[9080.12] financing
[9082.76] is unbiased. Let's just call it that.
[9086.72] It's not going to be limited to, oh,
[9088.88] here's this finance here on one side.
[9091.76] Oh, and here's this other finance here
[9093.84] who stands for these same principles and
[9095.68] they're financing and they're fighting
[9096.96] against each other and they're much just
[9098.88] as much a part of the war. Like you will
[9102.399] find that so much of the financing is
[9105.84] coming from the same places for
[9108.24] everybody. So what benefits is the
[9111.28] amount of debt that's built up, the
[9113.04] amount of lending that has to be given
[9116.08] for this war to even happen, for them to
[9118.319] be purchasing weapons, for them to be
[9120.399] moving people around, for them to be
[9121.92] purchasing food. And wars are highly
[9125.6] profitable. Oh, yeah. Highly, highly
[9128.319] profitable. And we often miss the big
[9130.64] clue right in front of us is like, okay,
[9132.479] well, why would a war be
[9134.84] profitable for who? What would make it
[9137.6] profitable? It seems unprofitable for
[9140.08] all of us, right? Or maybe the weapons
[9142.64] manufacturers have that as well. It's
[9144.96] like, okay, well, who's spending the
[9146.88] money for the weapons manufacturers?
[9148.88] Where's that money coming from? You just
[9150.96] have to keep drawing this back. And
[9153.439] you'll find that violence pays and it's
[9157.84] not paying to the the ethical people who
[9161.68] are standing there trying to finance
[9163.68] what they think is good. It's not how it
[9166.479] works.
[9167.439] uh you know back as a you know in the
[9170.08] 50s and 60s is when they begin to shift
[9173.359] the mindset from you know producing the
[9175.84] highest quality product to planned
[9178.64] obsolescence
[9180.399] right so I remember we had you know like
[9184.56] we had a washing machine that lasted
[9187.04] like 25 years and people still don't
[9189.52] believe that's a real thing by the way I
[9191.04] had a conversation with somebody and
[9192.399] they were like that's fake no that's not
[9194.88] fake oh my god that is not fake. Um, but
[9198.399] what's the ultimate planned obsolescence
[9200.96] is uh, you know, military equipment
[9204.479] because it you get engaged in a war and
[9206.56] it all gets used up and then has to be
[9209.2] resupplied. So, as long as the war goes
[9211.84] on, you know, whoever is providing the
[9214.64] weaponry or the ordinance, whatever it
[9216.64] might be, has to keep on producing it.
[9218.96] Then when peace comes, uh, boom, they're
[9222.479] not providing it anymore. So you have to
[9224.08] come up with fake doctrines like the
[9226.479] Cold War which the whole thing was a
[9228.0] fake doctrine to justify the continued
[9231.68] increase in military spending. And you
[9235.04] know because of the fact that it's the
[9237.04] way I look at things that even things I
[9238.96] don't like and don't disagree with if
[9240.56] they're they're happening out there in
[9241.92] the real world how do we salvage them
[9245.04] and try to extract some kind of positive
[9248.319] effect out of it? Right. Well, to me,
[9251.28] what the arms race did during the cold
[9253.6] war was, you know, there wouldn't have
[9255.76] been, look, one of the things that was
[9258.08] the byproduct of the cold war was the
[9260.8] space
[9262.04] race, right? Because Soviet Union
[9265.28] launched Sputnik in what was it 57, I
[9267.76] believe. And that's what launched the
[9270.8] space race. Mhm. Well, when we decided
[9275.52] when we began the Mercury program and
[9277.6] the uh the Gemini program and ultimately
[9280.08] the Apollo program, we took what we had
[9282.96] learned by building intercontinental
[9286.08] missiles whose purpose was to deliver
[9288.64] nuclear warheads around the world and we
[9291.68] were able to adapt that technology to
[9294.56] lift uh you know astronauts up to space
[9298.64] and return them to Earth. Now that I
[9302.319] think again is a precedent that we can
[9304.72] learn from is that a lot of the
[9307.439] technologies that are being developed
[9310.24] for warfare can be adapted to peaceful
[9313.439] uses particularly
[9315.84] uh into the economic expansion and
[9319.28] development and colonization of space.
[9322.319] The industrial expansion into space
[9325.0] because we're still a ways away from it.
[9328.0] But you know, just like if you go back
[9330.0] to the
[9331.0] 1600s, you know, the Europeans were
[9333.76] still a century away from being able to
[9335.92] exploit the virtually unlimited
[9338.0] resources of the Western Hemisphere. But
[9340.8] eventually we did. And as bad as our
[9343.68] treatment of the Native Americans was,
[9345.52] and we could have done what we did
[9347.439] without that, without the mistreatment
[9350.08] of the Native Americans, we could have.
[9352.24] But again, when you look at the the
[9353.92] organized pilgrims of mistreatment of
[9356.64] the Native Americans, the Indian wars
[9358.479] and stuff, the forced displacement of
[9360.96] Native Americans from their homelands,
[9363.04] it was all being spearheaded by the
[9364.56] federal government, you know, and it
[9366.64] particularly accelerated after the the
[9369.2] Union armies won the uh Civil War. Now,
[9372.479] you bring Sheridan and Sherman back
[9374.319] home, what are you going to do with
[9375.439] them? Well, you've gone down, you've
[9377.12] obliterated the South, their attempts to
[9379.08] secede, right? you've justified it on
[9381.92] the on the uh the goal of uh eliminating
[9385.76] slavery even though that was only the
[9388.0] stated goal, not the real goal. The real
[9389.84] goal was economic and that's a whole
[9391.76] another discussion that we could have at
[9393.2] some point. But what do you do? You
[9395.04] redeploy them to the western frontier.
[9397.28] It was Sheridan after uh the you know uh
[9400.96] after the Union Army was redeployed. It
[9402.96] was Sheridan that came up. He was a
[9404.8] wonderful man. He came up with the idea
[9406.64] that uh we could uh infect we could give
[9410.0] the uh we could give the Indians
[9412.399] blankets, right? Because we deprive them
[9414.479] of their ability to uh basically keep
[9417.6] themselves warm during the winter. So,
[9419.52] we'll give them blankets except that
[9421.439] we'll infect those blankets with
[9422.88] smallpox, right? Oh, here's another
[9425.68] thing we can do. the the Plains Indians
[9428.16] that are uh uh impeding the the the
[9431.439] railroad interests, you know, that are
[9434.08] bribing politicians, uh you know, the
[9436.96] Native Americans are, you know,
[9439.28] obstructing them and they have to be
[9441.04] cleared out. What's the best way to do
[9443.359] that? Well, because the Plains Indians,
[9445.68] the the foundation of their economic
[9448.0] system was the buffalo, what we could do
[9450.319] is sheridan again came up the idea of
[9452.64] exterminating the buffalo.
[9455.359] And so the uh federal government been
[9458.399] began to pay a $10 uh uh bounty on
[9461.92] buffalo hides including and also to to
[9465.68] uh stimulate the private sector to go
[9468.0] out and kill buffalo. And they sent
[9470.319] soldiers out and they did mass
[9472.479] slaughters of buffalo. Um again this is
[9475.76] never taught in history that the near
[9477.76] extinction of the American bison was
[9480.399] almost the result of of the federal
[9482.72] government of government policy. Yes. Oh
[9484.8] my gosh. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, again,
[9488.399] Yeah. But there's other lessons to be
[9491.04] learned there. I mean, the whole species
[9492.88] came to within what, a few hundred
[9494.399] individuals,
[9496.0] but with a change in policy. Yeah. The
[9500.399] whole species was able to be restored.
[9503.12] Uh, and now, you know, we can go to the
[9504.96] grocery store and we can buy bison meat,
[9507.439] right? Not that was certainly not an
[9509.52] option that I had growing up. And it's
[9511.6] not fully restored. It's just been
[9513.84] protected in certain areas. You know,
[9515.92] there's just been like intense focus on
[9519.52] conservation of habitat essentially for
[9522.08] repopulation. But the pressures that
[9524.64] were caused the mass extinction of the
[9527.28] species have gone considerably because
[9529.68] now there's an economic incentive to
[9532.0] preserve the species. I mean, I've been
[9533.76] to, you know, multiple bison r uh ranges
[9537.28] and stuff and, you know, the the
[9539.439] national bison range there in Montana.
[9542.0] I've been there, taken tours there
[9544.479] because it's just it's such a cool area.
[9546.399] But yeah, huge herds of bison just
[9548.479] freeranging. Oh, it's beautiful. It's
[9550.479] great. It's wonderful. Yes.
[9553.12] But you know what? You look back from a
[9554.88] thousand years from now, you could
[9557.04] completely miss the fact that the
[9559.76] American bison came this close to
[9563.0] extinction. You could completely miss
[9565.16] that because turn of the century, yeah,
[9568.72] they're this close. a hundred years
[9570.92] later there's hundreds of thousands of
[9573.84] buffalo. Yeah. And that's why it's
[9575.28] important for truthful documentation
[9577.76] too. Like we cannot be afraid of telling
[9580.319] the truth even when it makes you look
[9582.72] bad. Right. Right. So, you know, in a
[9586.479] way you could say that um the Union
[9589.359] victory of the Civil War had an
[9592.68] unintended consequences because now you
[9595.2] had this big federally controlled Union
[9598.479] army that didn't exist before because
[9602.08] Abraham Lincoln imposed the first draft,
[9604.96] right? Abraham Lincoln, every single
[9607.84] journalist that wrote anything uh you
[9611.52] know uh against the war uh was rounded
[9615.439] up and imprisoned. People don't know
[9616.88] that about Lincoln. Uh he had senators
[9619.52] that opposed the war, imprisoned. Uh he
[9623.6] was not the character, the fine
[9625.28] upstanding character that he was and he
[9627.2] was totally beholden to the railroad
[9628.8] interests. That's why um in the
[9631.439] aftermath of the Civil War, the now
[9633.76] organized Union Army was deployed to
[9636.72] suppress the Native Americans and any
[9638.88] attempt that they were making to resist
[9642.0] the encroachment. Uh and so the whole
[9645.12] like early on railroad uh pro uh
[9648.64] railroad industry was just rife with
[9651.439] corrupting corruption. So, one of the
[9653.6] things that they would do was Washington
[9655.479] politicians would give like a five or a
[9658.479] 10mi easement on either side of the
[9660.84] railroads. Then their cronies knew about
[9663.92] that. So, they would start buying up the
[9665.84] land along the route of the proposed
[9668.0] railroad. Now, they've made all this
[9670.0] investment. They bribed politicians and
[9672.399] paid them off. Oh, now those Indians are
[9674.72] being annoying because this goes right
[9676.8] through their territorial homeland,
[9678.399] maybe across their sacred graveyards,
[9680.8] whatever. But they're resisting. So now
[9684.16] what happens now? You send in the army
[9687.04] to, you know, slaughter the Native
[9690.24] Americans. And that's what led to the
[9692.08] Indian Wars. Now, of course, there were
[9694.28] skirmishes individually outside of that.
[9696.72] Yes, absolutely they were. But it was
[9698.319] not a systemic policy. It became that
[9701.92] once the federal government got involved
[9704.16] and there was a great injustice
[9705.92] perpetrated upon Native American people.
[9708.399] They were then uh forced into
[9711.64] reservations. Uh and there's a whole
[9713.84] another story there again we could talk
[9715.52] about. But I guess you know again the
[9718.72] the three things peace, freedom, and
[9720.399] truth. And they've all been compromised
[9723.319] severely through this centralization of
[9725.92] power. Now ultimately is this
[9728.399] centralization of power part of the big
[9730.319] picture? Is it going to vindicate
[9731.68] itself? Well, it needs to. And how it
[9734.16] could vindicate itself is that
[9736.64] diversification.
[9738.319] In the same way that the original
[9741.04] colonists came to the new world to get
[9743.76] away from the uh the the oppression of
[9748.399] the old world, the control, the bure
[9751.04] bureaucracy, the wars, everything. They
[9753.84] were motivated by the desire for freedom
[9756.64] and opportunity. And they came here and
[9759.68] look what they built in the next 200 250
[9762.399] years.
[9763.84] Look what we've done. Now, you know, you
[9766.16] can you can be down on the products of
[9768.319] capitalism while you're, you know,
[9770.24] posting memes to the internet with your
[9772.88] with your cell phone. Well, if that's
[9775.6] your if that's your take on things, you
[9777.84] just don't get it. You need a serious
[9779.439] reality check. The problem is crony
[9783.84] capitalism versus free market
[9787.0] capitalism. If we shift the pendulum
[9789.76] back to the free markets and get the
[9792.56] coercion out of it, we get the ability
[9795.04] of the federal government to extract
[9797.439] resources from the American working
[9800.04] population by force, we'll see a major
[9803.6] major shift. If we can get the the
[9806.72] centralized authoritarian control out of
[9810.0] the education system, that's going to go
[9812.88] a long way towards getting people to be
[9816.72] to be educated again, to be smart again,
[9819.28] to become intelligent, to be able to
[9821.359] think independently. But what they're
[9824.319] trying to do and have been trying to do
[9826.08] since for the last half uh century is to
[9829.92] dumb people down. And now you've got a
[9833.359] big segment of the population that is
[9835.76] just gullibly swallowing whatever
[9837.92] they're being spoonfed and you see it
[9840.399] all the time. Here's the mainstream
[9842.6] narrative and then these people are
[9844.96] repeating it over and over and over
[9846.64] again. I don't know if there's hope for
[9848.8] those people. It may just be that we
[9851.12] have to focus on let's say the third of
[9854.0] the population that that are about
[9858.439] awakening and and getting back to some
[9861.439] deeper and higher principles. Hey, I
[9864.24] think it's possible that if we swing one
[9866.24] out of every 20 people towards being an
[9869.399] awakened person in America, that will be
[9872.24] enough to turn the tide, right? Because
[9874.72] each one of those one in 20 people, that
[9877.359] 5% is going to influence their
[9880.84] immediate circle. Yeah. When you when
[9883.2] you're a critical thinker and you're a
[9884.8] relational person that chooses to be
[9888.8] even emotionally stable and interact in
[9891.439] a format where you're able to think,
[9896.04] reason, not just in external uh not just
[9900.08] looking at external problems, but in
[9901.359] onetoone relationship. I mean there's a
[9902.96] gravity to it. I mean it changes
[9905.439] everyone's life around you. So I think
[9908.08] it's a a good point.
[9911.04] Yeah. I mean initially that was so
[9913.279] roughly the ratio that led to the
[9915.76] revolutionary war. It was the ratio that
[9918.399] led to the anti-war movement that
[9921.12] opposed what we were doing in Vietnam.
[9924.16] It probably started in the 64 65 you
[9927.92] know with with one person out of 20. By
[9930.88] 60 it was one person out of five and by
[9934.24] 68 it was you know four people out of
[9937.88] five and the whole the whole mindset of
[9942.399] America shifted but it took some trauma
[9945.359] to do it. It took you know people who
[9949.12] who were totally on board with the
[9951.2] narrative. See the thing is is everybody
[9954.0] knew somebody that had gone over there
[9956.64] and either came back killed was killed,
[9960.08] came back maimed, came back
[9962.84] psychologically debilitated,
[9965.359] etc. Everybody knew somebody firsthand.
[9968.88] Your neighbor, your friends, everybody
[9971.88] did. That was one of the things that the
[9975.52] shock of that, the trauma of that. And
[9979.2] you know, is that what it's going to
[9980.399] take? I don't know. Uh if enough people
[9982.88] wake up, the transition can be made
[9985.12] without the trauma, without the shocks.
[9988.08] And what I would hope to see happen
[9990.319] within the next decade is that we go
[9992.96] that the that the leaders sit down and
[9995.76] say, "Look, you know what? We're here to
[9998.68] represent our people. And what's best
[10001.6] for our people is not that we go to war
[10003.92] with each other, but that we set aside
[10006.72] maybe political differences in political
[10009.2] philosophy and we figure out how we can
[10011.439] work
[10012.2] together. And I think it actually could
[10015.359] work because what has history shown is
[10017.439] that well, hey, yeah, so Vietnam became
[10020.0] communist, right? and we were
[10022.08] ideologically opposed to communism. And
[10024.319] yet within a few years after the Vietnam
[10026.64] War was over, we're doing millions of
[10029.279] dollars of business with them, right?
[10032.88] Well, who now is going to say, "Oh, we
[10034.56] can't be doing business with Vietnamese
[10036.16] people. Those people are our enemies."
[10038.319] Well, what made them our enemy? Well,
[10040.319] what made him the enemy was, well, one,
[10042.0] they had a different ideology, and the
[10043.92] idea was to go stop communism. So we
[10046.279] intervene because we believed that there
[10048.72] were huge reservoirs of oil in the Gulf
[10050.64] of Tonkan was the main motivation why we
[10053.76] didn't want into China to fall to the
[10056.479] communists. Right? Um so we were
[10059.2] motivated by an economic uh uh agenda
[10063.92] right there. Right? But when it came
[10066.24] down to it once the war was over we set
[10068.72] aside our differences and we became
[10071.359] trading partners.
[10073.6] And now, you know, I have, like I said,
[10075.92] I was this week in G visiting my
[10078.16] accountant and he's Vietnamese. And I'm
[10081.04] in that room full of 20 Vietnamese, some
[10083.76] of them, which were some very attractive
[10085.92] young Vietnamese ladies. But in there, I
[10089.6] did not feel, oh my god, these are
[10091.359] Vietnamese people, and I feel
[10093.76] threatened. Well, they were never a
[10095.359] threat to us. How could they have been a
[10096.56] threat to us when they when they had no
[10098.24] navy and they had no air force? How were
[10100.479] they going to get here? You know, they
[10102.64] weren't going to swim. Were they going
[10104.399] to go, you know, in canoes and rowboats
[10106.16] to cross the ocean to get here to attack
[10108.0] us? No. They were never a threat at all
[10110.0] to us. Just like Iran is not a threat to
[10112.24] us right now. The Iran doesn't want war
[10114.72] with us, but you know who does? Um, but
[10118.8] you know, that's my point is that look,
[10121.04] we can work with China, we can work with
[10123.2] Russia, we can work with Iran, right?
[10126.56] Why? Because in front of us is looming
[10129.84] this incredible mega opportunity that we
[10134.08] can take the wealth and riches of our
[10136.8] free economy up to an exponentially
[10141.399] expanded level by realizing that if we
[10146.0] work together, we can begin to harvest
[10147.76] the resources of the cosmos. Literally
[10151.12] harvest the resources of space. And we
[10154.08] can literally we can within a century
[10157.2] probably less than that probably within
[10158.64] 50 years we could offload our entire
[10161.84] industrial basis of our civilization
[10164.399] from the planet. Now if you're an
[10167.0] environmentalist you should be getting
[10169.04] 100% behind that because I think we're
[10172.319] on the verge of technological
[10174.16] breakthroughs that would allow us to so
[10177.12] streamline our technology. It will allow
[10179.84] us set the free market free. Set the
[10183.84] power of innovation free, stimulate it.
[10188.0] We will have the ability to reduce our
[10191.6] dependence on fossil fuels enormously
[10194.72] without the imposed social deprivation
[10197.84] and and economic deprivation that is
[10200.88] going to be the inevitable result of the
[10203.279] forceful imposition of all of the Green
[10206.0] New Deal policies.
[10208.24] that's going to put monitors on how much
[10211.279] carbon dioxide we can consume, right?
[10214.24] And and it's it's going to create a a
[10217.439] system that's ripe for corruption and
[10219.92] payoffs and bribery. We don't need to go
[10222.8] that route, right? We could be within a
[10226.319] generation, we could be harvesting the
[10228.24] resources of space. We could be and
[10231.439] that's both material and energy. This is
[10234.08] not some Right. Yeah. This Yeah. I mean,
[10237.279] look, when I was born, we had zero zero
[10240.96] presence in space, right? That first
[10243.76] Sputnik, look up Sputnik, learn about
[10245.72] that. That was the first beach head of
[10248.56] the human species into space off planet.
[10252.399] And look where it's come now since then.
[10254.72] You know, once again, if it wasn't for
[10257.04] uh our satellite surveys, I mean, our
[10260.0] satellite uh we wouldn't have these. We
[10263.439] wouldn't be doing what we're doing now.
[10266.399] It all depends on our presence in space.
[10268.16] You could you would not have we would
[10270.0] not be having any of this interaction
[10271.6] where you're in Mexico, I'm in Georgia,
[10273.279] and we're sitting here talking to each
[10274.64] other, looking at each other in real
[10276.24] time without real without the whole
[10278.319] system of relay satellites that's up
[10280.399] there in space. And now with the
[10283.279] advantages that we've got with AI, with
[10285.439] robotics, and so on, we have the ability
[10288.399] to really go exploring. And this is why
[10292.0] I'm so behind the Aremis program and
[10295.08] seeing the rise of the private sector
[10298.08] space program. Now you can say what you
[10300.08] want about Musk and about Bezos and
[10302.64] about Richard Branson. These
[10304.72] billionaires are financing. If it wasn't
[10307.12] for them, our space program would be
[10309.68] totally more abundant. Their presence
[10312.319] has stimulated NASA to get their ass in
[10314.88] gear, right? Um we're way behind. We're
[10318.16] way behind on the cosmic timetable in my
[10320.56] opinion. Um, and now we've got the left
[10324.56] faction who says we got to get rid of
[10326.68] billionaires. You know, we need to tax
[10329.04] billionaires at
[10330.76] 90%. Well, okay, for, you know,
[10334.319] well-intentioned humanitarian, of
[10336.479] course, what's going to happen then?
[10338.0] You're simply going to take the money
[10339.359] from the billionaires who created the
[10341.76] wealth in the first place and give it
[10344.0] over to politicians and that's going to
[10346.319] be better. You that's going to be a
[10348.479] higher use to give that money to
[10350.68] politicians who did not take risks who
[10353.6] did not have to put their lives and
[10355.84] their economic uh lives online to build
[10359.6] whatever it is that you know and and you
[10362.319] know personally yeah of course
[10364.0] everybody's got flaws and you want to
[10365.76] focus on that. Yeah. But the fact is, as
[10368.16] you look at the billionaire
[10370.2] class creates millions of jobs, millions
[10374.0] of jobs, right? If you now tax the
[10376.96] billionaires at
[10378.279] 90%, you're going to kill you're going
[10380.88] to kill the civilian space program. Now,
[10384.56] you might celebrate that because you've
[10386.72] never thought about it at all within the
[10389.439] context of the larger picture of global
[10392.319] change and where we're going to be going
[10393.68] in the future. But we need a civilian
[10396.8] space program. We need that. And we can
[10399.84] form an alliance with NASA. We can form
[10403.04] an alliance with the uh European Union's
[10406.8] space agency. We can form an alliance
[10409.76] with the Russian space agency. Look, who
[10412.64] was it that delivered the goods up to
[10414.319] the international uh to the Russia?
[10417.52] Yeah. Right there was an example. We can
[10420.56] take that example and multiply it by
[10423.04] orders of magnitude. But see then if
[10426.88] we're not at war with them, I mean,
[10429.04] nobody's making money. Like you said,
[10430.96] war is a very profitable enterprise. And
[10434.319] the war industry along with these other
[10437.96] agencies have co-opted our system of
[10441.439] government. Yeah. And that's got to
[10444.88] stop. And one way that can stop is we
[10448.6] rescend the 17th
[10451.0] amendment. And now no longer will Ted
[10454.08] Cruz have to raise a hund00 million. All
[10456.8] he's got to do is protect the interests
[10459.04] of the Texas state government and the
[10461.359] Texas people. And that is who he's
[10463.359] obligated to. Nobody else.
[10466.24] Doesn't matter whether you're
[10467.2] Republican, Democrat, whatever. That's
[10469.2] going to be the outcome. Now is there is
[10472.319] there or was there uh corruption in the
[10475.68] system? Absolutely there was. But under
[10478.8] a diversified system now in 2025, it's
[10482.479] going to be a whole lot harder to get
[10484.64] away with corruption on the state level
[10486.8] than it is going to be on the federal
[10488.52] level. Because remember, the state
[10490.64] governments get their power from the
[10492.399] local governments, from the
[10493.76] municipalities, from the counties. See,
[10496.68] so your your involvement in the
[10499.92] political sector under the original
[10501.76] system, if you go to your town hall
[10503.72] meeting, you see that reverb bates
[10506.08] upward. That town hall reverb bates
[10508.08] upwards through the municipality,
[10510.16] through the county, up through the state
[10512.479] level. See what happens now? It's
[10516.16] truncated at the state level because
[10519.96] it's between all of the policies that
[10522.56] have been in place over the last 120
[10524.479] years or so. What it's done is it has
[10527.359] centralized power in the federal
[10529.439] government while it's insulating the
[10532.0] federal government from the original
[10533.76] system of checks and balances that that
[10536.479] kept it limited that kept it subordinate
[10538.96] to the interests of the states.
[10542.319] So, you know, there's a lot to unpack
[10544.16] here and you know, all I all I can say
[10546.96] is, you know, it's one of the
[10549.04] fundamental ways that we move forward is
[10551.2] authentic
[10552.279] education. Uh we teach authentic history
[10555.6] and of course, you know, you might be
[10557.52] well-meaning, but the whole DEI thing is
[10559.84] is ultimately about again sanitizing
[10563.439] real history. If you talk about slavery,
[10566.399] and this is a good point, and I think
[10567.68] we'll make this point, and then we've
[10568.88] got to we got to wrap it up. But if you
[10571.52] look at the uh the whole uh issue of
[10575.52] slavery and the introduction of slavery
[10578.319] into America or into the new world, it
[10580.8] always begins, it begins with the
[10583.2] transatlantic slave trade. Well, when
[10586.8] the Dutch when the Portuguese ultimately
[10589.12] when the English went to West Africa and
[10594.0] sailed away with a load of slaves, they
[10597.2] didn't like go into the African interior
[10599.439] and capture slaves. No. And I mean this
[10602.0] this I don't couldn't get me in trouble
[10603.76] for saying this, but it's the truth.
[10605.92] There was a flourishing slave trade
[10608.319] already there. They didn't go and
[10610.319] capture slaves. They bought slaves.
[10612.96] Africans were enslaving each other just
[10615.52] like virtually every culture in the
[10618.64] world throughout of history at at one
[10620.56] time or another have enslaved other
[10623.0] people. Now slave though even the word
[10626.16] comes from Slavic, right? Because the
[10628.88] Slavs were white slaves, right? People
[10633.04] forget that. But it's important to go
[10635.2] back and realize that there was already
[10638.319] in many parts of the world flourishing
[10640.56] slave trade and that simply got imported
[10642.96] into the US. And you can see that it
[10646.72] then became economically entrenched. And
[10649.68] that's another whole discussion that
[10652.08] needs to happen between the founding of
[10653.84] America and the Civil War. Had the Civil
[10656.479] War not occurred, it's likely that
[10658.24] within 10 years, slavery would have been
[10660.0] abolished in America anyway because it
[10661.92] was already becoming economically
[10665.08] counterproductive because with
[10666.96] technological and industrial advances,
[10669.6] it was a lot more efficient to use
[10671.84] machines and things than human labor.
[10675.279] And this was the natural trend. The
[10677.359] natural trend was that you know it's
[10679.68] just like in Brit I mean in Brazil they
[10681.84] never had a civil war but they had more
[10684.16] slaves than the US but they slavery
[10687.2] became obsolete as Brazil advanced
[10690.319] industrially.
[10692.24] Um yeah history is uh a lot more nuanced
[10697.52] and colorful than we've been taught. You
[10700.319] know, I think that's where the the point
[10702.399] of all of these different examples that
[10704.24] we've run through today and me as a
[10706.56] learner in this as well is just there's
[10709.92] so much more to investigate. There's
[10712.96] more to be curious about and a lot of
[10715.04] the problems, a lot of the things that
[10716.479] we're dealing with today, we can look to
[10718.56] the past, look to history to try to find
[10721.12] the truth in order to help us make
[10723.439] decisions to inform us, for us to have a
[10726.399] strong data to work off of. Now, I don't
[10729.6] claim I've got every detail right or
[10731.92] every nuance exactly described as it
[10734.399] happened. Uh, you know, you people can
[10736.72] fact check me. I think they'll find that
[10738.16] the majority of my facts follow up. I
[10740.399] may have a year off here or there, a
[10742.0] name off here and there, but typically
[10744.96] when we post this stuff and I look at
[10746.64] some of the comments and I'll see
[10747.92] somebody saying, "Oh, like, oh, this guy
[10749.68] is full of shit." I go I look at and
[10752.399] that's the sum total of their whatever.
[10754.479] This never happened. This guy's full of
[10756.08] [ __ ] Right? I look at that and I go,
[10757.84] "Okay, well, here is a product of the
[10760.399] education monopoly in America right
[10762.56] here. This is evidence of the failure of
[10766.08] the education system." Yeah. And
[10768.399] hopefully these the intention behind
[10771.04] this podcast is for this to be a format
[10775.12] where people can engage and can learn
[10777.359] and can I think from my perspective
[10779.76] where I sit, I'm trying to learn from
[10782.399] you. After I get off these podcasts, I
[10784.96] research the things that are said. This
[10786.8] doesn't just end at us sitting here. And
[10790.16] that's the invitation that we're trying
[10792.24] to extend through this. That's kind of
[10793.68] the whole idea of we're investigating
[10795.68] the big picture. And the reason why
[10797.68] we're investigating the big picture is
[10799.439] so we as humans can coordinate from a
[10802.8] similar standpoint. So we have similar
[10805.359] information. Even if we've investigated
[10807.52] it and come to different conclusions,
[10809.68] we're still working with the facts.
[10811.84] We're still working with similar
[10813.12] information to be able to coordinate on
[10815.6] how we decide to move forward as
[10817.439] humanity and this is our small rock in
[10820.08] the pond towards that. So yeah, thank
[10822.24] you Randall. This was a lot of fun too
[10824.8] journey through your life and your
[10826.319] perspective on a lot of things. Well,
[10828.479] you know, I've lived it. So I've, you
[10830.64] know, and I've thought ever since I was
[10832.72] a kid. I was encouraged to read. Uh my
[10835.92] mother and my grandmother both were
[10837.92] voracious readers. So I had there were
[10840.16] books around from the time I was six,
[10842.16] seven years old. There were books. So I
[10844.319] started reading. I discovered a love of
[10846.0] reading at seven and eight and I've read
[10848.279] non-stop ever since. And that's the
[10850.64] starting of it getting a conceptual
[10852.96] framework. I also stepped outside of the
[10855.2] bounds of what was considered normal and
[10857.04] accepted behavior and went into realms
[10859.12] that were considered offlimits. Came
[10861.279] back from those realms and with a
[10863.52] heightened perception of the very nature
[10866.16] and basis of reality. uh that led me to
[10869.92] uh realize one of the reasons why this
[10872.64] was being oppressed by the government is
[10874.319] because you know if you did a
[10876.319] psychedelic drug it was often that you
[10878.479] saw through the veneer of
[10881.96] inauthenticity. That was one of the maj
[10884.08] major outcomes of that and that's why it
[10886.08] was so dangerous and had to be outlawed
[10888.72] and suppressed rather than allowed to uh
[10892.16] emerge and evolve as a as a a modality
[10895.76] that could heal our psychic ailments.
[10898.479] And ultimately all of these so many of
[10901.76] the problems are the direct consequence
[10903.92] of psychic ailments then translate into
[10907.84] the physical ailments and the the things
[10910.0] that separate us and divide us and so
[10912.479] on. Um there's so much more we could
[10915.439] talk about. Oh yeah. We we have been
[10917.279] talking about these major global events
[10920.64] that we we need to circle back to. Why?
[10923.96] Because just as these major disrupting
[10927.359] events within the continuum of nature,
[10929.92] within the continuum of civilization and
[10932.84] society can cause tremendous setbacks uh
[10937.439] resets if you will. Uh and ancient
[10940.479] cultures had to adapt and survive uh in
[10944.24] order for us to even be here. Well, the
[10946.64] kinds of disruptive events that have
[10949.68] occurred over and over and over again in
[10952.16] the history of the world and in the
[10953.68] history of civilization are going to
[10955.359] continue to happen. And one of the
[10957.439] lessons that we're going to take when we
[10958.8] look at this is why I think that Teton
[10960.399] Dam disaster is so important. It's a
[10962.6] microcosm for two different ways of
[10964.88] approaching what happens when there's a
[10967.52] major disruption in the status quo of
[10971.2] things. And there are tremendous lessons
[10973.439] to be learned from that. And one of the
[10976.16] things going forward is we have to
[10977.84] recognize that things are going to
[10979.279] change sometimes
[10981.319] catastrophically no matter what we do.
[10984.0] Yep. Now the question is are we going to
[10986.88] be able to adapt? Are we going to be
[10988.8] able to respond? And we are having
[10991.6] policies imposed upon us right now that
[10994.479] are not going to uh you know make us
[10998.08] adaptable. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. So I
[11001.68] think that's where we'll leave it for
[11002.96] now.
[11004.319] Excuse me. This pollen is in my throat.
[11007.12] Um, well, we're three hours deep, man.
[11010.0] So, let's rap. That was a fun time. I'm
[11014.0] headed off day after tomorrow to go to
[11015.92] Sedona. I'll be hanging out with Graham
[11017.92] Hancock and some other interesting
[11020.24] people. Uh, who gets a lot of un Yeah.
[11024.479] Allan West from Research Group. We
[11027.2] talked about him a little bit, but we
[11028.88] did. We'll uh Yeah, we'll we'll do a
[11032.479] recap of it next time, too. Yeah, we
[11034.479] will. So, if not sooner, I'll see you at
[11036.399] the Cosmic Summit in June. Yep. All
[11039.68] right, man. Enjoyed it. Talk to you
[11041.92] again soon. Talk to you soon. Bye.

Title: When Truth Broke the Narrative
[0.0] the Vietnam syndrome. If you hear that
[2.48] when I get back, if I catch one, I'm
[5.12] walking down the street carrying a NVA
[7.04] flag or something, I'm busting right in
[8.32] the chopper.
[10.559] There it is. Can't make it any planer
[13.12] than that.
[15.2] And I'm with Jean. If I go back and I
[18.08] see one of them walking down the streets
[19.6] waving NV flag, NBA flag, I'm going to
[22.48] get out and I'm going to take that son
[23.76] of a and they can lock me if they
[26.88] please. That's just the way I feel.
[29.439] The Vietnam syndrome was because of the
[32.32] free roaming media. That was a huge
[35.079] major influence on turning public
[37.84] opinion against the war because you
[39.76] could turn your television on. There it
[41.2] was right there. And then of course on
[42.96] top of that was the draft. It's not an
[44.719] all volunteer army. It was post Vietnam
[47.039] again where they switched to the all
[48.559] volunteer army. And that was again to
[51.28] try to be able to get control of public
[54.0] opinion because after post Vietnam they
[56.719] did not have control of public opinion
[59.039] and you had their draftes coming back
[61.12] saying hey this is all It's
[63.68] all And they had no emotional
[66.479] investment in the narrative.

Title: The America You Forgot...
[0.16] Look at there. That's Aquatenial Canoe
[2.24] Derby racers left Biji on July 14th,
[5.64] 1960 for Minneapolis. So, we have
[8.4] similar information even if we've
[10.32] investigated it and come to different
[12.0] conclusions. This is classic history
[14.4] right here. There's things that we could
[16.24] be standing up for. This is an era
[18.16] that's gone now. Carlton, grab your
[21.359] ankles. Randall, if I ever say grab your
[24.08] ankles, you should turn around and shoot
[26.4] me. So all of that came as part of the
[29.24] postVietnam the Vietnam syndrome if you
[32.0] hear that wars are highly profitable and
[34.48] you had the drafties coming back saying
[36.96] hey this is all a hope of a
[39.2] different future that was the thing that
[41.04] was what was in the background hovering
[43.04] over us we don't like guys like you the
[45.68] all-American type what I do believe that
[49.039] there is massive change coming in the
[51.76] original constitutional system there
[54.079] wouldn't be any of that we don't really
[55.76] know what's going on in Venezuela right
[58.0] now and standing against a war, standing
[60.64] against violence, but also standing in
[64.08] for something. So, they're imposing
[66.08] their regime has completely destroyed
[68.159] their economy. And where are they
[69.6] coming? They're coming here. The
[71.28] pressures that were caused the mass
[73.6] extinction of the species. History is uh
[77.68] a lot more nuanced and colorful than
[81.2] we've been taught. Yeah, they're this
[82.88] close. There's a whole another story
[84.72] there again we could talk about.

Title: The Cuban Missile Crisis
[0.0] A big turning point was October of
[3.24] 1962, the Cuban missile
[11.559] crisis. We America had been deploying
[14.639] Jupiter missiles with nuclear capability
[17.68] and they probably were had were carrying
[20.0] uh nuclear warheads. Let's see in Greece
[22.48] I believe in the other country was
[23.84] Turkey and they had the ability to reach
[27.439] into the Soviet homeland. I believe the
[30.64] ones in Turkey had the ability to reach
[33.44] Moscow actually. So in response cuz I
[36.559] mean this is this is in the thick of the
[38.719] Cold War that's been going on now since
[41.239] 1946 1947. You know, after World War II
[44.719] was done, we immediately shifted gears
[47.68] as far as the Soviet Union, and we'd
[49.44] been allies through the World War II.
[51.28] Now, they became our enemy number one.
[54.0] And so, this cold war began in place,
[56.8] and you had this tit fortat back and
[59.359] forth, now moving into the nuclear age.
[63.199] So, we see the evolution of of nuclear
[66.159] doctrine beginning, for example, with
[68.159] long range bombers, which could actually
[70.08] carry bombs that you dropped out of the
[72.0] plane. This is what you're seeing in the
[73.52] 40s. And when the US is now building a
[76.4] whole series of like plutonium bombs
[78.799] that are anywhere from 10 to 100 times
[81.759] more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb,
[83.84] the thought was the delusion was that
[86.32] the Soviet Union was going to be 15 or
[88.479] 20 years out before they were even going
[90.159] to be able to get their first well they
[92.24] come and test their first atomic bomb in
[94.52] 1949. So now it accelerates. We move to
[98.079] from long range bombers into
[100.799] intermediate range missiles and start
[102.88] deploying those reform. So then we began
[105.04] to forward deployment of intermediate
[106.96] range missiles and then the Soviet Union
[109.92] headed by cruise shift. They
[111.28] reciprocated and they started building
[113.6] launch sites in Cuba. You know because
[115.759] by this time the Cuman revolution ca
[118.079] Castro's overthrown Batista who was our
[120.64] dictator puppet who was running Cuba.
[123.2] Castro takes over and pretty much
[126.32] nationalizes everything and pisses a
[128.319] bunch of people off. This is what led
[130.64] the CIA to pressuring Kennedy to oversee
[133.76] an attack on Cuba. So, this was this
[136.239] failed Bay of Pig story. That's a whole
[138.48] another interesting chapter, but that
[140.239] was a major turning point for Kennedy.
[142.72] This is a fact.

Title: From Vietnam to Now
[0.0] in the early 20th century. What was life
[1.92] like during the wartime? What was life
[3.679] like during the depression? I'm old
[5.92] enough to remember my dad bringing home
[8.639] our first ever television media even
[11.28] then was becoming corrupt, but it was
[13.04] way more honest and authentic than it is
[15.28] now. Yeah. By the time I got to the
[17.199] teenage years, I could turn on the
[19.359] evening news and you you had video
[21.52] footage of the Vietnam War. Do you turn
[24.4] on now the TV or anything? And well, I
[27.92] guess you can because people do post
[29.599] now. Mainstream media, you're not going
[31.359] to turn on any mainstream media and see
[34.0] a dispatch that came out from a free
[36.0] roving journalist or reporter uploading
[39.12] stuff from that day or the few days
[40.96] before of actual battle scenes,
[43.12] fighting, shooting going on, Marines or
[45.6] soldiers carrying their dead comrades
[47.36] out of battle. No, you didn't see any of
[49.12] that. Now you don't on mainstream media.
[51.84] They don't show that because coming out
[53.52] of the Vietnam War, the idea was they
[55.92] wanted to get control of the narrative.
[58.079] So the first thing they did was they
[59.76] shifted from being able to have free
[61.92] roaming journalists and photographers
[65.04] and things who could go anywhere without
[68.24] restraint for the most part to having
[70.32] embedded journalists which meant that
[72.88] you go where we assign you with what
[75.119] group and we have the power now to
[78.479] censor anything that comes out. So all
[81.36] of that came as part of the postVietnam
[84.159] and it was called um the Vietnam
[86.159] syndrome. If you hear that the Vietnam
[88.24] syndrome was because of the free roaming
[90.88] media that was a huge major influence on
[94.96] turning public opinion against the war
[97.2] because you could turn your television
[98.479] on. There it was right there. And then
[100.32] of course on top of that was the draft.

Title: How Climate Shaped Human Civilization
[0.08] Wait a minute. Are you going to say that
[1.439] that 3,000 years of early holysine
[3.919] warmer than now was an optimum? No. We
[7.04] better get that word optimum out of
[8.72] there and make it the hipsothermal. I'm
[10.96] going to stick with the climatic
[12.16] optimum. I like it. So immediate
[14.32] aftermath of the the younger dest you
[16.56] said like the the full glacial which was
[18.8] on its way out. They were receding,
[21.039] right? Suddenly came back at the
[23.199] beginning of the younger dest, right? So
[25.119] we have to endure this another 1300
[27.199] years of bitter cold before the whole
[28.96] thing is finally over. The glaciers can
[31.439] melt back, sea level can rise, stabilize
[34.0] coastlines worldwide, right? And only
[35.92] then are you going to be able to
[37.12] establish coastal communities, not only
[39.52] dependent upon the sea, but now having
[41.2] an incentive to actually go out into
[44.0] this monster. Yeah. And only when you've
[47.6] got stable coastline are you going to
[49.76] now be able to create stable communities
[52.64] that are exploiting the resources, the
[54.64] marine resources. And because of their
[56.96] exploitation of marine resources, of
[58.879] course, they're going to start venturing
[60.48] back out into the sea itself via
[62.879] whatever kind of boat or whatever they
[64.72] happen to be using. And what seems that
[66.4] they were initially using was boats of
[68.72] made out of papyrus reeds in both
[71.36] eastern and western hemispheres. We see
[72.96] it in in the tiger Euphrates and we see
[75.2] it in South America. 3 or 4 thousand
[77.6] years has to pass during which what's
[79.84] the human population doing? It's being
[82.24] fruitful and multiplying. That's what
[83.84] it's one of my favorite things. Yeah, I
[85.6] I know. So that's why I use every
[87.92] opportunity to bring the subject

Title: Teton Dam Collapse & the Lake Bonneville Flood Breakout -Kosmographia ep 112 Randall Carlson Podcast
[1.42] [Music]
[20.1] [Music]
[30.56] Hello and welcome back.
[33.239] Cosmography Randall Carlson podcast.
[35.84] We're going to do it again. We got
[38.399] normal guy Mike with us this time.
[40.239] Welcome back, Mike. And hello, Randall.
[42.96] Hello,
[44.44] Brad. Hello, Mike. Randall. Brad, good
[48.48] to see you guys after such a long
[50.32] hiatus.
[52.16] Been years.
[54.48] It's been years, hasn't it? Well, been
[57.36] been about a year, I guess. I think it's
[58.96] been just over a year since we had Mike
[61.039] with us. Yeah. The last one was uh back
[63.52] at the end of October 111 we did with
[66.479] Jordan and Johanna.
[68.88] Uhhuh. Yep. So, let's do it again here.
[71.76] We got a we got a tour coming up. Uh
[74.479] area behind me is one of the stops out
[76.56] on the Snake River in southern Idaho. Uh
[78.96] so, we got a couple things we're going
[80.24] to talk to talk about that. And uh
[84.04] Randall has been writing uh probably 15
[87.759] years ago. I don't know, man. When did
[89.119] you write that stuff about the Teton Dam
[91.04] failure from
[92.439] 1976? We're going to go out and see
[94.4] that, too. It's a bit of a dog leg, but
[96.88] uh we want to get you there. I've been
[98.32] there and flying the drone. So, I've got
[100.0] some photos I'm hoping we'll get a
[101.759] chance to show tonight and uh let you
[104.079] talk about the Teton Dam failure in
[106.479] relation to our tour coming up. Yeah,
[109.119] the Teton Dam, just to to give a little
[112.0] context, was uh the last great
[114.64] monumental dam failure in in America.
[118.24] And there was the last monumental dam
[120.719] built by the Army Corps of Engineers.
[123.36] And there has been not an attempt to
[125.92] build that scale of a dam since then,
[128.959] since that failure. And we're going to
[130.399] look at that and kind of talk about why
[132.56] it failed and what we could be able to
[135.12] what we have learned from that with
[136.72] respect to floods, breakout floods
[139.44] because some of the lessons uh to be
[142.319] derived from the study of that event uh
[145.84] go directly to uh giving insight into
[149.2] even the bigger events that we're always
[150.8] talking about the mega floods because
[153.44] anyway it was kind of its own mega flood
[156.319] you know and it caused some serious
[158.4] damage. We're going to look at that. So,
[160.879] but there's been a lot of other things
[162.319] going on. Yeah, I was just going to say
[164.4] something really surprising happened and
[166.319] that should be applied to the Cordieran
[170.08] mega floods also. Uh, and we'll get into
[172.56] that. Yeah. Where where did a lot of the
[175.68] volume of the water go after that lake
[177.76] busted through the dam on the Teton
[179.84] River? So, yeah, get get to that after
[182.159] the break. Uh, we may sprinkle in some
[183.92] stuff. Like I said, I've got some photos
[185.68] for my drone, but yeah, you want to
[188.0] catch up uh anything been going on? I
[190.159] know you did a sacred geometry course uh
[193.36] back at the end of February and you've
[195.2] been doing Squaring the Circle, started
[197.92] the Big Picture podcast. So, yeah,
[200.159] staying busy in that new studio you got
[202.64] there. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that was, you
[204.64] know, had to make the, you know, made
[206.159] the investment. So, gota gota, you know,
[209.36] make it pay for itself. But, you know,
[211.12] that was the whole point was to build a
[212.959] studio and then to be able to start
[215.519] putting out content and stimulate some
[218.08] interest and some um, you know, grow the
[221.92] the network of people that are
[224.319] interconnecting that's forming around
[226.64] alternative paradigms of of our world,
[230.08] which is important to happen right now.
[232.959] We might mention that Russ and Kyle are
[236.159] now in Turkey. Are they in Turkey now?
[238.879] Have they left Egypt? They've gone to
[240.239] Turkey. They finished up the Egypt tour.
[243.04] Uh had had that conference going on in
[245.519] between. Uh they they had some off days
[249.36] there and uh yeah, then went to Turkey.
[251.2] So that it might be might be the last
[253.519] day of it actually.
[256.0] And then yeah, they've announced they're
[257.519] going with Uncharted Xband down to Peru
[260.799] the end of the year. Uh overlaps the
[263.759] time we're going to Azor. So I'm not
[265.36] going to be able to do both of those,
[266.479] but uh yeah, that's awesome. That's
[268.16] definitely really high on my list. Get
[270.24] down to Peru.
[272.32] Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's high on my list
[274.56] as well. Yeah, those guys staying real
[276.639] busy.
[278.88] Well, we miss them. I guess they uh some
[281.759] point though they need to take a break
[283.28] to earn some money, don't they? Or are
[285.6] did it turns out that they're
[287.36] independently wealthy and we just didn't
[289.199] know it?
[291.28] Well, they made they made one hell of an
[293.72] album. I tell you what, that was really,
[296.479] really impressive music. And uh we went
[298.479] down for the Eclipse to Texas and they
[302.16] performed as a band through the whole
[305.28] procession record. And uh really
[308.24] impressive, really awesome. And uh I
[310.56] think they've done well selling selling
[312.639] their music. And uh Wow. Kyle's Kyle
[315.12] sent me half a dozen songs uh already
[317.52] putting together for the next one. So
[319.199] yeah, they're they're a rock and roll
[321.52] band, man.
[323.24] Well, okay. I know there's a lot of rock
[325.68] and roll bands out there and I really
[327.199] like their music and I miss that we
[329.44] didn't have their music music for the
[331.4] intro. Unless that's something we can
[334.32] slide in there later, right? Oh, it's
[336.479] certainly going to be added in. But
[337.84] yeah, we got to the point where uh yeah,
[341.12] Kyle would just play that to kind of set
[342.88] the set the mode uh and and get Russ to
[346.479] do the the timely
[348.36] intro. Yep, we missed that. That was
[350.8] that was good for 108 episodes.
[354.96] 108. So does that mean this is 109?
[358.8] No, we did one with Chuck. We did one
[360.96] with Johanna and Jordan. So this is 112.
[364.639] This is 112.
[367.16] 112. Uhhuh.
[369.68] B. Bam. Yeah.
[373.52] Just after the full moon here. A lot of
[376.479] astronomical astrological stuff going
[378.479] on. I've definitely paid a lot more
[380.08] attention to that uh in the past year or
[383.4] so. The effects of being at the Monroe
[386.88] Institute last summer. Uh Oh, really?
[389.039] Yeah. Definitely. I meant to ask you
[391.199] about that. What uh really kind of
[392.96] having an effect and uh penetrating uh
[395.52] the things that went on there, I
[397.68] imagine. So um yeah, so right right
[400.96] after that um well not right after that
[403.44] but uh yeah just got deeply back into uh
[408.72] my chiong and was meditating more and
[411.6] walking and exercising and I'd sit out
[413.84] on the the railroad tracks there behind
[416.08] my place in in Marshall and watch the
[419.039] river move around as the water level
[421.44] went up and down and just you know it
[423.12] just really slowed the pace
[426.0] uh from the craziness that is the modern
[429.039] world, right? It was just really slowing
[430.639] down and then the flood gushed through.
[434.4] So, yeah, that was a major that disrupt
[438.24] happened, wasn't it? Yeah. So, I didn't
[440.16] do any of that stuff again for three
[441.52] months. Uh Oh, wow. as I was dealing
[443.44] with that. So, getting back into that.
[444.8] But yeah, one thing that I learned uh
[447.039] soon after uh was how it was uh well, we
[451.599] talked about this in in one of the
[453.039] podcast or at least I brought it up that
[454.479] it was
[456.28] one plutonic year since the birthing of
[460.4] America. Oh, 248 years.
[465.28] And that just kind of struck a chord
[467.039] with me that that was interesting. uh
[469.599] you know learning a little bit more
[471.44] about what the planets represent and you
[473.759] know the mass effects on us as a whole
[476.4] not necessarily just an individual and
[478.08] what you're going to do though I'm
[479.68] trying to see where that applies also
[482.16] but uh yeah the the the turmoil and
[485.68] things that are happening with the
[487.199] election that was right right then all
[489.039] the buildup to that and uh yeah right
[491.68] right as Pluto hit the spot where it was
[495.199] when 76 you know America was was formed
[499.52] So yeah, that that kind of nudged me or
[501.84] kicked me into that direction. So I'm
[503.44] listening to a lot of kind of stuff like
[504.8] that. And uh yeah, definitely want to be
[507.68] more aware of the motions in the sky,
[510.319] right? That was like the most important
[512.32] thing for our ancestors for the the long
[517.2] period of of our species, right? Well,
[521.279] we need to work some of that into our
[522.959] Bonavville tour. Well, we are. We are.
[526.24] Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. We're going to
[527.6] be out at uh the Bruno Gorge. Oh, wow.
[531.12] Down near the dam or the the dunes, I
[533.92] mean. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, we're going
[536.32] to we're going to have some nighttime
[537.44] sky viewing for sure in a in a really
[539.6] dark place. Yeah. You know what I
[541.6] remember about the our visit to the
[543.76] Bruno uh dune Bruno gorge?
[548.0] Several things, but what do you
[549.04] remember? Well, what I remember that was
[550.64] most impressive to me was as we're
[552.399] coming up, we're seeing that bank of
[555.56] clouds, right? and and it was like
[558.08] almost serpent-like blank bank of clouds
[560.24] and then realized that the clouds were
[563.44] condensing over the gorge. It was like
[567.279] you had the gorge below and then you had
[568.959] this cloud suous type of cloud following
[572.24] the the gorge. I thought that was imp
[574.24] that stuck with me. I definitely
[576.08] remember that it it matched the shape of
[578.399] the of the canyon. Yeah. No. Would that
[581.68] be mimic the shape? That would be
[585.88] because Okay, because I'm I'm Okay, I'm
[588.959] guessing this would be the explanation.
[591.279] It's the gorge there was how I mean it
[593.92] was enormously deep where we were at 67
[596.56] 800t deep right there. Right there. And
[598.56] it gets deeper than that, doesn't it?
[600.399] Yeah, a little bit. Yeah. So maybe the
[603.2] explanation is that because it's it's
[605.2] cooler down there. you've got this cool
[607.48] air and if if there's air moving down
[610.8] the gorge through the canyon and it it
[613.8] um you know displaces cool air that's
[616.72] already there. Now that moves up into
[619.36] the moist warmer atmosphere. I mean
[622.079] ordinarily you think that cool air would
[623.839] sink which it would unless there are air
[627.36] currents moving which which is possible.
[630.399] We know that that that is can happen
[633.12] that you got these air currents moving
[635.04] through the gorge. Well, then it would
[637.36] explain to me why that cool air that's
[640.399] being forced upward then into the warmer
[642.56] air would
[643.72] condense. Um I don't know if that's the
[646.56] explanation or not. I'm just totally
[648.16] speculating here, but there is obviously
[651.04] an explanation. Yeah, meteorologists
[653.36] could explain that to us, but yeah, this
[655.04] it was near sundown, right? So, it was
[657.36] cooling off already and then the sun
[659.04] would go behind the cloud and that would
[660.959] change the temperature quickly. Uh,
[663.2] yeah, combination all those factors, but
[665.04] it that that definitely stuck with me uh
[667.92] as as you say that. And the other thing
[669.519] was that that eagle that flew by and
[672.64] just kind
[674.76] of turned its head and stared at us as
[677.519] we were we were just standing at the
[679.2] rail looking down into this, you know,
[681.2] this deep chasm, right? And it just was
[683.839] there a rail? Checked us out. Just kind
[685.519] of checked us. Is there a rail? It Well,
[688.24] it was it was pretty abused. Maybe not
[691.36] maybe not at that right spot where the
[693.2] eagle flew by, but uh yeah, I was there.
[696.48] Uh Pat went with me last year on the way
[699.36] to the the gorge tour uh to check it out
[702.399] again. And they have upgraded it like
[704.399] three years ago. So, there's there's new
[706.88] sidewalks and gravel parking and uh the
[711.44] signs that that we were you know, this
[713.44] was 2000, right? This was 25 years ago
[715.6] we went out there, Randall. It's It's
[717.04] pretty crazy to consider that that
[719.36] wasn't 2002.
[722.56] Uh, no. Bonavville was 2000. So, it Wow.
[726.399] So, it uh it kind of got civilized in
[728.959] the interim.
[730.959] Well, partly, but yeah, remember there
[732.88] was that old beatup sign and we drove
[734.88] past it and it said cuz it's a gunning
[737.279] range, right? There's a nearby air force
[739.36] base there at Mountain Home south of
[741.12] Boisey. And uh it was like, you know,
[743.519] objects may fall from the sky.
[746.639] And we're like, should we go any farther
[749.44] here? No, don't run into the guttery
[752.0] range. It's not an active range. Large
[753.92] explosions may be occurring all around
[756.079] you. That's what the sign said. It's
[758.399] really a beautiful site now. So yeah,
[760.24] we're definitely going to go out there
[761.2] and uh you know that that may be at
[763.68] least one of our our star gazing nights
[766.959] there. Yeah. Well, when we do, weather
[769.12] permitting, of course. Yeah. Well, uh my
[772.399] orders in Yeah. The Bruno Canyon. That
[775.36] was impressive. And and so I think that
[777.279] that's a very interesting how that fits
[779.44] into the whole story, which it
[781.839] definitely does. I mean, and what's the
[783.839] other one? I I I've never been able to
[785.6] learn how to pronounce Ohei. Ooh.
[788.399] There's a partner canyon to Bruno that's
[791.839] just as deep, I think.
[795.16] Um, so we are a little farther to the
[797.44] west. Yeah, they're coming out of right
[799.36] the the northern Nevada border there.
[802.68] Yeah. And there So it was a a south to
[805.92] north directed flow, correct? Yes.
[810.88] Yeah, I could probably find that. Yeah,
[813.0] that's that sounds familiar, but you
[816.399] know, lots of more
[818.56] more vowels than consonants. So, it's
[820.24] hard to say, right? Uh yeah, they've
[824.959] actually got a a new that's another
[828.16] thing that's gone up since we were out
[829.36] there. They've got a a little center
[832.48] there at the park at Bruno Dunes for
[836.639] there's there's not a a planetarium or
[839.68] an obser it's maybe it's just an
[841.72] observatory. Um but it's pretty small,
[844.079] but yeah, they've got like a classroom
[845.68] out there. Uh but it it's definitely
[848.079] windy. Uhhuh. Yeah. Um so yeah, we're
[851.76] thinking about trying to set something
[853.76] up, but yeah, it's a as always, it's a
[856.72] pretty full itinerary. So, uh that was
[859.36] one thing that's kind of gotten
[860.72] squeezed, but we'll we'll be out under
[862.24] the stars on our own without having to
[864.8] uh be led by someone that at at that
[867.199] particular park.
[869.6] Okay. Give us some flexibility.
[872.8] So, I did get up the Google map here. I
[876.959] think it might be cool to take a look at
[879.519] it.
[881.24] So, let's see what the paper stuff, man.
[884.639] I still look at my benchmark maps. Yeah,
[887.92] I know. They're Yeah. And it's pretty
[890.48] easy to pick out where we were. Yeah.
[892.88] Let's see here. So, we've got It's two
[895.36] creeks that come together. Uh Oh, Jar
[898.88] the Jarbage Jarbage River. That's one of
[902.16] them. And then the other one, oh, Hot
[904.639] Springs
[906.04] Bench. There's a beach.
[910.24] That's interesting. How do you get
[911.519] across the canyon is the So, this is the
[915.839] I think this I thought you were saying
[917.12] there's a whole another uh another gorge
[919.92] to the west is what I was thinking. Not
[922.16] not two that come together to form the
[924.399] Bruno. Well, I think the Ohei, if I'm
[927.839] saying that right, this might be it over
[929.839] here. Uh, let's see. No, Salmon Falls
[934.0] Creek Falls because we never made it to
[936.8] the Ohei, but uh it's there.
[940.04] Uh, it's one of these. So then, yeah,
[942.639] these are two creeks that come together
[944.56] and then where they come together,
[945.92] that's the
[947.079] Bruno. And there's the Bruno sand. Let's
[951.12] see. The birds of prey
[953.48] area. So, yeah, the dunes.
[957.16] Well, what are you looking for? Well,
[959.6] I'm trying to figure out what is the
[962.24] original erosion that cut this channel.
[966.399] There's Jar Bridge Peak up there. So,
[968.24] that's given the name to the to that
[970.56] branch of the river. And look here,
[972.519] Matterhorn. Let's look at what that
[974.48] looks like.
[977.839] Well, it's not quite as impressive as
[979.92] the Matterhorn in Switzerland. I was
[982.399] going to say that's Switzerland. Yeah.
[984.8] Well, not quite. Not quite.
[989.6] Yeah, Nevada's uh somewhere we haven't
[992.32] really explored too much. That's It's
[994.48] true. So, we're getting the headarters
[996.24] then are in these this mountain range
[998.72] here. Uh and yes, I've looked up the the
[1003.759] name of this mountain range and it
[1005.6] escapes my mind, but I look at there
[1008.079] seems to be a lot of hot springs around
[1009.68] here. Murphy Hot
[1011.24] Springs. We won't get that far south.
[1015.04] Um that's that's down in it. So that's
[1017.44] like
[1019.04] camping trip days. Yeah, I think it's
[1022.079] BLM land. So, uh you can request to set
[1026.16] up your camp out there. We we saw a
[1028.079] woman in a van that was just kind of set
[1030.0] up
[1031.079] uh across across the way on on one of
[1034.24] the one of the bends in the river. Bruno
[1037.52] Canyon Bridge. All right. So, check this
[1042.76] out. We won't get down here, will we?
[1046.72] Probably not. Wouldn't it be enough time
[1049.44] if it bridge? We're talking extra days
[1052.72] already. Yeah. To to
[1055.44] that day. That bridge looks a little
[1057.28] suspicious to me. Little rickety. Yeah.
[1059.84] Yeah. I It's not over the river. It's
[1062.0] over a creek getting to the river. Yeah.
[1063.76] Pass. So, you would think you'd probably
[1066.16] not want to haul a tour bus full of
[1070.24] tourists across that
[1072.6] bridge. Um, no. The tourists better haul
[1076.08] the van. So I look notice somebody has
[1079.28] built a little barricade out of the
[1081.12] cobbles here to prevent tragedy from
[1084.799] happening.
[1087.039] But yeah, so this is part of the So
[1089.84] where were we?
[1092.32] All right. You got to go a good ways
[1094.24] north there. Okay. See that big arc
[1096.16] right there? Right there. Yep. That's
[1098.48] where the That's where the overlook is.
[1101.16] Yeah. Yep.
[1105.44] Oh yeah.
[1108.52] Yep. That's
[1110.6] impressive. Let's see here what we got.
[1112.72] I think Well, and it's going to be May,
[1114.64] so we're going to have some color in
[1116.32] there. When we were there last year,
[1117.84] yeah, it was quite green and uh and
[1119.76] vibrant, you know, wasn't just brown
[1121.679] burn up desert. So, we're going to see
[1124.08] that again hopefully in in May. Coming
[1126.08] up. Yeah. Really, we're we're at a
[1128.08] month. Wow. Okay. So yeah, you can see
[1132.24] how the canyon is suous and so that that
[1136.4] impressive cloud formation that that was
[1138.4] the thing I'd forgotten about the
[1140.12] eagle.
[1142.52] Um but now that you mentioned him, I I
[1145.2] remember him now. He was just kind of
[1146.88] gliding in and hanging out, wasn't he?
[1150.24] Yeah. And just just turned his head over
[1153.28] and just kind of stared at as as he
[1155.2] coasted by, you know, like, "All right,
[1157.6] this is my this is my joint. Who are
[1159.28] these guys?
[1161.679] Okay, so and then the Dune State Park
[1163.76] right there at the top there. You saw
[1165.2] the lake and the little
[1168.88] Okay. And another hot
[1171.4] springs. There are a lot of hot springs
[1175.32] here. Hot springs. Cemetery. Cemetery.
[1178.559] Okay. Seems to go in with basult. Yeah.
[1182.799] Okay. So, here comes the river. Notice
[1184.64] it's just become sort of a look at all
[1186.799] these cut off
[1188.84] meanders. So, okay. So, what you got
[1191.36] here is a big layer of sediment, soft
[1194.24] sediment that was probably laid down.
[1197.28] This is all the, you know, the sand and
[1200.32] small gravel and stuff that was egg
[1203.12] sized from the formation of the Bruno
[1205.919] Canyon. And it's all spled out here. You
[1208.48] see the flat valley floor. And then what
[1211.6] happens here?
[1213.52] We have a little Do we have a a dam down
[1216.0] here? Yeah, there's a dam to the west
[1218.559] there. Yeah. Okay. So, it winds around.
[1220.88] Then we get back to the snake.
[1224.24] Boy, there's some interesting landscapes
[1226.0] in here.
[1228.64] Yeah. We're going to drive across
[1230.4] several of them. Yes, we are.
[1236.039] So, as we've covered and talked about
[1239.44] fairly in depth is that, you know, this
[1242.08] whole canyon here, all of this here is
[1244.0] the uh the byproduct of a peak flood
[1247.84] discharge of about 40 million cubic feet
[1250.32] per second,
[1252.52] which is about onetenth the magnitude
[1256.559] roughly of the big flows in the uh
[1259.84] channel
[1261.08] scablands, but it's still mind-blowingly
[1264.88] powerful when you see the effects and
[1267.039] know what you're looking at. You see the
[1269.28] boulder deposits and the gigantic gravel
[1271.76] bars and and you realize, okay, so this
[1274.159] is what 40 million cubic feet per second
[1276.32] can do. What's 400 million cubic feet
[1279.28] per second going to do?
[1283.039] So, so we got some photos of that, too.
[1285.12] So, yeah, we're going to be covering
[1286.24] that territory. Snake River goes across
[1288.96] the the plane of southern Idaho.
[1293.12] So yeah, five, six days with us coming
[1295.52] up and uh midmay here. So couple seats
[1299.44] left. Definitely check the description
[1301.52] if you think you can jump in uh last
[1304.24] minute with us. Well, let's uh just look
[1307.039] here at We're going to
[1309.32] start we'll start here out of uh Salt
[1312.64] Lake City. Is that the deal? That's
[1314.64] right. Yes. Yeah. So we'll gather in
[1317.44] Salt Lake City and then we will head
[1320.24] north. And what we should mention is
[1322.84] that this is the Great Salt Lake, but
[1326.08] the Great Salt Lake Basin,
[1328.64] uh, the terminal Ice Age Lake filled all
[1331.84] of these valleys here. And all of this
[1333.679] flat again is is the sediment, the
[1335.919] aluvium that was laid down in the lake
[1338.88] bottom. And then what we're going to do
[1341.76] is there was a breakout point right up
[1345.96] here. And this is Highway 15 right now.
[1350.679] follows the breakout of the floodwaters.
[1354.48] And let's see, Red Rock Pass would be
[1358.72] Yeah, right under that 91 there. Yeah,
[1361.28] right under the Yeah, right in here.
[1363.36] There it is. Right there. So, that Swan
[1365.039] Lake. Yeah, there it is. There's the
[1366.96] breakout point. Yeah, Red Rock Junction.
[1369.84] So, there was this was infilled with uh
[1374.159] a softer sedimentary rock through here.
[1376.88] And this was like the northernmost tip
[1379.52] of the lake was right here. And then it
[1382.4] backed up all the way down through this
[1385.24] arm all the way back down into here and
[1388.88] filled this basin. And right here where
[1391.28] we start out in Salt Lake City, the
[1393.2] water was just right up almost 1,000 ft
[1397.36] deep. And then it uh came up here. And
[1402.4] when this when this soft
[1405.159] rock dam failed
[1408.559] uh right in here, the water began to
[1410.96] gush out. And and you can see this
[1412.96] eroded terrain because this was the main
[1414.72] passage for the discharge of the water
[1416.64] right here. And when we go through,
[1419.52] let's see. Well, that would I'm guessing
[1421.679] this is probably red rock right here.
[1424.4] Yeah, that's the little red red rock but
[1426.4] there. Yeah, red rock button. The red
[1428.64] rock but is about 300 ft high and it
[1431.12] marks a remnant of the pre flood
[1436.0] sedimentary rock dam. So this piece
[1438.799] right here would have been continuous
[1440.48] with this whole layer from here across
[1443.039] over to here. And so this breach allowed
[1447.36] about 40 million cubic feet per second
[1449.679] to discharge through. And the water
[1452.08] level the lake dropped about 350 ft. the
[1455.76] the water level
[1457.48] essentially dropped just about the same
[1460.24] amount as the uh as the but is high and
[1464.96] then when it gets to the bottom of the
[1467.039] but now there's sediment laying on top
[1469.36] of it but right under all this is is a
[1471.52] hard granite sill. So, the water level
[1474.64] dropped until it hit that sill and then
[1477.36] it stabilized. And when we go out of uh
[1481.279] Salt Lake, we'll be able to see the two
[1483.84] shorelines that were etched into the
[1485.6] sides of the mountains. Um yeah, right
[1488.24] there at Brigham City, we're going to
[1489.6] make a stop. Okay. Yeah, right here. Cuz
[1492.96] that uh Yeah, we're probably not going
[1495.52] to be able to no time to divert around
[1498.24] Bear Lake,
[1500.36] unfortunately. because we're going a
[1502.72] long way day one to be able to see the
[1505.039] uh uh to get up to the Teton Dam site.
[1508.4] Yeah, it's really a dog lag. I'll tell
[1510.0] you what. Um we we have or you have
[1512.88] covered this. Do you know I recently
[1515.52] posted an archive that we did we tried
[1518.159] uh 2017. So there was an hour of you
[1520.64] going through this whole path and then
[1522.96] you did one of your big picture episodes
[1526.0] that you focused on the bottom of. Do
[1527.44] you know the title of that one? We need
[1528.96] to we need to pop that in the
[1530.4] description too. people can get the
[1531.84] details. But um
[1535.36] yeah, I think that was the second one we
[1537.12] did. Uh like the greatest story never
[1539.36] told is part two or something. I think
[1541.279] that's part three. Um I can easily find
[1544.559] out and we can post it in the show notes
[1547.76] or something.
[1549.76] Yep. Well, let me let me uh let me show
[1552.08] you something that I would did playing
[1553.6] around yesterday. Okay, follow we can
[1556.799] follow that same path. So yeah, if you
[1558.559] stop a share. Let me see if I can share
[1560.4] this
[1561.48] thing. Uh screen two. No, there's no
[1567.799] audio. All right. You see in this low
[1570.08] angle? Yep. So we are going
[1574.279] into Red Rock Pass right there. So we're
[1577.279] just just barely over the Idaho border
[1580.24] from Utah going
[1582.12] north like we said, Route Route 91.
[1586.24] So, let's see if we can get this. And
[1588.08] we're looking north here. Yep. Going
[1590.32] north. So, we're following Route 91
[1592.159] north through Red Rock
[1598.36] Pass. Right. So, right where the road is
[1601.2] straight right
[1604.679] here. That's That's our little red rock
[1608.64] but there. Where is it? Back back up for
[1611.12] us
[1613.48] there. Yep. right along here.
[1617.039] Oh, okay. Right. Oh, okay. Yeah. So,
[1620.32] we're looking deep into the distance,
[1621.84] right? We got the horizon out there. So,
[1623.36] we're gonna go we're gonna ride on down
[1625.919] and and follow this this valley. That
[1628.24] was the breakout. And you can see a bit
[1630.08] of a channel. Yeah. In the inner
[1632.48] channel. So, see right here, that's
[1634.32] where we join up with the interstate.
[1636.0] So, this is I-15 coming north
[1639.64] here. And then it's going to do this dog
[1642.08] leg, right? That Yeah. Uh, Inkham is the
[1644.799] little town and then it goes through
[1647.36] follows the Port Nof River. Let's see.
[1653.12] That dog leg is interesting there. Pause
[1655.76] right there for a second. And then you
[1657.279] got that little tributary coming in from
[1659.44] over on the right. Coming in from the
[1661.919] northeast. Yeah. So, that's what I was
[1664.4] going to say. It It seems like it's the
[1666.64] first wave must have It totally looks
[1669.36] like it had to push through here. Mhm.
[1672.0] The momentum of that water is coming
[1673.679] straight in that direction. So, a lot of
[1675.679] it made the turn, but it looks like it
[1678.08] had to flow through here also. Yeah,
[1681.679] that was exactly what I was thinking as
[1683.279] I was seeing that. This is very helpful.
[1686.64] Yeah. And I stopped there and flew the
[1688.32] drone there, too. So, I got some good
[1689.679] shots of And then down there, you look
[1691.679] just to the left, you really almost see
[1693.2] that scabland like erosion with that
[1695.919] escarment there down right here. Yeah,
[1699.679] right there. And in down below that come
[1701.679] down. Yeah, this is this is like a
[1703.2] basalt cliff right next to the highway.
[1705.2] So that's really impressive right there.
[1707.12] You drive right by it. Yeah, I can just
[1710.159] I can do this manually, I guess, versus
[1712.399] playing and pausing.
[1714.679] Okay, then we come and then it breaks
[1716.96] through the hills right there. Right. So
[1719.36] you got this little breakout point,
[1721.44] right? Port Newf Pass. It's the Port NF
[1724.0] River. And then and then look at this.
[1726.799] Yeah. Got a big sand quarry over there.
[1730.0] So that's, you know, looks like looks
[1732.32] like pretty sizable delta right there.
[1734.399] Right out right outside the the break.
[1737.08] Can that'd be interesting to go into the
[1739.6] visit the sand quarry, but probably
[1741.44] there's definitely definitely.
[1744.32] All right. And into the the pathway is
[1746.24] pretty obvious through there. Yeah. So
[1748.96] we're getting out into Pocutello.
[1755.279] And by the way, when the uh when the
[1757.6] flood waters were gushing out through
[1759.52] that aperture in the hills there, uh the
[1761.84] town of Pocutello was not there. So was
[1765.039] in case anybody was wondering. Right.
[1766.88] Okay. So you got the Snake River coming
[1768.64] out of Yellowstone.
[1770.64] Uh and then over in over in Wyoming,
[1773.279] right? So it's in Idaho. So this is
[1774.799] American Falls Reservoir that Interstate
[1778.159] 86 travels along. So we're going to take
[1780.0] that route. There's there's the dam
[1782.88] there. Uh-huh. So then you've got a bit
[1785.2] of a a channel starting up in this broad
[1788.24] valley and then way back here, right?
[1790.08] This is your lava field. That's craters
[1791.84] of the moon. Craters of the moon. Yeah.
[1794.24] Now mentioned that this green area, this
[1797.039] at the peak of the flood, you can
[1799.2] actually see this transition from the
[1801.2] green uh agricultural land into the
[1804.32] brown. That was the the the width. That
[1807.12] was the shoreline. That would have been
[1808.96] the maximum northern shoreline of the of
[1811.44] the flood as it's passing through here.
[1813.679] It was not confined to the channel. But
[1816.399] like all floods, we've talked about this
[1818.48] so much. Often times they will start out
[1820.399] as a sheet flow. But undoubtedly there
[1823.44] would have been some kind of a pre flood
[1825.36] Snake River valley or channel there that
[1829.039] would have been exploited by the water.
[1831.44] But initially whatever was there was not
[1834.32] capable of handling the full capacity.
[1836.96] So the water spread out over the whole
[1839.52] plane that you can see right here. So it
[1842.559] would have been completely submerged
[1844.32] down where your where your cursor is
[1846.0] now. And it would have been completely
[1847.48] submerged all the way up to where that
[1849.679] transition took place takes place up
[1851.76] there from from green checkered
[1854.159] agricultural fields south. Yeah. Behind
[1856.48] us there's a a range of mountains. So
[1859.039] that would have held it on the south
[1860.24] side. But yeah, like you said, it it
[1862.159] expanded a good ways. I don't know if
[1864.039] that's, you know, tens tens of miles
[1868.24] possibly out here. 20 20 some miles. Uh
[1871.76] yeah, this is about the end of this. So,
[1873.2] we
[1874.52] just follow the river down to uh what
[1878.48] was called Massacre Rocks when we were
[1881.44] there. They don't identify it as that
[1883.36] anymore.
[1885.039] Why? Because right here along the river.
[1886.64] So, that's going to be one of our stops
[1888.32] right there. Uhhuh. Right. And then with
[1890.96] the terrain, you can see it better, but
[1892.64] you've got this outlet where, you know,
[1895.84] obviously the water was at least 100 ft
[1898.0] higher. Yep. To to cut this and spread
[1900.88] out that way. So, yeah. So, that is a
[1904.48] dis distribute distribu.
[1909.12] There you go. Yes. Because it goes off
[1910.96] the main trunk. But you can see like
[1914.88] right up there there's a there's a a a
[1917.32] cataract at the top end of it right
[1919.84] there. Yeah. Up in here. Yes. So you had
[1923.2] water
[1924.2] flowing out of the Snake River Canyon
[1927.919] and then you had water flowing surface
[1930.399] flow that cut this here, this feature
[1932.88] that you were just hovering over,
[1936.08] right? Yep. Okay. So that's that's one
[1939.08] section of the of the outbreak. So
[1942.32] that's that's the end. That's something
[1943.6] I was just playing around with how to
[1946.0] fly through these and record. You use a
[1948.24] screen recorder, right? Yeah. Yeah. All
[1951.519] right.
[1953.36] Yeah, that's a that's a great tool. I
[1955.2] gota I confess. So I've got So I've got
[1958.0] one, but it's it's really slow. I did
[1960.159] one from here then all the way over to
[1963.519] Clearwater um at at Lewon and Clarkston.
[1967.039] I follow the snake all the way over
[1968.559] there. Aha. Okay. But yeah, we won't do
[1971.36] that. But yeah, just just playing. I get
[1973.6] lost in Google Earth.
[1976.88] Yeah, I'm gonna Yeah, we're gonna we're
[1978.399] going to do this
[1981.559] occasionally. Have different people on.
[1983.6] Uh Oh, yeah. Mike, you didn't you didn't
[1987.36] get up here with me. Uh you're about
[1989.36] ready for a road trip, aren't you?
[1994.44] Um I'd love a road trip, but I'm not
[1996.88] sure I can do it anytime soon.
[1999.6] All right. All right. I'm scanning over
[2002.24] here. Massacre rocks. So, is this a new
[2006.559] visitor center? What is this?
[2010.799] They were working on the parking lots. I
[2012.799] don't remember that they were working on
[2013.919] the visitor center, but yeah, it's
[2015.679] probably something different than 25
[2017.2] years ago. Yeah, they were they were
[2018.96] cleaning up the campground and uh yeah,
[2020.799] it's a pretty extensive park. It is. It
[2023.039] is. So, this is a big So, this is like a
[2026.64] huge deposit of stuff that you, you
[2029.36] know, you'll see when we get there. Um,
[2032.08] it's
[2033.0] uh pretty impressive boulder field. Uh,
[2036.559] look, they're still calling it Massacre
[2038.24] Rocks here. Uh, okay. Yeah, on the other
[2041.519] side, huh? But not the park.
[2044.48] Let's see. Okay. So, there's some
[2046.84] boulders to differentiate from the
[2050.359] foliage. When you pull out, sometimes
[2052.639] it's hard to tell. Well, there's a big
[2054.72] truck on the highway there. Uhhuh. Yep.
[2058.399] Yep. Okay. Well, that says Massacre
[2059.919] Rocks, too. So, yeah, I haven't seen it.
[2061.919] My map hasn't been coming up that way.
[2063.919] Huh. Well, you know what? I'm looking at
[2066.079] Google Maps. And then on Google Earth, I
[2068.32] don't have any of that. I don't have any
[2069.679] of the labels on. It's just the It's
[2071.76] just Oh, yeah. the images.
[2075.52] So, this will be following this route
[2077.919] right here.
[2081.48] We're we've got you've scheduled we're
[2083.839] going to do a stop right here so that
[2085.359] people can run a run laps if they want
[2089.2] and then
[2091.079] um kind of flattens out, doesn't it?
[2093.76] Before it gets spectacular again, right
[2096.32] before you get to Twin Falls gets pretty
[2098.64] dramatic again. But what is all this?
[2101.2] Could this all be alovvium? Just piles
[2103.04] of
[2103.72] alovvium. See, you know, when you're
[2105.599] traveling, there's so much stuff off the
[2107.119] road that you don't see.
[2112.119] Uh but yeah, and then it gets
[2114.079] interesting again when we get uh let's
[2116.079] see. So we would have a dam right there.
[2117.76] What dam is
[2119.8] this? Not sure about that one.
[2123.72] Okay. Then below the dam, it starts
[2126.32] getting rather spectacular again. Hey,
[2128.16] look at this. A streamlined erosional
[2132.839] residual right there. There it
[2135.88] is. Look, another one.
[2141.079] more. Okay. Well, it's going to be a
[2143.839] hell of a trip. I can say tell you that.
[2145.76] And this is just part of it that we've
[2147.359] looked at here. That's Lake
[2149.96] Walcott. I don't know if that's the name
[2151.92] of the dam, but there is a park down
[2153.359] there at that western end. Yeah. Lake
[2155.68] Walcott.
[2157.2] Oh, down here. No, up here. The one you
[2160.4] ask about? Yes.
[2163.0] Okay. So, what is Lake Walcott known
[2165.839] for?
[2170.88] Wow, look at this. Randle talking about
[2173.52] it on episode
[2175.4] [Laughter]
[2179.88] 112. And yeah. Okay. And then we end up
[2183.28] this ends up going up here to Hell's
[2187.8] Canyon. And that's about how far we're
[2190.16] going to take it, right?
[2192.48] No, we're going to we're going to stay
[2194.8] at Boisey though. southeast end of
[2197.44] Boisey where the airport is and down
[2200.0] that's getting closer to the uh the
[2203.92] Bruno Canyon and also Okay, the Swanf
[2207.04] Falls Dam is is just south of there. So,
[2210.64] yeah, we're not going to get any farther
[2212.16] west. Well, I will enjoy getting back to
[2214.64] Boise. I like
[2216.68] Boise when we were there before. So,
[2220.0] this is an the interesting area right
[2222.4] here. So Snake River goes right up along
[2226.16] this this
[2227.4] canyon is is forms the rim the the
[2231.04] eastern rim of this feature right here.
[2235.04] And that is ultimately the area where
[2238.079] all of the basalt flows originated that
[2242.16] created the Colombia basalt plateau
[2244.16] which is all of
[2246.599] this. So, and let's see. It looks like
[2250.64] the other isn't it the other end of the
[2252.079] like the Yellowstone?
[2254.079] Well, yeah. Yellowstone. This is
[2255.52] Yellowstone Lake right here. And this is
[2257.599] the curve that this is the curve, you
[2260.48] know. Yeah. Okay. You can follow that
[2262.88] curve like this right around like this.
[2265.68] Yeah. Okay. And then all the way up and
[2267.76] that's the Snake River. flows out and
[2270.72] meets the Colombia right there at uh
[2272.88] Lewon and Clarkston where Tam Bar is
[2275.68] that we've visited several times and we
[2278.96] Brad made special arrangements to get us
[2281.119] in and and we were given a tour of the
[2284.4] big gravel quarry there which was very
[2287.52] very interesting to me. That was that
[2289.76] was so worth it. Yeah, that was
[2290.96] excellent. Yeah, it was excellent. It
[2293.119] really was. And that was only day one.
[2295.359] Yeah. And that was only day one. set the
[2297.52] bar high on that tour. Yeah.
[2301.96] Yeah. So, uh uh what else is news is we
[2307.359] had a really great sacred geometry
[2309.44] retreat
[2311.119] up at Buraba Springs assembly and uh we
[2315.28] had 54 seats. We were sold out. It was
[2318.64] really we had a Friday night lecture, a
[2320.72] Saturday all day learning to draw
[2323.56] hands-on and then Sunday we had a couple
[2326.56] of uh Sunday right we took the field
[2328.72] trip
[2330.4] right we went to uh all visit all sage
[2334.32] chapel in Sani well that hosts the
[2339.359] university of the south which is
[2342.0] considered to have one of the most
[2343.359] beautiful campuses of any college in in
[2346.88] the United states and having visited it
[2350.079] now three times, I can concur. I can see
[2353.44] why it would be I'll vouch for that,
[2356.0] too. Yeah. Yeah. So, um we we went and
[2359.76] we we toured the chapel. I'll mentioned
[2361.92] that the chapel uh long story there. We
[2364.48] won't get into that in in this episode
[2366.64] talking about the backstory on that. Um
[2369.599] but, uh it was a long process. It
[2372.079] started pre- civil war and then actually
[2374.079] finished
[2375.4] up 1950s was it? I think it was 1950s.
[2380.32] But it was inspired the ar the primary
[2382.4] architect on the project was inspired by
[2384.72] chart cathedral and
[2386.28] amians and he carried some of that in
[2389.2] some of the proportioning and the the
[2390.8] the the rose windows and things. It very
[2394.16] beautiful impressive piece of work. Um
[2397.44] then we left there. We went to the
[2400.079] campus of the uh University of the South
[2402.88] and we met Carolyn Hogland who is the uh
[2408.079] the farm manager because they have a
[2410.4] whole regenerative farm program there,
[2412.8] an agricultural program that they do.
[2415.359] And so she was gracious enough to take
[2418.079] us on a tour, explain to us their
[2420.56] workings and the greenhouse. and you
[2422.88] know it's all pretty much run by the
[2424.56] students at the college and uh that was
[2427.839] very interesting. Then we got to go and
[2430.24] hang out with the goats and uh that was
[2433.839] really that was probably the uh
[2435.839] highlight of the whole weekend was
[2437.44] hanging with the goats. Goat hugging.
[2439.92] Goat. Yeah. Everybody enjoyed that. Goat
[2442.48] hugging. Yes. And there Well, a bunch of
[2444.64] us learned that even the females can
[2446.56] have can have horns. That was a big
[2448.32] question going around when we showed up.
[2450.88] Yeah. Well, not a farm person. All
[2454.0] right. Yeah. Well, uh, yes, the females
[2457.92] can have horns. We we learned that. Um,
[2460.64] y
[2462.24] but they were they were friendly. They
[2463.92] liked hanging out with humans and, uh,
[2466.8] like the attention and, uh, that was a
[2470.72] lot of fun. But, so it it was it was a a
[2473.2] really good weekend. And we are going to
[2476.16] do a level two next fall. We're planning
[2479.839] it so it doesn't
[2482.839] confuse that and and watch the live
[2485.44] stream and do the exercises from that.
[2487.68] Absolutely. Yeah, that's available too.
[2490.16] Yeah, that would be go to how.com. We've
[2493.04] got it. We we live streamed it, recorded
[2495.04] the whole thing. And so, uh, if people
[2499.599] have purchased that, which, you know,
[2501.92] you can do it at home, purchase it,
[2504.8] watch it at home, do it with the whole
[2506.48] family because we kind of oriented it
[2508.4] with the idea that something that that
[2511.04] there's enough information in your basic
[2513.52] information that you it would be
[2515.119] valuable for you, you know, students who
[2516.88] need to learn geometry, you know, who
[2518.8] are doing a a curriculum. So kind of the
[2521.119] idea in mind was make this uh valuable
[2524.96] or functional to homeschoolers and uh so
[2528.88] anyways yeah the that we've got now
[2531.04] we've got two versions of the level one.
[2533.28] We've got the one we did a couple of
[2534.64] years ago in Nashville. We got this
[2536.88] there's a lot of overlap but there's
[2539.28] also some distinctions between them that
[2541.2] are I think valuable and so somebody can
[2543.44] actually buy the two bundled together.
[2545.92] Um and it's a it's a really good deal.
[2548.16] Oh that's good. Well, yeah. In any any
[2550.16] lecture you give, there's always wide
[2552.96] variety of things that you pull in.
[2554.56] There's obviously definite points that
[2556.48] you want to hit each time to get across
[2558.64] the point to the class, but um yeah,
[2560.96] everyone's unique. So, uh there's what,
[2565.04] three different lectures there. Uh you
[2567.68] went you went past 11 o'clock one of the
[2569.76] nights still drawing. U I guess we did.
[2573.04] Oh, yeah. It was a full it was a full
[2574.4] weekend.
[2576.56] So, that would interrupted there. You
[2578.72] said you're going to do a level two. Um,
[2581.04] are you going to are you going to try to
[2582.4] get another level one class in? do
[2584.72] something in Atlanta or Asheville or
[2586.64] something where Well, I'm open, but I
[2588.24] don't think we're gonna need I mean,
[2590.16] with the uh you know, with the number of
[2593.28] uh you know, sales of the I think we've
[2596.319] got enough people out there and I'm I'm
[2598.72] putting together some bonus material
[2600.48] that's going to go out to anybody who
[2602.8] was inhouse seats or who bought the the
[2605.599] live stream or the after market live
[2608.56] stream, you know, which is recorded,
[2610.0] which you can buy and then you'll get a
[2611.68] downloadable file and you can get the
[2613.44] whole
[2614.64] Um so anybody who does that um yeah I
[2618.88] mean because it's going to pick up did
[2620.64] the online one can still yes qualify to
[2624.16] participate in level two without being
[2626.319] there in person. Well, yeah. Okay. You
[2627.92] got you got a Yeah. a viable audience to
[2630.8] to fill that course, too. That Yeah,
[2633.68] it's going to be at the Bursha. It ought
[2635.28] to be really nice time of year to be
[2637.2] there, you know, in the early fall. And,
[2640.48] uh, we're already planning a field trip
[2643.04] to a nearby
[2645.079] observatory. So, I'm looking into see
[2647.28] what's going on astronomically while
[2649.359] we're there. Uh, see if there's going to
[2651.2] be anything special. But, um, yeah,
[2654.16] Rowan setting that up. Uh, it's going to
[2656.72] be Yeah, we do actually. I mean, we've
[2658.56] reserved Rowan's not here, but uh, it's
[2660.8] in September. Pre-announced, but teasing
[2664.16] that it's this fall. It'll be in
[2666.319] September. Yeah. Okay. We've reserved a
[2668.72] block of rooms there and the and the the
[2671.2] big meeting hall uh, like we did before.
[2674.0] Um, and I forget which weekend it is.
[2676.48] Uh, but yeah, we'll be announcing that
[2678.56] soon. Uh, all the specifics on it to
[2681.76] everybody that has participated. Now, if
[2684.64] you if
[2686.0] Go ahead. Sorry. Go ahead. Well, I was
[2687.52] just gonna say you find out about these
[2689.119] things by getting Randall's monthly
[2690.8] newsletter. Yeah. Uh that's that's the
[2693.76] best way to learn as soon as possible uh
[2697.2] more than the the crowds that would see
[2698.88] it on YouTube. You can actually get the
[2700.64] monthly newsletter where all these
[2702.319] events upcoming are typically announced
[2704.92] first. So that's easy to do. Uh
[2709.4] randler.comnewsletter and just takes an
[2711.52] email address. So yeah, that's something
[2713.76] we we might want to just briefly let you
[2716.72] cover here before we get into a break.
[2718.72] Just the the one for April came out a
[2721.52] couple days ago. So definitely some
[2723.56] interesting stories in there. You cover
[2726.079] recent scientific articles and give your
[2729.04] your summation of them and uh one of
[2731.359] them was very applicable to to the
[2733.359] studies out there again for the Cordier
[2735.76] and Ice Age floods. So yeah, I I haven't
[2739.44] been able to read through that yet. I
[2740.72] just I just saw it this morning. So, uh,
[2743.52] is that something you
[2744.92] can kind of overview for us? Well, since
[2748.72] you That's That's probably something we
[2750.4] could do a whole We could probably do a
[2751.76] whole podcast on that and related stuff
[2753.92] that's come out in the last year and we
[2756.16] haven't been doing Cosmos.
[2759.119] Well, let's see here. Since you asked so
[2761.28] politely,
[2763.8] um, we could do that. And
[2768.68] uh let's see. I wonder if I should pull
[2771.04] up the the newsletter that went out. I
[2773.52] send I send the raw thing over to uh
[2777.44] Laura. She forwards it to Casey and
[2780.0] Casey puts the puts it together in
[2782.16] newsletter format and uh she's the one
[2786.4] who sends it out and she does a really
[2788.48] good job. I've got to uh let's see.
[2791.52] Thank you, Laura and KZ. It it went out
[2794.16] late this month, of course, because of
[2796.24] everything that has been going on. Uh we
[2799.2] were busy and then uh but we got it out.
[2802.8] Uh let's see. So, Mike and Dave's
[2806.0] Multiverse World Views Media. While
[2808.16] you're looking for that, yeah, that
[2809.44] Well, I I I don't know. I think you told
[2811.119] me it's sold out. You're going to be out
[2812.64] in Sedona with Graham Hancock, but uh
[2815.76] yeah, might that might not be uh
[2818.4] available for tickets anymore, but that
[2820.16] is that's probably a live stream also.
[2823.119] I believe it is. And I think he's
[2825.2] arranged an overflow room if people Oh,
[2828.64] okay. Yeah, because it did sell out.
[2830.0] Watch it on though. Yeah. Hey, good for
[2832.16] them. Yeah. Well, that's great. So,
[2834.56] yeah, I'll be hanging out with Graham
[2836.079] again. Hadn't seen him in a couple of
[2837.44] years, so that'll be great.
[2841.04] Yeah, I think it's going to be a lot of
[2842.48] fun. I'm looking forward to it. I just,
[2845.28] you know, wish that I had had more time.
[2847.28] I could have we we could have done a
[2849.04] tour out there. Um because oh my god the
[2852.319] sites that out there unbelievable
[2856.079] question. Yeah great time of year to to
[2858.24] be out exploring the desert.
[2862.24] This is the newsletter. So here we go.
[2864.8] Let's
[2866.599] see. Ah look at
[2869.4] this. What do we got here? Well oh my.
[2874.56] Yeah. Good. Good.
[2877.839] Well, we did we did find that Shoson
[2882.0] Falls Park is closed until the week
[2885.359] after we're there.
[2887.52] So, what are you saying? We're going to
[2888.72] have to break in. We're going to have to
[2890.72] find our own way in. I'm not saying what
[2892.88] you said. Okay. We're going to have to
[2896.079] find another access point because the
[2899.839] road will be closed.
[2902.64] So, next month from May 11th through the
[2905.119] 17th, Brad Young, that's that's you,
[2908.24] Brad. Myself, I got named and the Grim
[2911.68] America Boys will be following the route
[2913.92] of the mighty Bonavville flood from its
[2916.48] origins in Utah with the break out of
[2920.24] gigantic Lake Bonavville through Red
[2922.16] Rock Pass, north through and across the
[2924.24] Snake River plane of Idaho. Yeah. Yeah.
[2927.599] Along the way, we will visit and explore
[2929.599] some truly amazing sites while becoming
[2932.0] literate in the language of catastrophe.
[2934.64] This tour is part of an ongoing project
[2936.64] to facilitate the unveiling of the epic
[2939.64] manuscript engraved into the planetary
[2942.24] landscape that has been waiting more
[2943.92] than 12,000 years to reveal itself to
[2947.28] those with the eyes to see. Now, this
[2949.76] was 10 spots, but now it's down to five
[2952.0] spots. Yep. So, wow. Okay. Then I wrote
[2956.559] something about the subterranean
[2958.16] subterranean the subterranean structures
[2960.559] below the Giza
[2962.04] pyramids. And uh as I say here but yeah
[2967.52] yeah I was not intending to remark on
[2970.8] the supposed structures detected below
[2973.28] Kafrey's pyramid but since I have been
[2976.0] asked repeatedly for my thoughts on the
[2978.16] matter I have agreed to venture forth
[2981.04] from my ivory tower to declare my
[2983.76] opinion before the eagerly anticipating
[2986.559] masses.
[2989.44] Okay. Well, after all that bombast, all
[2992.559] I can really say is that I am ambivalent
[2994.96] about the whole thing.
[2997.599] That was kind of bombastic. I wasn't
[2999.52] going to say anything.
[3003.359] You didn't think I was taking myself
[3005.52] seriously.
[3007.319] Okay. Feeling good.
[3011.44] Where's that ivory tower? I haven't
[3013.04] checked that out, man.
[3014.72] You know, like I like I often say, you
[3017.92] know, sometimes I even impress myself.
[3022.16] And the thing of it is almost I'm not
[3024.64] easily impressed. I will vouch for that.
[3027.52] Also, take all that for what it's worth.
[3030.96] All right. First of all, the scenario is
[3033.68] so extreme in its implications that if
[3035.68] it were real, it would overturn our
[3037.2] entire historical narrative, calling
[3039.119] into question everything we have assumed
[3040.88] about our past. But with a tip of the
[3043.599] hat to Carl Sean, I must agree that
[3045.92] extraordinary claims require
[3047.359] extraordinary proof. What is needed is
[3049.839] peerreview of the scientific reports
[3051.839] followed by independent
[3053.559] replication. Uh what form independent
[3056.4] replication could or should take remains
[3058.8] to be seen. But then what I get into and
[3060.96] I'm not going to go through it all but
[3062.079] what this is one of the things you know
[3064.0] if you get the newsletter I go into a
[3066.4] whole background about uh you know
[3069.64] former the times when uh Egypt was was
[3073.2] wet and had a lot of uh rainfall and and
[3077.2] uh water erosion. There's a lot of water
[3080.079] erosion. If you could sweep away all of
[3082.4] the the the desert sand and look at the
[3084.64] bedrock beneath it's all scarred with
[3086.96] water erosion. And then this to me was
[3089.76] one of the most interesting of the
[3091.04] things that that you know when you
[3092.88] realize this and it may have bearing on
[3095.64] what those images which I can't
[3098.64] interpret. They look like something the
[3100.72] images that that were published what it
[3104.0] is. My first conjecture would be taking
[3106.319] the lowest common denominator, AAM's
[3108.559] razor, would be that they're natural,
[3111.28] that there's some kind of natural
[3112.52] cavities because I'd actually often
[3115.2] thought that was an an option for e
[3118.4] Egypt when I learned about um you know
[3121.119] those first shuttle overflights in uh in
[3124.72] the 1980s that were able to look through
[3127.119] the sand and see the see the uh eroded
[3131.04] bedrock beneath. But this is interesting
[3133.119] and then I'll jump back out of this. But
[3135.68] um we'll just go through this part right
[3137.52] here. This is in discussing the
[3138.88] importance of the Nile River in the life
[3140.48] of Egypt. Despite having a small
[3142.72] discharge, the the river itself,
[3145.04] geologist Rashi say explains the
[3147.839] remarkable fact and I'm quoting here.
[3150.16] The Nile is not only small relative to
[3152.48] other rivers of the world, but it is
[3154.16] also small compared to its predecessors.
[3156.8] Since the incision of the valley of the
[3159.599] Nile as a grand canyon some 2 and a half
[3163.52] kilometers deep. This occurred about 6
[3166.559] million years ago. Gigantic rivers have
[3169.44] come and gone filling this canyon
[3171.28] unquote. Then I point out here that 2.5
[3174.319] kilometers is equal to 8,200
[3177.76] uh feet or about a mile and a half. It
[3180.4] took an extraordinary amount of water to
[3182.319] carve a canyon to this depth. And this
[3184.16] canyon sits right at the edge of the
[3186.4] Giza
[3187.4] Plateau. So, you know, if that's the
[3190.559] case, then uh you've got this mile and a
[3195.04] half deep canyon right there, this
[3197.88] huge aperture opening, this space in the
[3201.319] earth. Is it out of the question that
[3203.92] you might have natural cavities of a
[3205.839] large scale? So, the rest of it goes
[3208.64] through here. uh looking at just a small
[3211.119] sample of the evidence for these water
[3214.319] flows in ancient Egypt and the
[3217.079] alternating the deserts and then the
[3219.44] lush green land that that interspersed
[3223.2] and these climate changes that are
[3224.96] preserved which are pretty amazing in
[3226.8] themselves. If you get the newsletter,
[3228.72] you can read all that and then uh about
[3230.88] all that. Then I get into uh the uh it's
[3236.16] called the terminal uh uh the terminal
[3240.079] ice age mega floods in British Columbia,
[3243.2] an alternative hypothesis. Now, this is
[3245.839] interesting here because this is from a
[3248.319] paper about studies primarily in the
[3250.72] Prince George area and the Fraser River,
[3253.88] which in
[3256.119] 1999, you and I did a traverse from the
[3259.359] headarters of the Fraser all the way
[3261.839] down to
[3263.16] Vancouver. And everywhere along there,
[3266.319] we were observing mega flood features.
[3269.04] And now there's this paper and another
[3271.839] paper. Um, I'm going to pull this up
[3274.16] here in a minute. It's called uh it was
[3276.24] published in 2021 by uh John J. Clag
[3280.599] um and Brian Manun Manunos who I am I've
[3284.8] read papers by him before. The other
[3286.96] authors I don't know but the title of
[3289.2] the paper is a and it appeared in the
[3292.079] journal Geomorphology. The title of the
[3294.079] paper is a huge flood in the Fraser
[3297.599] River Valley, British Columbia near near
[3300.0] the place to scene
[3301.96] termination. So, so this was I think
[3305.2] part of this whole complex of again why
[3307.92] I think it needs to be called the
[3309.119] cordier and
[3310.92] floods. And I think that interestingly
[3314.4] the dates that are coming up on this
[3316.64] thing are looking like right around 8
[3319.2] 115 or
[3320.599] 116 meltwater pulse 1B. Now, that's I'm
[3323.76] wondering is that accurate? Um, but
[3326.72] right there, I mean, I instantly noticed
[3329.2] that correlation. So, um, in the
[3332.48] newsletter, I go into it. I've got some
[3334.16] great graphics here of of Glacial Lake
[3336.839] Frasier. Um, I probably should, uh,
[3340.8] share that because I think you'd like to
[3343.44] see this. I think you got some images
[3345.28] there. I as I was scrolling down through
[3347.2] the newsletter. Yeah, definitely. Uh, we
[3349.68] can take a look at that. and and
[3352.359] we're really wanting to do a tour up in
[3354.88] BC also. Uh you know, we were there in
[3357.76] 99 like you said. Uh that's where the
[3361.04] Grim America guys are, Darren and Graham
[3364.64] that do the GRA podcast and they they're
[3367.44] the contact at the cabin host that uh
[3370.96] take care and organize the uh the tours
[3373.839] that we're doing out there for the mega
[3375.28] floods.
[3376.799] So yeah, that's another one that's in
[3378.72] the works. I think here for looking at
[3380.96] the images, I'm going to go right to the
[3384.119] originals. Uh rather
[3386.68] than looking at the online version, uh
[3391.119] just take a second here. There's April.
[3393.839] And here we go. Well, we'll probably
[3395.04] take a break here coming soon, too.
[3397.2] Yeah. And then we'll talk about the
[3399.44] Teton Dam. Okay. I can enlarge this and
[3405.44] Yeah. So, this is probably worthy of a
[3406.96] whole whole show or at least half one.
[3408.799] And uh Oh yeah, maybe we can check in
[3411.52] with Jerome. He might be having some
[3413.2] influence on some of these guys out
[3414.72] there.
[3418.48] Well, yes, I think he very much could
[3420.96] be. Uh we hope so. And Nick Zentner,
[3424.0] too. He's uh made a bunch of good videos
[3426.48] people are paying attention to. All
[3428.4] right. Well, we got to kind of get Nick
[3430.96] to start thinking bigger. Bigger. Yep.
[3434.079] Yep. Well, he last I heard and I don't
[3436.319] follow him, but yeah, the gist I got
[3439.28] that he was he was kind of done with the
[3440.72] mega floods and he was going to start
[3442.16] talking more regularly about volcanoes.
[3444.48] No. Okay. Well, but not not that he
[3446.96] never wants to hear about it or talk
[3448.24] about it again, but uh yeah, I think the
[3450.96] stretch of videos have have turned into
[3453.28] a different topic. Uhhuh. Well, well, we
[3456.88] certainly know then that if he's moved
[3458.64] on, there's plenty of uh unexplored,
[3461.68] unexplained, uninvestigated material
[3464.4] sitting right there that needs to be
[3466.48] looked
[3467.88] at. All right. So, here hopefully you're
[3470.559] seeing this. This is uh sure do Frasier
[3473.599] glacial lake Frasier. You can see
[3476.319] there's Prince George. So, Prince George
[3477.839] would have been like 300 feet
[3479.119] underwater.
[3480.96] And you see it it it here there's an arm
[3484.48] of it that extends down into the Rocky
[3486.4] Mountain Trench and then but the main
[3489.2] body of it follows the Snake River down
[3491.44] and then you see Williams Lake. So we
[3493.76] this is the pathway we
[3495.72] followed coming out of Prince George.
[3498.079] Now what we didn't get up that far in 99
[3502.24] but we got to Prince George. We went in
[3504.48] 2015. Where did we pick up Frasier
[3507.359] Valley
[3508.28] at in 99? Uh, Revel Stoke maybe.
[3513.359] No, we followed the Colombia. I'm not
[3515.119] sure where we picked up the Frasier,
[3518.559] right? We went to the headarters of the
[3520.16] Colombia. We did do that. Yeah.
[3524.64] Well, let let's see. So, what year did
[3526.079] we go to Prince George when we had uh
[3528.319] speaking? We had George with us on 2015
[3531.359] with with Ed and George and Yeah. A
[3534.0] couple guys. Uhhuh.
[3536.119] Yeah. So, that would have been uh Yeah.
[3539.04] Yeah. Right. That was there was like
[3540.64] seven of us I
[3542.839] think. So yeah. So this was there's a
[3546.4] whole tour we're going to put together
[3548.0] in here that will that will encompass
[3549.92] going to B Jasper. We'll look at the the
[3553.2] the
[3555.28] erratics train. Oh, I mean there's so
[3557.44] much here. It's we're going the
[3559.119] challenge is going to be how to narrow
[3560.96] it down to a week, week and a half.
[3563.28] Well, yeah. That's thing. We're going to
[3564.4] have to do a week and a half. It's not
[3566.319] going to be a six day, five day, five
[3568.079] and a half day one. Well, we go to all
[3569.68] the trouble to, you know, get up there.
[3571.359] Might as well. All right. So, then this
[3573.44] is the Nako River,
[3575.92] which is one of the tributaries to the
[3577.52] Frasier. And this was the Nako River. If
[3580.0] I go back here, the Choco comes in right
[3583.839] here. Comes in this way.
[3587.04] So, this plateau. Yeah. The Choco
[3590.4] Plateau. Exactly.
[3593.52] But boy, and so this whole valley was a
[3596.799] conduit for giant meltwater floods. So
[3599.28] you got a big terrace built here, right?
[3601.599] This is, you know, um the great
[3606.2] terrace, not the same one obviously, but
[3608.88] yeah, this is again one of the features
[3610.64] that you regularly see throughout these
[3612.4] mega flood pathways is these big
[3616.28] terraces. And then that's just a uh a
[3619.28] graphic that I included in the
[3620.72] newsletter to help people understand
[3622.88] what they were reading about. We got
[3625.44] this what they're calling whalebacks.
[3627.119] There are whale backs on some of these
[3628.88] terrace surfaces. There's also
[3632.599] um giant current ripples. Kettle lakes.
[3636.319] So kettle lakes, this is anywhere where
[3638.16] a glacier, I mean sorry, an iceberg came
[3641.52] to ground within the
[3643.319] alovvium and then melted away. So it's
[3646.64] called a cattle because it reminded
[3648.64] presumably I don't know the the settlers
[3650.64] or whom explorers or whomever of literal
[3653.92] cettles,
[3655.92] right? Because generally it's got one
[3657.52] little breakthrough of the of the mound.
[3660.0] That's the like a spout where it drains.
[3663.04] Yeah. Right. Often does it has a spout.
[3665.76] Yes. Yeah. So those what's the
[3668.64] difference between a humpback or a whale
[3670.4] back and a and a drumland? because I
[3671.92] remember seeing those with with uh
[3674.319] Jerome when we were out there in 2017.
[3676.96] Yeah. I I don't know unless it has to do
[3679.52] with the with the uh you know because
[3682.24] drumlands are very distinctly blunt at
[3684.88] the up current end and tapered at the
[3686.88] downstream end. Maybe it has to do with
[3688.559] that because I think these were
[3690.559] described as being by by
[3694.04] convex which means that they've got a
[3697.359] double uh that you're that they're
[3700.599] convex the along the long axis and then
[3703.52] they're also convex perpendicular to the
[3706.24] long
[3707.16] axis. So they're called by convex. So
[3710.48] that I I think it's probably just the uh
[3714.319] the the the the shape. Now it might be
[3717.04] taper of the ends. Yeah, the taper of
[3719.52] the ends. So, and it might be that the
[3721.28] whalebacks are formed under a free flow
[3725.359] with a free surface. Okay. But I'm not
[3729.04] 100% sure on that, but I'm I'm
[3730.72] definitely going to be looking into this
[3732.96] so I can really fully understand every
[3735.92] nuance of this of this evidence here. A
[3739.04] sub formation of the streamlined
[3741.76] erosional residual. Yes. And then and
[3745.119] see if you're not subscribed to the
[3746.64] newsletter, this is the kind of stuff
[3748.0] you're missing out on. Then I go into
[3749.839] the remnants of ancient technology in
[3751.839] the American
[3752.92] Southwest. And this is interesting
[3755.2] stuff.
[3756.52] Um I'll just scroll down here. Uh so
[3762.599] uh so it's the some of this what we
[3765.599] already know is that there were these
[3766.96] ancient roadways uh in the southwest
[3770.16] just like there are up in the northeast
[3772.24] along the the mound structures are these
[3774.799] perfectly straight roadways. Well, so
[3777.28] this is a uh a new study that just came
[3781.599] out. Uh let's see. Yeah. Uh well, no,
[3786.24] this is an older one that I refer back
[3787.839] to to help con uh give context to the
[3791.44] new work. See, so this was a 1978 paper.
[3795.44] Uh it was titled Stone Circles of of
[3797.76] Choco Canyon, Northwestern New Mexico.
[3799.92] Let me do I have the whole I definitely
[3802.319] have the whole reference in here. Um but
[3805.599] it was in the journal Antiquity. uh care
[3808.319] to report about new lidar and field
[3810.64] studies undertaken on a littleknown
[3812.4] archaeological site that is part of the
[3814.88] ancient Chocoan complex in New Mexico.
[3817.839] This site known as the Gasco site was
[3820.64] investigated by Robert S. Winer or
[3823.039] Weiner, I don't know which with the
[3824.64] department of religion, Dartmouth
[3827.119] College, Richard A. Freriedman with the
[3829.44] geographic information systems and John
[3832.24] R. Stein in independent reacher who's
[3834.16] done some really interesting papers on
[3836.4] the Choco and stuff that um I've been
[3839.039] reading. So this is their study. Um
[3842.72] we'll just I'll just the underlined part
[3845.359] here where they're saying many
[3846.559] researchers concur that a compelling
[3849.68] religious tradition with associated
[3851.52] ritual practices and architectural forms
[3854.319] underlay this regional influence and the
[3856.96] authority of Chako and leaders. But so
[3858.799] what they've done is they've discovered
[3860.72] using liar that there's this long set of
[3863.68] parallel roads. And if I scroll down
[3866.4] here we can see that I'll come back to
[3869.039] that.
[3870.599] Um should be yeah right here. Okay. So
[3873.2] here's the LAR image and you can see
[3875.359] here's the north what they call the
[3876.799] north
[3877.64] road and then you have the south road.
[3880.799] Right. Now it turns out that this is if
[3884.16] you go look at this alignment it's it's
[3886.559] northwest to southeast. And the
[3888.96] alignment happens to be exactly the
[3891.68] alignment of the uh mid-inter
[3896.359] sunrise from this
[3899.079] latitude. Uh so we can see here here's
[3902.079] they're showing um where they've mapped
[3905.599] out the the the edges of the this would
[3908.0] be the uh yeah the south parallel road.
[3911.52] So this the the lines here define the
[3914.64] outer edges of the road and then you see
[3917.839] in the distance Mount Taylor which is a
[3921.119] considered to be a sacred pilgrimage
[3923.039] mount to the Pueblo and people and it's
[3926.559] indicated clearly that they considered
[3928.559] it significant enough to align this long
[3932.0] road to that mountain and where it meets
[3934.48] the horizon. And the modern Pueblo
[3937.039] people still hold Mount Taylor in
[3940.079] sanctity. But so then here the authors
[3942.64] of this paper, which is open source,
[3945.359] they went down here on winter
[3948.039] solstice morning. And here's the sun
[3951.119] rising directly over Mount Taylor. Mount
[3954.559] Taylor. So you've got this huge
[3957.92] construction. Well, it would have been
[3959.68] back in the day. and and and and I
[3962.0] started with stone circles because one
[3963.76] of the interesting features of this is
[3965.52] that there are these mysterious stone
[3967.28] circles that you find and that was what
[3969.52] I was showing like they're right here if
[3972.4] you look the the Heroduru
[3975.64] Heraura that's the uh is that Spanish uh
[3979.76] this is what they call the things these
[3982.16] circles so there's one of them right
[3984.44] here and so this that's why I went
[3988.44] back to help people understand these
[3991.599] stone circles and then the stone
[3994.599] circles had uh these circular
[3999.319] pits some of the basins stone basins uh
[4003.28] and the number and and it's surmised the
[4007.119] possibility that these stone basins
[4009.039] might actually form star maps but they
[4011.76] didn't get that far into their study and
[4013.839] this was the study here these old
[4015.839] pictures from the from the 1978 paper uh
[4019.359] where they were first looking at these
[4020.799] stone circles, not really connecting the
[4023.52] stone circles as part of a complex that
[4026.319] included these long parallel
[4028.44] roads. So, yes, on the bluff up above
[4031.92] the canyon.
[4033.839] Where where are these? Are they Yeah,
[4036.48] that Well, that one we just looked at is
[4038.4] right here within the canyon. It's right
[4040.24] here. I think this is the one we were
[4042.0] just looking at, but there's there's
[4043.68] bunches of them. Yeah, they're they're
[4045.28] on the rim of Choco Canyon. Uh and then
[4049.44] there Yeah.
[4052.119] Um and then but the most interesting
[4055.359] thing to me right here where it really
[4057.359] gets interesting is if you follow this
[4060.0] alignment the road which defines the you
[4064.64] know the mid- winter sunrise. It's also
[4068.0] defined
[4069.0] geologically because at the beginning of
[4071.359] the road and the end of the road are two
[4075.44] sacred
[4079.72] springs. Now that to me is interesting,
[4083.92] you know, is that just a coincidence
[4085.28] that you if you draw this line between
[4087.039] these two sacred springs, it gives you
[4088.799] the mid winter sunrise
[4092.359] alignment, the winter solstice sunrise.
[4096.159] That's interesting to me. Not
[4098.319] necessarily that there's a road between
[4099.839] the springs, but that the springs are
[4102.239] lined up with that alignment. Well, the
[4104.88] springs, I'm assuming, were there before
[4106.96] the roads were built? Yeah. Yeah.
[4110.88] And did they which came first, the the
[4113.6] alignment or I mean, did they define the
[4116.319] springs and then
[4118.799] lay out the road because it ends at this
[4120.719] spring down here. And I think that
[4122.52] that's that'd make an interesting trip,
[4125.04] wouldn't
[4126.759] it? Uh so regarding this coincidence,
[4129.759] the author's comment, the Gasco roads
[4132.56] also events associations with water, a
[4135.759] scarce resource crucial to the
[4137.52] sustenance of life and the focus of much
[4140.0] pueblo and da ceremonialism. Most
[4143.6] prominently the gas roads connect the
[4146.64] gas heradurus with watery places. A
[4150.48] spring in the cliffs behind Blue J and
[4153.759] the head of Twof Fault Canyon. The
[4156.4] deposition of waterworn pebbles at both
[4159.88] Heroduras Heroduras. So if that's a
[4162.48] misspelling there I should fix.
[4166.199] Uh there we go. and of blue green
[4169.199] turquoise chip at the little gasco
[4171.159] heraduro likely express relationships
[4173.839] with water. The alignment towards mount
[4176.4] Taylor is also relevant as mountains are
[4178.56] strongly connected with water among the
[4180.4] poublo and da people. Numerous
[4182.96] previously documented chakan roads
[4185.199] terminate at watery places. So again
[4188.719] this is
[4190.12] uh yeah the assoc disassociation between
[4193.64] architectural and infrastructure
[4195.92] expressions endowed with special
[4197.679] sanctity the alignment with cosmic
[4200.08] events and the presence of natural
[4201.84] springs all apparently a part of an
[4204.159] integrated system is of considerable
[4206.88] significance and it should be mentioned
[4208.4] that the example discussed herein is by
[4211.04] no means an isolated one but has
[4212.88] counterparts in many examples in a vast
[4216.08] system of sacred
[4217.64] geography found far removed from Choco
[4220.719] Canyon, but I should mention is part of
[4223.0] the this the hub which is occupied by
[4226.96] Choco Canyon. It's part of that whole
[4229.36] system that now I was in some of the
[4232.4] older work I was writing about this was
[4234.159] putting 10,000 square miles. It's much
[4237.12] bigger than even that now. So here was
[4239.84] the paper the parallel roads solstice
[4242.08] and sacred geography at the gas site a
[4244.8] choco and ritual landscape just came out
[4247.12] 2025. So every month I report on
[4250.08] interesting breaking news in the realm
[4253.239] of subject matter that would be of
[4255.76] interest to
[4257.88] cosmographians. Um there it is. Yeah.
[4261.199] Yeah. So there there it is. That's the
[4262.96] whole that's that's the raw form that
[4264.88] gets sent over to the ladies. Then they
[4267.28] jazz it up and and send it out. But then
[4270.56] what I'm doing, it's not a little couple
[4272.239] sentences. You're you're really
[4275.719] summarizing, you're covering the full
[4278.8] sense of these papers. Yes. And like you
[4282.159] said, bringing in other previous papers
[4284.08] if people want to dig in themselves, you
[4285.76] give them a pathway to to follow even
[4287.679] more info. So yeah, sign up, get that
[4291.04] every month from Randall.
[4294.08] Indeed. Indeed.
[4297.12] Break time. Yeah. Let's do a little
[4298.96] break here and we'll come back. I want
[4300.96] to show a couple photos and that'll lead
[4303.12] us right into the Teton Dam. Yeah. All
[4305.76] right. Sounds good. Cool. All right.
[4308.0] Taking a break. Right back.
[4315.07] [Music]
[4322.7] [Music]
[4325.679] for the
[4335.97] [Music]
[4351.59] [Music]
[4352.84] man.
[4359.93] [Music]
[4369.08] Heat. Heat.
[4372.72] [Music]
[4386.66] [Music]
[4390.32] Wait. Do your Louiswis and Clark here.
[4392.32] Do your Louiswis and Clark. You want me
[4393.84] to do my Louiswis first? That way? Yeah.
[4396.719] I think it's lower. There's my Lewis.
[4399.44] Yeah. Here's Clark.
[4405.679] All right, guys. We're back
[4407.4] here on
[4410.199] Cosmographia episode 112. How about
[4412.56] that? We're pulling it together. Got
[4414.8] normal guy Mike. You You got any uh wild
[4417.44] stories for us or everything normal?
[4422.159] Nothing wild. Everything's normal. No.
[4425.0] Okay.
[4426.52] Well, yeah, we've been uh talking about
[4429.6] the Teton Dam failure and we're
[4432.159] definitely going to get out there on our
[4434.48] tour and uh so Randall's written quite a
[4437.36] bit and I've been out there. So, I'm
[4439.28] going to share a couple photos here uh
[4442.0] stills I took from my drone flyover
[4444.4] video and then uh Randall got some more
[4447.679] of the historical photos because it the
[4449.76] event was back in 1976.
[4452.56] Yep. Bicesentennial year. That's right.
[4456.56] All right. Let's see. I got these queued
[4458.96] up here, I think. Right. So, this is one
[4462.96] of our stops. This is
[4465.64] actually a closer in shot of what's my
[4469.04] background right now. Yeah. This is the
[4471.52] big boulder bar on the Snake River below
[4475.52] uh the Swan Falls Dam out in the
[4477.44] distance there. You guys seeing this?
[4480.28] Mhm. There we go. Yeah. Oh my, look at
[4485.84] that. All right, so yeah, Snake River
[4488.56] coming through here. It's actually
[4490.0] flowing south to north. And that's the
[4492.719] Swanf Falls Dam out in the distance
[4494.719] there,
[4496.8] right? So here's my SUV. So this is on
[4500.239] the north side of the river.
[4504.199] Uh well, right there it's the east side
[4508.719] because the river is go river is going
[4510.4] south to north, right? Okay. But just
[4512.719] south of Boyisey. Yeah. So, um, so
[4516.64] that's that gives you some good scale. I
[4519.04] mean, that little black thing there is
[4520.96] your SUV, right? Right. So, that's my
[4523.52] car down there. So, you see most of
[4525.36] these are bigger than my car. Yeah.
[4527.84] Easil easily. They're big. They're more
[4530.159] like garage sized or and then some.
[4534.08] Right. So, I haven't I haven't gotten to
[4536.159] this yet, but I just flew my drone over
[4539.12] Marshall and the French Broad River, and
[4542.56] it's very
[4543.88] obvious that stones were moved and the
[4547.36] water flow is not straight down. Now, it
[4550.0] takes a a turn. Mhm. And it's because
[4553.199] these rocks got pushed off from the
[4556.0] wall, that's the barrier at the the nose
[4558.88] of the island. the flood waters eroded
[4561.92] all that and pushed those rocks out into
[4563.84] the the middle of the riverbed. So the
[4567.04] flow's quite different and that flood
[4570.159] was 27 ft deep, right? So the rocks are
[4572.719] not that big, but it did move them. So
[4575.6] it's kind of a scale invariant thing. So
[4577.44] that's something I'm going to play with
[4578.4] and put together and compare it to to
[4581.36] what was moved here. Well, you can get
[4584.159] some indication of at how deep the water
[4586.48] is by looking at this washed up
[4590.0] stuff against the flanks of the cliffs
[4592.56] right down the other side. Yeah, even
[4594.32] more so. Yeah, it's way up there. Let's
[4596.96] see. We got one more looking the other
[4599.12] direction.
[4601.36] Oh, wow. So, that's down down the snake
[4604.159] heading north and then it then it veers
[4606.0] off northwest. So, again, my my little
[4607.84] car down there. So, it's not not a tiny
[4609.92] car, but yeah, most of these are are
[4612.96] that big and then some.
[4615.84] So yeah, we're gonna we're going to go
[4617.199] roam around down here and uh yeah, I
[4619.6] think some of some of Randall and
[4622.64] there's one of them for sure that you
[4623.84] know, one of my favorite pictures we've
[4625.36] ever taken is us a top couple of these
[4627.6] rocks down here. Yeah.
[4630.56] All right. So that is Snake River,
[4633.84] Swanfalls Boulder Bar.
[4638.48] All right. So here's overflight of the
[4640.8] Teton Dam site. I think one backs off.
[4643.28] There we go. Oh wow.
[4647.12] Right. So the lake was never filled up,
[4649.76] right? It started draining before it
[4651.44] even filled. So this spillway was
[4653.04] probably never even used at all. Yeah, I
[4657.28] think that Well, yeah. It was just about
[4659.04] to top out, I think, when it when it
[4661.04] failed. Was it? Okay. Yeah. So, let's
[4663.92] see. I got a couple of these here. So,
[4665.92] right. Didn't you say it's like lust?
[4667.6] They thought they'd use lust as a a
[4669.84] damning material. Doesn't sound like a
[4671.92] good idea. No, it does not sound like a
[4674.0] good idea to me. Look at that. So,
[4675.84] that's still a big mountain in the
[4676.96] middle and then there's trails and, you
[4678.56] know, people take their bicycles and
[4680.159] motorbikes and you can hike up to the
[4681.76] top to top of it. There's people fishing
[4684.48] down there. Uh there's all kinds of, you
[4687.12] know, area down here. So, it's it's very
[4689.96] accessible. So, we'll roam around there
[4692.159] a good
[4693.239] bit. And then that's right. You got the
[4696.0] spillway here. So, this is down the
[4698.32] Teton River out into the plane there.
[4700.64] Yeah. So, you'll have some older but
[4704.08] very similar versions of this this shot.
[4708.159] Trying to remember what the uh peak
[4710.64] discharge
[4713.4] was. Maybe I have that. We might run
[4715.84] across it in your in your literature
[4717.679] there. I don't recall that one right
[4718.96] off. But yeah, it's like the whole if if
[4721.36] there were some uh concrete uh anything
[4726.0] injected into the bedrock here, they
[4728.8] removed it or if it washed out. There's
[4730.8] nothing of a structure on either side.
[4735.76] Well, this right here, you see all the
[4737.44] trails around on both sides? Yeah. You
[4739.12] see that switchback trail going to the
[4741.28] top? That is the remnant of the dam
[4742.88] right there. Yeah. Yeah. That's all
[4746.0] that's left of it.
[4752.44] But all
[4754.36] right. We got got a couple Mallet Gorge
[4757.92] here. I'll flip through those, I guess,
[4759.28] since we're here. But yeah, you go right
[4761.52] into the Well, this is one of our stops.
[4763.679] Pulled a couple out. Y we're seeing a
[4766.239] beautiful examples of recessional
[4768.48] cataracts
[4771.28] right here. And then this one Yeah. goes
[4773.92] right under the interstate. So you can
[4775.28] see the semi trucks out there. I think I
[4777.36] got one closer in up on the the
[4779.199] waterfall.
[4783.44] Right. So this was an overland sheet
[4785.199] flow that came in and it channelized.
[4787.92] That's exactly what this was.
[4790.08] It found some weakness in the bedrock,
[4792.08] exploited it, and then it started
[4794.56] enlarging it. And at some point, this
[4797.6] gorge most likely captured all of the
[4800.76] overflow from the land. And uh once that
[4804.0] happens, of course, then that
[4805.04] accelerates the down cutting and the
[4807.719] erosion. Yeah. And you can see all the
[4809.76] rubble there on the
[4811.239] floor. And you can see that the modern
[4813.679] water flow was not responsible for
[4817.04] cutting this gorge. But you can also
[4819.6] look over here on this uh this limb over
[4821.92] here on this side over here where you
[4823.44] can see there's probably going to be a
[4825.76] collapse going on right there. You see
[4827.84] the ground opening up. Yeah. Yeah. I was
[4830.159] going to say there's much bigger
[4831.199] examples of that. I think you called it
[4832.719] mass wasting. Yep. Mass wasting. But
[4835.76] yeah, you take the little bridge and
[4837.199] then there's a overlook or you can go
[4839.36] right along the rim if you want to. And
[4841.04] then uh yeah, there's plenty of trails
[4843.12] to explore around here.
[4845.84] Yeah, that's where I
[4847.8] wanted. Yep. So, see all the trails and
[4850.88] then it's it's farther down here where
[4852.719] there's really big chunks of the the
[4855.44] wall that's starting to slough off in
[4857.36] down into the canyon. This we should
[4860.159] mention this creek here or a river. I
[4863.199] believe it's enough flow to be a river.
[4865.92] Small river is tributary to the snake.
[4869.28] The Malid River. Yeah, correct. Yeah,
[4871.679] the M River behind us right off the
[4874.08] bottom of the screen, right? It opens
[4875.52] up. I don't have that angle in these
[4877.28] pictures that I just grabbed real quick
[4878.8] earlier. Mhm. All right. So, then we're
[4880.8] back into Red Rock Pass here.
[4883.92] There it is. Yeah. Looking north there,
[4886.239] right? So, yeah, kind of a Yeah, look at
[4889.52] that. You see the embankment over there?
[4892.56] So, this was the spillway. Mhm. For 350
[4896.8] ft or so of uh down cutting. Yeah.
[4899.76] There's Red Rock, right? That's Red Rock
[4901.6] right up there. No, that's it over
[4903.28] there. Over here. You're looking You're
[4905.92] looking south. So, you're looking into
[4907.52] the Lake Bonavville. Yeah. Like this
[4910.159] way, right? So, it was you can kind of
[4912.56] follow a maybe a high water level across
[4915.6] here. Mhm. But yeah, massive. Massive.
[4918.88] I've got other Google Earth images.
[4921.92] Yeah. That that kind of show off into
[4923.84] the distance just all the different uh
[4926.8] dry lake beds that used to be part of.
[4929.12] And it was 20 20,000 square miles. Is
[4931.84] that right? Estimated. Probably bigger
[4934.96] than that. But that's kind of the round
[4936.88] term it's used.
[4939.44] All right. Same looking looking north.
[4941.28] So yeah, that's a rem that's all that's
[4943.36] left of that sedimentary 350 ft of
[4946.159] sedimentary rock that that formed the
[4949.199] dam behind which the the high waters of
[4952.8] of Lake Bonavville as it rose up. It
[4955.28] eventually rose up to this level, which
[4957.52] is the right basically right at the top
[4959.6] of the of the uh uh the the b uh the
[4962.96] outcrop that and then it I'm guessing
[4965.76] that the most likely scenario is that it
[4967.92] overtopped. Once it overtopped, it
[4970.239] rapidly eroded down that through that
[4972.56] 350 ft of rock and then below the roads
[4976.639] here down and I'm not sure what the
[4978.159] depth is, but underneath it's a much
[4980.4] harder rock. And so at that point the
[4983.44] the uh the lake level stabilized. I'm
[4986.719] thinking if you look at that terrace uh
[4989.44] just above it, the flat terrace right in
[4991.6] there, that was probably close to the
[4995.679] high water mark. Generally the water is
[4997.44] a little higher than the terraces that
[4999.92] it produces. Right. And that probably
[5002.48] then would coincide with the uh
[5004.56] Bonavville shoreline that we'll
[5007.08] see on the mountains. And then it
[5010.159] dropped down to the
[5012.199] uh
[5014.12] uh oh hell uh the shoreline. Um well,
[5018.48] we'll be able to see two shorelines. The
[5020.56] uh oh, I forget the name of them is that
[5022.8] we're trying to come up with, right? The
[5025.199] names of the shorelines. Yeah. Yeah. I
[5027.679] don't know those. Well, Bonavville is
[5029.6] the upper one. And the it'll come to me
[5031.84] in a second.
[5033.76] Uh yeah lined up photos of that. But
[5037.6] yeah, they're they're very prominent for
[5039.199] miles and miles.
[5042.32] Can't miss them. So where they're, you
[5043.84] know, they're right parallel to the
[5045.36] Interstate 15. All right. So that's the
[5048.0] end of that photo.
[5050.239] Little run
[5054.12] there. Is it was either the No, I think
[5056.96] it was the It was the Provo store
[5058.8] shoreline. Provo sounds more Yeah. Yeah,
[5061.52] that was it. The pro that there Provo
[5063.6] Shoreline. That was it.
[5066.48] Then the Teton Dam. You're running the
[5068.32] show. Oh, me? Oh, yeah, man.
[5072.6] Oh, so I'll just I mean, I can show you
[5076.56] a thousand more photos, but Oh, I love
[5078.56] looking at photos. Well, if you want to
[5080.8] show just show photos of the damn site
[5084.159] or what? What would you show photos of?
[5086.96] Oh, just all kinds of stuff I've been
[5088.56] collecting from where we're going on the
[5090.4] tour. Oh, well, yeah. I didn't do
[5092.56] anything with Analopee Island or the the
[5094.4] shorelines you're talking about or
[5097.199] Shashon Falls is going to be closed, but
[5098.8] like I said, we're we're going to find
[5099.92] an overlook. We won't be able to go into
[5101.44] the park. Uhhuh. And then Bruno Canyon.
[5105.76] So, yeah, I just got a whole collection
[5107.52] of stuff I've been putting together
[5108.88] because we're bungee jumping off the
[5110.639] pine bridge.
[5112.84] There's Well, it's it's base jumping.
[5116.48] Base jumping that they're doing. Oh, so
[5118.159] you got to parachute. Yeah. You don't
[5119.6] you don't But yeah, they'll they'll be
[5121.84] there'll be kind of a slow day in the
[5123.76] middle because we're going to be
[5124.8] covering a lot of territory. So, we're
[5126.8] staying in Twin Falls some of the time,
[5129.12] so there'll be a day to just hang close
[5130.88] there. And yeah, people people might
[5132.4] want to do that. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah.
[5135.199] The guy guy guy guy guy guy guy guy guy
[5135.679] guy guy guy guy guy guy guy guy guy guy
[5135.679] guy guy guy guy guy guy guy guy guy guy
[5135.76] guy guy guy guy guy guy guy guy guy guy
[5135.76] guy guy w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w
[5135.92] w w w walked up to me and asked me he's
[5137.44] just kind of roaming around you know
[5139.28] some wild evil conval looking multicolor
[5142.88] you know American flag suit you want to
[5145.52] jump off the bridge yeah he came up to
[5147.76] me and you you of course said yeah I
[5151.44] would let's go I was like 250 bucks oh
[5156.32] jeez so that's pretty pretty quick of
[5158.96] cash so no I didn't do it but as later
[5162.0] that day or the next day we drove by
[5164.08] right as A guy jumped off. Oh, really?
[5166.719] That was pretty wild to just be driving
[5168.0] down the road and you see a guy standing
[5169.36] there. What the hell? And then he just
[5171.199] jumps off.
[5173.6] So people doing it.
[5176.32] So a little bit of background on the uh
[5179.44] on the disaster
[5181.32] here. Again, America's bicesentennial
[5184.0] year
[5185.08] 1976. The newly built Teton Dam in Idaho
[5188.44] failed, unleashing a massive torrential
[5191.36] flood into the headarters of the Snake
[5193.36] River. This was the last great dam
[5196.639] disaster in America and and effectively
[5199.76] pulled the plug on the Federal Bureau of
[5201.96] Reclamation's program of monumental dam
[5205.199] building that had been going on for
[5207.36] something like 75 years. Uh James
[5211.44] Sherard, one of the postfailure
[5214.4] investigating engineers, was quoted as
[5217.44] saying, "The Teton dam failure is one of
[5221.199] the most important single events in the
[5223.6] history of dam
[5225.4] engineering." At a meeting of the House
[5228.0] Committee investigating the Teton Dam
[5230.76] collapse, Congressman Leo J. Ryan of
[5234.52] California, heading up the congressional
[5236.88] investigation of the catastrophe, called
[5239.04] it one of the most colossal and dramatic
[5242.32] failures in national history. The story
[5245.84] of this event deserves a wider telling
[5248.239] than it has
[5249.96] received for its lessons are many. Like
[5253.76] the current predicament uh with the
[5255.44] Mosul dam, which this was at the time
[5257.92] that they were afraid that the Mosul dam
[5259.92] might fail. uh the failure of the team
[5263.12] which it didn't because a group of
[5264.8] Italian engineers got there just in the
[5266.88] nick of time and were able to salvage
[5269.679] what was there and they prevented a an
[5271.52] outburst flood. But the failure of the
[5274.159] Teton dam was the result of a confluence
[5276.639] of human errors and has a peculiar
[5280.0] connection to another kind of
[5281.28] humanitarian catastrophe that happened
[5284.08] just over two years later. And Brad, I
[5286.88] would not expect you to know this, but
[5288.719] maybe you would. Mike, do you remember
[5290.48] Leo J. Ryan from California?
[5293.92] Cal the congressman. Congressman, what
[5296.56] happened to him? Didn't he die at
[5299.6] Jonestown? The guy Yes, he was murdered
[5302.0] at Jonestown. Yeah, that and we're not
[5305.199] going to get into that story, but at
[5306.48] some point say that's a diggation. Well,
[5309.199] I just thought I'd mention he was head
[5310.639] of that investigating committee and two
[5312.48] years later he was murdered in Jonestown
[5316.32] uh by Jim Jones some fanatical Jim Jones
[5319.36] follower. Yeah, he was he was trying to
[5321.44] leave uh and take some of the take some
[5324.08] of the Jonestown campers with him and
[5326.88] the Jonestown Leo Jim Jones's people
[5330.96] ambushed them and killed them. Yeah.
[5333.6] Yeah.
[5335.12] As they were trying to get on the plane.
[5337.96] So the Teton dam was an earthen
[5341.44] embankment
[5343.0] structure and uh the failure of the
[5346.4] Teton dam was a result of the cumulative
[5348.88] effect of human error. The multiple
[5351.36] purposes for which the dam was being
[5353.199] built included agricultural irrigation,
[5355.6] flood control, power generation, and
[5358.719] recreation.
[5360.239] Investigations of the Teton River Canyon
[5363.679] for purposes of dam dam construction go
[5366.48] back to the early
[5367.96] 1930s. An impetus to undertake
[5370.56] construction of the new dam came in the
[5373.84] wake of a severe drought in the region
[5376.639] that happened in 1961
[5379.199] uh that was then followed by a major
[5380.88] flood the next year. The Bureau of
[5383.52] Reclamation proposed the construction of
[5385.52] a dam in
[5387.0] 1963 and Congress authorized the funds
[5390.0] the following year. After extensive
[5392.719] surveys and core sampling throughout the
[5395.36] 60s, a site was chosen in the lower
[5397.84] Teton Basin in Fremont Fremont County,
[5402.6] Idaho. So, construction of the dam began
[5406.239] in February 1972.
[5409.84] Specifically, the dam was constructed of
[5411.92] five zones of different kinds of earth
[5414.4] material installed in compacted layers.
[5418.239] Each layer performing a different
[5419.96] function with the central core designed
[5422.48] to be the one that actually retained the
[5424.6] water. Uh at the completion, uh the
[5429.6] dam's crest stood at 305 ft uh above the
[5434.159] riverbed and its width was almost 3,200
[5437.44] feet. It's almost a kilometer. At the
[5440.08] base of the dam, it was 1,700 ft wide.
[5443.679] And when the full reservoir would have
[5445.92] the full when full, the reservoir would
[5447.76] have contained
[5449.159] 356 million cubic meters of water,
[5452.96] equivalent to about 94 billion gallons.
[5457.56] Uh, and the lake formed above the dam
[5460.639] would have reached up river nearly 17
[5463.36] miles.
[5465.04] So, uh, if you were to visualize this
[5468.4] volume of water as a giant ice cube,
[5472.28] uh, take that whole volume of water that
[5474.8] was going to be in the Teton Dam
[5476.159] reservoir and froze it into a cubicle
[5478.719] ice cube. Uh, each side of that cube
[5481.44] would be
[5482.76] 2,350
[5484.28] ft. And that's, you know, disregarding
[5486.719] the coefficient of ice factor. Okay, so
[5490.56] that was a lot of water.
[5493.32] Uh so one cubic meter of water weighs
[5497.04] one metric ton. So it is obvious that
[5500.159] the weight of the lake when full would
[5502.719] have been about
[5504.679] 356 million metric
[5507.159] tonses. Uh so then I say that in this
[5511.6] thing that I wrote up on it this is a
[5513.36] considerable amount of pressure bearing
[5516.239] on the bedrock.
[5518.52] Uh so uh so while a number of geologists
[5523.92] and engineers did actually express
[5526.88] reservations about the site that they
[5528.719] had chosen uh and said that the bedrock
[5532.0] was unsuitable for for dam
[5534.52] construction. Uh politics politics of
[5538.88] course took precedence over prudence and
[5542.32] the project went ahead anyway. So the
[5545.28] main problem with the bedrock in the
[5546.88] Teton dam local was that it consists of
[5549.76] porous riolyte and basaltt. These are
[5553.199] volcanic rocks which any geologist will
[5555.76] advise are not the kind of foundation
[5557.6] upon which one wants to erect a major
[5559.92] dam with a large reservoir behind it.
[5562.4] Interestingly, this particular rock
[5565.44] called by geologists the Huckleberry
[5567.84] Ridge tough TUFF was the product of a
[5572.0] massive eruption of Yellowstone Caldera
[5574.96] about 2 million years before. So, you'll
[5578.159] see a picture of it in a second here.
[5580.08] Uh, this violent eruption was at least
[5582.88] 6,000 times more powerful than the 1980
[5587.44] eruption of Mount St. gallons and it
[5589.84] ejected about 600 cubic miles of dust,
[5594.32] ash and debris into the atmosphere. And
[5596.88] it was this stuff from the massive
[5599.28] eruption of Yellowstone that came down
[5601.44] and consolidated into the bedrock that
[5604.239] was being used uh that was at the site
[5607.52] there.
[5609.0] Um so let's see. Uh okay. So now I'm
[5613.04] going to share screen here and we're
[5614.239] going to look at the bedrock. And I mean
[5616.8] to me I think would even think that the
[5618.8] lay person would look at this and
[5621.56] go wait a
[5624.36] second does this look
[5628.36] like so there's the
[5631.159] bedrock so as I say here extreme
[5633.92] fracturing of the bedrock is clearly
[5636.48] displayed in this photo of the right
[5639.12] abutment area before construction of the
[5642.08] dam. Extensive voids were uncovered
[5645.199] during the process of excavation. The
[5648.0] rock is a type of riolyte called welded
[5650.159] tough that forms through the
[5651.6] lithification of volcanic ash flows. It
[5654.56] is not a suitable bedrock for
[5657.52] construction of a large dam and
[5662.199] reservoir. So the bedrock into which the
[5665.28] Canyon had been eroded was composed of
[5667.52] this highly fissured and porous riolyte
[5669.679] and basaltt. The choice therefore of a
[5672.32] dam site itself was the first
[5675.159] mistake. The problem was that the sites
[5678.08] suitable for the construction of
[5679.52] monumental dams were becoming scarce by
[5682.159] the
[5682.92] 1970s. At the same time, as pressure
[5686.08] from multiple factions, lobbying for all
[5689.199] the presumed benefits to be derived from
[5691.36] the new dam were
[5694.04] considerable.
[5695.719] So you can see right there what's
[5698.0] happening. So you got all this. Remember
[5700.4] I I listed what was it was going to be
[5702.159] power, it was going to be agriculture,
[5704.08] it was going to be recreation. Uh so you
[5706.8] got all of these social forces that are
[5708.719] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We want this. We're
[5710.32] going to you know power generation. All
[5712.719] of these what was the fourth thing? Uh
[5714.239] there was four things that it named. Um
[5717.28] so then you had this political pressure
[5719.28] and like it says other suitable sites
[5721.36] were already being used up by the
[5723.639] 1970s. So political pressure they went
[5726.239] ahead anyway. I should mention that up
[5729.36] to this point, the Bureau's record of
[5732.159] dam building over nearly 75 years was
[5735.84] virtually impeccable without a single
[5738.239] dam failure. Although there was one
[5740.159] close call, the engineers, geologists,
[5743.199] contractors, and other professionals in
[5745.04] their employee were highly experienced
[5747.36] at dam building. After all, the bureau
[5749.92] had built two of the great engineering
[5752.159] wonders of the modern world, both Hoover
[5754.719] Dam and Grand Koulie Dam.
[5757.52] Uh but this reign of success and
[5759.96] accomplishment became compromised as the
[5762.88] enterprise became progressively more
[5766.6] bureaucratized and
[5768.52] politicized with the growth of
[5770.88] government. Teton Dam represented the
[5773.76] tipping point and its physical collapse
[5776.639] parallels the economic collapse in Venez
[5779.84] Well this is what yeah at the time I
[5781.76] wrote this there was an economic
[5783.28] collapse in Venezuela which we're still
[5786.08] experiencing the after effects of
[5788.04] because you know the economic collapse
[5791.12] in Venezuela fueled the the immigration
[5793.84] and all of the Venezuelan immigrants
[5796.08] that found their way to America and so
[5797.92] on but that's a huge distraction but
[5800.36] interestingly as I was writing this uh
[5804.639] that was going on that economic collapse
[5806.8] was just beginning in slow motion. So to
[5810.56] me one of the takeaways of this kind of
[5812.4] study that we do is often there seems to
[5814.159] be a correlation between what's
[5816.719] happening in the social sphere, the
[5818.32] cultural sphere, the economic sphere and
[5820.32] what's happening within the natural
[5821.76] world. And when we talk about the um the
[5825.04] great dust bowl and drought of the
[5827.04] 1930s, we really see that really this
[5830.639] mutual feedback thing between what
[5832.96] nature is doing and what the economy is
[5834.96] doing. But that's a that's a uh
[5838.4] digression. Um anyways, the physical
[5841.119] collapse parallels the economic collapse
[5843.199] in Venezuela as that nation succumbs to
[5846.56] total bureaucratization. As I mentioned,
[5849.119] the failure of Teton Dam marked the end
[5851.119] of the era of monumental dam building in
[5853.36] North America. So, yeah, over the
[5855.6] basalt, Brad, you brought this up. So,
[5857.199] over the basalt bedrock of the region,
[5858.96] there has accumulated a very interesting
[5861.199] and unique type of soil called lust, the
[5864.4] most volcanically, this mostly
[5866.639] volcanically derived soil is extremely
[5868.88] fertile and is widely distributed
[5871.28] throughout the Pacific Northwest. All
[5873.36] that is needed for lust to support
[5875.44] abundant biological activity is the
[5877.52] addition of water. But much of the area
[5879.92] over which it is found in Idaho and
[5881.679] Washington is quite aid and hence the
[5884.719] numerous hydraological projects that
[5887.119] have been undertaken
[5889.36] um throughout the Northwest uh which
[5893.28] occasioned the building of not only dams
[5895.04] but canals, aqueducts and vast
[5897.76] irrigation systems. Uh we'll skip over
[5901.119] some of this.
[5903.56] Uh so as I explained in let's see in the
[5907.84] course of site preparation contractors
[5910.159] began grouting
[5911.96] operations. As I explained in an article
[5914.56] I wrote about Mosul Dam in Iraq.
[5917.44] Grouting is a method of injecting
[5919.6] fluidized concrete under high pressure
[5922.88] into voids and fissures in the rocks
[5926.0] surrounding a dam for the purpose of
[5927.84] preventing seepage. When the grout
[5930.239] hardens, it forms or supposed to inform
[5932.639] and it uh form an imperous barricade to
[5935.76] water
[5936.679] penetration. In the course of
[5938.48] excavation, it was confirmed that the
[5940.32] bedrock adjacent to the Teton Dam site
[5943.199] was porous, containing large voids and
[5946.44] cavities, some of which consumed
[5948.8] enormous quantities of grout. In some
[5951.92] cases, the voids were never even
[5953.6] actually filled. Some of the grout holds
[5956.32] extended to a depth of more than 300 ft.
[5960.239] Large fissures and caverns were
[5962.32] especially prevalent around the right
[5964.8] abutment, which we're going to see the
[5966.56] pictures of in a moment. More than 1.1
[5969.679] million cubic feet of grouting material
[5971.84] was injected into the Swiss cheeseike
[5974.719] bedrock with no end in sight. This was
[5977.92] more than double the amount of grout
[5979.92] originally estimated. The decision was
[5984.0] made to suspend grouting operations due
[5986.4] to the acrewing cost overruns. And this
[5989.6] was mistake number
[5991.239] three. In early June of 1973, the
[5994.48] contractor Morrison Nudson completed the
[5997.28] diversion tunnel and rerouted the Teton
[5999.76] River. On June 8th, imp placement of the
[6003.04] embankment material commenced in October
[6005.28] of 1973.
[6007.52] The embankment that as I said consisted
[6009.679] of five layers with a central core layer
[6012.239] the one that was to serve as the barrier
[6014.32] to water
[6015.719] penetration and it was composed of
[6017.92] fryable
[6019.08] lust.
[6020.76] What over the lust core were layers of
[6023.44] rock and clay extracted from the site
[6025.6] and from borrow pits nearby. At its
[6028.48] completion, the Teton Dam consumed
[6031.6] something like 10 million cubic yards of
[6034.88] earth and rock material.
[6038.48] By the beginning of 1976, the dam was,
[6041.199] for the most part, complete. Officials
[6043.36] had already begun filling the reservoir
[6045.199] in October of
[6046.679] 1975. The approved filling rate for a
[6049.44] large dam reservoir was generally not
[6051.92] permitted to exceed a maximum rise of
[6055.04] about 1 foot per day. This allows the
[6058.96] site to adjust slowly to the
[6060.88] substantially increased pressure imposed
[6062.96] by the weight of a large body of water.
[6066.44] However, in the spring of
[6069.32] 1976, two occurrences conspired against
[6073.04] this preferred filling rate. First,
[6075.92] there was a an unusually heavy snow pack
[6078.239] on the Teton Mountains that winter. And
[6080.96] second, the month of May was unusually
[6083.56] warm. The warm weather triggered a rapid
[6086.48] melting of the copious volume of snow
[6088.8] which had accumulated and that caused a
[6091.44] rapid rise in river level.
[6094.159] The decision was made to capture the
[6096.96] increased amount of meltwater, thereby
[6100.159] accelerating the filling of the
[6102.159] reservoir and hence the completion date
[6104.32] for the project because the project was
[6107.6] significantly at that point behind
[6109.639] schedule due to the numerous delays that
[6113.04] arose from the highly problematic site
[6116.6] preparation. Okay, so now they're
[6118.719] behind. they get this big melt,
[6121.199] accelerated melt, right? So, the
[6124.88] reservoir was allowed to fill at its
[6126.96] natural rate rather than its controlled
[6129.4] rate. This led to water level rise over
[6133.199] four times greater than the recommended
[6136.28] rate. A process that should have taken
[6138.719] up to three years was virtually
[6140.639] completed in that single spring of 1976.
[6144.8] What compounded the problem of the
[6146.8] accelerated lake level was the fact that
[6148.719] the outlets by which the water level
[6151.28] could be drawn down were only partially
[6154.28] operational. So this was major mistake
[6156.88] number
[6159.639] four.
[6161.639] Uh so in the first few days of June
[6165.56] 1976, as the reservoir reached about 280
[6168.96] ft in depth uh behind the dam, about 30
[6173.199] ft below the dam crest and about 15 ft
[6177.52] below the overflow spillway, several
[6180.84] springs showed up downstream from the
[6183.52] dam, indicating that water was leaking
[6186.56] through the bedrock base. Early in the
[6189.6] morning of June 5th, a Morrison Nudson
[6192.719] worker arrived at the site to find a
[6195.44] leak in the dam itself about 15 feet
[6198.96] above the stream bed close to where it
[6201.36] abudded the right canyon wall as one was
[6204.4] looking
[6205.239] downstream. The measured rate of leakage
[6208.08] was about 20 to 30 cubic feet per
[6210.159] second. The time of the discovery of
[6212.719] this leak was between 7:30 and 8:00 a.m.
[6216.32] And this was the beginning of the end of
[6218.48] the Teton Dam. Around 9:00 a.m., the
[6222.56] project manager, Robert Robinson, made a
[6226.239] closer inspection of the of the leak and
[6228.56] discovered that its flow rate had
[6230.96] increased to nearly 50 cubic feet per
[6233.6] second. He also noticed a second smaller
[6236.48] leak issuing from the abutment rock near
[6239.92] its contact with the embankment about
[6243.44] 130 ft below the
[6245.08] crest. Somewhere between 9:30 and 10:00
[6248.159] a.m. a wet spot appeared on the
[6250.159] downstream face of the dam no more than
[6253.199] about 20 ft from the abutman. The wet
[6256.48] spot quickly turned into active seepage
[6260.08] and a hole appeared. At this point, it
[6263.199] was clear that action must be taken. As
[6266.0] the hole was growing larger, two
[6267.8] bulldozers bulldozer dozers were
[6271.199] dispatched to push boulder material into
[6273.76] the hole, but it continued to erode
[6276.48] faster than they were able to fill it.
[6278.56] Now, I've got a series of photographs
[6280.239] we're about to look at here. Um, at
[6283.119] 10:30 a.m., Teton Dam project officials
[6286.719] alerted the sheriff's offices in both
[6289.28] Madison and Fremont counties to begin
[6292.48] preparing for the onset of a devastating
[6295.36] flood in the downstream area. At about
[6298.239] 11:00 a.m., one of the dozers started to
[6300.96] slide into the hole. The second dozer
[6303.76] operator worked frantically to pull it
[6305.84] out, but his effort was futile, for the
[6308.56] hole enlarged as fast as the first dozer
[6311.52] could be pulled back. Finally, both
[6314.92] dozers, bulldozers, slid into the
[6318.239] expanding hole and were swept away in
[6321.6] the
[6324.84] torrent. Sometime between 11 and 11:30,
[6328.48] this is still in the morning now.
[6329.76] Project officials called the sheriff's
[6331.76] office and informed them that people
[6334.239] living in the flood path must be
[6336.48] evacuated
[6337.88] immediately. As the call was being made,
[6340.48] a whirlpool appeared in the reservoir
[6343.84] just above
[6345.96] uh just upstream of the swiftly
[6349.04] expanding leak. Two more bulldozers made
[6352.08] a frantic and futile effort to shovel
[6354.159] rip wrap into the whirlpool, but it was
[6357.36] sucked down as fast as they could dump
[6359.36] it in. The world pool quickly expanded
[6362.32] from a few feet in diameter to about 20
[6364.88] feet as the hole in the dam face
[6367.679] continued to grow.
[6371.92] At about 3 minutes before noon, a large
[6374.48] section of the dam crest gave way and a
[6378.0] massive wall of water poured through the
[6380.28] opening. The roing torrent of some 80
[6384.08] billion gallons carried away about 4
[6386.719] million cubic yards of embankment
[6389.0] material that now mantles the floor of
[6391.76] the canyon for miles downstream.
[6394.639] The pumping station and powerhouse at
[6397.44] the base of the dam were completely
[6399.159] obliterated and buried by the mass of
[6401.84] water and
[6403.56] mud. Time magazine for June 21st, 1976
[6408.8] ran a story recounting the experiences
[6411.84] of a family who witnessed the entire
[6413.84] collapse from start to finish. Dale
[6416.8] Howard was a geography professor at
[6419.199] Minot or Minote State College in North
[6421.92] Dakota who visited the site that
[6423.76] Saturday morning with his family and
[6426.32] while he was snapping pictures from an
[6428.32] observation platform which are some of
[6430.48] the pictures we're going to see. Uh he
[6432.8] noticed quote that darn hole started
[6436.239] growing quite slowly at first forming a
[6439.119] small waterfall down one side. It still
[6442.08] looked like just a minor leak. As Howard
[6445.36] continued shooting, the collapse began
[6447.199] to unfold before his eyes, and he was
[6449.199] able to record the color pictures
[6451.36] documenting the progressive failures
[6453.36] that we're about to look at. When the
[6455.76] two bulldozers were sucked into the
[6457.6] hole, it became apparent that Howard and
[6459.28] his family were witness witnesses to
[6461.52] something truly extraordinary. He
[6463.92] commented, "My wife was excited and my
[6466.48] kids were crying because they thought
[6468.32] the world was coming to an
[6470.36] end. It was really frightening. If I had
[6474.159] had a weak heart, maybe it would have
[6477.08] stopped. The hole was enormous and huge
[6480.08] chunks were breaking off. By this time,
[6482.639] you could see daylight through the hole.
[6484.4] It was almost like a natural bridge.
[6486.56] Then the whole thing fell and it was
[6488.639] just a raging torrent. Howard goes on to
[6492.32] describe that when this raging torrent
[6494.08] hit the power plant that it just
[6497.04] disintegrated.
[6499.08] Uh, the water picked up a huge oil tank
[6502.4] like a cork and away it went. There was
[6505.6] a beautiful grove of cottonwood trees
[6507.52] down below and they were snapped off
[6509.04] like matchsticks. Later, I could see the
[6511.6] water out on the plane. It was like a
[6514.76] surrealistic
[6516.52] picture. As the torrent of water surged
[6519.6] down river, residents of the towns lying
[6522.159] in its path, Sugar City, Teton, and
[6525.56] Newale scrambled to evacuate, having to
[6529.199] leave in such a rush that most of their
[6531.199] belongings were left behind. Luckily,
[6534.159] Teton and Newale were on higher ground
[6536.08] and spared the worst ravages of the
[6538.4] flood wave. Another town, Wilford, did
[6541.679] not fare so well, receiving the full
[6543.52] force of the flood. It was literally
[6546.0] wiped off the face of the map. When the
[6548.56] surging flood wave reached Sugar City at
[6551.52] about 1:00, it was 15 feet deep. The
[6554.56] largest city in the path of the flood
[6556.32] was Rexburg. As the flood swept into
[6559.04] Rexburg, it struck a logging mill on the
[6561.36] outskirts of town, and hundreds of
[6564.0] massive logs were picked up by the
[6566.56] powerful currents and became battering
[6568.88] rams that smashed and destroyed
[6570.96] buildings by the hundreds. Can you
[6574.0] imagine witnessing that?
[6576.92] God.
[6578.52] And it took about eight hours for the
[6581.199] reservoir to empty. 35,000 people had to
[6585.36] be evacuated within hours to minutes.
[6588.4] Hundreds of families had their homes
[6590.679] obliterated. 14 people lost their lives.
[6594.159] Uh several thousand were injured.
[6596.639] Irrigation canals that brought water to
[6598.639] farms and crops were choked with debris
[6600.719] and rendered useless. Highways, railroad
[6603.6] lines, and power lines were damaged or
[6605.6] destroyed. Seven bridges were destroyed.
[6608.639] Cars, trucks, trailer homes, and whole
[6610.719] houses were swept away. An estimated
[6613.8] 400,000 acres of farmland were
[6616.679] inundated. An estimated 13,000 to 20,000
[6620.639] head of cattle were drowned and swept
[6623.639] away. And in the aftermath, their
[6626.0] corpses littered the flood pathway.
[6629.92] The flood waters cut a swath of
[6631.76] destruction for some 80 miles along the
[6634.0] Teton and Snake valleys from the dam
[6636.56] site to American Falls reservoir. Some
[6639.119] estimates place the value of the flood
[6641.04] damage as high as $2 billion. Now that's
[6643.6] in 1976
[6645.92] um
[6647.159] dollars. The devastation was extreme as
[6650.4] the following images demonstrate which
[6652.56] we're just about to look at. Uh let's
[6656.32] see. Uh, and yeah, we'll see this. But
[6659.76] here's the thing that gets really
[6662.48] interesting to me, and maybe I have
[6664.4] something about that here.
[6666.199] Uh, there's a whole series of monumental
[6668.8] dams along the Snake River, and the
[6671.52] first one that this flood water was
[6673.36] going to reach was the one at American
[6674.88] Falls Reservoir. So the engineers uh
[6679.6] were afraid that uh when that water when
[6683.679] that surge reached that dam, it was
[6686.56] going to over top the dam at American
[6688.84] Falls. It would fail and all the volume
[6692.0] of American Falls reservoir would be
[6694.159] added to the
[6696.28] flood and they were literally fearing
[6699.28] that it was possibly going to be a
[6701.36] domino effect all the way down the
[6703.84] snake. And then of course all that water
[6705.84] is moving down to Colombia. And if if
[6708.08] that had happened and this was a
[6709.599] realistic
[6710.92] possibility. Um and if that were to
[6713.36] happen that would have been obviously
[6715.199] the greatest disaster in American
[6717.84] history bar none.
[6721.48] Um you know would have been of a class
[6723.76] by itself. So let's get to the pictures
[6727.119] here. Okay. Yeah. Here we go.
[6731.08] Um, the disaster that occurred was
[6733.84] tragic enough in its own right. The
[6736.4] flood waters drowned some 80 miles of
[6738.96] the Teton and Snake River valleys. But
[6741.84] it could have been worse. A lot worse.
[6745.599] The Teton River is a tributary to the
[6748.159] Snake River. About a 100 miles
[6750.48] downstream from Teton Dam lay American
[6753.119] Falls Reservoir on the Snake. This
[6756.159] reservoir contains about a half cubic
[6758.639] mile of water. In 1976, the dam
[6762.639] retaining that reservoir was known to be
[6765.76] severely deteriorated and in need of
[6768.84] replacement. Officials rightly feared
[6771.599] that if a substantial volume of water
[6773.599] rushing down the Teton River were to
[6775.36] overwhelm American Falls Reservoir, this
[6778.32] old decrepit dam would probably fail,
[6781.199] adding another half cubic mile of water
[6783.36] to the flood. This augmented flood surge
[6786.56] would then race down the Snake River
[6788.32] Canyon about 30 miles until it reached
[6791.28] Lake
[6792.199] Walcut, held in by the Mina Dam. This
[6797.04] dam would then likely fail, adding the
[6799.76] water of Lake Walcott and swelling the
[6802.639] flood even further. Between the Minadoka
[6806.0] Dam and the confluence of the Snake
[6808.48] River and the Columbia River lay eight
[6811.36] more dams with their reservoirs.
[6814.96] Officials and engineers begin to panic
[6818.0] as they realize the potential for all of
[6820.56] these dams to fail one after another
[6823.28] like
[6824.36] dominoes. But that's not all. Along the
[6827.52] Colombia between the Snake River and
[6829.52] Portland lay another four dams with
[6832.159] large reservoirs which likely would have
[6834.56] been overtopped. Had this worst case
[6837.44] scenario occurred, it is possible
[6839.52] possibly could have been one of the
[6842.159] greatest disasters of modern times. No
[6845.04] doubt the greatest disaster in American
[6847.119] history. In
[6849.239] desperation, officials raced to open the
[6852.159] outlet works of American Falls Reservoir
[6855.679] uh full boore in an effort to drain as
[6858.239] much water as possible before the flood
[6860.96] torrent arrived. However, one of the
[6863.599] same factors that contributed to the
[6866.239] failure of Teton Dam in the first place
[6869.199] uh now acted to mitigate uh the extreme
[6871.92] disaster of multiple flood multiple dam
[6874.8] failures. And this was the porocity of
[6877.84] the riolyte basalt bedrock. By the time
[6881.119] the flood surge reached American Falls,
[6883.679] it had substantially diminished in force
[6885.84] and volume because much of the water had
[6888.56] soaked into the highly permeable
[6891.4] bedrock. American Falls reservoir was
[6893.92] able to absorb the additional volume of
[6895.679] water and an extreme calamity was
[6898.28] averted. Two years later, the dam at
[6901.199] American Falls was replaced.
[6905.36] Thankfully, the worst case scenario did
[6907.84] not
[6908.679] materialize. However, had it done so, it
[6910.96] would have initiated one of the massive
[6914.32] floods that swept it would have
[6916.36] imitated one of the massive floods that
[6919.119] swept down the Colombia to the Pacific
[6921.04] Ocean at the end of the last ice age. A
[6923.76] scenario of multiple dams failing one
[6925.84] after another as they are overwhelmed by
[6927.679] an everinccreasing flood volume might at
[6930.639] first seem too extreme to be realistic,
[6932.56] but even such a flood as that would be
[6934.679] minuscule when contrasted with some of
[6937.199] nature's mighty floods of the past. The
[6940.159] deluges that came through the Colombia
[6942.0] at the end of the last ice age were
[6943.36] among the most massive floods ever
[6945.76] documented to have occurred in the
[6947.52] entire history of the
[6949.56] earth which you know everybody knows.
[6953.48] Uh but here's the
[6955.96] thing I think we would be looking at a
[6958.48] very similar process because you know
[6961.28] the conventional view is you have
[6962.96] glacial lakes held in by ice dams. Well,
[6966.56] the assumption is, you know, where is
[6968.239] the the the temporal framework? Where's
[6970.239] the chronology of that? I would guess
[6972.88] that rather than being separated by
[6974.88] years and decades, you might have had
[6977.44] multiple damn failures, but one right
[6980.4] after another almost. That's why I'm
[6982.639] saying that this might have imitated the
[6984.159] process at the end of the last ice age.
[6987.44] So, let's go back now and we'll go
[6989.679] through this amazing set of pictures
[6992.239] here that I've pulled together. We've
[6993.679] seen the first one. Uh, now let's go to
[6998.88] the dam before
[7002.199] failure. Okay. Well, there you can see
[7004.88] some of the dozers and heavy equipment
[7007.04] up on top of the dam there. So, this is
[7009.119] it says, yeah, uh, May of
[7012.44] 76. Then we'll scroll down. So, here.
[7017.52] Okay. This is There we go. Review. Okay.
[7021.28] to this as it says aerial photo of the
[7023.599] Teton dam as it was nearing completion.
[7025.599] This was taken on September 26th,
[7029.239] 1975. This would be the right abutment
[7031.679] over here. And of course, you can see
[7033.679] there there's no really filling of the
[7037.28] reservoir yet above the on the upside of
[7039.92] the dam. Here's the
[7041.719] spillway. Um star marks the approximate
[7045.679] position near the right abutment where
[7048.239] the leak began.
[7051.159] Uh well, I don't I guess the star didn't
[7054.239] come through, but it's it's right over
[7055.84] here in this area. Yeah. Uh note the
[7059.599] power and pumping station at the base of
[7061.84] the dam right down
[7066.84] here. All right. So, there's uh looking
[7069.36] downstream. So, here you can see the
[7071.199] reservoir is starting to fill. This is
[7073.599] May 21st, 1976, 16 days before the
[7077.679] failure. Uh note the Snake River plane
[7080.96] beyond the mouth of the Teton Canyon.
[7083.28] That's this area out here. Uh failure
[7086.639] occurred near the boundary between the
[7088.4] embankment and the abutment on the right
[7090.719] side of the dam looking downstream.
[7092.88] Arrow points to the right abutment. So
[7094.96] this is where the major failure occurred
[7096.96] right
[7099.639] here. And there we see image taken about
[7102.76] 10:45 a.m. The wet spot has turned into
[7106.32] a substantial leak. And you see the
[7108.8] muddy water beginning to enter the
[7110.88] valley
[7111.96] downstream. The pumping station and
[7114.4] power stations are still unscathed. You
[7116.8] see them over here, but not for long.
[7119.52] Arrow points to a bulldozer. Well, I
[7122.32] guess some of the formatting didn't come
[7123.84] through, but you can see right up here.
[7125.44] That's a bulldozer
[7127.679] uh making its way toward the leak.
[7133.52] And here, right here, you can see
[7135.119] there's the leak right here. And they're
[7137.84] dumping rubble, bouldery rubble,
[7140.56] thinking that that's going to stem the
[7142.84] leak.
[7144.76] Uh after vainly trying to fill uh break
[7148.48] an embankment of Teton Dam, two CAT
[7151.88] operators back toward safety as their
[7155.719] bulldozers slide into the widening gap.
[7158.56] Look at this down here. Look at him just
[7161.599] standing there though. Get the freak
[7163.04] out,
[7165.0] man. Hey, Ed, look at that. There goes
[7168.159] my dozer. My cat. Yeah, look at that.
[7171.719] Jesus. Getting sucked
[7174.28] in. Let's go to the next one. Okay, so
[7176.96] here we go. image taken about 11:20 a.m.
[7180.8] This one was
[7182.92] uh doesn't give us the time, but it just
[7187.84] the teacher that happened to be there in
[7189.679] the observatory parking lot across the
[7192.96] way. That's amazing. And here, yeah, as
[7195.76] you can see, the water uh is rising
[7198.159] against the walls of the pumping station
[7200.32] right down here.
[7207.76] Holy crap. The hole the hole has
[7210.639] continued to enlarge, eating its way
[7213.44] back into the mass of the dam. Here it
[7216.48] is about to breach the dam
[7221.4] crest. Look at there. Now the breach of
[7223.76] the dam crest is beginning. Look at that
[7226.239] water that's gushing here through here.
[7228.719] The leak has turned into a turbulent
[7230.719] rush of muddy water.
[7237.76] A large section of the dam has collapsed
[7240.239] right here. Look at this. So here you
[7242.32] can see there's a powerful torrent of
[7244.88] sediment choked water rushes through the
[7246.96] gap and the power station and pump house
[7249.92] have been buried beneath the mass of mud
[7251.84] and water.
[7258.4] Aerial view of the damn breach at peak
[7260.4] discharge. Brad, what you're
[7263.239] s I wonder if we could I I don't know if
[7265.679] I have in here the peak discharge of
[7268.639] this flow. I'd really like to know that.
[7272.36] Um we could find it, I bet. And here
[7276.32] here's the Teton dam the day after
[7278.48] failure looking
[7280.04] upstream. Uh note that the power station
[7282.639] is completely buried. Uh now am I
[7287.36] correct that this all this is gone now
[7290.08] and only this
[7292.08] Uh, this mound of material still
[7295.44] remains. Just that center hill. Yeah,
[7297.36] the Uhhuh. That other side's gone, too.
[7301.119] I guess they took that out cuz they
[7303.04] feared that that could
[7308.52] collapse. And there we have tsunami like
[7311.44] flood waves sweeping over farmland as it
[7314.639] exits the Teton Canyon and spreads out
[7317.36] over the Snake River plane.
[7320.199] uh this doomed farm is about to be
[7323.52] engulfed. Can you imagine the feelings
[7325.28] of the family that sees this wave
[7327.679] oncoming as they scrambled to evacuate
[7329.92] their farm their farm to utter
[7333.239] ruin? So this you can see this is very
[7335.92] instructive because this is what floods
[7338.4] do when they exit a confined channel.
[7340.88] They spread out. Now, of course, when
[7343.28] they spread out, they they lose
[7344.96] velocity, and that's why you see delta
[7347.92] fans and boulder bars and things like
[7350.679] that deposited at places where confined
[7355.119] flows uh open up into basins or more
[7359.679] unrestricted
[7362.52] flows. I got a number for you here.
[7365.88] Okay. My power is dropping. There's big
[7369.44] storms coming through here. Yeah. Peak
[7371.84] peak dam failure outflow of
[7375.4] 2,300,000 cubic feet per second.
[7379.88] 2,300,000. Okay. So, I'm going to
[7383.56] put Bonavville
[7386.92] flood divide that by 2 million
[7392.04] 300,000.
[7396.679] Uh so basically the Bonavville flood was
[7400.08] about 18 times bigger than this at its
[7404.36] peak. So this times about 18. However,
[7408.4] to get to 40 million. Yeah. Yeah. Like
[7411.36] where this flood lasted a day, the
[7414.32] Bonavville flood lasted for at least
[7416.159] several months.
[7419.84] The raging flood overtakes the farm
[7421.679] which is in the process of being washed
[7423.52] away. So if this was your farm, this
[7426.08] would really
[7429.56] suck. There you have drowned fast tracks
[7432.96] of prime agricultural land were
[7437.719] drowned. Yeah, look at this. The swath
[7440.0] of destruction reached up to eight miles
[7442.4] in width.
[7449.119] Let's see that. Rexburg, Ohio,
[7452.76] Idaho. After the flood, it lies about 14
[7455.84] miles southwest of Teton Dam. Brigham
[7458.8] Young University, then Rick's College in
[7461.28] the foreground. Uh was elevated enough
[7464.32] to escape flooding and was utilized by
[7466.639] the Mormon Church to provide food and
[7468.719] shelter to thousands of displaced and
[7471.44] homeless flood victims.
[7476.88] So, there's a museum in Rexburg now.
[7481.36] Typical street scene in Rexburg as the
[7483.599] flood surge passed through
[7487.159] town.
[7490.599] Wow. Drowned neighborhoods, you know.
[7494.08] So, here you got neighbors out
[7495.36] navigating streets by
[7500.119] boat. Yeah. I was uh 25 years old when
[7503.52] this
[7505.48] happened. The inundation of Rexburg. You
[7508.639] can see out
[7509.639] here cars almost completely
[7516.119] submerged. Downtown
[7525.0] Rexburg. Residents witnessing the
[7527.28] drowning of their town.
[7533.52] One hour to
[7535.239] evacuate. Can you
[7537.88] imagine? So the
[7540.04] aftermath. Let's see
[7546.52] what the swath of
[7551.0] destruction. Yeah. How would you like to
[7552.88] see that that rush of water coming on,
[7556.719] you know, carrying all of that?
[7563.719] Jeez. Many irrigation canals that
[7566.4] brought water to thousands of acres of
[7568.159] crops were choked with debris and
[7570.56] rendered useless. Here you can see the a
[7573.599] piece of the irrigation canal there and
[7575.52] then it's just completely like it says
[7581.239] choked. So the flood left a massive
[7584.08] thick layer of mud and debris in its
[7586.0] wake.
[7590.639] whole communities were submerged and
[7592.56] laid to waste. So yeah, the whole just
[7596.56] left the whole town with a thick layer
[7598.719] of mud. All the streets, all the the
[7602.079] property.
[7605.52] I've been seeing it myself. Yep. One of
[7608.4] the many houses swept off its foundation
[7610.48] by the force of the water.
[7618.4] Downtown
[7626.599] Rexburg. Yeah. First the damage of the
[7629.199] swiftly moving water followed by the
[7631.199] deposition of a thick layer of mud over
[7636.52] everything. Railroad
[7641.4] tracks. Yeah.
[7646.159] Oh yeah. So yeah, the amount of top soil
[7648.56] stripped away can be gauged from the
[7650.079] separation of the railway tracks from
[7652.56] the post flood ground
[7657.159] surface.
[7666.679] Whoa. Yeah, look at this guy sitting
[7668.96] here.
[7670.88] Wonder what's going through his mind
[7673.56] now. If he's still with us, he probably
[7676.4] remembers this day. Well,
[7680.239] at least it didn't get in my truck. Look
[7682.719] at this
[7684.52] one. A homeowner sitting on the step and
[7687.28] foundation of what had been her house,
[7689.76] utterly swept away by the torrent. Note
[7692.32] the scoured and pockm marked character
[7694.56] of the landscape.
[7700.0] Yeah. So, what kind of feelings would
[7701.44] you be having at that
[7707.239] moment? All of the streets of Rexburg
[7710.159] and Sugar City were covered with
[7711.599] wreckage and
[7715.8] mud. Massive damage to infra. Look at
[7718.4] this. This bridge collapsed. the
[7720.159] railroad
[7725.159] tracks.
[7728.44] Um, yeah. In the effort to understand
[7731.52] the causes and origins of this
[7733.199] monumental failure, there were a number
[7734.96] of conclusions arrived at by the various
[7736.96] investigating committees. No final
[7739.44] agreement was ever reached as to any
[7741.44] single cause for the failure, but I
[7743.84] think it obvious from the results of the
[7745.52] various investigations that it was the
[7747.36] unique confluence of factors that
[7749.84] interacted cumulatively and pushed the
[7752.079] system from relative stability to
[7754.32] catastrophic
[7755.639] instability. From the time of the first
[7757.76] indication of a problem to the collapse
[7760.639] was only about 5 hours. In his very
[7763.44] useful reference on the failure of earth
[7765.44] embankment dams, selected case histories
[7768.239] of dam failures and accidents caused by
[7770.4] internal erosion. Author David Mama
[7773.96] Maidma presents 10 case histories of
[7776.639] failure including Teton Dam. In his
[7779.52] summary of this event, he presents the
[7781.199] seven most likely mechanisms that may
[7783.04] have initiated the failure. I won't
[7785.44] dwell on the technical details of the
[7787.199] various failure mechanisms, but Madema
[7790.079] sums up the general understanding that
[7791.92] has emerged when he states, "While the
[7794.239] exact cause of the failure is not known,
[7796.159] it is commonly accepted that a
[7797.76] concentrated flow of high-pressure
[7799.44] reservoir water passed through open
[7801.679] cracks in the rock upstream of the key
[7804.719] trench on the right abutment and road
[7806.88] eroded the very erodable silt material,
[7809.52] silt fill material, which was then
[7812.079] carried into large open cracks
[7814.079] downstream. of the key trench. This very
[7817.44] erodable silt filled material is the
[7819.76] affforementioned lust used in the core
[7822.719] layer. The key trench referred to is in
[7824.96] this case a large roughly 70t deep slot
[7828.239] excavated into the bedrock below both
[7831.119] abutments that was supposed to act as an
[7833.36] additional barrier to water penetration
[7836.159] well below the mass of the dam proper.
[7839.4] Um ah as pointed out by F. Ross Peterson
[7842.639] in the damn Teton dam disaster, tragedy
[7845.04] or triumph. 95% of the people affected
[7847.679] by the flood were Mormons whose presence
[7850.4] in the upper Snake River Valley goes
[7852.48] back to the 1880s. In this semi-arid
[7855.52] region, the lifeblood of their farms and
[7857.36] communities has always been water. Most
[7860.4] Mormons in the area therefore favored
[7862.32] construction of the dam. However, it was
[7864.719] this shared heritage that dramatically
[7866.719] lessened the severity of post flood
[7869.679] recovery efforts. Interestingly, as
[7872.079] Peterson describes in the above
[7874.4] referenced work, quote, the similar
[7876.8] religious beliefs of the valley
[7878.32] residents created an immediate folklore
[7881.28] of premonitions, miracles, and divine
[7884.199] intervention. This phenomena is worth
[7886.48] dwelling upon, and I don't know how much
[7888.079] we want to get into that, but it's
[7891.119] really interesting. Just like in many of
[7892.639] these disasters, we find there is this
[7895.119] almost metaphysical component to it. And
[7898.0] that was definitely not missing from
[7900.119] this. Um,
[7903.48] so in the interest of time, we probably
[7906.52] won't go into that and maybe we can do
[7909.44] another cover that in another episode.
[7913.04] Sure. But this was um Yeah. People love
[7915.599] the stories of that from the from the
[7917.28] Peshigo fires and everything. Oh yeah,
[7918.8] there's similar stuff right here. Yeah.
[7922.239] Men, choose your weapons. Volunteers go
[7924.8] to work. And this is a good this is an
[7928.079] amazing part of the story. People of all
[7931.199] ages came to lend a
[7933.719] hand. See, in the aftermath of this
[7936.079] disaster, people came
[7938.04] together. Spontaneous cooperation in
[7941.04] time of need. Now, no government
[7944.239] bureaucracy saying saying you have to
[7946.239] fill out this form, you have to follow
[7948.32] this procedure, these rules, these
[7950.44] regulations. No. People just came out
[7952.8] spontaneously and did what they had to
[7954.719] do. And there's there was between the
[7957.599] disaster and the recovery efforts there
[7960.32] was minimal
[7962.52] bureaucracy. So yeah
[7965.159] um the central creed of the LDS church
[7968.239] is disaster preparedness. The efficiency
[7971.199] of the family self-help and church
[7973.199] operated welfare systems ensured that
[7976.159] almost no one went hungry. Now to this
[7978.8] to me this is important because what we
[7980.56] have here is an alternate to a
[7983.52] government bureaucracy handing out
[7985.84] relief and
[7987.0] welfare and one has to ask this
[7989.52] question. If the government was not
[7992.599] monopolizing that whole process, which
[7994.88] it does clearly, what could have emerged
[7997.76] or what still could emerge as an
[7999.8] alternate if local communities are left?
[8002.88] It's up to you, you guys, the states,
[8004.88] the local communities, the counties to
[8007.52] to be prepared. And the uh LDS church
[8011.84] shows us that it can be done.
[8014.76] Um, as it was, the leaders of the church
[8017.36] and the local government leaders were
[8019.52] frequently the same people. The
[8021.599] effectiveness of the locally managed and
[8023.84] coordinated response left federal
[8026.56] agencies free to focus on restoring
[8029.44] electrical power and transportation and
[8032.079] communication lines. There we go.
[8034.719] General James Brooks, who was director
[8037.119] of disaster services for Idaho,
[8039.04] commented, "The church organization
[8041.52] functioned marvelously under these kinds
[8043.84] of conditions, and I'd have to say more
[8046.8] effectively than most anything I've
[8048.719] seen."
[8050.639] Uh, we'll cover that kind of dimension
[8054.0] of it in another episode, but it says
[8057.44] here, Teton Dam after failure. So, here
[8060.639] we're looking downstream. Here's where
[8063.04] the right abutment failed. Like Brad
[8065.119] said, this has all been removed now. Um,
[8068.96] note the obvious scouring along the
[8071.119] lower section of the canyon wall. Uh,
[8075.119] right over
[8076.199] here. You see that? Here you can see the
[8078.48] high water mark very clearly etched into
[8081.04] the canyon wall. Oh yeah.
[8087.119] Um,
[8091.44] this is not a newspaper article. You
[8093.119] wrote all this. I wrote all this. Yeah.
[8095.199] Yeah.
[8097.36] A view of the canyon below the dam taken
[8099.52] in
[8101.32] 1977. Um, the Teton River, and this is
[8104.639] this is valuable, too. The Teton River
[8107.36] has cut a new channel through the
[8109.679] massive flood debris that chokes the
[8111.36] canyon floor. This debris is composed of
[8114.079] the roughly 4 million cubic yards of dam
[8116.239] material that was swept downstream by
[8117.92] the discharging flood waters. Scouring
[8120.88] and uh erosion on the canyon walls from
[8123.84] the passage of the flood torance is
[8125.92] readily visible. You see it right along
[8128.119] here. Uh these features can yield
[8130.96] insight into the great duvial
[8133.44] catastrophes of the past. Absolutely
[8136.0] they
[8136.84] can. Well, just in case people were
[8139.36] wondering in the back of their head the
[8140.48] whole time, the Teton River. Yes. Comes
[8142.639] out of the Grand Tetons. Yes. On the
[8145.36] border with Wyoming and and we can see
[8147.44] them from the site there on the horizon.
[8150.96] The the craggy jagged mountain tops
[8153.36] there that are the Grand Tetons in that
[8155.239] range. Uh so yeah, we will be able to
[8157.84] see those. But that's definitely
[8159.28] connected.
[8161.199] Yeah. So I think we'll conclude with
[8163.44] this. Um there's another important
[8166.88] lesson to be learned from this
[8168.079] particular event. A well-prepared,
[8170.48] self-reliant people
[8172.599] spontaneously, voluntarily, and
[8174.8] harmoniously rose to the challenge, came
[8177.119] together to alleviate the worst excesses
[8179.76] of the disaster to render aid and
[8182.159] assistance, and to provide food and
[8183.92] shelter to thousands of victims. It must
[8186.56] be acknowledged that local, state, and
[8188.239] federal officials responded effectively
[8190.239] as well. But it must also be recognized
[8192.96] that the ethos of government was even
[8195.04] then undergoing decline as evidenced by
[8197.92] the failure of the Teton Dam project
[8200.92] itself. Nevertheless, it still retained
[8203.439] enough individuals endowed with the
[8205.2] traditional values of honor,
[8207.399] self-reliance, and government as servant
[8209.92] of the people to rise to the the demands
[8212.8] and challenges of the occasion. And it
[8215.76] must also be recognized that the
[8217.2] deterioration and
[8218.76] bureaucratization of government has
[8220.8] continued a pace since then and as it
[8223.679] has expanded in scope and power it has
[8225.76] declined in efficiency and
[8227.84] accountability.
[8229.439] Uh this was clearly demonstrated by the
[8231.84] incompetent federal response to her
[8233.76] hurricane Katrina and I would say also
[8237.2] with the response to hurricane Helena as
[8239.84] well which this was written well before
[8243.76] hurricane Helena.
[8246.2] Um so yeah we get into that. Uh there's
[8250.399] there's an important reason why I end up
[8252.479] with this out here, the Saturn rocket
[8255.28] which was left to rust. uh because it's
[8258.16] kind of a metaphor, an icon of what's
[8260.8] happening to America's infrastructure
[8262.559] right now as we speak. And unless
[8266.24] something is done in the next decade,
[8268.559] we're going to see more massive failures
[8271.12] of America's
[8273.319] infrastructure. And uh that's something
[8275.599] that needs to be addressed. And this is
[8278.479] uh takes us directly into the realm of
[8280.96] politics and what national priorities
[8282.8] are. But my mind is is how many events
[8285.92] is it going to take? Perhaps even more
[8288.399] events on the scale of the Teton Dam
[8290.599] disaster before we change our
[8293.599] orientation to how we deal with things
[8296.399] like this. So,
[8298.76] um anyways, uh I think that's probably
[8302.399] where we'll wrap it up for now, unless
[8304.8] Brad, you have something else to to say.
[8307.679] No, this is that's a good summation.
[8310.16] That's a amazing story and great that
[8312.639] you wrote all that up. Um, so yeah, I'll
[8314.719] add some photos and uh, yeah, quite an
[8317.519] episode here back with
[8319.24] Cosmographia. Keep up with Randall and
[8321.359] Square in the Circle and the big picture
[8324.0] he's doing with Beckett. And uh, I'm I'm
[8327.599] looking at reviving the radio show I
[8330.319] did. Oh. When I first met with Randall
[8334.399] and he said, "Yeah, I've never done
[8336.559] that, but I think I ought to eventually
[8338.559] be doing more of those things." And yes,
[8341.04] you have. So, yeah, I was actually
[8344.28] considering bringing it back on 928,
[8347.04] which was a a pertinent date for my life
[8350.8] in many ways and uh ended up again
[8354.16] that's when the flood was. So, there was
[8356.8] no debut of the aware state update. Uh
[8359.599] but yep, coming soon, maybe the summer.
[8362.399] So, uh too much to keep silent. Yeah,
[8366.399] we're going to be visiting the site of
[8369.28] the Teton Dam failure. So, we're going
[8371.28] to get to see a lot of Well, what's
[8373.519] interesting, we'll get to see uh what
[8376.16] the intervening decades have done to
[8378.88] begin to restore some of these features
[8381.519] that were so obvious in that year, say
[8385.679] after
[8387.599] um the disaster.
[8390.84] Um so, how many years has it been?
[8393.28] Almost a half a century. 49 years. Yeah.
[8397.04] 49 years. So, I'm looking forward to
[8399.92] that that visit of during our Bonavville
[8403.68] flood tour.
[8406.359] Absolutely. Yeah, it's it's very it's
[8408.479] very interesting and there's plenty of
[8409.76] places to roam around. So, yeah, we'll
[8411.439] spend uh all all morning there one day.
[8415.52] Okay. Going to be good one. Now, are
[8418.24] there any I guess there's no
[8421.76] uh visitor center or anything there, is
[8424.2] there? No place where we might go in and
[8426.88] talk to a No, there's nobody at
[8429.92] geologist or anything. Oh, okay. No, I
[8433.52] mean, we could probably find somebody in
[8434.88] Rexburg at the museum, but I hadn't set
[8437.12] that up. Uh, but yeah, easy enough to
[8438.96] make a call. But yeah, I mean there's a
[8441.439] parking lot and uh you know the round
[8443.84] overlook like it was set up for people
[8446.319] like any dam to visit and you know check
[8448.72] out this impressive Oh yeah. Okay.
[8450.72] Construction here, you know. So that
[8452.16] stuff is still there.
[8455.68] Abandoned, but yeah, still black top and
[8458.16] uh you know, a lot of
[8459.64] graffiti, but a couple wild goats
[8462.88] actually I ran into the first time. But
[8465.04] yeah, you can just roam around. people,
[8466.64] like I said, riding their their bikes
[8468.08] and motorbikes and down in there
[8470.479] four-wheeling and fishing and so yeah,
[8472.56] it's plenty accessible.
[8474.8] Cool. Yep. I'm going to do All right.
[8477.52] Well, it's late here. Good to see you
[8479.04] guys. Yeah, likewise. Welcome back,
[8480.64] Mike. Thanks for doing this, Randall.
[8483.52] And I think we'll have together for
[8485.04] another one. There will be some future
[8487.2] episodes that we do with the Serpent
[8489.359] Brothers. They've indicated their
[8491.52] willingness
[8493.04] to come off their high horses and you
[8495.2] know now that they're famous. All right.
[8497.28] Don't go slandering anybody else. Rock
[8498.88] stars. Well, they want to get us on on
[8501.68] their show, too. So, well, hey, I'd love
[8503.76] to do that. Let's reciprocal. It's been
[8505.359] a long time. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Well, I've
[8508.16] had some some interactions with Russ
[8510.08] lately, which were good. And then of
[8512.8] course I got Hey, I had a lot of fun
[8514.56] with them at the uh was it the last
[8517.52] cosmic summit where I was able to jam
[8519.84] with them. Well, that's right. They got
[8522.0] you I need to get their album and listen
[8524.0] to the the drum section and so rather
[8527.439] than just, you know, add libing it
[8530.88] really kind of know, you know, because
[8533.28] it does make a difference. Yeah, it's
[8536.08] it's really well done. It's great music.
[8538.16] I really enjoyed it. I've got I've got
[8539.92] the the LP right still in the in the
[8542.96] plastic cover. So I have to listen to
[8545.359] the MP3s. But yeah, it's it's really
[8547.84] good if you haven't been listening to
[8549.2] it. Well, you know, doing that cosmic
[8552.08] summit, you brought that up. So that is
[8553.68] coming up uh also same same time as
[8556.399] previous years right around the uh the
[8558.88] summer solstice and Father's Day is
[8560.8] right there second third week of week of
[8563.12] June. So you'll you'll be there
[8564.88] headlining and uh yeah, it's big crowd
[8566.88] of speakers. Oh yeah, it's going to be
[8568.8] some interesting discussions and inter
[8572.08] ideas exchange and yeah, I'm really
[8574.56] looking forward to it. It's going to be
[8575.68] in the same hotel. That's right.
[8578.359] Green. Yeah. Mhm. Yeah. We'll put the
[8580.88] link in the in the description here. Oh,
[8583.52] okay. Good. Yeah.
[8586.24] Help that crowd out. Yeah. Lots going
[8588.08] on. So, we'll do this again. Let's Let's
[8591.52] do it again.
[8593.52] All right. Couple phone calls and uh a
[8596.319] little agreement from the storms missing
[8598.479] me so my power didn't shut down and uh
[8601.359] yeah in the books coming soon. All
[8604.88] rightent Mike. Good to see you again.
[8606.88] You too. I'm glad everything's normal
[8609.04] with you.
[8610.72] That's important. Yep. What would life
[8613.6] be without a little bit of normal? Huh?
[8615.359] A little bit of normality. Normal guy.
[8618.399] Well, you Mike are our standard of
[8620.479] normality.
[8622.0] Got to balance me out. I appreciate it.
[8626.319] And Brad, wherever you are, take care.
[8629.84] Cheers, brother. Yeah,
[8631.8] man. About to hit the road. Tour coming
[8634.56] up. All right. All right. Shutting it
[8636.16] down. Great show, guys. Good night. All

Title: They Moved Mountains to Build Stonehenge
[0.08] One of the senior characters working for
[3.439] English Heritage and they oversee and
[6.24] manage the Stonehenge site, Heather Seb,
[9.599] I hope I'm pronouncing her name correct.
[11.2] She was compelled to make this comment.
[13.599] It is phenomenal that the people of the
[16.0] time brought such a large stone all this
[19.68] way. They must have had a compelling
[22.08] reason to do it. In an interview with
[24.4] f.org, or Seb speculates that Stonehenge
[28.48] isn't a settlement site, but it's a
[30.4] place of ceremony or ritual. First of
[32.88] all, I'll say yes, go to all that effort
[35.6] to transport these stones. And look,
[38.399] hey, even from 17 or 20 m away,
[41.36] transporting the the Sarsson stones for
[43.44] the for the outer ring and for the
[45.12] horseshoe triathon, that's going to be a
[47.52] major effort. 140 mi transporting all of
[50.719] the blue stones. That itself is no minor
[54.079] effort in its own right. Here's a
[56.16] convenient source of rock right here at
[58.64] the site that we'll dig up and use to
[60.559] build this monument. No, they went to
[62.32] great lengths to import stones from
[65.439] three different areas. Right. She says
[68.4] they must have had a compelling reason
[70.96] to do it. Yes, they must have had a
[73.68] compelling reason for doing so. So now
[75.92] I'm curious as to what is the nature of
[79.24] this ceremony or ritual that is being
[82.24] conducted at this site that I think we
[85.68] can now safely speculate incorporates
[88.479] astronomy. It incorporates geometry and
[92.159] obviously I think it implies that there
[94.799] were major concerns about where it's
[98.88] going to be placed.

Title: How Did a 466-Mile Stone End Up at Stonehenge?
[0.719] What's the problem here? So, here we
[2.72] have a map of the British Isles. And you
[5.52] see down here, very prominently
[6.96] displayed is Stonehenge. Where did the
[10.24] altar stone come from? It came from all
[12.719] the way up here, the same type of rock
[15.759] here ups at the very northern tip of
[18.8] Scotland. It actually also shows up on
[20.72] the Orcne Islands here. What's the
[23.6] problem here? Obviously, some method of
[27.119] transport had to be utilized to get that
[29.4] stone 460 plus miles from the northern
[33.04] tip of Scotland down to the building
[35.28] site at Stonehenge. Right in this
[38.16] article which appeared in Nature, it's
[39.92] entitled A Scottish Providence, the
[42.879] altar stone of Stonehenge. We posit that
[46.16] the altar stone was
[48.6] anthropogenically transported to
[51.0] Stonehenge from northeast Scotland,
[54.399] consistent with evidence of Neolithic
[57.44] inhabitation in the region. Whereas the
[60.32] ignous blue stones were brought around
[63.76] 225 km or 140 mi, a Scottish province or
[69.52] the alter stone demands a transport
[72.159] distance of at least
[74.68] 466 mi. Nonetheless, even with
[78.159] assistance from beasts of burden, rivers
[82.0] and topographical barriers, including
[84.88] the Grampians, southern uplands, and the
[87.64] panines, all mountain ranges, along with
[91.04] the heavily forested landscape of
[94.0] prehistoric Britain, would have posed
[97.52] formidable obstacles for overland
[101.4] megalith transportation.

Title: What They Don’t Tell You About Climate Change
[0.08] We're hearing what we hear about climate
[1.68] change. What does the average person not
[3.2] know that's going on? An awful lot.
[5.359] Specific to climate change. Okay.
[6.879] Specific to climate change. Well, I
[8.48] would say the biggest thing that they
[9.679] don't know is the degree and extent and
[13.04] frequency with which climate has changed
[15.2] naturally over and over and over again.
[17.44] I mean, I would say this. Okay. So,
[20.4] explain to me how we get from half of
[23.119] North America. The climate of half of
[25.199] North America 10 to 12 to 13 15,000
[28.48] years ago was a climate like you now
[30.56] find at the South Pole. I mean, that's
[32.32] not an exaggeration. If you believe that
[34.399] the climate that there's some steady
[36.399] state that we're supposed to find that
[38.399] we're that's what we're supposed to, you
[40.239] know, what are we trying to do here? Get
[41.44] back to the climate of the 1800s or the
[44.0] early 1900s. People don't know the
[46.399] extent to which climate has changed. So,
[48.0] I just mentioned the fact that sea
[49.68] levels rose 400 ft. Well, nobody's in
[53.199] the mainstream is really thinking about
[54.8] that. You know, you have to go to marine
[57.12] geologists. They're talking about it and
[59.12] realizing it. Oceanographers,
[62.039] paleoclimatologists who study ancient
[64.159] climate will tell you, "Yeah, it's
[66.479] overwhelming that evidence that the
[69.04] climate has changed over and over again,
[71.28] orders of magnitude beyond anything
[72.96] we've seen in the last century or two."
[74.96] That's what most people don't know. They
[76.56] don't know the degree and extent to
[78.72] which the climate has changed naturally
[80.88] without anthropogenic influences and
[82.88] long before we were driving SUVs and
[85.28] putting carbon dioxide in the
[86.56] atmosphere. The other thing they don't
[87.92] know is that the thermal capture
[90.56] ability, the longwave radiation coming
[93.36] off of the earth that the carbon dioxide
[96.159] in the atmosphere can capture is
[98.56] limited. It's in fact most of the
[100.72] thermal capture is within the first 100
[102.88] parts per million and beyond that it
[105.28] tapers off logarithmically. It's like a
[107.84] leaky sponge. That's what's being
[109.92] captured by carbon dioxide.

Title: 10,000 Generations...What Did We Forget?
[0.08] What the hell have we done for 10,500 of
[2.639] those generations? Well, I think that
[4.48] can become partially understandable when
[7.6] we understand the role of great
[9.12] catastrophes in Earth history and and
[11.44] the implications for the rise and fall
[13.04] of civilization. But that's a lot of
[16.32] generations to accumulate learning. It's
[18.88] almost like we have to assume for all
[20.56] those thousands of generations, nobody
[22.48] learned anything and passed it on to
[24.0] their their heirs, to their progeny. how
[26.88] we got from where we are now to just 300
[29.039] years ago. Well, we're sitting here at
[31.76] the leading edge of accumulated
[34.32] learning. And most of this learning,
[36.079] most of it is within the last 300 years.
[38.399] You bet. Although the core principles
[40.879] we've inherited from thousands of years
[42.719] ago, upon which we have built our modern
[46.399] knowledge of nature and the world that
[49.2] essentially gives modern civilization
[51.84] its its form. How did Hypocrates know
[54.719] that all health starts in the gut? How
[56.96] did they know that? Why would you say
[58.64] that?

Title: Did Neanderthals Survive Longer Than We Thought?
[0.08] If you're hunting something that weighs
[1.6] 2,000 lbs and it's just you and your
[3.64] buddies, you better communicate really
[6.799] well because one of you is getting
[9.599] killed every time you go out hunting
[11.44] unless you can communicate how to corner
[14.24] this thing. How who's going to go up
[15.839] front, you know, who who gets the fun
[18.0] end and who gets the business end of
[19.439] this beast. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[21.039] Pause there. Is that the case? They
[23.119] became us. Number one, there were
[25.039] different species. Mhm. Completely. Now,
[28.16] Neanderls disappeared. somewhere around
[30.24] 30,000 years ago. They found some
[32.0] evidence in southern Spain that that
[33.84] suggests it might have been as late as
[36.8] 18,000 years ago. Okay. I'd be
[38.8] interested in seeing that cuz I was
[40.399] wondering if it couldn't be as we
[42.079] discover specimens that are
[44.239] progressively younger that we might get
[46.0] to 26,000 years ago. But I don't know. I
[48.96] haven't seen that yet. So far the
[50.239] numbers I've seen and I haven't stayed
[51.6] up with the research time span that I've
[53.52] seen is around 30,000 years. So you're
[55.36] saying now that there may be some
[57.12] evidence that they survived to as long
[59.559] as 18,000 years. Precisely.
[62.84] Interestingly, that is the late glacial
[65.199] maximum right there. That's pretty much
[67.119] the peak of it. You know, the fact that
[69.04] they found that in the southern part of
[70.72] of Spain as well is interesting because
[73.52] that would have been as far as Europe
[75.6] goes. If you think about being driven
[77.6] out onto that peninsula by ice, that
[79.92] would have been just about the last warm
[81.68] place in Europe. Mhm. Mhm. Make sense.

Title: Civilization Exists by Geological Consent
[0.08] When I was quite a bit younger back in
[2.32] the 70s, I was very interested in
[5.04] anything that had to do with the
[7.44] mysteries of our own existence on this
[10.4] planet, spiritual traditions, hidden
[13.44] things, all of that. But the one thing I
[15.28] do remember was a quote that I wrote
[17.119] down. Civilization exists by geological
[20.52] consent, subject to change without
[23.68] notice. I think that this is an insight
[25.76] into the nature of our efforts to create
[28.8] civilization on this planet that needs
[30.64] to be taken into account. The legend of
[32.88] the fall of man possibly may be all that
[36.16] has survived of such a time before when
[40.239] for some unknown reason the whole world
[43.6] was plunged back again under the
[45.68] undisputed sway of nature to begin once
[48.96] more its upward boilsome journey through
[51.92] the ages.

Title: The Younger Dryas Changed Everything
[0.24] 20 years ago, nobody had ever heard of
[2.0] what was the younger dus. Well, the
[3.36] younger dus was a period of very rapid
[6.24] climate and environmental change. And it
[9.04] started, it lasted roughly,300 years.
[11.84] And it started somewhat younger than
[14.2] 12,900 years ago. And then it ended
[17.119] abruptly about 11,600 years ago. And one
[20.56] of the things that defined the end of
[22.48] the younger dus was a very rapid melting
[25.359] of the great ice sheets which would then
[27.84] be accompanied with a very rapid rise of
[31.119] sea level and that's now the defining
[33.84] point of transition from the pleaene
[36.079] which was almost 2 1/2 million years and
[38.879] the holysine which is just you know
[40.48] about 11,600 years. We are in a period
[43.28] called the interglacial. For the last
[45.92] couple of hundred thousand years, there
[47.92] has been this very extreme swinging back
[51.2] and forth between glacial and
[53.8] interglacial. What is driving that is an
[56.64] open question. We need a lot more
[58.559] scientific studies to try to really
[61.16] define what is driving these enormous
[64.559] climate changes and uh environmental
[67.439] changes. But the upshot of it is at the
[69.92] end of it, what we see is the great
[72.439] megapa that inhabited the earth went
[75.72] mysteriously extinct. In a geological
[78.799] snap of the finger, they were gone.

Title: Why Does 432 Keep Showing Up?
[0.08] There's some kind of a pattern here and
[2.0] I don't claim to ultimately know what it
[3.679] is. I show example after example after
[6.16] example. There's a certain set of
[8.4] numbers that recur over and over and
[10.719] over again and they're found on sacred
[12.96] structures all over the world. You
[14.559] mentioned earlier about moving big
[16.32] stones and frequencies. And then there
[18.72] was the overlap, you know, honing in on
[21.6] the number 432, which is interesting.
[24.68] 432 recurs over and over again in uh in
[29.199] the Samrian king lists. The total number
[32.16] of the 10 kings of ancient pre deluge or
[36.92] anti-deluvian kings the reign of the 10
[39.92] kings the mythical kings is 432,000
[42.96] years. And then when you go to the Vadic
[46.48] traditions of India, um you have the
[49.2] what are called the Yugas, these great
[51.039] grand cycles of global earth change. And
[54.96] they're all built upon a sequence that
[57.76] goes 1 2 3 and four. What is the God
[61.359] frequency? Do you is it? I don't know
[62.96] what that is. I've heard of it. And I I
[64.479] I don't know. I wish I could answer
[66.64] every question that everybody has. I was
[69.28] reluctant to talk about it. Something
[71.6] really bizarre happens.

Title: What Makes a Geologist?
[0.16] We're seeing these products of education
[2.32] that don't know how to critically think.
[4.56] So all they know is to say something,
[6.799] he's not a
[8.519] geologist. Well, I mean, what is a
[10.639] geologist? You have do you have to be
[12.4] paid to be a
[14.12] geologist? Do you have to be working for
[16.64] the government to be a geologist? Or do
[19.439] you have to be working for industry,
[21.76] let's say, the fossil fuel industry, who
[24.32] are probably the two biggest employers
[26.4] of geologists? Do you have to be working
[29.679] for those organizations to be considered
[32.719] a geologist? Right. Well, maybe if
[36.8] that's your definition. I was thinking
[38.96] about just giving up and just quitting.
[41.84] I think I'll I'll stay with it for
[43.36] another for a little while longer yet.
[45.28] what I need. And you're not a
[46.559] professional geologist, but what you're
[48.32] getting is a concentrated dose of
[51.12] catastrophist geology, which is no
[54.8] subheading that's being taught in
[57.399] universities. So, I've had to pretty
[59.44] much go and do my own work to pull all
[62.8] of this together. What I'd like to see
[64.96] is a curriculum emerge that essentially
[68.159] that's a whole subbranch of geology.
[70.159] Just like sedimentology, strategraphy,
[72.84] geomorphology, you've got catastrophice
[74.96] geology.

Title: The Mammoth Extinction Doesn’t Make Sense
[0.08] Up until the end of the last ice age,
[1.6] there were four species of probacidians
[3.439] living in North America. Think about
[5.279] that. They're all gone now. What
[7.839] happened to them? Well, there's
[9.04] different theories. One theory, which I
[10.8] think considered to be ridiculous, is
[12.8] that they were hunted to extinction by
[14.96] nomadic tribes of of hunters. But given
[18.16] that the estimates for the human
[20.439] population at the end of the last ice
[22.72] age and we're talking 12 to 15,000 years
[25.439] ago roughly those estimates of human
[27.84] total global human population range
[29.84] between 5 and 10 million estimates for
[32.239] total number of mammoths 12 million.
[34.64] Wow. 12 million mammoths. That's just an
[38.0] estimate but it's probably in the
[39.52] ballpark. Let's say you got 10 million
[41.28] people. How many of those are going to
[42.879] actually be hunters and hunters that are
[45.36] willing that are capable of taking down
[47.12] a mammoth? 25% or less. That's probably
[49.52] about right. Yeah. So, what does that
[52.64] leave? Couple of million people were
[55.199] able to exterminate every mammoth on
[58.28] Earth in less than a thousand years. No
[61.199] way. Don't.

Title: The Apocalypse Unsealed: Fire, Water & the End of Worlds
[1.48] Greetings. Welcome to another edition of
[4.319] Squaring the Circle podcast. I'm your
[6.56] host, Randall
[8.2] Carlson. In this episode, we are going
[10.719] to be looking at some of the symbolism
[13.84] and traditions associated in in ancient
[16.8] times with cosmic impacts and their
[20.24] effects on Earth and civilization.
[35.04] When I was quite a bit younger back in
[37.28] the 70s, I attempted to read and I did
[41.12] read most of a two volume set by HP
[44.68] Bolivatski called The Secret Doctrine. I
[48.16] was very interested in anything that had
[50.399] to do with the mysteries of our own
[53.68] existence on this planet, spiritual
[56.36] traditions, hidden things, all of that.
[60.559] one of the quotes that jumped out at me
[63.6] when I was reading in there and it's a
[66.68] very massive volume tone but home but
[70.96] the one thing I do remember was a quote
[73.68] that I that I wrote down and we'll we're
[77.52] going to begin with that. I never tire
[80.4] of this quote by the famous historian
[83.92] Will
[84.84] Durant who
[86.68] said in the summation of a lifetime of
[91.6] studying the history of civilization on
[94.68] earth. He said civilization exists by
[98.079] geological consent subject to change
[101.84] without notice.
[104.24] I think that this is an insight into the
[106.64] nature of our efforts to create
[108.799] civilization on this planet that needs
[110.64] to be taken into account, but it's
[114.399] generally
[115.399] been sidelined in most of the popular
[119.36] culture and in the issues that concern
[122.6] people. And I refer specifically there
[125.36] to
[126.439] the to the concerns about anthropogenic
[130.399] climate change about which I have talked
[133.44] in depth and will continue to present
[135.599] information on that to try to put that
[138.48] whole controversy into some kind of a
[141.28] rational perspective.
[146.72] Frederick Sadi, the Nobel Prize-winning
[148.879] chemist who passed away in
[151.8] 1956, said this. The legend of the fall
[155.519] of man possibly may be all that has
[158.599] survived of such a time before when for
[162.8] some unknown reason the whole world was
[166.08] plunged back again under the undisputed
[168.64] sway of nature to begin once more its
[172.0] upward boilsome journey through the
[174.319] ages.
[176.08] Now, what has happened since he made
[178.319] this quote is we know a lot more about
[180.4] our own catastrophic history on this
[182.64] planet. And we have some pretty good
[184.64] ideas
[186.28] about what those reasons were for the
[191.28] fall of civilization. That's one of the
[193.92] big topics that we explore in this
[196.08] particular podcast and it's one of
[198.599] the major topics that has been the
[201.36] subject of this series that I've been
[203.92] doing on apocalyptic traditions ancient
[209.879] and an old English proverb says that
[213.28] fire and water have no mercy. And that I
[216.4] think hearkens back to the to the
[219.04] knowledge that fire and water have been
[221.28] the two primary agencies of global
[223.76] catastrophes that have come down to us
[225.84] in the traditions of
[228.44] apocalypse. You'll note that the Bible
[231.76] begins after the expulsion from the
[234.0] garden of Eden and the the generations
[237.36] of the patriarchs. 10th patriarch Noah
[240.64] survives a great deluge, a world
[242.959] destroying deluge, a destruction of the
[245.519] world by water. And that tradition has
[249.12] echoes through many dozens of cultures
[251.92] that have preserved traditions about
[254.159] gigantic floods and deluges.
[257.479] Cataclysmos was the Greek term for
[261.68] destruction of the world by fire from
[263.6] which we I mean I'm sorry by water from
[265.68] which we get the term cataclysm which
[268.72] specifically refers to world destruction
[271.68] a watery destruction of the world. We
[274.479] now know from the studies of paleo
[276.56] hydraology that gigantic unimaginably
[280.0] gigantic floods have really occurred in
[282.479] the recent geological history of this
[284.4] planet. Likewise, the term ecarus, the
[287.6] Greek term for the destruction of the
[289.12] world by fire. We now know that fire has
[292.4] also been an agency of world
[294.16] destruction. And that has been
[295.44] demonstrated because we can find the
[297.8] fingerprints of ancient gigantic fires
[301.6] in things like the core samples taken
[305.6] from the bottom of lakes from core
[308.0] samples taken
[309.96] from ice cores in Greenland and other
[313.44] Iceland other ice sheets around the
[316.56] world. And some of these conflrations
[319.919] have been extraordinarily huge. And
[323.52] survivors of some of these that we're
[325.44] talking about here and will be talking
[327.32] about could easily believe that they
[330.16] were destroying the world as a
[333.08] whole. So let's continue on
[337.56] then with the testimony of history and
[341.759] the language of symbolism.
[345.28] So here is the quote from HH HP
[347.88] Bulvasi
[349.4] Bllovatzki from the secret doctrine
[352.0] volume 2 anthropogenesis published in
[354.6] 1888 and this was the quote that
[356.8] intrigued me so much that it sort of
[358.96] helped to stimulate curiosity about the
[362.639] things that she was talking about here.
[364.72] So she raises some questions. So let's
[367.919] read. The modern
[370.199] archaeologist though speculating add
[372.639] infinitum upon the dolmans and their
[376.199] builders knows in fact nothing of them
[378.96] or their origin. And that still is as
[381.039] true today as it was in
[383.4] 1888. Yet these weird and often colossal
[386.56] monuments of unhuneed stones which
[388.96] consist generally of four or seven
[391.759] gigantic blocks placed together are
[395.12] strewn over as Asia, Europe, America and
[398.16] Africa in groups or rows. There is no
[401.84] country from which they are absent. Who
[404.479] built them? Why are they all connected
[407.919] with serpents and dragons?
[411.84] So, here's an example of what we mean by
[414.72] a
[415.96] dolman. And you can see it's just a
[418.96] series of blocks and there's hundreds of
[422.039] them. And what was their purpose? Well,
[426.96] to this modern archaeologists really
[429.52] don't know. They says, "Well, it had a
[430.96] religious or a ceremonial purpose." And
[432.72] that's about as far as it goes.
[435.36] I would suggest that what we're actually
[439.199] looking here is remnants of an ancient
[442.759] technology. Now, that's not going to be
[444.8] the subject of of this episode of Square
[448.479] Circle, but it is going to be a theme
[450.8] and a subject that we explore in much
[453.52] greater depth in upcoming episodes. So,
[457.44] keep that in mind as we go forward here.
[459.68] When I say technology and
[461.96] why an important hint or clue here is
[464.96] the association with dragons, right now
[468.319] dragons are a very powerful and potent
[470.24] symbol that we find all over the world
[472.639] from China all the way down to Mexico
[475.44] and amongst Native
[477.24] Americans. Dragons or their counterpart
[480.479] serpents or sometimes fire serpents.
[487.479] So, let's continue on here with
[490.84] this. I love some of the modern
[493.44] depictions of dragons. We see this great
[496.639] fierce beast mounted on a pinnacle
[499.84] presumably. Notice the wings because
[502.12] dragons could fly. And for
[506.039] all enthusiasts of the Lord of the Rings
[509.36] and the stories of the JRR Tolken, many
[514.479] people know that dragons usually
[516.64] hibernate in caves. And so dragons have
[521.08] this two-fold existence. They can exist
[524.64] underground or they can exist in the
[526.8] sky. And the symbolical meaning of the
[531.0] dragon is indicated by that dual
[534.48] existence of both terrestrial and
[536.6] celestial. Keep that in mind. And as we
[539.44] go forward and we start looking at this
[541.12] material, if you have an opportunity to
[543.12] grab a notebook and a pen, I highly
[545.92] recommend taking some notes,
[547.839] particularly when we get into the
[549.839] specifics of the symbolism that we
[552.399] associate now with cosmic events.
[556.56] Okay. So, let's proceed. Now, this is
[559.92] from a book that I read years ago.
[562.6] Thunderstorm, thunderstorm, stones and
[565.44] shooting stars, meteors and meteorites
[568.32] in
[569.16] folklore. In legends of Central Asia,
[572.16] meteors were fire serpents coursing
[575.44] across the sky. Sometimes these serpents
[578.24] brought problems and sometimes they
[580.32] brought hordes of treasure and riches.
[583.76] To the folks from the Andaman Islands,
[586.32] meteors were torches carried by evil
[589.279] spirits of the forest as they hunted for
[591.64] men. Okay, fire serpents. Right here we
[595.04] see explicitly the association between
[597.279] serpents and even more precisely fire
[600.36] serpents with the idea of
[604.68] meteors. Also we see that we got it's
[609.839] mentions here brought problems. Okay.
[612.44] Sometimes they could create problems.
[615.6] Sometimes they could bring hordes of
[617.279] treasure and riches. Now, we're not
[619.04] going to be exploring that in this
[620.399] particular episode, but we now know that
[623.04] some of the most
[626.519] richest precious metals and
[629.959] orbearing strata on Earth are associated
[634.399] with cosmic impact such as
[638.279] Sudbury, Astroleam in Ontario, Vaport in
[644.0] South Africa and others were
[645.839] discovering. In fact,
[648.44] when
[650.12] when PEMX, which was Petroleum Mexico,
[654.64] was searching for hydrocarbons, they
[657.6] drilled into back in this is back in the
[659.92] 80s. They drilled into the the
[662.24] Cretaceous
[663.32] tertiary astroleam, which is called
[666.399] cheek shaloo, because they felt they
[669.04] thought that that would be a very
[671.04] logical place for there to be a
[672.64] hydrocarbon deposit.
[675.36] So even right there we have an example
[677.279] of exploratory drilling looking for
[679.839] hydrocarbons and drilling into what they
[683.279] at the time they didn't know was an
[685.8] astroblade but later
[688.12] was confirmed to be in fact impact
[692.04] produced. NASA did a has on their
[696.56] website they have a really good
[698.48] summation of comets in ancient cultures
[701.279] and some of the reactions and
[704.0] impressions of comets, comet impacts and
[707.44] so on
[710.44] and
[712.6] that and so I'm going to I'm going to
[714.8] recite from that because it has a lot of
[717.04] good condensed information.
[719.16] It's it's understandable by a lay
[722.56] person. It doesn't get too technical,
[724.8] but it also covers some of the more
[727.839] prevalent symbolism associated with
[729.839] comets, asteroids, meteors, fireballs,
[733.12] shooting
[734.04] stars, impacts, and so on. So, we'll
[737.12] just we'll just go through that
[738.92] together.
[741.079] And here we go.
[744.48] Comets have inspired dread, fear, and
[747.24] awe in many different
[751.32] cultures and societies around the world
[754.0] and throughout time. They have been
[755.76] branded with such titles as the
[757.839] harbinger of doom and the menace of the
[761.399] universe. They have been regarded both
[763.839] as omens of disaster and messengers of
[767.36] the gods.
[769.44] Why is it that comets are some of the
[771.279] most feared and venerated objects in the
[774.639] night sky? Why did so many cultures
[777.519] cringe at the sight of a comet? Well, I
[780.399] think every year that goes by, we're,
[782.32] you know, finding out more and more what
[784.399] the answer to those questions actually
[787.04] would be. is that because of comets and
[790.839] their spring that result through the
[794.839] disintegration of comets, Earth has
[798.24] suffered numerous catastrophes, far more
[801.36] than just the single object that wiped
[804.16] out the
[806.92] dinosaurs. What were the gods trying to
[809.24] say? Some cultures read the message by
[812.72] the images that they saw upon looking at
[815.6] the comet. For example, to some
[818.16] cultures, the tail of the comet gave it
[820.24] the appearance of the head of a woman
[822.48] with long flowing hair behind her. And I
[825.839] will mention that the word kameta or
[827.6] kita literally means long-haired. Okay,
[830.56] so there's another symbol. If you're
[832.56] taking notes, we've got fire serpents,
[834.639] we've got torches, and now we've got
[837.04] long hair. Okay. This sorrowful symbol
[840.88] of mourning was understood to mean the
[843.279] gods that had sent the comet to the
[845.44] earth to earth were
[848.04] displeased. All right. And this
[850.079] interesting sorrowful symbol of mourning
[852.72] is one we're going to look
[854.279] at again later. It it has a very
[857.76] important role to play in deciphering
[860.16] Masonic
[861.959] symbolism. So we'll come back to that.
[865.92] Others thought that the elongated comet
[868.48] looked like a fiery sword blazing across
[871.839] the night sky, a traditional sign of war
[875.199] and death. Such a message from the gods
[878.24] could only mean that their wrath would
[879.92] soon be unleashed onto the people of the
[882.76] land. Such ideas struck fear into those
[886.32] who saw comets dart across the sky. The
[889.92] likeness of the comet though was not the
[892.399] only thing that inspired fear. Ancient
[896.079] cultural legends also played a hand in
[898.24] inspiring a terrible dread of these
[901.36] celestial nomads. The Roman prophecies
[904.72] the cyoline oracles spoke of quote a
[908.959] great conflration from the sky falling
[912.56] to earth. While the most ancient known
[915.68] mythology, the Babylonian epic of
[917.88] Gilgamesh, described fire, brimstone,
[920.56] and
[921.48] flood with the arrival of a comet. Now,
[925.519] I think we can make a scientific case
[927.44] that Epic of Gilgamesh was perhaps ahead
[930.88] of its time because all of these things
[932.44] that were associated in the Epic of
[935.04] Gilgamesh with comets, we now know we
[937.519] can scientifically demonstrate are in
[940.32] fact associated with the arrival of
[942.16] comets into an Earth crossing orbit.
[947.279] Rabbi Moses Ben Nakman, a Jew living in
[950.16] Spain, wrote of God taking two stars
[953.639] from and throwing them at the earth in
[956.72] order to begin the great flood. Now,
[959.839] this let's pause for a minute there. Two
[962.32] stars from
[963.48] Hea. Again, I hate to keep putting
[966.399] things off. We are going to come back to
[968.399] that because this is a really important
[971.12] clue that ties into understanding the
[974.72] whole process of global catastrophe
[977.48] associated with the younger dus and the
[980.8] younger dus potential impact event.
[984.88] Yakut legend in ancient Mongolia called
[988.12] comets the daughter of the devil and
[991.519] warned of destruction, storm and frost
[994.0] whenever she approaches the earth.
[996.72] Stories associating comets with such
[999.36] terrible imagery are at the base of so
[1001.839] many cultures on Earth and fuel a dread
[1004.8] that followed comet sightings throughout
[1008.44] history. Well, I would say that this
[1011.44] dread and fear of comets has roots in
[1014.72] very real memories and experiences of
[1017.92] ancient people. And of course, I think
[1020.8] modern science is confirming that.
[1023.48] Although we still seem to be more
[1027.48] neglectful of that interpretation or
[1030.48] that insight than we ought to be given
[1033.439] what we now
[1035.24] know. So unlike their western
[1037.52] counterparts, Chinese astronomers kept
[1039.76] extensive records on the appearances,
[1041.919] paths, and disappearances of hundreds of
[1044.319] comets. Extensive comet atlases have
[1047.36] been found dating back to the Han
[1049.08] Dynasty, which described comets as
[1052.679] longailed feeasant stars or broom stars
[1057.84] and associate the different commentary
[1059.76] forms with different disasters. you can
[1062.48] add now to your list. If you hopefully
[1064.799] took my advice, you paused the video,
[1067.039] you went and got
[1068.52] yourself a notebook and a pen or you're
[1071.28] doing it digitally, however you're doing
[1072.64] it, and you're taking these taking
[1075.16] notes and you're listing these things
[1077.84] because this is the vocabulary of
[1081.2] ancient symbolism. These are the words
[1085.64] that are associated into phrases by
[1089.2] which we can then interpret and
[1091.679] understand a lot of the ancient
[1093.36] symbolism. Okay. So, broomstarch, add
[1097.36] that to the list. Broomstarch. We're
[1098.96] going to we'll we'll continue. We'll
[1100.72] come back to this in just a moment here.
[1102.72] This symbolism of the
[1105.08] broomstar. Although most human beings no
[1107.44] longer cringe at the sight of a comet.
[1109.679] Well, yes, because it's been a long time
[1111.6] since we have had at least in modern
[1114.32] historical memory that we have an
[1117.44] awareness or a remembrance of a
[1119.6] commentary induced disaster. However, go
[1123.52] back and listen to the episodes within
[1125.52] this apocalypse series on the Tangusa
[1128.48] event of 1908. I highly recommend
[1132.0] relisting to
[1133.4] that because there are so many lessons
[1136.559] to be extracted from that particular
[1138.799] event for the survival of our modern
[1143.64] civilization. So although most human
[1146.32] beings no longer cringe at the sight of
[1148.08] the comet of a comet, they still inspire
[1150.48] fear everywhere around the globe from
[1153.039] Hollywood to doomsday cults. I think
[1155.44] that doomsday cult is probably a
[1157.039] reference to the when comet Hailbop flew
[1160.64] by and uh the that one particular cult
[1165.679] whose name escapes me at the moment
[1168.4] committed mass suicide believing that
[1170.48] they were going to hitch a ride on the
[1173.16] comet. I don't know how that worked out
[1175.44] for them but I suspect that they might
[1177.679] have been misled somewhere along the
[1179.6] way.
[1180.72] The United States even set up the Near
[1182.64] Earth asteroid tracking or NEAT program
[1185.76] specifically to guard us from these
[1188.24] divine dangers. However, although they
[1191.2] were once regarded as omens of disaster
[1194.32] and messengers of the
[1198.36] gods, today scientific approach has
[1201.76] helped allay such concerns. It is
[1204.799] science and reason that has led the
[1206.72] fight against this fear since the days
[1208.64] of the ancients. It is science and
[1211.36] reason that has emboldened the human
[1213.28] spirit enough to venture out and
[1215.96] journey, literally journey to a comet.
[1219.44] It is science and reason that will
[1221.36] unlock the secrets that they hold. Now,
[1225.039] I concur with all of the sentiments of
[1227.039] that last paragraph, but I will say that
[1231.039] the fear since the days of the ancients
[1234.64] was not unfounded.
[1236.96] And I think that science and reason is
[1238.88] in fact confirming that
[1242.84] truth and there are secrets to be
[1245.679] unlocked from comets and we have a lot
[1248.08] more to learn but there's a lot that has
[1249.84] been learned that we need to take notice
[1252.96] of and that's part of my motivation for
[1255.2] doing this particular series in squaring
[1257.679] a circle. This was
[1260.12] from
[1261.64] the journal Science and Christian Belief
[1265.2] by the author Colin Humphre published in
[1269.4] 1995 specifically about the star of
[1272.12] Bethlehem which of course was the star
[1274.24] that guided the three wise men to the to
[1276.88] the
[1277.88] nativity. So in that article he mentions
[1280.88] that the Chinese kept careful
[1282.64] astronomical records of visible comets
[1285.6] nova etc and use different terms to
[1289.12] describe them. A tailed comet was called
[1292.919] swinging meaning a broom star. The broom
[1296.799] referring to the tail of a comet. All
[1299.44] right.
[1301.36] And the noted Chinese astronomer Lee
[1303.679] Shung Shun Fang has this to say on the
[1307.039] subject of broom stars. Comets are vile
[1310.72] stars. Every time they appear in the
[1312.84] south, something happens to wipe out the
[1315.6] old and establish the
[1318.679] new.
[1320.36] And we can when we see some of the great
[1323.6] comets in the sky, we can see how the
[1326.64] metaphor of a broom came to be applied
[1330.4] to the appearance of
[1332.52] comets. From Mary Proctor, a very
[1335.919] readable book that gets in delves into a
[1339.84] lot of the ancient symbolism associated
[1341.6] with comets, the romance of comets,
[1344.559] published way back in 1926.
[1348.32] Quoting from her book, comets are called
[1350.96] broomstarss in China, a name derived
[1353.12] from the form of their
[1354.679] tails, which have the very prosaic name
[1357.2] of brooms. And the idea was that as a
[1359.2] broom sweeps out the dirt and the debris
[1361.84] and the dust of the old cleans out the
[1366.64] room, the floor, whatever for the onset
[1370.159] of the new, the comets also served in
[1373.12] that role. We've already seen this
[1375.52] quote, but it's good to revisit the
[1378.0] question. Who built them? And why are
[1380.08] they all connected with serpents and
[1382.12] dragons? Well, again, keep in mind the
[1385.039] dual nature of the of the dragon, both
[1387.84] terrestrial and celestial, because
[1389.76] that's an important clue.
[1392.32] Okay. So now this is from study of
[1394.96] comets in Islamic astronomy and
[1398.2] astrology from the journal of near
[1400.559] eastern studies published back in 1957
[1403.72] by oriental orientalist ES Kennedy one
[1407.919] of the most respected
[1411.559] orientalists publishing back during that
[1413.84] period. The
[1416.52] Ibenhinte. So a Christian astrologer of
[1419.84] Baghdad. This individual in
[1422.76] 829 wrote an astrological work called El
[1426.36] Marini. A copy of the second part is in
[1429.84] the Bardesi stats bibliote in Munich. On
[1434.64] folio 67 of this document, there begins
[1437.6] a section entitled on the stars having
[1440.44] tails. The passage states that there are
[1443.2] seven such stars in the heaven or sphere
[1445.919] of the sun surrounding if after the
[1449.2] fashion of
[1450.919] stars or sorry surrounding it. It's a
[1454.32] little typo there surrounding it after
[1456.08] the fashion of stars. The manuscripts
[1458.799] names five of these. Okay. So teur is an
[1462.48] Arabic me name and it says
[1465.4] here reference the comet name Typhon.
[1469.52] Now, we're going to come back to the
[1471.12] typhon here in a
[1473.159] second. Aac is a Persian loan Persian
[1476.799] loan word in Arabic meaning a short
[1479.08] spear, hence a meteor. So add this now.
[1482.48] Typhon in the myth of
[1485.0] Marduk battling Typhon in this celestial
[1488.559] great celestial battle and Marduk
[1490.48] finally defeat defeats Typhon.
[1495.52] But then we have the Persian word which
[1497.84] also means a spear because this is
[1500.08] another one of the images that was
[1501.84] projected
[1503.96] onto shooting stars,
[1506.76] comets, asteroid phenomena that was
[1509.679] visible, fireballs in the sky and so on.
[1512.559] Then als meaning the
[1516.12] stick
[1517.88] alle the bearded
[1520.52] one. And then finally d alasa the oops
[1526.64] the
[1528.039] hunchback. So you can add these to the
[1530.48] list now of various imagery images and
[1533.6] symbols associated with celestial
[1537.799] phenomena. Okay let's go on. These are
[1539.919] some of the historical accounts of w of
[1542.88] what from eyewitnesses of these kinds of
[1545.279] celestial phenomena. This is from the
[1546.96] history of Japan. I'm not going to try
[1549.96] to angle probably Angelberg Kemper MD
[1554.0] translated by
[1555.64] JG Schuer of London
[1558.76] 1728. Now this is referring to events in
[1561.679] the reign of Son which began in 29 BC.
[1566.48] So in the 36th year of his reign, it
[1569.52] rained stars from heaven in Japan. In
[1572.64] the 40th year of his reign, on a clear
[1574.799] and serene day, there arose of a sudden
[1577.52] in China a violent storm of thunder and
[1580.52] lightning. Comets, fiery dragons, and
[1583.76] uncommon meteors appeared in the airs,
[1587.12] and it rained fire from heaven.
[1590.799] Now, this is why I'm going to be highly
[1594.0] recommending that you go back and
[1595.76] relisten to the episodes specifically
[1598.72] about Tungusa. The Tungusa event of June
[1602.4] 30th, 1908 is probably
[1605.159] the preeminent most prominent cosmic
[1609.32] lesson that humans can learn about our
[1613.72] relationship to the earth and the sky
[1616.52] and our ancient ancestors beliefs and
[1621.039] experiences with these same
[1623.4] phenomena. Notice here several things.
[1625.679] Let's take note here. a violent storm of
[1628.64] thunder and lightning. Well, we know
[1630.559] that this was associated with Tungusa.
[1632.919] Absolutely. It was experienced, many
[1636.0] people interpreted
[1637.48] what they experienced as being a violent
[1642.76] storm. And we have fiery dragons,
[1645.919] uncommon meteors, and then we have
[1647.679] specifically saying it rained fire from
[1649.6] the sky. Does that mean that it
[1652.24] triggered terrestrial fires? I don't
[1654.799] know. They're not specific enough. But
[1656.4] this idea of fire from the sky is one
[1658.24] that
[1659.96] is repeated over and over again in in
[1663.039] the traditions of olden
[1666.76] times. Now going back to Mary Proctor,
[1671.039] comets have sometimes been pictured as
[1673.2] dragons and according to plenty the
[1675.6] shape of a comet indicated its character
[1678.24] as a portent.
[1680.32] Thus, some were shown as
[1682.6] arrowheads, sea monsters, swords,
[1686.559] lances, and
[1688.36] flames. In
[1690.52] AD69, according to Josephus, several
[1694.159] signs appeared in the sky announcing the
[1697.12] destruction of Jerusalem. And this is
[1700.0] quoting from
[1702.919] Josephus. Amongst other warnings, a
[1706.44] comet, one of the kind called Zifus,
[1710.32] because their tails appear to represent
[1712.32] the blade of a sword, was seen above the
[1715.84] city for the space of a whole
[1719.159] year. So now we can add this. The blade
[1722.0] of a sword, right, a spear, a fire
[1725.679] serpent, a torch, okay?
[1729.24] arrowheads,
[1731.159] lances, all of these have
[1733.72] been very frequently associated with the
[1736.72] kinds of phenomenon we're talking about
[1738.08] here. So rather than
[1741.88] explicitly describing these experiences
[1744.399] in terminology that we would recognize
[1746.399] from a scientific perspective, they had
[1748.96] their own symbology.
[1750.88] And once we understand the symbology and
[1754.159] the meaning, we can go back and we can
[1756.32] review a lot of the ancient writings,
[1759.039] the ancient prophetic writings and so on
[1761.919] and see them in a whole new context. And
[1763.84] that's exactly where we're going with
[1765.84] this section
[1767.799] of Squaring the Circle podcasts on the
[1771.84] traditions of apocalypse.
[1778.159] This is from a European chronicle set
[1780.159] down around a th000 AD also quoted in
[1783.64] Proctor and in Sean that's the Carl
[1787.2] Sean's work
[1788.6] on
[1790.2] comets the heavens having opened I want
[1793.44] you to notice this now this is referring
[1795.2] to this is again back in a th000 AD from
[1799.12] a chronicle back then and describing the
[1801.6] heavens as opening okay the heavens
[1804.399] having opened
[1805.919] A kind of burning torch fell upon the
[1808.88] earth, leaving behind it a long train of
[1812.08] light similar to a flash of lightning.
[1815.919] Okay, here's where we can begin to see
[1818.48] the correlation. Also, we know from
[1821.6] fireballs and impacts in meters, there
[1823.6] can frequently be electromagnetic
[1826.24] phenomena associated with them that
[1828.72] manifest as as lightning.
[1831.44] Such was its light that it frightened
[1833.36] not only those who were in the open
[1835.039] country, but those who were within
[1837.799] doors. As this opening in the heavens
[1841.6] slowly closed, men saw with horror the
[1845.84] figure of a dragon whose feet were blue
[1849.36] and whose head seemed continually to
[1852.24] increase. Now, of course, that would
[1854.48] make perfect sense if the comet is
[1857.44] approaching and the nearer it gets, the
[1859.76] greater the nucleus now appears in the
[1863.0] sky. So, it's also probable that this
[1866.88] comet was associated with an entourage
[1870.88] of debris, which we now know can be the
[1873.52] case with a lot of comets. There may be
[1875.919] a main nucleus, but then there may
[1878.279] be say
[1881.08] satellite material that's associated
[1883.52] with it. Some of this may directly
[1887.12] impact the earth where the nucleus
[1889.76] itself doesn't fall to
[1892.919] earth. But this is very interesting.
[1895.2] this this this idea of the opening of
[1897.2] the heavens and then closing
[1900.679] again and the figure of a
[1904.6] dragon. So here's
[1906.76] contrib contributions towards the
[1908.96] history of these star showers in former
[1911.2] times written by Edward C. Heric
[1914.32] published in the meteorological journal
[1916.48] back in 1841 and he had collected a lot
[1918.88] of these ancient accounts that he
[1921.6] included in in this work of his. So
[1926.12] AD764 in the same year in the month of
[1929.12] March stars were seen falling from
[1932.08] heaven so that all the beholders
[1935.36] imagined that the end of the world had
[1938.2] come. There was also a great drought and
[1941.84] the fountains were dried up. Now, this
[1945.559] idea that took hold of so many of the
[1948.88] eyewitnesses and and those who
[1950.799] experienced these events was clearly
[1954.279] apocalyptic. Over and over again, we see
[1956.64] that in some of these grander scale
[1958.76] events, the witnesses thought this is
[1961.6] it. This is the end of the world, right?
[1964.32] They certainly believe that with with
[1966.799] regard to the Tungusa event, but many
[1969.919] others as well. And this also now from
[1974.679] the naturalistic perspective we find
[1978.159] these interesting correlations. We
[1980.96] learned from the accounts of Tungusa
[1986.08] that and we know from the scientific
[1987.919] evidence that there was an earthquake, a
[1990.12] relatively strong earthquake that was
[1992.44] felt, right? And but now the first
[1997.2] impression would be most scientists
[1999.679] would dismiss any correlation or
[2002.44] connection between things terrestrially
[2006.0] and things celestially like the nearby
[2011.2] visitation of a comet, right? I would
[2014.32] say that that might be premature. We
[2016.96] should consider that there may very well
[2019.48] be correlations and links between what
[2022.88] goes on out there and what goes on down
[2025.76] here below. problem is too many
[2029.72] scientists as gatekeepers of the
[2032.559] rational and the the establishment view
[2035.919] of things are too ready to dismiss
[2038.799] astrology. Now, of course, they're
[2040.32] dismissing astrology and its modern
[2042.159] degenerate forms. But because they do
[2044.72] that, they don't realize that that the
[2047.279] origins of astrology
[2049.8] had had their roots in this in the
[2053.52] correlations between what happened in
[2056.0] the sky and what happened in the earth.
[2058.32] And now we can make a pretty strong case
[2060.24] that yes, there is this pattern of
[2063.679] interaction between earth and sky. And
[2066.399] it's not just based upon some silly
[2068.76] superstition or some new age fad, but
[2071.839] actually has real world roots. And
[2076.8] that's again will be a theme that we're
[2078.72] going to be exploring much greater
[2081.72] detail. The possibility that that out
[2085.44] there, what happens out there might
[2087.2] actually be affecting things like
[2089.48] droughts and and other things as well.
[2092.72] So this was this from the Stfanis
[2094.919] chronographia the history of
[2098.44] Bzantium. If you want to take notes and
[2101.44] actually dive into this yourself think
[2103.52] you'll be able to use some of these
[2104.64] references and go into Google Scholar
[2107.04] and maybe even find some of the original
[2109.119] stuff. Now most of this I've collected
[2110.72] 10 and 20 years
[2113.8] ago. There's even more now available
[2116.56] than there was back then.
[2119.28] Okay, this is from an
[2123.96] Arabic paper and this was
[2128.599] quoted this guy M. Fran L institutes
[2132.96] that would be French. This was what
[2136.0] happened in
[2137.96] 1889, November
[2140.76] 14th, which possibly puts it very close
[2143.68] to
[2145.0] being if if the modern dates, if they're
[2148.0] using our modern calendar, this puts it
[2149.839] right during the the Leonid meteor
[2152.52] shower. In the year 286 of the Higiraa,
[2156.96] there was an earthquake in Egypt. on
[2159.599] Wednesday the 7th of the month. I won't
[2162.16] even pron try try to pronounce that from
[2165.04] midnight until morning and stars called
[2167.44] shuhub or luminous meteor meteors were
[2170.32] in extraordinary commotion going from
[2172.72] east to west and from north to south in
[2174.88] such a manner that no mortal could look
[2177.76] at the heavens.
[2179.88] Now right here this is interesting.
[2182.64] Okay, an earthquake. There was an
[2186.359] earthquake on Wednesday the 7th of the
[2188.88] month and then from midnight until
[2191.079] morning the stars called shoe hub were
[2194.8] an extraordinary commotion probably
[2197.44] falling to earth. Now is it possible
[2199.599] that there was
[2201.16] was
[2202.68] atmospheric detonations as we found in
[2207.48] Tangusa that was associated with an
[2210.599] earthquake. Why not? I mean otherwise
[2213.28] it's just simply a coincidence. But what
[2216.0] I'm proposing here is that when we look
[2218.16] at the traditional accounts that have
[2220.32] come down to us, we find these
[2223.32] correlations in such abundance that it
[2226.16] becomes hard to dismiss all of them as
[2227.839] being merely coincidence. And we know
[2230.16] from the lessons that we've learned from
[2232.76] Tangusa that yes that it a cosmic impact
[2237.04] even if it's an aerial detonation or an
[2239.2] aerial
[2240.2] bombardment can be and will can be
[2242.88] associated
[2244.119] with an earthquake. Okay. So this is not
[2247.839] at all stretching it to think that here
[2250.32] this event is talking about a phenomena
[2254.16] where earthquake
[2256.2] and you know meteors bolides being the
[2259.28] the collective
[2261.16] term are
[2266.52] associated okay notes found on a
[2268.96] calendar and printed at the end of the
[2270.839] chronic cavi
[2273.96] moratori. So this is
[2277.48] Italian anyways. AD 931 or
[2281.48] 934. In the same year appeared signs in
[2284.4] the heavens among the stars which
[2286.8] appeared some falling others blazing
[2290.079] like torches the 14th day of October the
[2293.92] second day of the moon. So here again
[2296.8] now torches right now this is completely
[2300.28] disconnected culture
[2303.72] cultural experience than what we
[2306.72] referred to earlier but we find
[2308.8] disperate cultures projecting the same
[2310.96] type of symbolism here in this case
[2315.72] torches ad AD55 on October 17th this
[2320.88] year there was a fall of stars during
[2322.72] the night preceding the first day of the
[2325.52] month Jadi or Higera 241 which continued
[2330.8] from the beginning of the night until
[2333.56] dawn. At the same period earthquakes
[2336.079] were felt in all parts of the
[2338.2] world. Again, are we looking at a
[2340.88] coincidence here or are we looking at a
[2345.839] unified phenomena that the fall of these
[2348.88] stars from the heavens and the
[2351.04] terrestrial response in the form of
[2352.96] seismic shaking or earthquakes that
[2355.44] they're part of the same event? I think
[2358.079] we need to be seriously considering
[2359.52] that. And to
[2361.32] reiterate this is one of the things the
[2363.92] important lessons takeaway lessons from
[2366.96] the Tangustka cosmic lesson.
[2371.64] Okay. AD 935 in the year
[2375.72] 323 several violent shocks of an
[2378.32] earthquake were felt in Egypt the third
[2380.48] day of Dada.
[2383.68] At about the same time, many of those
[2385.44] meteors called falling stars of a very
[2387.68] remarkable kind likewise appeared in
[2390.16] Egypt. I would like to mention that one
[2392.079] of our original sponsors at
[2394.28] Cosmographia, CBD from the Gods, is
[2397.44] following us here to our new podcast,
[2399.599] Squaring the Circle. As many of you
[2402.0] know, I've been using their products for
[2403.76] going on four years now. And having
[2406.48] tried a number of CBD brands, CBD from
[2409.839] the gods seems the most effective for my
[2412.4] needs. which is primarily as a sleep aid
[2415.359] and as a remedy for inflammation and
[2417.76] associated pain. I use both the oil and
[2421.599] the sav. My wife also likes their
[2424.48] products, especially the sav, which
[2426.24] alleviates the pain in her hands, which
[2428.8] is the result of working for years as an
[2431.24] electrician. If you've been thinking
[2433.04] about trying a CBD product and
[2435.04] experiencing the benefits for yourself,
[2437.68] give CBD from the gods a try. To learn
[2441.119] more and see their product line, check
[2443.92] out
[2446.599] CBDrothegods.com. Any purchase of their
[2448.72] products helps our efforts here at
[2450.64] Squaring the Circle to realize our goal
[2453.599] of making this world a better place.
[2456.599] Thanks. So, several violent shocks of an
[2459.64] earthquake. Now if you have an impact
[2464.16] even in say in the case of an
[2466.0] atmospheric impact like Tangusa or an
[2470.24] actual impact into the ground certainly
[2474.319] an impact into the ground of a
[2476.44] hypervelocity object is going to trigger
[2479.16] earthquakes. Now here again what we have
[2482.0] to realize and think about is
[2484.2] that many times the evidence is now
[2486.88] suggesting that many times impacts can
[2489.92] occur in clusters. Now witnessed in one
[2493.68] place you know there were people
[2496.04] who you know experienced some of the
[2498.72] after some of the effects of Dungusa
[2501.68] without knowing that it had been an
[2504.319] event in the sky. Right? people heard
[2506.96] what they described as a subterranean
[2509.119] rumbling like the the sound of multiple
[2512.96] freight trains passing under their feet
[2515.68] without really knowing necessarily at
[2518.48] maybe a 70 miles away there was this
[2522.48] tremendous violent atmospheric
[2525.0] explosion. Right? So you may have people
[2528.72] in one area witnessing the fall of of
[2532.56] cosmic debris, right?
[2535.839] But somewhere far removed from them,
[2537.76] there might be an actual impact or an
[2541.119] aerial burst along the lines of Tangusa
[2543.359] that they're unaware of. But they are
[2545.44] aware of the secondary consequences
[2547.599] which manifest as as
[2551.8] earthquakes. Okay. So then we get to
[2555.28] what I consider some of the most
[2556.72] important work on our catastrophic past
[2559.52] on this planet. The work of neoc
[2561.88] catastrophists from Britain. Two of the
[2565.119] most prominent, Victor Clube and and
[2566.88] Bill Napier, they wrote a book came out
[2570.319] in 1990 called The Cosmic Winter, which
[2572.64] I have read. I think it's probably
[2574.319] available online, but it's probably out
[2576.079] of print, so it may be expensive, but
[2578.319] you can look it up if you can get a hold
[2580.079] of it. Highly recommend it. If it's
[2582.56] still available, we will put a link on
[2586.2] our updated website which will be coming
[2589.119] out very soon and we'll put a link to
[2591.839] that in our bookstore of recommended
[2594.04] reading. Anyways, this is what they have
[2596.079] to say. Later, there was another attempt
[2598.64] to defeat Zeus when the Earth gave birth
[2601.92] to Typhon, a flaming winged monster
[2606.079] whose head reached to the stars, who had
[2609.52] a hundred serpents heads in place of
[2611.96] fingers, who was nothing but vipers from
[2614.8] the waist down and whose eyes flashed
[2617.72] fire. Typhon was destroyed by Zeus's
[2621.4] thunderbolts and fell a flame to the
[2623.92] ground. Now that's very interesting
[2625.599] because there's a parallel there with
[2627.28] the story of fate the son of Haleos who
[2630.64] tried to drive his father's chariot in
[2632.72] the path of the sun but because he was
[2634.8] too weak and exper inexperienced the
[2637.04] four great steeds pulling the chariot
[2639.599] deviated away from the path of the
[2641.44] clipic clipic descended to earth set the
[2644.24] earth on fire and in order to save the
[2646.88] earth Zeus had to hurl a thunderbolt at
[2650.079] fatan and
[2652.04] he then met his demise
[2654.76] by falling to earth falling and then
[2658.319] falling into the river Aerodonis. So we
[2661.44] have in this case Zeus's
[2663.72] thunderbolts taking out Typhon and
[2666.24] Zeus's thunderbolts taking out
[2669.56] Fatan. Then then the authors here go on
[2672.4] Typhon is explicitly recognized as a
[2675.28] comet in classical and early medieval
[2677.68] times. Very important right now. So as
[2682.319] yeah being described as such by the
[2684.24] astrologer Lidus in AD 490 to 565 by
[2689.2] Plutarch and by Plenny who 800 years
[2692.16] after he should describes a comet called
[2695.119] Typhon having spiral like glowing red
[2699.56] knots. The spiral motif as we have seen
[2702.56] could only have been connected with a
[2704.24] comet if it were an extraordinary body.
[2707.76] And Carl Sean in his book on comets
[2710.72] suggests that possibly a rapidly
[2712.8] spinning nucleus throwing out tons of
[2716.88] volatile gases could give the give that
[2720.8] appearance. And in fact, he even
[2722.24] associates shows and I can show you in
[2726.079] as we go here even in the Chinese
[2729.2] accounts of comets and the different
[2731.04] types of comets, there's one type of a
[2733.52] comet that's represented as a as
[2737.56] a whirling type of object that would
[2741.28] looks like a
[2742.599] swastika. Okay. And possibly even I
[2746.079] think that Carl Sean was intimating that
[2749.359] that could have been the origin of the
[2751.44] swastika symbol as a symbol of cosmic
[2757.16] power. So here is
[2761.079] a ancient Babylonian cylinder seal that
[2764.4] shows Marduk here doing battle with the
[2768.56] great dragon Tiiamat. So this is a
[2771.359] counterpart to the battle between Zeus
[2773.68] and Typhon. So Tiiamat has all of the
[2776.96] same characteristics we just associated
[2779.2] with Typhon. And ultimately Marduk
[2782.96] defeats the great dragon Tiiamat. And I
[2786.56] would suggest that this could be a
[2788.88] possible reference to
[2791.24] a to a cosmic event.
[2794.8] And you can see here some of the stuff
[2797.4] that that Marduk is wielding. It looks
[2801.28] like he could be wielding even a vagra.
[2805.56] Here we see notice this figure over
[2808.64] here. This up here. This could be the
[2811.68] sun or it could also be something
[2813.52] exploding in the sky.
[2820.64] And just as a reminder, the Tangusa
[2823.28] cosmic event, this is 5 miles from
[2825.359] ground zero. 20 years after the
[2827.88] blast, something like 820 square miles
[2830.88] of old growth Taigga forest were
[2832.64] completely
[2834.119] decimated. Tens of millions of trees
[2836.56] were
[2837.4] destroyed. And this would be enough to
[2839.52] take out any urban area on Earth. an
[2843.04] explosion of this magnitude. We've
[2844.72] discussed
[2845.64] it multiple times here in these
[2849.4] episodes. 15 megat tons. A 15 megat ton
[2853.76] blast is about roughly equivalent to the
[2856.56] largest nuclear hydrogen bombs tested in
[2861.119] the American arsenals during the peak of
[2863.2] the cold war back in the 1950s.
[2869.599] So here theatum kticum from 1667. This
[2874.16] is a traditional European depiction of a
[2876.56] comet and meteors as cosmic
[2886.76] serpents. Now with this we're just going
[2889.76] to look for a second ant orbit of a
[2892.64] typical meteor stream. This this being
[2894.88] the torid meteors. Now, for those of you
[2896.72] that have watched my Halloween
[2901.16] presentation, I include this and was
[2904.0] actually created this for the Halloween
[2906.2] presentation, which even though it's
[2908.96] focused on Halloween, it it's a broad
[2911.52] net that covers a bunch of stuff that
[2914.24] most people don't realize is all
[2916.16] interrelated and interconnected and then
[2918.96] manifests through our ceremony, our
[2923.2] yearly observation of Halloween, which
[2925.359] was ultimately descended from the
[2929.48] universal observation of the Day of the
[2932.52] Dead. What we're going to look do here
[2934.64] is we're going to look at this and
[2935.839] you're going to see that you've got two
[2939.04] orange ellipses here. Now this is based
[2941.68] upon photographic studies that were done
[2945.72] by Fred Whipple originally but what they
[2949.44] do is if you look at two of them what
[2951.839] I've done is I've selected two represent
[2954.96] the limits of the torid stream right so
[2959.28] if you look here you can see here's the
[2961.359] sun let's go through this this is the
[2962.96] sun and here's the orbit of Mercury
[2965.76] here's the orbit of Venus and here's the
[2967.76] orbit of earth here's the orbit of Mars.
[2971.44] The arrows show the direction of the
[2973.559] orbits. So, we're going around this way.
[2976.8] This is the orbit of the Earth going
[2978.96] this way. The stream is moving this way.
[2983.359] And it and it this is the orbit of
[2985.2] Jupiter. So, you can see
[2987.48] that the reason I've picked these two is
[2990.079] they kind of
[2991.4] pre demarcate the limits of the of the
[2996.64] shower. Right. So one was at kind of at
[2999.119] the outermost limit, one was at the
[3000.96] innermost limit of the shower. So you
[3003.119] can see if the earth is moving around
[3004.96] the sun here and then it takes some
[3007.68] passage of time. This is actually a
[3009.44] couple of weeks to traverse this
[3011.04] distance
[3012.2] here. I'm going to go to the next one
[3014.48] here. So yeah, now you can see I've
[3017.359] provided some dates here. I've done a
[3019.76] little graphic here to help visualize
[3021.839] that this is the meteor stream here. Now
[3024.88] you can see here as the meteor streams
[3027.28] are coming in this way they make their
[3030.48] parihelion passage it's called
[3032.319] parihelion meaning it's closest to the
[3034.319] earth to the sun right parelion right so
[3038.559] then it comes around this way it comes
[3040.4] from behind the sun and then roughly
[3043.68] around June 30th it is when the earth
[3048.559] crosses the stream okay then some months
[3052.96] pass June July August,
[3055.16] September, October and then at the end
[3057.68] of October, the early November, we see
[3060.24] that the Earth crosses the stream a
[3062.16] second time. Now, the difference here
[3064.64] between these two crossings is that in
[3067.599] June, it's crossing the orbit, the torid
[3070.72] meteor shower, as the stuff is coming
[3074.4] from its close passage by the sun. So
[3077.28] obviously if you think about it, if
[3078.96] you're here looking upstream to see
[3081.68] where this stuff is coming from, you're
[3083.44] not going to see much because you're
[3085.119] looking almost directly at the sun.
[3087.64] Whereas when you get over here to
[3089.76] November 1st, you're looking upstream.
[3093.119] So an object approaching during this
[3095.359] stream here is going to be visible much
[3098.319] sooner than it is over here on June 30th
[3103.04] for obvious reasons. Right? You can see
[3105.04] that right here. You're look, if if an
[3107.2] object is approaching, you're looking
[3110.359] upstream towards the sun. You're not
[3112.48] going to see it until the very last
[3114.72] second basically. And then here looking
[3117.599] away from the sun. You're looking out
[3119.839] following this
[3121.16] arrow and it leads directly to the
[3124.52] Pletes. The Pletes, the star cluster, is
[3127.92] the radiant point, if you will, where
[3131.68] the the meteors appear to be emanating
[3134.16] from. Okay. Now the
[3137.16] Pletes in the classical depiction of
[3140.0] Taurus the bull and hence the name the
[3143.28] torids the torid meteor shower the
[3146.559] pletes occupies the shoulder of the
[3148.96] bull. So basically if you're going to go
[3151.359] out on around November 1st actually it
[3155.359] takes couple of weeks to cross the whole
[3157.839] stream but it the peak of that is around
[3160.88] the the last few days of October and the
[3163.119] first few days of November. Now in the
[3167.0] Halloween live stream that I did which
[3169.359] is now available the whole recorded
[3173.72] ver the whole recorded version of it is
[3176.4] is available online you can download it
[3179.52] I think it's pretty affordable but it
[3181.839] goes into explaining this association
[3184.88] between the tor meteor shower and the
[3187.04] origins of Halloween and the day of the
[3189.119] dead and I think if you're interested in
[3191.359] this kind of stuff at all if you're
[3192.8] interested in the catastrophic history
[3194.48] of our planet, its effects on
[3197.119] civilization. If you're interested in
[3198.88] symbolism and metaphors, if you're
[3200.8] interested in some of the ceremonial
[3203.68] traditions and customs of our own modern
[3206.0] times, there's a lot to unpack in
[3209.319] that
[3211.559] Halloween presentation that I put
[3213.88] together. But this is the thing to keep
[3216.0] in mind. Now, we've talked so much about
[3218.8] the Tangusa event. Now here I think
[3221.839] you'll be able to if you haven't put
[3223.52] these this two and two together yet here
[3225.599] here's your
[3227.4] opportunity. Tunguska occurred on June
[3229.92] 30th right at the peak of the summertime
[3233.8] torids. So the timing during the year
[3237.44] was precisely what it would have needed
[3239.119] to have been in order to be a member of
[3241.839] the torid family of meteors, comets, and
[3246.2] asteroids. Okay.
[3249.48] Secondly, eyewitnesses
[3252.52] describe describe the the emergence of
[3256.319] the meteorite as coming from the
[3260.04] sun. Some of the descriptions refer to
[3262.88] it as being born out of the sun. Some of
[3264.88] it some of the one of the descriptions
[3267.88] saying born as it were from the sun.
[3271.92] Well, in other words, because it's
[3274.48] coming for directly from the sun or or
[3277.76] it appears to be from the vantage point
[3279.68] of an observer on the earth. So that's
[3282.88] precisely where you would expect a torid
[3285.92] meteor to be coming out of the sky.
[3288.319] Okay? So its placement in the sky is
[3291.68] consistent with a torid meteor and its
[3294.079] timing is consistent with a torid
[3296.4] meteor. That doesn't mean that
[3299.48] Tatangusa, it doesn't prove that it was
[3302.24] a member of the Torid meteor stream, but
[3304.72] what it does do is it makes a very
[3307.04] strong circumstantial case that that is
[3309.599] in fact what it was. and and Bill Napier
[3313.119] has written a whole paper on looking at
[3316.319] the evidence that possibly the younger
[3319.119] driest
[3320.359] bolide or multiple bolides as the case
[3323.359] may be were members of the torid meteor
[3326.88] stream.
[3331.72] Okay, so here now is kind of what we
[3334.88] post with the studies that were done in
[3337.92] 1986 and afterwards with the return of
[3341.44] comet Halley, we learned something about
[3343.44] the structure of comet nuclei which we
[3347.2] kind of already knew but which is which
[3349.359] I think is very significant especially
[3351.839] in
[3353.559] understanding the way it may have
[3355.839] affected the ancient world and also the
[3359.119] these events were encoded into
[3361.839] symbolism. So here is the type comet
[3364.88] nucleus and now in the next image we're
[3366.799] going to look at a cutaway view and what
[3369.839] we have here is we have a frozen icy
[3372.44] matrix loaded with volatiles that we can
[3375.28] see are outgassing here and then
[3379.04] macroscopic debris. Now, all of this
[3381.44] stuff could be anywhere from large
[3385.119] chunks of ice to
[3387.16] boulders that are
[3389.16] being contained within this matrix here.
[3393.599] Then there's a there's a crust that kind
[3396.559] of binds it all together. But when a
[3399.04] comet nucleus comes in close to a planet
[3401.76] or comes in toward towards the sun, both
[3404.559] gravity forces and thermal forces can
[3407.52] cause the comet nucleus to begin to
[3411.44] disagregate or to disintegrate. It
[3414.559] begins with the outgassing of volatiles
[3416.48] as is depicted here. But you can
[3419.119] visualize from this what would happen if
[3421.2] this nucleus completely disintegrated.
[3424.24] Well, what you would have then is you
[3426.4] would have countless thousands, hundreds
[3429.359] of thousands possibly of shooting stars
[3432.72] that could range from specs the size of
[3435.92] a grain of sand to the size of your
[3438.72] thumbnail all the way up to the size of
[3441.2] the Tangusa object and larger. Now, the
[3444.16] Tangusa object, remember, estimates are
[3446.319] there was about 150 ft in diameter.
[3448.88] Well, a 10 mile
[3450.92] do comet nucleus like this could contain
[3453.839] potentially hundreds of thousands of
[3456.559] Tangus- like objects. This is something
[3458.64] that we should keep in mind because if
[3461.92] we're basing our ideas of planetary
[3464.24] defense upon just a single, you know,
[3467.68] isolated asteroid impact, of course,
[3470.559] that might be one scenario. And then we
[3473.119] know from repeated close encounters over
[3476.16] the last 20 or 30 years since we've been
[3478.079] really keeping track that impacts of
[3481.359] asteroids are way more common than we
[3483.76] would have
[3484.599] previously imagined. And this is
[3486.799] something that I document and get into
[3488.48] again in the series on the the
[3491.52] apocalyptic series and squaring the
[3493.359] circle. So I highly recommend because
[3496.079] this is such an important subject. I
[3498.72] highly recommend going back and
[3500.72] reviewing those, re-watching them. And
[3503.599] as you watch them for the second or even
[3505.28] the third time, that's when you're going
[3506.799] to begin to see the connections forming.
[3508.88] That's when you're going to begin to see
[3510.319] sort of an integral pattern linking all
[3512.96] of these things together, right? from
[3516.48] impacts that leave astroblams and
[3518.96] craters in the ground to to air bursts
[3521.44] like Tungusa to near misses that we know
[3524.72] we've experienced repeatedly in the last
[3528.079] 20 or 30 years. I started keeping track
[3531.44] and and recording near misses in 1988.
[3534.96] And there's been at least several
[3536.559] hundred since then. And the episodes
[3541.04] dealing with that, the square in the
[3543.2] circle episodes dealing with that
[3544.64] phenomena, I call while man close
[3546.92] encounters while mankind sleeps because
[3550.48] the majority of of the human race, the
[3553.28] human species, including professionals
[3555.44] and scientists other than a small group
[3558.799] are basically oblivious to the fact that
[3562.559] many of these events have been occurring
[3565.2] in recent times.
[3568.52] And I think, let me see if I can pull
[3572.4] this up here
[3575.24] in this past year, this past June, June
[3579.559] 29th. I may have talked about this. I'm
[3582.319] going to talk about it again though
[3583.44] because it was really such an important
[3585.04] wakeup call for
[3586.52] us in June 29th of this year. Now,
[3590.24] notice the date. Notice the date, right?
[3593.359] So, this is of the summertime torids.
[3596.88] So, asteroid 2024 MK flew past the Earth
[3600.96] well within the lunar orbit. Now, I'm
[3602.559] going to say and I'm not it's going to
[3604.079] not going to be the focus of this
[3605.359] particular discussion, but we now know
[3608.4] that there's no necessarily clear line
[3611.359] of definition separating comets from
[3614.799] asteroids. We now know that a we've seen
[3617.839] and witnessed a lot of ca asteroids that
[3620.319] are displaying cometary behavior,
[3622.88] apparently outgassing volatiles and so
[3624.96] on. We also see what look to be
[3628.599] devolatile devolatilized comet nuclei
[3631.76] that are very much like asteroids. Okay,
[3636.079] so this is something that we're kind of
[3637.76] like, you know, the definitions here of
[3640.48] asteroids on one side, comets on another
[3642.64] side are beginning to to dissolve. Okay,
[3646.0] so anyways, on June 29th of this year,
[3648.079] asteroid 2024 MK flew past the Earth
[3651.04] well within the lunar orbit. I I wrote
[3653.599] this
[3655.04] you know, in maybe late
[3658.04] summer after this had passed. It was one
[3660.559] that I found particularly impressive.
[3663.119] So, I wrote about it and that's what I'm
[3665.52] reading from here. It was only
[3667.28] discovered on June 16th, less than 2
[3669.92] weeks before its rendevous with Earth.
[3672.64] This asteroid was estimated to be
[3674.88] between 500 and 800 ft in
[3677.799] diameter. Now, that's much much bigger
[3681.28] than the Tungusa object, right? This
[3684.799] something that's 800 feet in diameter
[3686.64] would be remember because if these are
[3688.88] roughly
[3689.799] spherical then the volume of a sphere
[3693.359] scales by the cube of the
[3696.359] radius. So we can talk that's something
[3699.839] that I've talked about and we'll talk
[3701.2] about again just so we get a sense of
[3702.799] the
[3704.2] scale. So anyways this this object 2024
[3708.24] MK flying past the earth it was much
[3710.64] bigger than Tangusa.
[3713.319] Okay, with only a slightly, now here's
[3715.839] the thing, with only a slightly
[3717.04] different trajectory, this object could
[3719.2] have collided with the Earth, causing an
[3721.4] explosion with the power of at least 500
[3725.52] to 600 1 megaton hydrogen
[3729.64] bombs. Now, this is more than the
[3731.76] combined energy of all nuclear weapons
[3733.68] presently in the world. Had it been on
[3737.359] this slightly different trajectory and
[3739.76] had it made an Earth
[3742.839] impact, it would have blasted a crater
[3745.839] somewhere be around 2 and 12 miles
[3750.119] wide and about 1,500 ft 1,500 ft deep.
[3755.28] Fireball generated by the impact would
[3757.76] have been well over 3 miles in diameter.
[3761.599] And in a densely populated area such as
[3764.4] the east coast of the United
[3766.52] States, more than a million people would
[3769.68] have been instantly vaporized in the
[3772.68] fireball or killed from the blast.
[3776.4] Another 200,000 people would die from
[3779.04] the 240 del shock wave. About half a
[3783.2] million people would receive thirdderee
[3785.559] burns and another 2 and a half million
[3788.48] would suffer from secondderee burns.
[3791.599] Within 9 to 13 miles of the blast
[3794.599] center, survivors would experience lung
[3797.52] damage and ruptured eard drums. Within
[3801.119] 25 mi of the impact epicenter, trees
[3804.64] would be knocked down and ignite into
[3808.52] flames. Most buildings would collapse up
[3812.079] to 22 miles from the impact site, and
[3816.359] houses within 30 miles would be
[3819.599] destroyed.
[3820.96] a powerful earthquake at least 6.3 on
[3824.24] the RTOR scale and probably much greater
[3826.72] than that as you are in the proximity of
[3829.52] the actual impact
[3831.88] epicenter would kill thousands of more
[3834.559] people and it could be felt up to 40
[3837.68] miles or more away. The peak wind speeds
[3841.68] emanating outward from the area of the
[3845.559] blast would reach up to 8,000 miles per
[3850.599] hour. Inside of 20 miles of the blast,
[3855.92] it would have felt like being inside
[3857.76] inside an F5
[3860.44] tornado. So, the natural calamities that
[3862.96] could affect human civilization in
[3865.2] profound ways are numerous. Yet I
[3868.559] mention this, the priorities of most of
[3871.359] the political establishment entirely
[3873.359] neglect these possibilities in favor of
[3875.839] contrived scenarios built on
[3878.319] cherrypicked science exploited to
[3880.48] promote a pre-ordained conclusion that
[3885.0] humankind is causing a climate crisis by
[3888.079] the use of fossil fuels. But the irony
[3890.96] of this is that as we stand on the
[3893.119] threshold of a new industrial
[3895.0] civilization based upon plasma physics,
[3897.92] if it is not suppressed, the whole
[3899.68] question of fossil fuel use and CO2
[3902.559] induced climate change becomes
[3904.92] irrelevant. But not to get off on
[3907.96] that on that track
[3910.92] now. So anyways, I'm going to show a
[3913.119] couple of pictures here to give you
[3917.64] the There we go. So here we
[3920.68] have a second generation disintegration
[3923.599] of comet Schwasman Wman fragment B
[3926.799] photographed by the Hubble
[3928.44] P space telescope April 18th 2006 and
[3932.319] what we see here is what we know now
[3934.799] know as the ultimate fate of con comets
[3937.119] if they don't crash into planets or fall
[3939.839] into the sun and that is they
[3941.799] disintegrate and they create meteor
[3944.16] streams but in those meteor streams you
[3946.72] might have extraordinary arily
[3950.359] major objects such as Tungusa and up up
[3955.119] to perhaps a half kilometer or kilometer
[3957.839] in diameter. In fact, it's been
[3959.44] estimated by Clue and Napier that in the
[3961.599] Torid media stream there may be dozens
[3965.039] of objects that we haven't detected yet
[3968.0] that could be half a kilometer to to a
[3970.48] kilometer in diameter.
[3974.88] And then of course this was another one
[3976.64] of the great cosmic teaching events of
[3979.599] recent history. This was the impact of
[3982.72] 21
[3984.92] objects from the disintegration of an
[3988.24] original single
[3990.839] nucleus in 19 July 1994. Shoemaker Levy
[3994.88] 9. And what we learned from this is that
[3998.16] yes comets can start out as a single
[4000.64] nucleus. they can fragment and produce
[4003.52] multiple nuclei and these nuclei can
[4007.28] then crash into planets. In this case,
[4009.119] it was Jupiter. What had been happening
[4011.68] here most likely is that for hundreds of
[4014.64] years or centuries, maybe even
[4016.44] millennia, Shoemaker Levy 9 un
[4020.44] unbeknownst to astronomers on Earth been
[4023.92] circling between the sun and Jupiter.
[4026.799] Well, each passage around Jupiter,
[4029.359] Jupiter's great gravity field tightens
[4031.44] its orbit and brought it in a little
[4034.359] closer. And what we discovered
[4038.76] was it was Carolyn Shoemaker and David
[4042.039] Levy who were co-discoverers of this
[4044.72] comet. So therefore, it bears their
[4046.48] name. And what we saw was the last or we
[4051.28] could say yeah the
[4053.72] last
[4055.319] parajovian orbit of this nucleus. It
[4059.039] passed so close to Jupiter without
[4061.44] hitting it but it passed so close to
[4063.039] Jupiter that the incredibly strong
[4065.44] gravity field of Jupiter literally
[4068.24] ripped the single nucleus into 21
[4070.76] pieces. And it was discovered just as
[4074.24] this fragmenting nucleus was emerging
[4077.52] from behind Jupiter. And then over the
[4079.92] next 3 or 4 months, it was seen that
[4082.319] these 21 separate objects spread out in
[4085.119] space and formed a so-called string of
[4087.2] pearls. After 3 to four months of
[4090.599] observations, the astronomers were able
[4092.96] to to
[4094.839] construct its its elliptical geometry
[4098.4] and they were able to construct
[4101.239] its period of revolution. And once they
[4105.279] had those two major facts in hand, they
[4107.44] were able to project where it was going
[4110.0] to be and when it was going to be going
[4111.839] into the future. So it's sort of an
[4114.319] example of prophecy, if you will. They
[4117.359] were able to predict that in around the
[4120.159] second week of July
[4122.279] 1994, these objects, this train of chain
[4125.839] of pearls was going to cross Jupiter's
[4127.96] orbit once again. But what made this so
[4130.719] significant was the fact that when they
[4133.6] crossed Jupiter's orbit and where they
[4135.6] crossed Jupiter's orbit at that time and
[4138.319] place, Jupiter itself was going to be
[4140.0] right at that spot. And therefore these
[4144.0] 21 pieces were going to collide with
[4146.08] Jupiter which they in fact did. It was
[4149.759] the most watched astronomical event of
[4152.239] the 20th century at that
[4155.159] time. Extremely important lessons that
[4158.0] we have derived from that because now
[4161.04] prior to Shoemaker leaving 9 most models
[4164.159] of cosmic impact just single isolated
[4168.56] events. one object, one
[4171.64] impact. But with this, we learned that
[4174.48] yes, you can have a multiple impact
[4176.799] event. I believe that this set up the
[4179.679] potential for a model of the younger dus
[4182.159] encounter because it looks to me very
[4184.4] much like there was more than a single
[4187.08] impact associated with the younger dus,
[4189.839] the lower younger dus boundary. There
[4191.92] have may have been multiple impacts. In
[4194.4] fact, I would speculate that there could
[4196.0] have been 10 or more
[4198.12] impacts between Earth and members of
[4202.32] some disintegrated comet back during the
[4206.239] Younger Dus. And we are going to explore
[4210.32] and get up to date on what the latest
[4212.4] research says about the Younger Dus in a
[4215.52] series of upcoming episodes. We're going
[4217.44] to really unpack that and try to derive
[4220.48] what lessons it has to teach our modern
[4222.56] civilization. Because let me say this,
[4226.08] you know, archaeologists now are going
[4228.88] to claim that there's nothing really
[4231.04] happening in prehistory that could be
[4232.88] construed as science, technology,
[4236.4] advanced civilizations. They're all
[4238.48] always down on Graham Hancock calling
[4240.719] him names because he's willing to ask
[4243.28] questions and hypothesized the
[4245.84] possibility that there may have been
[4247.64] going more going on in ancient history
[4250.48] than has been recognized up to this
[4252.719] point. Well, that scenario is completely
[4256.159] dismissed by the archaeological
[4257.92] establishment who for whatever reason
[4259.76] are highly invested in this uniform
[4262.719] linear model they've got of prehistory
[4264.88] that excludes any possibility for an
[4267.76] advanced or ci sophisticated or
[4270.8] scientifically based culture. Now, this
[4272.96] is a question that I feel is not closed
[4276.719] to scientific inquiry and needs to be
[4280.76] investigated. We're going to get into
[4282.56] that. That's part of the themes we're
[4284.08] going to be exploring in depth with this
[4286.08] podcast and with Cosmographia, the
[4288.56] sister podcast that I'm still doing with
[4291.28] Brad Young and and a number of other
[4294.08] hopefully visitors that will be able to
[4296.159] be bring their expertise to the table.
[4298.64] Remember, cosmographia comes from the
[4300.64] term cosmography, which was sort of the
[4302.92] all-encompassing view of how the world
[4305.76] system works. Okay, that's why I chose
[4308.64] that particular name for that podcast.
[4311.32] So because of the fact that there are
[4314.0] these sort of divergent areas, but of
[4316.8] course
[4318.36] overlapping, I feel like it was
[4320.8] advantageous to actually have two
[4322.64] podcasts that sort of have slightly
[4324.56] different but overlapping zones of
[4327.8] interest. Okay, so I think we're getting
[4330.88] to the point where we're going to wrap
[4332.4] up this episode. We'll look at the next
[4335.44] slide image here and I think we'll close
[4338.719] with this. This is comet
[4341.239] linear and we see here two stages of the
[4345.719] fragmentation in the first stage of the
[4347.92] breakup of the nucleus here and then if
[4350.88] you zoom in on this you can see and if
[4354.239] you look this up online I think you can
[4355.84] find some fairly high resolution images
[4358.159] of this again take your notes from just
[4361.52] pause this whenever you want to get more
[4364.32] references or
[4365.56] whatever and you can see I've got the
[4367.76] references down here for you to find it.
[4370.159] But what's happening here is the single
[4371.92] nucleus is broken up into hundreds of of
[4374.48] subnuclei if you will. Now you can
[4378.12] imagine that the Earth encountering a
[4381.76] blob, a swarm, I'll call it a swarm like
[4384.56] this.
[4386.199] The probabilities of an impact are going
[4388.88] to be much higher than you would have if
[4391.199] it was a single object. Now if it was
[4393.04] all in a single object obviously that
[4395.56] one progenitor object would be more
[4399.0] catastrophic striking the earth than one
[4402.239] of the subnuclei that we see here one of
[4405.12] the pieces right however the
[4408.6] probabilities of being struck by the
[4411.199] earth once the nucleus is fragmented
[4414.4] into hundreds or perhaps thousands of
[4417.48] pieces that probability is going to be
[4420.32] much much higher. See, and if some of
[4423.679] these pieces are in the range of tenus
[4426.4] and bigger up to two three two three 400
[4429.28] feet in diameter and earth is struck by
[4432.84] multiple image uh objects of that scale.
[4436.719] Yeah, it would be like a nuclear war
[4439.0] without of course the radiation. Unless
[4442.48] of course what we now also know from
[4444.32] Tangusa is that there was a dramatic
[4447.28] drop in ozone in the aftermath of the
[4450.32] Tangusa event. A drop in ozone now
[4453.719] allows, you know, the ozone acts as an
[4456.32] insulating blanket that helps to prevent
[4458.88] cosmic radiation from striking the
[4460.96] surface of the earth. So if you have an
[4463.36] impact or multiple impacts along the
[4465.92] lines of Tangusa, it's likely that the
[4468.48] ozone layer is going to be dramatically
[4470.56] affected allowing greater bombardment of
[4473.52] cosmic rays. So there's a
[4476.12] whole set of secondary phenomena here
[4478.96] that we need to also be looking at. And
[4481.28] as we go into this in the next episode,
[4483.12] I'm going to be continuing to dive
[4484.64] deeper into the symbolical
[4486.679] representation of these events by
[4489.199] ancient cultures. And we're going to see
[4490.8] how a lot of the the traditions of
[4494.04] prophecy were based upon this kind of a
[4499.04] phenomena and the experience of this
[4500.56] phenomena.
[4501.92] I'll make the final analogy here is
[4504.6] that the astronomers looked
[4508.199] at Shoemaker leaving nine and were then
[4511.52] able to project into the future and
[4514.719] determine that a year hence that this
[4518.719] was going to strike Jupiter in a way
[4522.159] they were like prophets of old.
[4524.84] Now if we you know there's there is
[4528.96] going to be in 2029 there's going to be
[4531.6] a near miss between Earth and an
[4534.12] asteroid. The question is is will that
[4536.719] asteroid then come back
[4539.08] to just like with Shoemaker leaving the
[4542.4] the gravity field of Jupiter drew it
[4544.88] ever every every orbit around it drew
[4547.679] that object that comet in closer. Right.
[4551.199] The question is is this the occurrence
[4553.84] of the
[4556.199] 2029 object going to undergo a similar
[4560.36] process? But here's the thing. Once
[4563.36] we've determined with a high degree of
[4565.44] precision the orbital elements, that's
[4567.6] what you call the orbital elements of
[4569.52] any orbiting object, whether it's a
[4571.92] comet or whether it's an asteroid or
[4573.88] whatever, you can now make predictions
[4576.64] with a high degree of accuracy as to
[4579.679] where they're going to be and when
[4580.96] they're going to be there. Right? So
[4583.12] what that does is it kind of puts the
[4584.96] modern astronomers who now can make
[4588.0] predictions and pred projections like
[4590.08] this sort of in a way is like our
[4592.08] modern-day prophets. And I'm going to
[4594.96] suggest the idea that the traditions
[4599.04] that have come down to us of intensive
[4602.08] obsessive
[4603.48] observations of the sky and what's
[4605.92] happening in the sky were all about
[4608.48] being able to predict and understand the
[4611.44] heavenly motions that were going to
[4612.88] affect life on Earth here below. And so
[4616.239] that will be where we continue with this
[4618.08] in the next episode of Squaring the
[4620.64] Circle. Thanks for joining me and I hope
[4623.52] to see you again and look up our work on
[4628.36] howto.com
[4630.6] randallcarlson.com and we'll see you in
[4633.28] the next episode. Thanks. Greetings.
[4636.8] Welcome to another episode of Squaring
[4639.04] the Circle. I'm your host, Randall
[4640.88] Carlson, and we're going to be
[4642.48] exploring, continue to explore some
[4644.48] interesting topics that I feel are
[4646.64] actually extremely important for we, the
[4649.52] human species, to know
[4651.85] [Music]
[4657.93] [Applause]
[4663.48] about. So, we've been talking about
[4665.84] cosmic impacts for a number of episodes
[4668.8] now. In fact, I think this is going to
[4670.76] be part 11 of the Apocalypse Unsealed
[4676.84] series that I hope that somebody who
[4679.36] works their way through all I think it's
[4682.239] going to end up being 12 parts. all 12
[4684.239] parts will come away with a pretty
[4686.4] thorough understanding of this whole
[4689.12] phenomena that I believe lies at the
[4692.159] core or the foundation of all of the
[4694.56] myths of apocalypse, traditions of
[4696.88] apocalypse that have come to down to us
[4699.36] through the ages from multiple cultural
[4702.64] sources. All right. So I think what
[4705.6] we'll do is we will just dive right in
[4709.4] here and start exploring some of the
[4712.8] relevant
[4714.28] information and let us try to do this
[4719.199] and see what happens. We are going to
[4722.08] start by talking about
[4725.08] comets. Let's see what do we want to
[4727.36] start. So here we go. Comet we want to
[4729.92] start with a definition first then we'll
[4732.719] move on from there. A comet is a
[4735.28] celestial body moving about the sun in
[4738.239] an elongated orbit usually consisting of
[4741.6] a central mass the nucleus surrounded by
[4745.04] a misty envelope which is the coma. It
[4748.56] extends into a stream which is the tail
[4752.48] in the direction away from the sun and
[4755.679] it's taken from the middle English. This
[4758.239] is an important clue right here for as
[4761.199] we begin to decipher some of the ancient
[4764.48] ways of encoding apocalyptic traditions.
[4768.159] Okay, it's taken from the middle English
[4770.56] which is taken from the Latin which
[4772.88] comes from the stem of comea or cometa
[4776.32] which is taken from the Greek and that
[4778.64] is a modification of cometes which
[4781.12] literally means longhaired. And for
[4784.64] anybody who has ever seen a comet, you
[4787.28] should know you you would know
[4790.28] that with the with the tail, you can
[4793.28] almost imagine that somebody in earlier
[4796.56] times might have looked at this
[4797.84] phenomena and seen the tail of the comet
[4801.92] almost as if it
[4804.12] was long hair streaming out. And
[4807.679] important point here, it says it's
[4809.44] always pointing away from the sun. Now,
[4811.679] that's somewhat different from the
[4813.239] trail. Okay, we're going to be looking
[4815.28] at the tail and the trail. The tail is
[4819.199] the gaseous, the
[4820.92] ion tail, if you will. It's basically
[4824.159] plasma. Okay, the trail is actual debris
[4828.32] that is spalling off of the comet. Now,
[4831.04] we now know that comets have a life
[4833.36] cycle, and in the final stages of their
[4836.0] life cycle, they begin to disintegrate.
[4838.64] That's part of their their final phase
[4842.239] of their existence or their life cycle
[4844.719] is that they begin to disintegrate. Now,
[4848.32] if we go through just very briefly, we
[4850.32] can cover this, we're we'll cover this
[4852.0] in more
[4853.0] detail as we go along, but you can think
[4856.92] of a comet having five phases in its in
[4860.96] its life cycle. And we're not going to
[4862.8] go through and break it all down now,
[4864.239] but just you know that at the beginning
[4867.12] a comet is probably refugees left over
[4870.32] from the creation of the solar
[4872.679] system left over from the creation the
[4875.6] the construction of the planets the
[4877.8] inner solid bodied planet planets. Okay.
[4882.08] So the
[4883.719] comets reside in two reservoirs the
[4887.04] Kyper disc and the cloud. And I've got a
[4891.36] nice graphic from the same company that
[4893.92] does Star War walks too, which we'll
[4895.92] look at in a second, and you'll be able
[4897.679] to envision this. But you've got these
[4899.12] two reservoirs. This is what you want to
[4901.12] keep in mind. Now, there's some little
[4903.92] bit of controversy, but I think at this
[4905.6] point the two reservoirs, there's enough
[4908.8] evidence that these that they're real,
[4910.719] that they exist, that if you actually
[4912.96] look into the studies, they're pretty
[4915.04] rigorous, they're pretty robust, that
[4917.76] there are these reservoirs of comets
[4920.08] that contain literally billions upon
[4922.88] billions of of comets.
[4924.92] Okay, so these objects are generally
[4929.12] very sly very slowly orbiting circling
[4933.44] the sun. They're very far out there. I
[4936.4] think what we'll do is we'll go
[4938.52] to let's see if we can see the Kyper
[4941.44] disc here. I've got a nice graphic. Here
[4944.4] we go. This
[4945.719] is this
[4949.0] is Veto Technology Incorporated. They're
[4952.48] the makers of the Starwalk 2. They got a
[4955.52] bunch of cool apps if you're into
[4957.199] astronomy that you can get for your
[4959.6] download for your phone, for your
[4961.6] computer, whatever you want. I've got I
[4964.8] do Starwalk on my phone and I love it. I
[4967.92] go out and I see a celestial object in
[4970.239] the sky. Want to know what it is? Boom.
[4973.44] I just turn on my my Starwalk. I aim it.
[4977.12] Many of you know about the these there
[4979.04] are other similar apps, but I use the
[4980.8] Starwalk, too. You just aim it at the
[4982.48] sky, point it after you've calibrated it
[4985.28] very simply, then you point it at the
[4986.96] sky at the object and you'll get a nice
[4989.36] screen coming up that'll show
[4991.639] you what exactly it is you're looking
[4994.159] at. And in fact, I might even open it up
[4997.12] here and see if let you look at it. But
[5000.0] looking at this graphic, let's go back
[5002.239] to the graphic here
[5006.04] on my PowerPoint
[5009.0] show.
[5011.32] And so this here you can see here this
[5015.84] is like a sphere. This is the the the UR
[5018.56] cloud. It's it's generally
[5021.0] spherical. Okay. Then you have the the
[5023.76] Kyper disc. is a flattened area
[5026.84] that most likely just grades into the
[5029.76] the spherical cloud. And you can see
[5032.08] what this graphic here's this is showing
[5034.52] the the area the region of the inner
[5038.52] planets and that of course is the region
[5041.6] within which we reside on planet earth.
[5045.12] Now the thing is is we have to now
[5048.239] enlarge our thinking because we
[5050.159] generally think of well the solar system
[5052.159] oh yeah it's it's the sun and nine
[5054.08] planets well not including the fact that
[5057.679] Pluto has been demoted so now there's
[5059.6] only eight planets but we all us older
[5063.36] people we always grew up with the nine
[5065.04] planets and it included Pluto and I
[5067.44] certainly can understand the arguments
[5069.96] for not including
[5072.36] Pluto but we won't get into
[5075.08] Anyways, we always think of the solar
[5077.36] system as being well the nine planets,
[5079.12] but really we have to enlarge our
[5080.56] thescape scope of our thinking now to
[5082.6] include the Kyper disc and the cloud
[5085.28] because they are an integral part of the
[5087.28] whole system and how it works. Without
[5089.56] those we essentially the the whole thing
[5092.08] wouldn't wouldn't function at all.
[5094.84] So the point is is that these are in a
[5098.639] sort of a
[5099.88] quasi stable rel configuration. I would
[5104.639] say you could you could explain it that
[5107.719] way. They're they're very very sensit
[5112.08] sensitive to any kind of perturbation at
[5114.4] all. Right? But the fact is the out
[5117.28] there in that region of in the vacuum of
[5120.48] space there just aren't many
[5122.0] perturbations that are going to upset
[5123.76] them. Well, on the larger scale, the
[5127.76] large the frame of the or cloud, what we
[5130.639] would assume is that
[5134.12] perhaps nearby supernovas that
[5137.719] cause gravity waves and shock waves to
[5141.6] move through the move outward from
[5144.199] the from the epis from the from the
[5148.719] nova. Okay, that could upset the balance
[5152.719] the the very precariously
[5155.08] balanced clouds comets that are in the
[5158.32] cloud
[5159.719] right perhaps a passing
[5162.76] star could dis dislodge comets from the
[5166.159] earth
[5167.239] cloud now what's going to happen out
[5169.44] there is those those cloud comets that
[5173.44] zone goes almost like halfway to the
[5176.32] nearest stars which is three to four or
[5179.12] five light years away. If it gets
[5182.199] jostled, it might go one of two things.
[5185.36] It might go further away from the sun
[5188.0] and get captured into the orbit of
[5190.239] another star, or it could start
[5192.48] migrating towards the sun. Now, the
[5195.52] Kyper disc might be more influenced by
[5198.88] the gravitational effects of the big
[5201.08] four outer gaseous planets, which is
[5204.0] Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
[5206.719] Now, we're going to talk about that
[5208.159] again in in probably in the next
[5210.48] episode. In the next part about this,
[5212.639] we'll get down into talking in detail
[5215.04] about the
[5216.28] five phases of a of the life cycle of a
[5219.28] comet. But what you're seeing here would
[5220.96] be the first phase in the life cycle of
[5224.08] a comet, which is they're out there
[5225.76] essentially in deep freeze, right?
[5228.4] They've been there for millions of years
[5230.639] in a in this close to zero absolute zero
[5235.44] temperature out there in deep space. But
[5237.76] if something disturbs them and they
[5240.32] start migrating in towards the solar
[5242.719] system, then they enter another phase of
[5245.679] their life cycle. They actually become
[5247.28] active. You have to think of them in a
[5249.12] way as hibernating. And then as they
[5251.679] come into the inner solar system or move
[5253.679] towards the sun, they begin to wake up.
[5256.48] Now we can now differentiate between the
[5261.56] sources, the two source regions for
[5265.199] comets that are entering into a an orbit
[5269.36] around the sun. One, if they're coming
[5272.32] from a steep angle to the to the plane
[5275.6] of the ecliptic, which is the the the
[5277.44] the orbital plane of the
[5279.96] planets, then they're probably from the
[5282.0] Earth cloud. If you just look at this
[5283.52] graphic here, you can see that
[5286.239] essentially you could come a comet could
[5288.639] come in towards the inner solar system
[5290.56] from any direction, right? If something
[5293.52] perturbs it, it starts moving and it
[5295.6] moves in towards the sun, it can come in
[5297.6] like at a steep angle. Now, the plane of
[5299.84] the ecliptic is the the orbital plane of
[5301.92] the planets. If a comet comes in on that
[5304.56] plane, it's probably originating in the
[5306.48] Kyper disc because the Kyper disc is
[5308.48] essentially in that plane of the
[5310.239] ecliptic extending out before it grades
[5312.56] into the or cloud. So what causes comets
[5317.199] to become dislodged from the Kyper disc
[5319.76] and start moving towards the sun?
[5322.08] probably more the influence of the like
[5325.12] I said the planets and again there's a
[5328.159] very interesting geometry between the
[5331.679] masses the ratio of the masses and the
[5333.679] distances of the outer four gaseous
[5336.52] planets and its effect on the inner zone
[5339.92] of the Kyper disc. Anyways, if a comet
[5344.48] is coming in from the or cloud and it's
[5346.32] coming in from a steep angle, chances
[5349.04] are it's on a parabolic orbit, which
[5351.44] means, you know, if you know your the
[5353.52] geometry of your conic sections, you
[5355.52] know that a that a parabola is
[5359.0] open-ended, right? So, if a comet comes
[5361.679] in on an open-ended, a parabolic orbit,
[5364.56] it's going to come in, it's going to
[5366.239] make a loop around the sun, and it's
[5368.32] going to go out and it'll probably never
[5370.239] return.
[5372.0] If it comes in from the Kyper disc, it
[5374.8] tends to get caught between a Jovian
[5377.679] orbit, Jupiter, and the sun. So,
[5380.84] it's it's it's oscillating back and
[5383.6] forth, if you will. It orbits the
[5386.52] sun and either goes out to Jupiter and
[5389.6] goes outside of the orbit of Jupiter or
[5391.76] it'll sometimes flip and come inside the
[5395.6] orbit of Jupiter. In any case, those
[5398.48] comets are going to be the ones that are
[5400.8] the
[5401.719] most dangerous in terms of their the
[5406.28] consequences of their life cycle in
[5409.679] terms of Earth because they lie in the
[5412.88] plane of the planets. Now, comets
[5416.0] disintegrate. That's part of their life
[5418.08] cycle. The nucleus of a comet is not
[5420.8] very solidly bound. In fact, it's more
[5424.08] like an icy matrix. and it's sused with
[5427.679] volatiles and a variety of different
[5430.639] kinds of material. And if that thing
[5433.52] starts to come apart, then it spews a
[5437.92] lot of debris into its orbit. That is
[5440.4] what forms the
[5441.96] trail. Meteor showers are part of the
[5445.52] solid material that has ultimately
[5448.239] originated from a comet. Okay? And we we
[5450.88] we've looked at some of that in the the
[5452.8] previous episodes. So, let's
[5455.639] just go on here and see what's coming
[5459.92] up. We don't need to get into this right
[5462.4] now, but what this shows you is the
[5464.48] what's called the orbital elements. And
[5467.6] with these scientists can essentially
[5470.159] become prophets of cosmic phenomena
[5472.159] because if they know the if they know
[5474.239] this geometry, if they know these things
[5476.4] here, descending node, ascending node,
[5480.12] perihelion, first point of Aries and the
[5482.48] plane of the
[5483.56] ecliptic and the aelion, if they know
[5486.88] those know those things, if they know
[5488.8] those elements, they can make very
[5491.52] accurate predictions about where an
[5493.92] orbiting object is going to be and when
[5496.159] it's going to be there and this is just
[5498.159] another variation of it. Okay, so this
[5499.92] is what I wanted to get
[5501.4] to. Here are some comets. This is comet
[5505.199] Cahoot late 1973 when that came in early
[5508.719] 1974.
[5510.32] What I remember about this particularly
[5512.159] is I and I do remember it well is
[5514.0] because this was the one of the first
[5516.32] times when I really remember that there
[5518.56] were these a lot
[5520.52] of concern and fear because a lot of
[5523.679] people believed that comet Cahoot
[5526.88] signaled some kind of
[5528.52] apocalyptic event was going to happen.
[5531.12] And there were all these predictions
[5532.4] around it and so
[5533.96] on about sweeping global changes and and
[5539.52] things that were going to happen which
[5541.52] as I recall didn't really happen other
[5543.36] than that comet Cahoot was a
[5546.199] beautiful object in the night sky for a
[5549.12] few weeks actually a couple of months
[5552.36] but as far as my own cons interests were
[5555.6] it really did stimulate my interest in
[5558.48] these kinds of phenomena so My I could
[5561.6] say that my interest in comets really
[5564.159] kind of goes back to
[5566.36] that comet Cahoot and that was would
[5569.36] have been the first comet I ever saw
[5573.88] personally and then there was the image
[5576.0] of comet Hayuki taken by Shigimi
[5579.159] Numazawa from Digata
[5581.8] Japan. Now comet Hayuki came by very
[5585.84] close to the time of comet Hailba. Now
[5588.639] there was some interesting things
[5590.36] about Yukataki that we learned is that
[5594.239] it had a lot of methane, ethane, and
[5598.48] even acetylene. It was discharging
[5601.56] acetylene. Okay, now that's very
[5603.44] interesting. And in my cosmographia
[5607.36] shows that I did talking about the great
[5610.52] firestorms, I I mentioned that as
[5612.8] possibly being a factor of significance.
[5615.28] I want you to notice here the the blue
[5617.679] tail coming off here. The blue gaseous
[5621.32] tail. Many comets have that blue gaseous
[5626.04] tail. Comet west. Now this is very to me
[5631.92] interesting because this the the tail of
[5634.96] the
[5635.639] comet was such that one can
[5638.84] really understand how a lot of ancient
[5641.36] peoples particularly the Chinese looked
[5643.76] at comets and and thought of great
[5646.4] cosmic brooms. In fact they were even I
[5648.96] don't know the Chinese word but they
[5650.239] were called broom comets. And
[5653.04] interestingly because of the traditions
[5656.0] and the associations with near
[5659.639] comtary
[5662.199] apparitions they came to believe that a
[5665.199] comet approaching the earth indicated or
[5668.0] heralded great sweeping
[5670.92] changes in the
[5673.0] world. As we now know scientifically in
[5676.639] some cases that is absolutely true.
[5682.719] There's another one of comet Hayuk
[5684.56] again. Notice the blue
[5689.32] tail. And I like always like this one. I
[5692.0] use this in the Halloween presentation
[5693.92] that I did because it has such a ghostly
[5697.08] appearance. H's comet. This was
[5699.28] photographed during its 1910
[5701.56] apparition.
[5703.719] And yes, this is oftenimes comets were
[5709.04] actually in Vid. It's interesting. Think
[5710.639] about this now. When you talk about like
[5712.8] a ghostly appearance, the appearance of
[5715.28] a ghost or a a ghostly figure like that,
[5719.92] it's referred to as an apparition. And
[5722.96] when you talk about the appearance of a
[5725.36] comet, they use the it's the same exact
[5728.0] term, apparition. So, I kind of
[5730.32] mentioned that as being maybe perhaps
[5732.48] more than coincidental in the
[5734.679] Halloween presentation that I do.
[5738.56] So yeah, this this I like this picture
[5740.719] because it really does kind of convey
[5742.8] sort of that
[5745.0] ghostly sense and how there were people
[5747.92] who who witnessed in some of the
[5749.92] eyewitness accounts. They are described
[5751.52] in language that would indicate that
[5754.48] they were thinking of
[5757.48] ghosts. Comet
[5761.88] Holmes. Yeah. Here's another 1910
[5764.88] showing a tail detachment. Look right
[5766.8] here. You can see the tail is beginning
[5768.719] to detach right here. You see
[5775.159] this? So here's 60 sec 7 seconds after
[5778.88] impact comet Temple 1 being struck by
[5781.6] the deep impact spacecraft right here.
[5783.92] Now Temple is
[5786.28] associated with one of the great meteor
[5789.4] streams, the
[5791.56] Leonids and comets of se
[5795.159] 1744. This is Chesso's comet of
[5799.0] 1774. The comet's head you can't see is
[5802.0] below the horizon. And notice this is
[5804.8] really would have been a sight to see.
[5806.48] The tail fans into synced six distinct
[5809.6] streams or it rays. The inset down here
[5814.08] shows the relation of the tail here to
[5817.44] the hidden nucleus.
[5820.88] If you could see the entire comet at
[5824.84] once and just a pair
[5827.32] of fireball. Well, you've got one great
[5830.48] Leonid fireball coming in here and it's
[5832.56] got a little attendant with it. Now,
[5835.52] were these two circulating as completely
[5837.92] separate objects before they encountered
[5840.88] this atmosphere or did this smaller
[5843.92] piece break off the larger piece? I have
[5846.32] no idea what the answer to that is.
[5852.719] And just a
[5853.96] nice painting that was done obviously
[5857.199] pre 911. And I kind of thought this was
[5860.96] sort of significant in the aftermath
[5862.8] because it almost looks like the comet
[5864.48] is headed for the twin
[5866.52] towers. That would have been comet
[5868.719] Hailbop I
[5870.44] believe. Okay. So now let's take a look
[5873.76] at the nucleus of a comet. Now after the
[5877.52] last apparition of comet Halley in
[5882.119] 1986 learned a lot about comets that we
[5884.719] didn't know before and we got
[5886.6] considerably deeper insight into the
[5890.239] structure of a cometary nucleus. Now
[5893.36] I've shown this before but it doesn't
[5895.36] hurt to review it quickly. You'll see
[5896.96] the the volatile spewing out here. And
[5900.4] then when you take a cross-section, what
[5903.28] you see here is solid material. It could
[5907.199] be anything. It could be silicut
[5910.84] material. And you see the volatiles, the
[5913.6] gases spewing out. And the point here,
[5916.4] now this is this along the long axis
[5919.199] here. This is about a 10 mile wide long
[5922.56] comet.
[5924.159] It could have literally thousands of
[5927.239] these macroscopic chunks in it that once
[5931.679] the comet begins to disintegrate, you'll
[5934.4] see that it can litter its pathway with
[5938.8] all kinds of stuff. Now, like I said,
[5941.119] meteors are the byproduct of comet
[5943.639] disintegrations.
[5945.159] Right now, typically, your shooting star
[5948.48] is going to be very tiny. It's probably
[5950.48] not going to be much bigger than your
[5952.0] thumb. And it's but it's still going to
[5953.679] be when it comes in at such a high rate
[5955.44] of
[5956.679] speed, it can create when that potential
[5960.56] energy gets converted to kinetic energy,
[5963.04] it can make quite an impressive light
[5965.199] show. Now, if you get something bigger,
[5966.639] the size of your fist or size of a of a
[5969.52] basketball or larger, it can really be a
[5972.4] spectacular site.
[5974.88] And we know we've we've talked a lot
[5977.76] here in these series of Apocalypse
[5981.52] Unsealed about Tungusa and that event.
[5984.239] So, go back and review that that
[5989.159] episode of this series because there's a
[5993.36] lot of material here and if you really
[5995.28] want to get a a good solid handle on on
[5998.32] what what the implications of this are,
[6000.96] you really need to revisit some of the
[6003.84] stuff so you can get down because
[6005.28] remember the old saying, the devil is in
[6007.36] the details. And you're going to find
[6009.36] out in a very interesting way that yes,
[6011.119] the devil really is hiding in these
[6012.8] details.
[6015.119] So, speaking of comtary nuclei breaking
[6017.76] up, here's the famous string of pearls
[6019.52] from Shoemaker Levy 9. This is a
[6021.92] cometary debris chain. Now, this was a
[6026.08] single comet nucleus, but just before
[6028.96] its discovery, it had passed very close
[6032.159] to the surface of Jupiter. Now, all the
[6036.239] big planets have this zone with
[6040.08] surrounding them. That's the where the
[6043.04] gravitational field is strong enough to
[6045.84] overcome the coherence the cohesiveness
[6048.88] of a cosmic body like a comet. Now you
[6051.76] you'd probably logic would tell you and
[6054.56] that that like a solid asteroidal type
[6057.44] body is going to be much less prone to
[6060.28] disintegrating than a cometary nucleus
[6063.119] which is mostly a bunch of stuff encased
[6065.28] in ice. Right? So what we had here was a
[6068.159] single nucleus that fractured as it
[6071.36] passed into the what's called the ro
[6074.239] limit. Remember the ro limit is the zone
[6077.76] the within the gravitational field of a
[6080.679] primary is strong enough to overcome the
[6084.8] coherence of a secondary. Now in this
[6087.04] case obviously a very big planet like
[6090.0] Jupiter is going to have a very strong
[6092.4] ro limit that extends quite a ways out
[6095.36] and of course a comet is going to be
[6096.96] weakly bound. So it's going to pass
[6099.76] within that ro limit and the gravity
[6102.0] field of Jupiter is literally going to
[6103.76] tear it apart. In this case here we had
[6105.92] one nucleus that became 21 nuclei. Now
[6111.119] this was in uh March
[6113.639] of 1993. that it was discovered. So now
[6118.76] astronomers, this named Shoemaker Levy 9
[6121.92] after Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy
[6124.8] who co-discovered the comet uh just as
[6127.6] it's emerging into the field of view
[6130.4] around Jupiter. So it was three I you
[6133.92] think maybe no more than four months of
[6137.48] observations allowed astronomers to
[6140.639] calculate all those orbital elements
[6142.48] that I just showed you. Right? The two
[6145.04] main ones were number one the geometry
[6148.48] of the elliptical orbit right the second
[6151.6] one was its velocity now all of that can
[6155.679] and then of course you know the plane of
[6157.36] the ecliptic is already already
[6158.96] established the ascending node and the
[6160.96] descending node that's just a matter of
[6164.44] of gathering the empirical data right
[6167.84] but once you have all of that and then
[6169.44] you look at the and you've got enough
[6171.36] observations over a long enough period
[6173.28] of time you can take a piece of that
[6176.239] ellipse that it defines its orbit and
[6178.719] you can then reconstruct the entire
[6182.8] elliptical orbit. Now if you know the
[6186.48] changes in the velocity and it is
[6188.32] changing because as the comet let's say
[6190.96] is moving away from Jupiter the gra the
[6194.8] gravity field of Jupiter is going to
[6196.32] tend to want to slow it down. But as it
[6199.04] moves away from Jupiter, Jupiter's
[6201.76] gravity field, its influence gets less
[6204.88] and less and the gravity of the sun
[6206.96] becomes more and more and eventually
[6209.199] it's the gravity field of the sun that
[6212.32] that now dominates the velocity of the
[6215.199] comet and then of course it's going to
[6216.719] be accelerating. But all that can be
[6218.96] worked out. It's all it's all just the
[6220.88] matter of using using calculus you can
[6224.8] calc you can you can compute those
[6228.159] changes. So now you've got the two
[6230.08] you've got the geometries and you've got
[6231.84] the the shape of the ellipse. You've got
[6234.08] the velocity and now you can you can run
[6236.719] it forward or you can run it backward.
[6239.199] You'll know where this thing has been.
[6241.52] And a lot of these studies of like say
[6244.159] the torid meteor stream. I'll I'll use
[6246.239] that for an
[6247.32] example. There are two streams the the
[6249.6] the the of the torids. There's the the
[6253.4] the daytime torids and then there's
[6256.56] nighttime torids. And they're slightly
[6259.679] different orbits, just slightly
[6261.88] different. So undoubtedly what happened
[6265.119] is that sometime in the past a single
[6267.48] piece broke into two pieces and then
[6270.56] subsequent to that those two pieces also
[6273.28] disintegrated further and basically
[6277.04] produced two meteor streams. And within
[6280.239] those meteor streams we
[6282.44] have comet Anki and which was probably
[6287.04] well I won't say probably almost
[6288.679] certainly part of the original cometary
[6292.0] nucleus. There's also couple of
[6294.0] asteroidalike bodies and another
[6296.8] cometary body called Jatoto. So it's
[6300.48] it's actually quite a populated family
[6304.719] of cosmic material. Right. Well, it was
[6308.56] was undoubtedly at one time all in a
[6312.76] single nucleus of a very large comet
[6316.719] that came into the old solar system
[6319.28] probably between 25 and 30,000 years
[6321.6] ago. How do we know that? Well, because
[6323.44] once we've established these orbital
[6325.6] parameters, like I said, we can now run
[6328.159] it forward or we can run it backwards.
[6331.04] The astronomer Fred Whipple was probably
[6333.6] the first one to do this back in the 40s
[6335.84] when he had I think 14 he had
[6338.4] photographs of 14 meteors within the
[6341.52] torid meteor stream and he was able to
[6344.159] calculate their orbits reverse them and
[6347.28] realize that they were all part of a
[6349.36] single object somewhere around 5,000
[6352.48] years ago. Okay? Because what happens,
[6355.76] you start reversing these meteors and
[6357.84] you follow them back and back and
[6360.08] they're going backwards through their
[6361.84] orbits and then they all converge on the
[6364.8] same point in space. Well, that's when
[6367.28] you know that they were part of a single
[6368.88] object that then broke apart. Right now
[6371.679] you can also run it forward and that's
[6373.36] what that's what astronomers did and
[6375.36] they were able to predict that it was
[6377.52] going to this material was going to come
[6379.119] in make its perihelion or close passage
[6382.0] by the sun go back out to the orbit of
[6385.239] Jupiter right and cross the orbit of
[6388.92] Jupiter. What they then realized was
[6391.679] that when that stream was crossing the
[6393.84] orbit of Jupiter, guess what? Jupiter
[6396.88] was at that point in its orbit. So they
[6399.76] knew it was going to
[6401.48] be a series of impacts and they were
[6404.48] able to predict right down to the day
[6407.36] when those first impacts were going to
[6409.28] hit. Here is
[6411.32] a artist's rendering of what it would
[6415.76] have looked like if we could have seen
[6417.28] it from a vantage point near Jupiter.
[6420.08] Three different perspectives. This is
[6421.92] what we actually saw.
[6424.48] the material came in and was striking
[6427.159] Jupiter just on the other just enough
[6431.04] around the sphere that we couldn't we
[6433.199] couldn't see directly the impacts. What
[6435.76] we did see though was the effects of the
[6437.92] impacts once Jupiter or rotated
[6441.08] around and here would be what it would
[6444.32] look like if we had been slightly
[6446.56] looking at it from a somewhat different
[6448.08] perspective. the 21 pieces would have
[6450.56] come in and fallen into the Jovian
[6452.32] atmosphere and created when they did
[6454.8] this they created these gigantic plumes
[6457.36] that were bigger than the Earth. And the
[6461.04] interesting thing, the takeaway here is
[6463.28] that what astronomers realized was that
[6467.76] any one of these objects, you take any
[6471.28] one of these 21 objects, they were all
[6473.6] big enough that were just one of these
[6476.08] objects to encounter the Earth. It would
[6479.28] be a major
[6481.8] catastrophe. What about 21 objects?
[6484.48] Well, that would be an extinction level
[6486.679] event. Now, nobody, no astronomers
[6490.08] believed or thought that we would
[6492.159] witness something like this until we
[6494.159] witnessed it. You know, that was
[6496.4] something that you would call an an
[6498.08] extinction level event if it occurred on
[6500.239] Earth. Now, I I think that in a way the
[6503.76] cosmos was kind of giving us a a a
[6506.239] lesson here
[6508.28] in the potential of our existence within
[6513.36] the universe, right?
[6516.639] It's most likely that multiple impact
[6519.52] events, and this is one of the the
[6521.84] insights gained from this event here, is
[6524.8] that multiple impact events are a whole
[6527.119] lot more common than had been imagined
[6529.76] prior to Shoemaker Levy 9. Prior to
[6532.639] Shoemaker Lev9, most researchers and
[6535.36] astronomers and geologists, people who
[6537.84] are looking at in any way the impact
[6539.6] phenomena are generally thinking in
[6541.199] terms of like one single impact of one
[6544.08] single object. Well, Shoemaker Levy 9
[6547.6] has demanded that we rethink our the
[6551.04] phenomena of of impacts, right? Because
[6554.08] now we have 21 impacts in a week. What
[6558.08] does that mean? What would that mean in
[6559.679] terms of Earth? Well, obviously
[6562.239] something like this would be, like I
[6564.96] said, it would be more than enough to
[6567.84] terminate civilization. It would be an
[6569.84] extinction level
[6573.159] event. And now that we're going back and
[6575.92] taking a closer look at some of the
[6578.639] cratering effects on other bodies, I
[6581.92] believe this is on the
[6584.04] moon. You can actually count here. 1 2 3
[6587.119] 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11. Looks like this was
[6591.199] about 12 pieces and the
[6594.92] fragmentation would have occurred very
[6598.159] close to the impact, the moment of
[6600.8] impact. Why? Well, because the
[6603.48] longer that these pieces are in orbit
[6606.639] before they disintegrate into dust or
[6610.4] separate further, the further apart
[6612.88] they're going to be. Well, you can see
[6614.8] these objects are really close together.
[6618.88] You can see these are a little bit
[6620.719] further apart, right? So, you can kind
[6623.36] of survive from that. You can see here
[6625.52] like this one here, you've got almost
[6626.96] two distinct completely distinct
[6629.52] craters. If we look at the back here,
[6631.28] you can see that they're all pretty much
[6633.52] overlapping. So from this you can you
[6635.84] can determine that you know this
[6638.6] fragmentation that produced this chain
[6641.36] called kina they're called kina crater
[6644.32] chains probably had a little bit more
[6647.4] time between fragmentation and
[6651.0] impact here's another one and here you
[6653.28] can very clearly distinctly count the
[6656.4] number of impacts and pieces
[6658.84] so this could have been again I don't
[6661.76] know could have been an asteroid that
[6664.56] broke up because asteroids do break up.
[6666.4] They certainly
[6667.719] do. A lot of asteroids have suffered
[6671.44] extremely catastrophic lives smashing
[6675.04] into other asteroids. So they can become
[6677.679] fractured, they can become cracked. So
[6680.08] as long
[6681.32] as you know they don't run into anything
[6684.0] else like a this running into a planet
[6686.639] or a strong gravity field, the the
[6689.679] object may hang together. But then when
[6692.32] it comes into makes a close approach by
[6695.28] a planet falls into a gravity field,
[6698.48] those that that conglomeration of
[6702.159] material can then separate and and form
[6704.88] separate bodies, separate
[6708.28] objects. And here's another one. So
[6711.36] they're relatively common. Now, we
[6714.4] talked a lot about Tangusa. Spent I
[6717.04] mean, I think I we did two episodes in
[6720.639] this Apocalypse Unsealed
[6723.0] series diving into Tungusa because
[6726.4] Tangusa had so much to teach us about
[6730.08] the cosmic ecosystem of which our world
[6732.48] is a part and which we ultimately must
[6735.76] pay attention to if we think in terms of
[6738.4] long-term survival of
[6740.04] civilization. We're going to have to
[6741.76] deal with that, right? Because what we
[6743.679] now know is that impacts that can have
[6746.719] global consequences occur a whole lot
[6749.36] more frequently than we thought a
[6752.08] generation or two ago. In fact, major
[6754.8] impacts may occur every 1 to 2,000 years
[6757.92] that could dramatically affect the
[6760.8] stability of civilization.
[6763.96] Again, Tenuska has shown us that one
[6767.119] object carried the force of a 15 megat
[6770.88] ton hydrogen bomb. Now, what if we have
[6774.88] multiple tunguskas? Now, if we're
[6777.52] looking at this surface of the moon,
[6779.76] well, there's going to be a difference
[6781.36] there. A fryable object like a cometary
[6784.8] nucleus which is breaking up doesn't
[6787.52] have to go through an atmosphere. So it
[6789.599] it's going to be much more likely to
[6792.08] strike the surface of the moon or say
[6794.639] Mercury where or one of some of the
[6797.04] other moons say of Jupiter or Saturn
[6799.599] which have also show crater chains on
[6802.88] them. So whereas an object like Tangusa,
[6807.599] well remember important point, didn't
[6809.84] make it to the ground, did not hit the
[6812.32] surface of the ground. It blew up in the
[6814.159] atmosphere, right? So a Tangusa event
[6817.76] doesn't leave a crater. So this is
[6820.48] important. So how many what is the
[6823.44] ratio? Here's the question. And what is
[6825.44] the ratio of impacting objects that
[6829.52] leave a crater that can later be
[6831.36] counted? And the number of impacting
[6833.52] objects that merely that strike the
[6835.76] atmosphere do not make it to the ground
[6837.52] and therefore they do not really leave a
[6840.0] major geological imprint that can be
[6843.119] cataloged later on. And as it turns out,
[6846.599] interestingly, it's almost certain that
[6850.48] Tangusa type objects are going to be way
[6853.679] more common than the higher density
[6857.0] objects that can actually penetrate
[6859.76] fully through the atmosphere and strike
[6861.84] grounds, leaving a hole in the ground,
[6863.28] the crater. And and here we use the
[6865.44] comparison of of Tangusa to Meteor
[6867.599] Crater in Arizona. Now, Meteor Crater in
[6870.4] Arizona is an iron object about the same
[6873.84] size as the tenus object. What's the
[6877.04] difference? Well, an iron object is a
[6879.04] whole lot denser. It's going to
[6880.88] penetrate fully through the atmosphere
[6882.4] and strike the ground. Whereas the
[6884.159] tongus object doesn't penetrate the
[6887.88] atmosphere, blows up five, six miles up
[6892.08] in the atmosphere, blows down hundreds
[6894.96] of millions of
[6896.84] trees, but well, say a 100red million
[6900.0] trees, but it does not leave a crater.
[6903.52] Okay?
[6904.52] So here's the question then. What is the
[6907.679] ratio of impacts of denser objects like
[6910.96] say a carbonatous condritic meteor which
[6914.56] is going to be much more prone to
[6916.32] striking the ground. And here's a here's
[6917.76] a good continuum to think of. Comets on
[6920.88] the low end of density scale like a
[6923.239] snowball. On the high end of the density
[6925.76] scale cast iron that's an iron object.
[6929.28] Right in the middle somewhere is the
[6930.639] stony asteroids which is about about
[6934.0] roughly like I said about in the middle.
[6937.36] Okay. So, you've
[6938.679] got this continuum and on
[6942.92] the on the low density end of the
[6945.599] continuum, you're not having impacts
[6948.4] into the ground unless of course they're
[6950.239] quite large. Now, an object the size of
[6953.119] the tungusa is going to be something
[6955.92] along the lines of maybe a quarter of a
[6958.48] mile before it actually strikes the
[6960.8] ground. Right? So, what's the ratio of
[6966.08] dense objects that strike the ground
[6967.84] compared to low density objects that
[6969.92] blow up in the atmosphere and don't
[6971.44] leave a big crater in the ground? And it
[6974.56] looks like it could be like 10 to one.
[6976.96] So, in other words, for every crater
[6978.56] there might
[6979.639] be crater such as you would see in
[6982.52] Arizona meteor crater, we might have 10
[6985.84] to Tangusa
[6987.56] type. Now, this is important, right?
[6990.8] Because again, if we're only counting
[6992.599] craters, we're probably
[6995.32] underestimating the number of encounters
[6998.719] between Earth and cosmic objects by a
[7001.04] factor of by an factor of
[7004.199] 10. All
[7006.44] right. And here we see this is in some
[7009.119] interesting photographs here. Here we
[7011.159] see
[7012.76] Kwashman Wahman in the early stages of
[7016.119] disintegration right here. So we we've
[7018.96] actually witnessed multiple times now
[7021.199] that comets do
[7023.4] disintegrate. And here you can see the
[7026.0] closeup of the debris tail. You can see
[7028.0] this is there's larger stuff here that's
[7030.719] probably could be anywhere from, you
[7033.28] know, half a kilometer and up in size.
[7037.119] Smaller stuff could be, you know,
[7038.8] hundreds of Tunguska objects. And then
[7041.119] within that there'll be, you know, lots
[7042.8] and lots of, you know, really small
[7045.36] stuff that will eventually become part
[7047.92] of
[7048.84] the of a meteor stream. Okay, just
[7052.8] another one where you can see look at
[7054.96] look at the separation that is occurring
[7056.8] here. So you've got the major nucleus
[7059.36] here and then you've got like a
[7061.52] secondary nucleus here. They've
[7063.36] separated and then look at here. Look at
[7065.44] the little offspring coming off of the
[7067.52] second one. See?
[7070.639] And this is what comets do. And if they
[7073.52] don't get swallowed up by the sun, which
[7076.239] is if they if they don't disintegrate
[7078.88] and turn into a meteor
[7081.32] stream, it's likely that they're going
[7083.44] to fall into the sun. And that's where a
[7085.679] lot of them end up and then potentially
[7089.119] like we saw with Shoemaker Levy 9
[7091.52] falling into Jupiter and or Earth or any
[7095.52] of the other planets. Okay. And then the
[7098.0] comet linear. Look at this down here.
[7100.0] You can see
[7101.159] the the debris swarm here. Now, I want
[7105.44] you to think about this. The difference
[7108.239] we're talking about
[7110.36] between an encounter with a single
[7113.48] object and what would be how different
[7116.639] it would be to encounter a recently a
[7119.599] swarm of recently disintegrated
[7121.76] commentary material. It would be two
[7124.4] very different things. And and you can
[7126.8] see that from the standpoint of
[7128.8] encountering a cluster of or a swarm I
[7132.4] like to use the term swarm of
[7134.84] debris. It could be very different. We
[7138.4] do computer modeling to let's say model
[7142.0] say a meteor the size of 150 ft in
[7145.04] diameter roughly the size of the iron
[7147.28] asteroid that struck Arizona. Right? Now
[7150.56] we can model that. We can we can model
[7152.48] we in coefficients for its density, for
[7156.159] its velocity, for its angle of approach.
[7158.56] We can then calculate how much energy is
[7160.8] released during that particular impact,
[7163.92] right? And then we can we can then
[7166.88] conjecture about the consequences. We
[7169.04] can say, okay, it's going to release a
[7170.48] fireball. There's going to be x amount
[7172.8] of of material volume of material
[7176.08] injected into the atmosphere. There's
[7178.32] going to be fallback material, what we
[7180.159] call fallback brecha is going to come
[7182.32] back to the earth, perhaps start
[7184.96] secondary
[7186.599] fires. What happens though if it's a 100
[7191.4] impacts or
[7193.239] more? Do you see how suddenly it gets so
[7196.08] complicated that what happens if we have
[7199.76] meteors falling into a forested area
[7202.639] where there can be huge forest fires
[7205.52] generated as let's say falling into an
[7208.32] arid area like a desert where there's
[7210.56] not the forests
[7212.52] right we know from Tungusa that about
[7216.56] 200 square miles of the of the impact
[7220.239] zone was incinerated right we know about
[7223.199] 820 20
[7225.4] miles were affected by the the blast
[7228.239] wave and knocked
[7229.719] down something like 800 800 Yeah. 800
[7234.08] and some square miles of old growth
[7236.159] tiger forest was utterly flat. Right.
[7239.76] What happens over the
[7241.88] oceans? What happens over if
[7245.159] they're in an Arctic zone? What would
[7248.4] happen? And this is a question that's
[7249.84] intrigued me for a long time. What would
[7251.44] happen over an ice sheet? Let's say you
[7254.08] had a encounter during the depths of an
[7257.84] ice age when large swaths of the earth's
[7260.48] surface are covered in ice, right? Well,
[7263.679] you can see right here if if the Earth
[7265.36] encounters a swarm like this, that like
[7267.84] we're seeing in this image right here,
[7269.199] this swarm could be actually many times
[7271.599] the the the size of the Earth itself.
[7274.88] Now if the earth is passing through
[7276.4] this, we might be looking at periods
[7278.639] where you have clustered
[7280.44] bombardment. And given the scale of this
[7285.08] swarm, it could be affecting dep and
[7288.0] depending how quickly the earth cross
[7290.239] through the stream, it could have
[7292.8] enormous consequences that would be very
[7295.36] very difficult to model. Right? I think
[7298.639] this might be one of the things that
[7299.92] we're going to have to be thinking
[7301.599] about.
[7303.639] And when we start looking at the ancient
[7306.32] traditions, which we're about to do in a
[7308.159] minute, I think you'll see that there is
[7310.719] some amazing correlations between some
[7313.92] of the visions and prophecies and and
[7317.599] accounts that have come down to us
[7320.159] through these various venues actually in
[7322.639] a religious context, which which we have
[7326.4] to assume could certainly be plausible.
[7330.44] that
[7332.199] experiences and people witnessing these
[7335.119] things and surviving encounters like
[7337.88] this. Think about what happened with the
[7340.639] single event of Tangusa. It spawned a
[7342.56] new religion, didn't it? Remember we
[7344.48] talked about that
[7345.88] agi, the fire god that descended to the
[7348.639] earth and according to the Tangusi
[7351.119] tribal beliefs. Now that
[7354.44] event triggered the emergence of a new
[7357.76] religion and Agdi the fire god was
[7360.159] punishing them for their transgressions
[7362.4] and so on. Right? So if one single
[7365.92] object an event like a tangusa object
[7369.04] could spawn a religion a religious
[7372.52] response what about 10 or
[7376.599] 100? Should we assume
[7379.239] otherwise that it wouldn't? Okay, we're
[7383.04] not going to get into this now. We're
[7384.4] going to talk about this later, probably
[7385.92] in the next episode, the five stages in
[7388.159] the life cycle of a comet. But very
[7390.239] briefly, aggregation is the hibernation,
[7394.0] activation, disintegration, and
[7396.599] amalgamation. Okay,
[7399.239] so let's go on here and I'm going to
[7402.4] just zip on
[7403.88] through Tungusa. We talked about this.
[7406.32] I'm not going to, you know, re reiterate
[7409.199] all of this. Just maybe a quick
[7411.239] refresher. We went through this material
[7413.599] already. So, please go back and review
[7417.56] this in order to get that maximum depth
[7421.199] of
[7422.28] understanding. I don't think we went
[7424.159] through all of the accounts, but we did
[7426.0] enough that I think you got the gist of
[7428.0] it. The kinds of
[7429.4] things the underlined parts here what
[7432.0] we're going to focus on here was too
[7433.84] bright for the naked eye. and it had a
[7436.639] bluish white light. Now, that's
[7438.32] interesting in in terms of what we just
[7440.08] saw with a lot of commentary nuclei. The
[7443.04] tails are bluish. There's a reason for
[7444.92] that. It moved vertically downwards for
[7447.599] about 10 minutes. The body was in the
[7449.199] form of a pipe, cylindrical. Now, I
[7452.719] remember my grandfather who was a boy in
[7456.0] Sweden used to tell a story to me and my
[7458.08] brothers when we were little about
[7459.92] something that he saw. And I remember I
[7463.119] really it made kind of an impression on
[7464.88] me when he would tell that story and I
[7466.4] would puzzle over it. He said it was at
[7467.84] night he was out walking next to a lake
[7470.639] and a big like blazing pipe. He saw it
[7474.88] in the sky and it fell down into the
[7476.92] lake. And I had no idea at that time
[7480.48] what in the hell he was even to what you
[7482.639] saw looked like a blazing pipe. I had no
[7485.92] concept of what he was even talking
[7487.52] about. But of course later on now I
[7489.84] figure he probably saw a a
[7493.56] major encounter of a bow line. Now it
[7497.52] may or may not have actually fallen in
[7499.28] the lake that he was next to. I don't
[7501.76] remember enough details from his
[7504.84] story. But one of the common phenomena
[7507.84] that people seeing witnessing fireballs,
[7511.44] major
[7512.599] fireballs, is they give the illusion of
[7515.44] being much much closer than they
[7517.199] actually are. In fact, I got some
[7519.36] stories here, you know, people like
[7520.639] there was a oh a cowboy who saw one one
[7525.119] night. He was out on his horse and when
[7527.599] when it and of course it came over it
[7529.679] was many miles over his head but he
[7531.52] literally thought it was about to hit
[7532.88] him and he ducked down in the saddle on
[7535.679] his
[7536.599] horse. So we'll just go through
[7540.04] here. All the inhabitants of the village
[7543.119] ran out. This was probably
[7545.96] Vanavara. The old women wept. Everyone
[7548.639] thought the end of the world was
[7550.08] approaching. This is something that we
[7552.639] find over and over again in these cosmic
[7554.88] events. People thinking that it's the
[7557.199] end of the world. So right there you can
[7560.32] see end of the world. Well, what does
[7561.84] that do? Well, it obviously invokes the
[7564.4] the the the picture of apocalypse and
[7567.92] what
[7569.88] happens and the traditions of the end of
[7572.4] the world. Let's go on here. This I may
[7575.76] not have mentioned, but this is an
[7578.4] interesting point. The flight and fall
[7580.4] of the meteorite on the 30th of June
[7582.76] 1908 amongst the greatest meteoric
[7585.199] phenomena known to mankind must occupy
[7588.4] one of the foremost places because of
[7590.079] the magnitude of the phenomena
[7591.52] accompanying its movement through the
[7593.079] atmosphere. It is unlikely. Now this is
[7595.92] written in 34. It is unlikely that our
[7598.48] generation may again be witnesses of a
[7600.96] similar meteoric phenomena. However, as
[7604.079] it says here, if it had occurred 4 hours
[7606.159] and 47 minutes later when the city of
[7609.36] Len Lenrad would have lain on the same
[7612.239] parallel near the center of the
[7614.44] explosion, our knowledge of it would
[7617.44] probably have been considerably more
[7619.4] extensive and also the implications for
[7622.32] history would have been very different.
[7624.56] If a major city of the world had been
[7628.28] annihilated back in
[7632.04] 1908 might have changed the perspective.
[7634.48] Who knows? Maybe World War I would never
[7636.719] would have happened. I would like to
[7638.719] mention that one of our original
[7640.48] sponsors at Cosmographia, CBD from the
[7643.76] Gods, is following us here to our new
[7646.239] podcast, Squaring the Circle. As many of
[7649.28] you know, I've been using their products
[7651.04] for going on four years now. And having
[7654.0] tried a number of CBD brands, CBD from
[7657.28] the gods seems the most effective for my
[7659.84] needs, which is primarily as a sleep aid
[7662.8] and as a remedy for inflammation and
[7665.28] associated pain. I use both the oil and
[7669.119] the sav. My wife also likes their
[7671.92] products, especially the sav, which
[7673.76] alleviates the pain in her hands, which
[7676.32] is the result of working for years as an
[7678.4] electrician. If you've been thinking
[7680.48] about trying a CBD product and
[7682.48] experiencing the benefits for yourself,
[7685.199] give CBD from the gods a try. To learn
[7688.639] more and see their product line, check
[7691.36] out CBD
[7694.119] fromthegods.com. Any purchase of their
[7696.159] products helps our efforts here at
[7698.079] Squaring the Circle to realize our goal
[7701.119] of making this world a better place.
[7704.0] Thanks. So this was from a an account in
[7706.88] a newspaper that came out on July
[7710.76] 13th published right there in Siberia
[7714.8] and describes an extraordinary
[7717.119] atmospheric phenomena. A noise as a
[7720.96] strong wind. Right? This is this is very
[7724.8] interesting metaphor here. The noise as
[7727.599] a strong wind. Of course, it's more than
[7729.36] a metaphor because they heard this
[7731.639] sound, and it was followed immediately
[7734.079] by a fearful crash accompanied by a
[7736.679] subterranean shock which caused
[7739.119] buildings to
[7740.36] tremble. One had the impression that
[7743.52] some huge beam or heavy stone had
[7747.36] possibly struck the building. This was
[7750.32] followed by two for further equally
[7753.36] forceful blows.
[7756.04] So then there was followed by between 50
[7758.88] and 60 bangs becoming gradually fainter.
[7762.56] During all this time the ground is
[7764.199] trembling.
[7767.159] Okay. And then as eyewitnesses relate
[7770.8] the before the first bangs were heard a
[7773.84] heavenly body of fiery appearance cut
[7776.639] across the sky from south to north
[7779.52] inclined to the northeast. Inclined.
[7783.96] Okay, an incline. This is
[7787.079] important. Neither its size nor shape
[7789.36] could be made out owing to its speed and
[7791.36] particularly its
[7792.92] unexpectedness. And part of that again
[7794.88] as we talked about that unexpectedness
[7796.88] is it was becoming it was coming from
[7800.159] the direction of the sun. Now this is
[7802.48] important in trying to get a sense of
[7805.52] the identity of this cosmic visitor
[7808.48] because it was coming from the direction
[7811.52] of space precisely where one would
[7814.32] expect a member of the torid meteor
[7816.4] family of objects to be coming from. It
[7819.599] also came during precisely the time of
[7822.56] year when the earth is crossing the
[7825.92] torid meteor stream. So those two
[7828.32] factors together make a strong
[7830.48] circumstantial case that the Tungusa
[7833.599] cosmic object was a part of the Torid
[7839.159] families. So here this is another
[7842.44] interesting metaphor here the way it's
[7844.719] described. Many people in different
[7847.199] villages distinctly saw that when the
[7850.56] flying object touched the horizon, a
[7853.679] huge flame shot up that cut the sky in
[7857.719] two. Okay, I want you to be trying to
[7860.48] visualize this as we're going through
[7862.719] this. And we've already gone through
[7864.0] this, so I'm not I'm going to skip a lot
[7866.0] of it.
[7868.88] So the glow was so strong that it was
[7872.32] reflected in rooms whose windows faced
[7875.199] the south, I'm sorry, face the north
[7877.92] because these villages are to the south
[7879.84] of the sight of the explosion.
[7882.96] Apparently the glow continued for at
[7885.28] least a minute since many peasants in
[7888.0] the field noticed it as
[7890.679] well. Bangs were heard as soon as the
[7894.0] tongue of flame disappeared. So you can
[7896.8] see that the visual impression precedes
[7899.199] the audio impression because the
[7901.599] soundwave has taken if we're van here I
[7905.28] think we're 20 to 30 mi probably this
[7908.32] this encounters 20 to 30 mi away the
[7912.119] blast the area of the blast on the
[7915.92] island opposite the village horses began
[7918.96] to we cows to low and run wildly
[7923.32] about one had the impression
[7926.32] that the earth was just about to gape
[7929.119] open and everything would be swallowed
[7932.0] up in the
[7933.48] abyss. Again, important descriptive
[7936.4] metaphor. Okay. Fearful bangs resounded
[7940.0] from somewhere, shaking the earth, and
[7943.199] the invisibility of the source inspired
[7946.159] a kind of superstitious terror. People
[7951.28] were literally dumbfounded.
[7954.32] And then from another newspaper
[7957.4] account, a mighty noise was heard
[7960.56] resolving into thunder cracks. Although
[7963.44] the sky was cloudless at the time, the
[7966.32] noise caused houses to shake. Many
[7969.679] inhabitants saw a fiery body like a
[7972.639] beam. So here we get this this analogy
[7975.44] of a beam once again. It shot from south
[7978.4] to northwest above the ground before
[7980.239] they heard the thunder. Immediately
[7983.04] afterwards, the bang was heard and in
[7985.44] the place where the fiery body had
[7987.719] disappeared, a ton of fire appeared and
[7991.679] this was followed by
[7996.199] smoke. And then Vaseli Ashen Achen, he
[8001.119] was one of the Aeni people who gave his
[8004.0] testimony to Krinov who was one of the
[8007.92] scientists that went and collected a lot
[8010.0] of the eyewitness accounts.
[8012.96] So he was sleeping in his tent when
[8015.04] suddenly his tent was just torn away and
[8017.84] he was thrown
[8019.88] aside. Then the ground shook. There was
[8023.119] incredibly loud prolonged roaring and
[8026.159] then everything roundabout was shrouded
[8028.4] in smoke and fog. The burning trees
[8032.719] eventually the roar died away. The wind
[8035.28] dropped but then the forest went on
[8037.84] burning.
[8042.88] So other
[8045.8] accounts the children of Evan Podigga
[8050.48] camped on the river
[8054.76] Aarita. So they were awakened by a loud
[8057.36] rumble. Explosions were heard
[8060.04] everywhere. The earth trembled and there
[8062.56] was a loud cracking noise. What was this
[8065.599] cracking noise? Well, it was probably
[8067.76] plasma discharges is what my thought
[8070.199] was. But then was this was followed by
[8073.52] what they describe as a terrible storm
[8077.04] during which they could hardly keep on
[8079.04] their feet. And this terrible storm
[8081.679] flattened the forest near their tent and
[8085.199] far away towards the north there was a
[8087.28] kind of a cloud that rose
[8093.96] up and
[8096.199] then this was the testimony of Seov also
[8100.32] given to Krinov while he was collecting
[8103.119] eyewitness accounts in 1930.
[8106.719] So he was sitting on the porch of his
[8108.8] house in the village which was a trading
[8111.28] station of Vanavara and at breakfast
[8114.079] time and he was happened to be looking
[8115.84] toward the north and he was going to
[8118.8] hoop a
[8120.04] cask. So he says he raised his ax. I
[8122.88] guess he was going to open a cask of
[8125.639] something when suddenly in the north the
[8129.52] sky was split in two and high above the
[8133.52] forest the whole northern part of the
[8135.36] sky appeared to be covered completely
[8137.679] with fire. At that moment he says I felt
[8141.84] great heat as if my shirt had caught
[8144.639] fire. I wanted to pull off my shirt and
[8147.599] throw it away but at that moment there
[8149.28] was a loud bang in the sky. A mighty
[8152.719] crash was
[8154.119] heard. I was thrown to the ground about
[8157.92] three senses away, which would be about
[8160.239] 20 to 25 feet from the porch and for a
[8163.76] moment I lost consciousness. My wife ran
[8166.4] out and carried me into the hut. The
[8168.679] crash was followed by the a noise like
[8172.36] stones falling from the sky or guns
[8176.599] firing. The earth trembled. And when I
[8179.92] lay on the ground, I covered my head
[8182.48] because I was afraid that the stones
[8184.48] might hit it. At that at the moment when
[8188.0] the sky opened, a hot wind as from a
[8192.16] cannon blew past the huts from the
[8196.92] north. Then we have the the tale of
[8200.519] Marfa Bayanova.
[8203.519] She was
[8204.679] 19 when the meteorite fell and she was
[8207.519] at the trading station in
[8209.719] Vanavara. She had gone to a spring for
[8213.16] water and as she began to draw the water
[8217.359] she was standing
[8219.479] beside so her friend her friend was
[8222.08] Marfa and this was the testimony I'm
[8224.479] sorry this was the testimony of
[8226.0] Semanov's daughter Aselova. So she went
[8229.28] out to the draw water with her friend
[8231.0] Marfa. So Marfa began to draw the water
[8234.8] and Kosalova was standing beside her
[8237.92] facing north. Then she says, "Suddenly
[8241.439] before me, I saw the sky in the north
[8244.88] open to the ground and fire poured out.
[8249.04] We were terrified, but then the sky
[8251.84] closed again and immediately afterwards
[8254.96] pangs like loud gunshots were heard. We
[8258.16] thought that stones were falling from
[8260.24] the sky and rushed off in terror,
[8262.719] leaving our pale by the spring. I ran
[8266.16] with my head down and covered because I
[8268.319] was afraid that stones might fall on it.
[8271.519] When we reached the house, we saw my
[8273.359] father, Seov, lying unconscious near the
[8275.84] barn opposite the porch of the house.
[8279.12] Marfa and I carried him into the hut. We
[8282.0] were terribly frightened at the time.
[8284.639] The fire is brighter than the
[8288.12] sun. During the bangs, the earth and the
[8290.96] huts trembled greatly, and the noises at
[8294.08] first were very loud and seemed to be
[8295.92] right above our heads. Well, the
[8299.12] explosion, of course, is 25 mi away or
[8302.16] maybe even more. But yet, the impression
[8304.479] they had was that stones were falling.
[8306.88] They're ducking because they think these
[8308.399] stones are going to fall and hit them in
[8310.16] the head.
[8317.96] So this is from a letter that Kulich
[8320.639] received 1935 through
[8322.92] 1936 by a certain
[8325.479] nenco from the village of Keshma. And so
[8330.399] he's describing how it was in the
[8332.24] morning. The day was unusually clear.
[8334.639] Not a single cloud was to be seen. No
[8336.639] wind stirred and there was absolute
[8338.88] silence. Suddenly, far off, still hardly
[8343.399] audible, was heard the sound of thunder.
[8347.04] Made us look up unvoluntarily in every
[8349.559] direction. The sound seemed to become to
[8353.439] come from beyond the river Anara, and
[8356.639] then it became louder and louder
[8359.96] rapidly. There was something
[8362.16] extraordinary about it. The first fairly
[8365.359] faint crash resounded, but when I turned
[8367.599] quickly in the direction of the crash, I
[8369.84] saw that the sun's rays were crossed by
[8372.319] a broad, fiery white band on the right
[8376.08] side of its rays. On the left side
[8379.92] towards the north, an irregularly
[8382.479] shaped, brilliantly white, somewhat
[8385.76] elongated mass was flying into the Tyga
[8390.08] with a diameter far greater than the
[8394.439] moons. Approximately 2 to 3 seconds,
[8397.359] maybe more, after the first faint crash,
[8400.56] a second, louder crash of thunder
[8403.56] resounded, as loud as that generally
[8406.0] heard during a storm. After the second
[8408.96] crash, the ball was no longer visible,
[8411.6] but its tail, or rather the streamer,
[8414.96] was now completely on the left side of
[8417.439] the sun's rays. Then, after a shorter
[8421.04] interval of time than that between the
[8423.12] first and second crashes, the third
[8426.24] thunder crash occurred. This was so
[8429.479] loud, as though there were several
[8431.92] crashes all mingled together within it,
[8434.8] that the whole ground trembled. An echo
[8438.8] like a continuous deafening roar
[8442.0] resounded through the Tyga. Indeed, it
[8445.6] seemed through the whole Tyga of vast
[8451.88] Siberia. The Carpenters after the first
[8455.2] and second crashes had crossed
[8457.6] themselves in
[8459.319] stupifaction, and when the third crash
[8462.04] resounded, they fell backwards from the
[8464.64] building onto the chips of wood.
[8467.359] Some of them were so stunned and utterly
[8471.16] terrified that I had to calm them down
[8473.68] and reassure them. We all abandoned work
[8476.88] and went into the village. There whole
[8479.6] crowds of local inhabitants were
[8481.68] gathered in the streets in terror
[8484.8] talking about the
[8487.64] phenomena. And then from another account
[8491.359] we
[8492.439] see who was this was a one Cokerin who
[8496.0] was sailing down the river
[8497.96] Angara. In the north a pale bluish light
[8501.6] glowed and from the south a fiery body
[8504.88] that was considerably larger than the
[8507.68] sun left a broad bright streamer behind
[8511.68] as it flew across the sky. Then such a
[8515.76] canonade broke out that all the workmen
[8518.88] who were in the boat rushed to hide in
[8521.6] the cabin, forgetting all about the
[8523.84] danger that threatened from the rapids.
[8526.56] The first bangs were faint but became
[8528.56] progressively louder. The sound effect,
[8531.2] he estimated lasted 3 to 5 minutes. The
[8535.92] intensity of the sounds was so great
[8540.0] that the boatman were completely
[8542.319] demoralized.
[8545.12] Then we
[8547.0] have that a large group of local
[8549.96] inhabitants say they first noticed a
[8552.399] ball of fire in the north coming down
[8555.96] obliquely obliquely to the horizon from
[8558.8] east to west. When it approached the
[8561.52] ground it changed into important symbol
[8565.28] a pillar of fire. After its
[8568.08] disappearance a cloud of smoke was seen
[8570.8] rising upwards from the ground. A few
[8573.68] minutes later, a loud noise was heard
[8576.0] with separate deafening crashes like
[8579.359] peels of thunder. These crashes were
[8582.64] followed by eight loud bangs like
[8586.28] gunshots. The first bang was
[8588.8] exceptionally loud and accompanied by a
[8591.84] whistling
[8595.319] noise. So, I think you get the
[8599.0] impression. Here the Tongas people
[8601.439] wandering beyond the hamlet of Nijni
[8604.52] Karolinsk say that the thunder was
[8611.8] terrible. So many of these accounts now
[8615.439] the reason I'm going over this and
[8617.28] reiterating is because I want you to get
[8619.04] these impressions in your mind. I want
[8620.8] you to get these pictures which is which
[8623.12] is being described
[8626.04] here. Go a couple more. on the 17th of
[8629.52] June. Now, this is because it's the it's
[8631.359] an older calendar that was used, the
[8633.2] 17th of June. And the older calendar
[8635.52] corresponds to June 30th of the
[8637.439] Gregorian calendar. Okay? At 17 at 7:15
[8641.439] a.m. the northwest, a pillar of fire
[8645.72] appeared in the shape of a spear. Okay.
[8649.84] So, here's another emblem, another
[8652.64] symbol that we're going to learn is
[8655.52] frequently attributed to these kinds of
[8657.6] events. When people are struggling to
[8660.16] try to fit this these kinds of events
[8663.76] that are for the most part completely
[8665.68] outside the experience, the human
[8667.84] experience, they're looking for anything
[8669.84] they can to try to describe what they're
[8672.96] experiencing and what they're seeing.
[8674.8] Okay? So it becomes very valuable to
[8678.399] look at these these the imagery that
[8681.6] they invoke, the symbols that they
[8684.359] invoke because we can now use that to go
[8687.2] back look at more traditional and
[8689.68] ancient accounts and to see those
[8692.72] ancient accounts in a different light in
[8694.88] a different perspective. Okay. So a
[8698.16] pillar of fire appeared in the shape of
[8699.92] a spear.
[8701.96] So, we're going to go look a little bit
[8704.479] and I'll give you an idea of where we're
[8706.0] going this and and where we
[8708.12] will go to where where we're headed to
[8712.72] for the next episode.
[8716.24] So, I'm going to
[8717.64] read
[8719.24] a verse from the Armenian Apocalypse of
[8723.479] Daniel, which goes back
[8726.68] to around the into the first few
[8730.96] centuries BC. And as I'm reading some of
[8734.479] these, I want you to keep this imagery
[8736.72] of Tungusa in mind and what we've just
[8740.479] learned and what we've learned over the
[8742.16] last 10 episodes
[8744.76] of this apocalyptic
[8747.399] phenomena. So here's how it
[8749.8] reads. Then shall the sun be darkened
[8754.0] and the moon changed to blood.
[8757.439] The stars shall fall down like leaves,
[8761.76] and the heaven shall be rolled up like a
[8766.2] scroll, and all things shall be scorched
[8769.439] and parched by the
[8771.399] wind. Fiery angels shall come down from
[8775.56] heaven, and fire shall flare up
[8779.04] throughout the whole
[8781.72] world. Let's look at a verse from the
[8784.319] eth chapter of the book of Revelation.
[8787.76] And the angel took the sensor, you know,
[8790.0] a sensor is what the what the the the
[8793.04] high priest is the
[8796.359] burning
[8799.64] in the burning coals or the
[8805.319] burning incense. Thank you. The burning
[8808.28] incense.
[8810.04] And this is what the angel is taking.
[8812.56] This is again a me a metaphor here. The
[8815.2] angel took the sensor, filled it with
[8817.76] fire of the altar, and cast it into the
[8820.6] earth. And there followed
[8823.08] hail. Now, think about hail.
[8827.319] This, okay, hail and fire mingled with
[8831.52] blood. Now this correlation with blood
[8834.8] again is something we're going to come
[8836.56] back to because this is this this
[8840.0] association and correlation with blood
[8841.84] we find occurring many times and there's
[8845.359] a reason for that. So there followed
[8848.399] hail and fire mingled with blood and
[8850.24] they were cast upon the earth and the
[8852.479] third part of the trees was burnt up and
[8856.08] all green grass was burnt up.
[8860.0] Now, here's from Psalms
[8862.92] 18, 18th
[8865.64] chapter. Then the earth shook and
[8869.96] trembled. The foundations also of the
[8872.479] hills moved and were
[8875.0] shaken. There went up a smoke out of his
[8879.319] nostrils, and fire out of his mouth
[8883.64] devoured.
[8885.16] Coals were kindled by it. He bowed the
[8888.72] heavens also and came down and darkness
[8891.28] was under his feet. He made darkness his
[8894.479] secret place and the brightness that was
[8897.52] before him is thick clouds passed
[8901.72] hailstones and coals of fire.
[8906.8] Then from the second chapter of the book
[8909.28] of
[8910.2] Acts. And there suddenly and suddenly
[8913.04] there came a sound from heaven as of a
[8916.24] rushing mighty
[8918.2] wind. And it filled all the house where
[8920.56] they were sitting. And there appeared
[8923.12] unto them cloven tongues like as of
[8925.96] fire, and it sat upon each of them. And
[8930.24] when this noise was noised broad, the
[8935.6] multitude came together and were
[8939.8] confounded. Sounds a little familiar,
[8942.0] doesn't it?
[8943.92] Then from the first kings 19th chapter
[8947.76] and behold the Lord passed by and a
[8953.04] great and strong wind the mountains and
[8956.96] break in pieces the rocks before the
[8959.88] Lord and after the wind an earthquake
[8964.16] and after the earthquake of
[8966.2] fire. Hm. Interestingly, sequence a
[8970.08] great and strong
[8971.56] wind, an earthquake, and a fire. Hm.
[8976.24] Where have we seen this
[8980.04] sequence?
[8981.72] Again, second chapter of Acts. And it
[8985.2] shall come to pass in the last days,
[8988.0] saith God, I will pour out my spirit
[8992.24] upon all flesh, and I will shoe wonders
[8995.439] in heaven above, and signs in the earth
[8999.8] beneath, blood and fire, vapor of
[9004.52] smoke. The sun shall be turned into
[9008.439] darkness, and the moon into
[9013.0] blood. sixth chapter of
[9017.08] Revelation, the book of Revelation. And
[9020.399] when I beheld, and I beheld, when he had
[9023.92] opened the sixth seal, and lo, there was
[9027.92] a great earthquake, and the sun became
[9031.12] black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon
[9034.08] became as blood. And the stars of heaven
[9038.56] fell unto earth, even as a fig tree
[9042.16] casteth her untimely figs, when she is
[9045.6] shaken of a mighty wind.
[9048.319] and the heaven departed as a scroll when
[9052.479] it is rolled together and every mountain
[9055.92] and island were moved out of their
[9059.64] places. From the 76th chapter of
[9063.479] Psalms. The waters saw thee, oh God. The
[9067.12] waters saw thee. They were afraid. The
[9069.92] depths also were troubled. The clouds
[9073.68] poured out water. The skies sent out a
[9077.96] sound. Thine arrows went
[9082.12] abroad. The voice of thy thunder was in
[9085.52] the heaven. The lightnings lightened the
[9088.479] world. The earth trembled and shook. Now
[9093.12] we know that there can be plasma
[9096.479] phenomena associated with cosmic impacts
[9099.84] manifesting as lightning bolts.
[9103.28] So, I find all of this now very
[9105.12] interesting and I hope that you, the
[9107.68] listener here, finds this interesting in
[9109.359] the light of what we've
[9111.08] learned in these episodes.
[9114.359] So now I'm going to just quickly go
[9118.24] through I'm going to set up side by side
[9121.76] so that you can see a comparison of some
[9125.28] of the quotes from the eyewitnesses and
[9128.96] survivors of the Tangusa event and some
[9133.92] of
[9134.84] the accounts which I am suggesting are
[9138.88] actually eyewitness accounts that these
[9141.359] that these accounts that appear in
[9142.88] scripture and prophecy and so on are
[9145.319] actually
[9147.16] inspired by eyewitness accounts of
[9151.84] celestial phenomena. We'll go back.
[9154.0] Let's sideby-side comparison. Psalms 18
[9157.04] scriptural testimony. Then the earth
[9159.12] shook and trembled. The foundations also
[9162.08] of the hills moved and were
[9163.96] shaken. Now from Tangusa, the earth and
[9167.04] the huts trembled greatly.
[9170.24] The ground shook. An incredibly loud
[9172.88] prolonged roaring was heard. Everything
[9174.64] round about was shrouded smoke and fog.
[9177.68] So here, interestingly, even the same
[9180.399] words are used. Here's our scriptural
[9184.6] testimony. And the Lord also thundered
[9187.52] in the heavens, hailstones and colds of
[9190.76] fire. The voice of thy thunder was in
[9193.76] the heaven. The lightnings lightened the
[9195.6] world. The earth trembled and shook.
[9197.84] Then from Tungusa, suddenly far off was
[9201.12] heard the sound of thunder. There was
[9203.28] something extraordinary about it. The
[9205.92] intensity of the sounds was so great
[9207.68] that the boatman were completely
[9210.28] demoralized. This was so
[9213.08] loud as though there were several
[9215.439] crashes all mingled together within it
[9218.399] that the whole ground
[9220.28] trembled. The ground shook. An
[9223.12] incredibly loud prolonged roaring was
[9225.439] heard.
[9227.2] deafening crashes like peels of
[9229.88] thunder and the thunder was
[9233.319] terrible. So thunder was common both
[9239.16] the
[9240.92] whatever spawned these scriptural
[9244.12] accounts and the eyewitness of the
[9246.8] Tungusa
[9248.68] survivors. Scriptural testimony. The
[9251.52] Lord passed by and a great and strong
[9253.76] wind the mountains and suddenly there
[9257.359] came a sound from heaven as of a rushing
[9261.68] mighty wind. The Tangusa testimony. Then
[9266.16] a noise like a strong wind was
[9270.439] heard. Our scriptural testimony. Thou
[9274.16] shalt be visited of the Lord of hosts
[9276.96] with thunder and with earthquake and a
[9279.6] great noise with storm and tempest and
[9283.68] the flame of devouring fire from the
[9286.64] prophet Isaiah. Now let's look at
[9289.04] Tangusa testimony for comparison. They
[9292.399] were awakened by a loud rumble.
[9294.319] Explosions were heard everywhere. The
[9296.24] earth trembled and there was a loud
[9298.24] cracking noise. A terrible storm during
[9301.76] which they could hardly heap on their
[9303.359] feet flattened the forest and then of
[9306.24] that of course is followed by a flame of
[9310.16] devouring
[9312.28] fire. Our scriptural testimony and there
[9315.84] appeared unto them cloven tongues like
[9318.479] as of fire. Now the word cloven which
[9321.68] shows in the Bible in the King James
[9323.88] version means literally to be split or
[9327.6] divided. Okay. So there appeared unto
[9330.64] them cloven tongues like as of fire. Now
[9334.0] our Tonguska testimony. A huge cloud of
[9337.12] black smoke was formed and a loud crash.
[9340.319] All the building shook and at the same
[9342.56] time a forked tongue of flame broke
[9345.6] through the
[9346.84] cloud. Next quote. A ball of fire in the
[9350.96] northwest coming down obliquely. It
[9353.6] approached the ground. had changed into
[9355.28] a pillar of fire. After its
[9357.92] disappearance, a cloud of smoke was seen
[9360.0] rising from the ground. Next quote,
[9362.479] "Suddenly in the north, the sky was
[9365.359] split in two, and high above the forest,
[9368.64] the whole northern part of the sky
[9370.16] appeared to be covered in fire. Many
[9373.2] inhabitants saw a fiery like a be body
[9375.76] like a beam shoot from south to
[9378.12] northwest before they heard the fi
[9380.64] thunder. And immediately after the bang
[9383.12] was heard, a tongue of fire appeared,
[9386.479] followed by smoke. Now notice described
[9390.399] as a tongue of fire. What do we have up
[9393.76] here? Cloven tongues like as of fire.
[9398.24] Our scriptural testimony from Acts 26
[9401.12] chapter. At midday, oh king, I saw in
[9403.84] the in the way a light from heaven above
[9406.88] the brightness of the sun shining round
[9409.92] about me and them which journeyed with
[9412.08] me. And then the basic English Bible
[9415.84] actually says on the road I saw a light
[9418.08] from heaven brighter than the sun.
[9421.6] Here's the Tungusa testimony. The
[9424.56] peasants saw a sh a body shining very
[9426.96] brightly, too bright for the naked
[9429.479] eye. Next quote. We were terribly
[9432.0] frightened at the time. The fire was
[9434.399] brighter than the
[9436.04] sun. A fiery body that was considerably
[9438.88] larger than the sun and an elongated
[9442.319] body narrowing towards one end and torn
[9445.2] as it were from the sun. Its head was as
[9449.359] bright as the sun.
[9454.08] From back to our scriptural testimony,
[9456.0] the sky was split apart like a scroll
[9459.76] when it is rolled up. That's from the re
[9462.72] book of revelations from the Syriak
[9465.52] apocalypse of Peter. We have and fire
[9468.479] shall eat into the earth from above. The
[9471.52] light of the sun and moon shall grow
[9473.439] dark. The scar stars be scattered and
[9476.8] fall down and the heaven rolled up like
[9480.24] a sheet of paper. From the Armanian
[9483.92] apocalypse of Daniel, the stars shall
[9486.56] fall down like leaves and heaven shall
[9489.52] be rolled up like a scroll. Now, let's
[9493.28] look at the Tungusa testimony. However,
[9496.319] many people in different villages
[9498.0] distinctly saw that when the flying
[9499.68] object touched the horizon, a huge flame
[9502.0] shot up that cut the sky in
[9505.56] two. Suddenly before me, I saw the sky
[9508.399] in the north open to the ground and fire
[9510.479] pour out. We were terrified, but the sky
[9514.399] closed
[9515.8] again. At the moment when the sky
[9518.08] opened, a hot wind as from a cannon blew
[9520.24] past the huts from the north. And the
[9522.479] final quote, when suddenly in the north
[9524.96] the sky was split in two. Now go back.
[9529.52] Look at here. The sky was split apart
[9533.12] like a
[9536.84] scroll scriptural
[9539.319] testimony. And the fifth angel, and this
[9542.479] is again from the book of Revelation,
[9544.16] and the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a
[9546.399] star fall from heaven unto the earth. I
[9549.12] think they're telling us here literally
[9551.96] people and to him was given the key of
[9554.8] the bottomless pit and he opened the
[9557.52] bottomless pit and there arose a smoke
[9560.319] out of the pit as the smoke of a great
[9563.16] furnace. He could actually be talking
[9565.52] there about a piece of
[9568.04] a object, a
[9570.92] meteorite actually striking the ground.
[9574.399] Then we have the Tungusa testimony. An
[9576.64] extraordinary underground roar like the
[9579.439] sound of a number of trains passing
[9582.2] simultaneously over rails and then one
[9585.28] had the impression that the earth was
[9586.88] just about to gape open and everything
[9588.479] would be swallowed up in the abyss. Now,
[9590.399] it's very interesting that people not
[9592.72] only experienced the atmospheric and the
[9594.8] celestial component of this, but they
[9597.12] also experienced the
[9599.64] subterranean component of this, which
[9602.319] was just as impressive to
[9607.56] them. From our scriptural testimony,
[9611.16] Acts 2 chapter, now when this was noised
[9614.319] abroad, the multitude came together and
[9617.2] were confounded.
[9619.439] Then from the Tangusa testimony, all the
[9621.52] inhabitants of the village ran out into
[9623.359] the street in panic. The old women wept.
[9627.04] Everyone thought that the end of the
[9629.2] world was approaching and whole crowds
[9632.24] of local inhabitants were gathered in
[9634.08] the streets in terror talking about the
[9637.399] phenomena. And finally they the
[9642.08] phenomena inspired a kind of
[9643.92] superstitious terror and people were
[9646.0] literally
[9648.04] dumbfounded. People were literally
[9650.359] dumbfounded and here the people came
[9652.8] together and were
[9656.04] confounded. Scriptural
[9658.12] testimony then shall fall the stars from
[9661.04] heaven. Moon shall be hid and no light
[9663.68] be in it. The light of the sun shall be
[9666.399] suppressed. This is from the pseudo
[9668.96] yohin apocalypse. Then we have from the
[9672.359] Ethiopia Ethiopic apocalypse of Peter.
[9675.92] And the sun shall suffer eclipse and the
[9678.56] moon become blood and the stars fall
[9681.12] from heaven through the greatness of
[9683.359] God's
[9684.6] wrath. And then the Syriak apocalypse of
[9688.12] Peter. Fire shall eat into the earth
[9690.72] from above. The light of the sun and
[9693.04] moon shall grow dark. the stars be
[9695.92] scattered and
[9698.52] fall. Now let's look at our scientific
[9701.2] testimony. By
[9702.76] contrast, this was from a paper
[9705.12] evolution of an impact generated dust
[9707.28] cloud and its effects on the
[9710.04] atmosphere which was published in the
[9712.64] Geological Society of America special
[9715.12] papers. We have simulated, quote, we
[9718.319] have simulated the evolution of an
[9720.64] optically thick dust cloud in the
[9722.8] Earth's atmosphere. Oops. And have also
[9726.0] calculated the effects such a dust cloud
[9728.88] would have both on the amount of visible
[9731.439] light reaching the surface of visible
[9735.68] light reaching the
[9737.16] surface. Okay. Then from the journal of
[9741.6] the theoretical and applied climatology,
[9744.0] we have this. This is the chronology of
[9746.0] dry fogs in Italy. The presence out of
[9749.52] season of unusual persistent fogs which
[9752.64] were preceded or followed by a weak sun,
[9756.0] a red sun or a red moon. Get this, the
[9760.399] sun and moon surrounded by bloody
[9763.72] halos. So this is something now that has
[9766.16] actually been
[9768.28] documented to have actually been
[9771.24] witnessed by peoples throughout history.
[9773.68] very similar
[9775.479] phenomena. And then we see the
[9777.359] scriptural testimony. And here it is. I
[9780.08] think it's right. It's I think it's just
[9782.56] telling us unequivocally what's going on
[9785.12] here. Then shall the sun be darkened and
[9787.52] the moon changed to blood. The stars
[9790.56] shall fall down like leaves. And this is
[9793.76] what we know in the aftermath of an
[9795.359] impact and the great fires and the dust
[9797.68] in the atmosphere is that the sun is
[9800.24] darkened and the moon can become very
[9805.0] red. Now, this ancient testimony here is
[9807.92] referring to historical records in the
[9810.479] period 536 AD, which I'm going to be
[9813.6] talking about when we get into
[9815.8] discussing the inner significance of the
[9819.359] Grail mythology.
[9821.84] But here we see from Proocopius, sun
[9824.399] gave forth its light without brightness.
[9826.96] Now he's describing what people are
[9829.399] witnessing 536 AD. The sun gave forth
[9833.279] its light without brightness like the
[9835.12] moon during the whole year and it seemed
[9837.52] exceedingly like the sun in
[9839.96] eclipse. And again the sun was dark and
[9842.56] its darkness lasted for 18 months. Each
[9846.319] day it shone for about 4 hours and still
[9848.72] this light was only a feeble shadow.
[9851.52] Now, here's the thing. In a series of
[9854.0] impact events, you're going to have the
[9855.359] injection of a large amount of soot,
[9857.92] dust, particulate matter into the
[9861.04] atmosphere that could take months, even
[9863.52] to a year or two to finally clear out.
[9866.96] During this time, yes, the sun can
[9869.84] become darkened. Literally, moon can
[9872.72] become his blood.
[9874.88] Then from the Armanian Apocalypse of
[9876.72] Daniel, scriptural testimony tells us
[9879.52] that fiery angels shall come down from
[9882.76] heaven and fire shall flare up
[9885.439] throughout the whole world. Well, here I
[9887.52] think we may have another another
[9889.04] symbol, another metaphor. Fiery angels
[9892.64] shall come down from heaven and fire
[9894.88] shall flare up throughout the whole
[9896.16] world. Now, here's what scientific
[9897.76] testimony says. Recent studies have
[9900.64] shown that a host of fairsized pieces
[9904.8] could have more devastating global
[9907.12] consequences than a single wintercausing
[9910.479] object by igniting many separate
[9914.279] conflrations that merge into a global
[9917.52] firestorm.
[9919.6] I would submit to you that to consider
[9922.08] that these are two different ways of
[9924.319] describing exactly the same
[9926.6] phenomena. Each using the symbology and
[9929.279] the terminology of its own discipline,
[9932.88] its own scientific understanding of the
[9936.08] world and and these events.
[9941.479] Finally, we have the angel took the
[9944.479] sensor and filled it with fire of the
[9946.319] altar and cast it into the earth. And
[9948.8] the third part of the trees was burnt up
[9950.96] and all the green grass. That's from 8th
[9953.92] chapter of
[9955.64] Revelation. And then we go down to the
[9957.92] scientific testimony and we discover now
[9960.479] that there is evidence for extraordinary
[9963.6] biomass burning. Here was a particular
[9965.84] episode and an impact winter triggered
[9968.56] by the younger dus cosmic impact 12,800
[9972.0] years
[9973.0] ago. And then the ice record is
[9976.399] consistent with the younger dest
[9978.0] boundary impact theory. Extensive impact
[9981.359] related biomass burning triggered the
[9983.6] abrupt onset of an impact winter. And
[9987.68] again the fiery angels coming down from
[9990.0] heaven and fire shall flare up
[9991.68] throughout the whole world. And then
[9993.439] from Peter Tyson comet busters article
[9996.56] appeared in technology review. Recent
[9999.279] studies have shown that a host of
[10000.8] fairsized pieces could have more
[10003.12] devastating global consequences than a
[10005.92] single winter-causing object by igniting
[10008.88] many separate
[10010.68] conflrations that merge into a global
[10013.439] firestorm.
[10015.52] Now, is this not basically saying the
[10018.0] same thing that the fiery angel coming
[10020.319] down from heaven, air shall flare up
[10022.479] throughout the whole world. And here we
[10024.56] have many separate pieces ignite,
[10027.76] emerging into a
[10030.6] conflration, many separate conflrations
[10033.2] that merge into a global firestorm.
[10036.64] And then as we get to the end here, an
[10039.68] important implication of this picture is
[10042.64] that smaller tungusike fragments of
[10046.04] comets will be concentrated in clusters
[10048.88] or swarms. This is from very important
[10052.24] book the origin of comets by Victor
[10055.439] Clube and Bill Napier came out in 1990.
[10059.92] Some contemporary fireball producing
[10062.24] meteorites. Meteoroids approach the
[10064.88] earth in streams. This is very
[10066.88] important. This is I was talking about
[10068.479] earlier idea that we might have
[10070.479] clustered bombardment and that we're
[10072.64] limiting constricting our thinking if we
[10074.72] confine it only to the single impact
[10077.12] event. So some contemporary fireball
[10079.6] producing meteorites approach the earth
[10081.52] in streams.
[10083.76] And then from the article in Hondrite
[10086.64] stream identification and confirmation
[10089.2] we read that clearly the existence of
[10092.399] streams of earth approaching meteoroids
[10095.6] also has implications for calculations
[10098.72] the likelihood of lifethreatening
[10100.88] impacts on our planet. Now we have from
[10103.76] the ancient testimony in the words of
[10106.279] Plato after the usual interval the
[10109.56] stream from heaven like a pestilence
[10113.2] comes pouring
[10115.16] down. Could that be the kind of stream
[10117.76] he's talking
[10120.68] about from the book of
[10123.0] Psalms? The waters saw thee, oh God. The
[10125.92] wa the waters saw thee. They were
[10128.8] afraid. The depths also were troubled.
[10131.52] The clouds poured out water. The sky
[10134.08] sent out sound. Thine arrows also went
[10136.92] abroad. The voice of thy thunder was in
[10139.439] the heaven. The lightnings lightened the
[10141.6] world. The earth trembled and shook. Now
[10143.68] look at here. The
[10145.24] waters were afraid. The depths also were
[10148.96] troubled. What does this suggest to you?
[10150.8] The depths of what waters? The clouds
[10154.0] poured out water. The sky sent out a
[10156.399] sound. arrows again another symbol for
[10162.16] the impacts. Okay, now let's consider
[10166.0] the waters saw the the depths were
[10167.96] troubled. I would submit the possibility
[10170.88] that we're references to an oceanic
[10173.359] bolide impact. The clouds poured out
[10176.399] water. Well, that's obviously going to
[10178.08] happen because you're going to have a
[10179.2] massive injection of water vapor into
[10181.84] the atmosphere and that's going to cause
[10183.439] your rain out.
[10187.76] And I think we're going to pause here
[10190.8] and we're going to pick it up in the
[10192.72] next episode with the the story of the
[10196.08] fall of fat which Plato in his dialogue
[10200.359] to references and obviously gives it a
[10204.24] great deal of importance and
[10205.64] significance because he references it as
[10208.72] a preface to his discussion of the story
[10213.04] of Atlantis. So we are going to end this
[10217.12] episode here in our series on the
[10220.56] apocalypse unsealed. We will soon be
[10223.76] back with another episode and we will
[10225.84] pick up the story line with the fall of
[10229.2] fat and we will look at the importance
[10231.76] of that particular myth to the ancient
[10235.439] Greeks and why Plato chose to preface
[10238.8] his story of Atlantis with a reference
[10242.319] to the myth of Fatan. Thank you. Hope
[10245.2] you enjoyed
[10246.52] this. I'll see you next episode.

Title: Did the Great Pyramid Encode Earth's Dimensions?
[0.08] Even in the way we still measure time
[2.8] today, if you think about how do we
[5.279] measure the length of one orbit, one
[9.2] rotation of the earth on its axis, the
[11.519] meridian lining up with the center of
[13.2] the sun, we've divided that into
[15.28] seconds, right? Minutes, hours. 24 hours
[19.039] is the exact period of the Earth's
[21.84] rotation with respect to the sun. 24
[24.76] hours time 60 * 60 means there's
[29.0] 86,400 seconds exactly in that period on
[33.76] the moment of vernal equinox the period
[37.52] of time of darkness and of light are
[39.52] exactly equal
[41.48] 43,200 that number is the scaling ratio
[44.48] of the pyramid if we were to take that
[46.48] the pyramid as it is today on the Giza
[48.96] plateau enlarge it by a factor of 43,200
[52.8] as Graeme The height of it is literally
[55.68] within a few hundred feet of being the
[58.32] polar radius of the Earth. And in fact,
[60.96] the range of error is within the range
[63.44] of error of our most accurate modern
[66.88] satellite surveys.

Title: Deeper Than the Grand Canyon
[0.08] When you look at um Egypt and Libya and
[2.56] Algeria, look at the Nile Valley. The
[4.88] Nile Valley is actually a canyon filled
[7.04] with sediment and the modern Nile River
[9.04] flows on top of that sediment. And it's
[11.44] such a long river and so low gradient
[13.599] that it's not really erosive. When it
[16.16] comes down at higher velocities from the
[18.88] Ethiopian highlands, it's charged with
[21.52] sediment, but then the river slows down
[23.84] because it's such a low gradient from
[25.76] say roughly from Azon up to Delta,
[28.72] right? So there's not much erosion going
[31.279] on there. And this is what the ancient
[33.04] Egyptians built their civilization
[34.8] around was the annual flood of the Nile
[37.36] River and its deposition of, you know, a
[40.239] new layer of top soil of fertile
[42.559] material that they would then plant
[44.079] their crops in. Right. However, in the
[46.32] Nile River, the valley flows right next
[48.16] to the Giza Plateau immediately to the
[50.559] east of the Giza Plateau. If you were to
[52.559] dig that sedimentary infill out, which
[55.28] is both material that was brought up
[57.44] from the south, the Ethiopian highlands
[60.0] in that area at the headarters of the
[61.76] White Nile and the Blue Nile, and
[64.159] backwash marine sediments that came from
[67.2] the Mediterranean. But if you were to
[69.439] clean out that thick infill package of
[73.6] sediment out of the canyon, it would be
[77.28] deeper than the Grand Canyon.

Title: The Meteor Stream That Changed Everything
[0.08] We are passing through the torid meteor
[2.0] stream right now and it probably is the
[3.84] most important meteor stream in terms of
[5.759] recent life on this planet. It's going
[7.52] to be a lot more energetic than now. I
[10.8] mean imagine your sea level rising at
[12.96] three or four times at least faster than
[16.24] we've seen rise in the last century. And
[18.32] within there juxtaposed are these
[20.32] episodes of very rapid sea level rise.
[23.119] So you're talking about a a very
[25.359] energetic intertidal zone. And I think
[27.76] that this is one of the things the
[29.599] archaeologists and the prehistorians
[31.92] people are looking at that have failed
[33.68] to take into account the severity of
[36.8] these events we're talking about. You
[38.48] don't realize the extent of the the
[41.36] total remodeling of this planetary
[43.92] surface that took place. If we're only
[46.079] looking for a mirror reflection of
[47.68] ourselves, we could overlook it
[49.36] completely because I think there's
[50.96] evidence that exists. Some modern
[53.199] researchers whose work has been buried
[55.44] or suppressed, I think we're getting
[57.92] very close to rediscovering some of the
[60.64] things that um our ancient ancestors
[63.44] were up to. And maybe this would be
[66.24] worth a whole show in itself.

Title: Did Ancient Sky Watchers Predict the Cataclysm?
[0.24] I think that the plausible scenario
[2.96] might be that you had survivors of two
[6.2] types. Those who survived by the luck of
[9.12] the draw and those who survived because
[12.08] they knew it going to happen. They
[13.759] planned for it. They prepared for it.
[15.599] You think they knew it was going to
[17.199] happen? I think we could make a strong
[19.119] argument that people there somebody did
[20.96] know. How so? How would they have known?
[23.32] Well, see, this is where we now get into
[26.84] why ancient peoples all over the world
[29.84] were such obsessive sky watchers. How
[32.84] did astronomers were able to predict
[36.96] this impact on Jupiter a year in
[38.879] advance? I think that we could make the
[41.36] argument that there was whatever you
[42.96] want to call them, a priesthood or
[44.399] whatever, whose job it was to monitor
[46.96] the skies for generation after
[49.32] generation. And typically one of the
[52.079] things that would happen is that
[54.44] impacts, you know, right now we could
[57.12] think of Earth, we could think of
[58.559] Jupiter, and there are streams of stuff
[61.84] traveling between the two, almost like
[63.92] cosmic pingpong or something. Now, every
[66.64] year on June 30th, two times right
[70.32] around late October, early November,
[72.799] late June, early July, Earth crosses
[77.119] this stream of cosmic debris that's
[79.6] called the torid meteor shower. Picture
[81.92] this. You've got this stream of debris
[84.479] coming in from Jupiter, coming around
[87.36] the sun, and going back out to Jupiter.
[90.0] The whole stream takes between three and
[92.4] four years to make an orbit around like
[95.119] this. Right? Now, here comes the Earth.
[98.56] It crosses the stream twice, right? Once
[102.159] in late October, early November. When it
[104.92] crosses at that time of year, it's
[107.96] crossing in such a way that if you were
[111.28] to look up the stream, you'd be looking
[113.439] out into space. You'd be, in fact, you'd
[116.399] be looking towards the constellation of
[118.24] Taurus. The things that modern
[120.84] astronomers used to count, the tools
[123.36] they use, the conceptual tools they use
[125.119] to make that prediction are all the
[127.36] things that you can identify by using
[129.84] the ancient standing stone circles.
[132.48] Interesting.

Title: The Hidden Lineage of Sacred Builders
[0.0] It's important to know the history. We
[1.76] can go back. We can go back to the
[3.12] Egyptians. We can go back to the
[4.96] Samrians, the Solomonic temple builders.
[7.6] There was a group called the Dian
[9.36] Artifificers that bridged the gap
[11.36] between the Solomonic temple builders of
[13.92] roughly a th000 BC. They were
[16.8] responsible for using the geometry and
[18.72] the astronomy to design and build all of
[21.439] the beautiful Greek temples. And then
[23.92] when Rome came to prominence, a lot of
[26.48] those secrets were passed on to a group
[28.72] called the Roman Collegium who designed
[31.199] temples and so on. Then with the
[33.6] collapse of the Roman Empire between 400
[36.559] and 500 AD, a lot of this knowledge got
[39.84] passed on to a group that uh took refuge
[43.04] on an island in the Lake Ko in Italy and
[47.28] they were called the Komaeen. And they
[49.52] preserved a lot of that knowledge until
[52.079] the Middle Ages. One of the things that
[53.68] was associated with the collapse of Rome
[55.68] was the onset of the dark ages between
[57.84] 536. The year 536 is considered to be
[61.199] the coldest year of the last entire
[63.6] 2,000 years. And it was followed by a
[66.08] decade of extreme cold weather and
[70.08] literal shrouded the planet was shrouded
[72.72] in darkness probably because of a
[75.439] combination of several cosmic impacts
[78.08] and several big volcanic eruptions.
[80.72] Well, what happened was you had 10 years
[82.96] of agricultural failures that led to
[85.84] famine. Famine led to people having
[87.68] weakened immune systems. Those weakened
[90.08] immune systems then allowed
[91.759] opportunistic disease and and you had a
[94.0] form of the bubanic plague. It usually
[95.84] cause the Justinian plague. That was
[98.24] followed by 300 years of basically very
[101.36] very hard times. And then when the
[103.6] climate began to warm again between 900
[105.92] and a,000 AD, population grew to the
[108.64] point where now you could actually
[110.799] viably undertake this tremendous,
[113.2] magnificent enterprise of building these
[115.36] great Gothic cathedrals.

Title: Where Was the Safest Place on Earth?
[0.32] Species loss is going to be directly
[2.159] related to habitat loss. The greater the
[5.12] loss of habitat, the greater it will
[7.2] affect species that are adapted to
[9.92] living in that
[11.08] habitat. So you can conclude from that
[13.679] that if 3/4 of the species of North and
[16.16] South America went extinct, that was
[18.72] where the greatest habitat loss
[20.4] occurred. So it was a was the the last
[23.76] global catastrophe was kind of focused
[25.92] on the Western Hemisphere.
[28.16] Eurasia was second, Africa was third. So
[32.32] what that tells you is the safest place
[34.0] to have been on earth during these
[36.719] events would have been Africa.

Title: From Imagination to Geometry
[0.0] If you had a polygon of a thousand sides
[2.159] and you were looking at it, it would
[3.52] look like a circle. And when you do
[5.2] that, you come up with some very
[6.96] interesting
[8.28] correspondences between the numbers of
[10.96] various words and phrases and names and
[13.84] numbers that are used to describe
[16.24] geometric relationships. I'm very
[18.64] interested in sacred geometry as a tool
[21.52] to be used by artists, architects,
[24.56] builders, graphic designers. The point I
[26.88] want to emphasize is that when you use
[29.119] this the unmarked straight edge and you
[31.84] use the compass, what you're doing is
[33.76] you're you you start the creative
[35.6] process is going to start up here. It's
[37.6] going to start with your imagination.
[39.04] You're going to conceive of an idea.
[41.2] Now, what you want to do is you want to
[42.879] project that out into the
[44.8] two-dimensional world. Just like if
[46.719] anybody's a builder, an architect,
[48.8] you'll know that in the old days they
[50.32] created blueprints. Now, they're not
[52.96] blue anymore really, but they're
[54.719] actually create the two-dimensional
[57.12] version, which is step one. From here,
[59.44] you go on to the two-dimensional. Or you
[61.52] want to create a hexagon, here's how you
[63.359] do it. You want to create a pentagon,
[65.119] here's how you do it. You want to create
[67.6] any particular shape. Those techniques
[69.92] that you learn your straightedge and
[71.84] compass transpose directly into the
[75.76] final manifestation of that idea in 3D
[79.68] base.

Title: 500 Miles of Mystery
[0.08] The boundary between British Columbia
[1.68] and Alberta forms the continental divide
[4.0] of the western North American continent.
[6.48] So you can see that this thing, the
[8.639] erratics train originates right there on
[11.44] the continental divide and then it
[13.36] follows this route down. It goes by
[15.28] Calgary right in here, loops to the east
[18.4] and then finally comes to an end in
[20.64] Montana. So what is it exactly? What is
[23.039] what is the Eratics train?
[26.32] Okay. Well, as you would guess from a
[29.039] train, something on the order of 500
[31.119] miles from its source there on the
[33.6] British Columbia, Alberta border where
[35.76] we saw to its final example there in
[38.719] Montana. There's hundreds of them, but
[40.719] these are examples here of and they're
[42.879] all of the same type of rock. It's a
[44.879] type of meta quartzite. It's a
[46.719] metamorphic rock similar to granite in a
[49.6] way. Meta quartzite. Question then, what
[52.16] are we looking at here? We're looking at
[53.84] string of these boulders. You can see
[56.079] that's a pretty big rock there. And you
[58.0] can trace these things in this line that
[60.48] we just saw on the map over 500 miles.
[63.44] And this is to me is it's very much like
[65.28] forensic geology. This rock didn't move
[68.88] itself here. So by what exact mechanism
[72.4] of transport can we attribute to the
[75.439] geographic disposition of these rocks?
[78.24] How do we do that?

Title: We’re Not Causing All the Change
[0.16] If you have a true and accurate and
[2.399] authentic understanding of the magnitude
[4.96] of these ancient changes, by contrast,
[7.839] you're going to see what's going on
[8.96] right now, and you're going to realize
[10.32] the current changes that we're seeing
[12.4] are
[13.4] insignificant within this larger context
[16.08] of catastrophic natural change that's
[18.8] been an intrinsic part of our planet's
[20.8] history and undoubtedly an intrinsic
[23.279] part of our own human history. But we
[25.279] don't want to go there. See, because
[27.519] there's this whole political momentum
[29.359] behind this other narrative that's put
[31.519] hundreds of billions of dollars behind
[34.64] the promotion of that narrative. Yeah.
[36.559] And it's very strange because it's it's
[38.48] very self-absorbed. It's like making
[41.36] everything humanentric. It's like, okay,
[43.92] well, the reason why all these things
[45.68] happen, which is kind of a a strange way
[49.52] of creating a disconnect between finding
[53.199] more and more fulfillment and finding
[54.64] more and more meaning beyond ourselves.
[57.52] There's a word for what you just said,
[59.719] anthropocentric. If they're developing
[61.96] models of reality that has no cognizance
[66.479] of any of the things that we've been
[68.32] talking about, how valid are those
[70.4] models? Looks

Title: Was the Sphinx Shaped by Water?
[0.16] It would be perfectly believable that
[3.04] there could be cavities, caves, some of
[6.08] them pretty large under the pyramids. At
[9.04] this point, I would not be willing to go
[11.36] any further than that. I think it's
[12.96] worth it to show the actual scan cuz
[15.759] most people who are talking about this
[18.16] have just seen like this 3D artistic
[21.359] depiction of what this scan could be. I
[24.4] look at that and I go, okay, what
[26.32] actually is this showing? There is
[29.199] examples of very large shaftlike caves.
[32.64] How that might be related to the
[34.559] controversy about the age of the Sphinx
[36.64] because clearly the controversy with the
[39.68] Sphinx was well does the Sphinx have
[42.48] evidence of major water erosion? Well,
[45.68] if it does then you have to go okay when
[48.16] was there enough water available to
[50.399] create that level of erosion? When I
[52.399] went there, what I saw was that they've
[54.719] been doing so many reconstruction
[56.719] campaigns, restoration campaigns on the
[59.039] Sphinx that it's hard to determine what
[61.28] was the original. They had not done any
[63.68] restoration campaigns in the recent
[65.76] centuries or even in older times, what
[68.56] would we be seeing? Because you look at
[70.4] it and a lot of what you're seeing is
[72.08] restored masonry. I think perhaps kind
[74.32] of misleading, but if you look at the
[76.799] walls of the ditch around it, nobody's
[80.32] tried to restore those that and to me
[83.52] that's now almost more valuable than the
[86.64] Sphinx itself. In every way, it it's
[89.2] consistent with water erosion. And
[91.04] that's my opinion on that. I think
[92.72] there's enough evidence to suggest that
[94.479] it was a surface flow, that it was an
[97.04] overwash, that it was a sheet wash
[99.04] moving over the thing. It was probably
[100.96] coming from the west because that goes
[102.88] up in elevation and that would be
[105.04] consistent with the fact that there are
[107.439] channels insized into the bedrock under
[110.159] the sand sheet. That was the whole
[112.24] importance of and value of the shuttle
[114.799] overflights is because for the first
[116.399] time we're able to peer beneath the sand
[118.719] and see that the bedrock under the sand
[120.88] is all completely channeled, paleo
[124.56] channelneled you would call it, with uh
[126.479] evidence of overland sheet floods. what
[128.879] is now pretty much the Sahara Desert.

Title: Not a Pyramid—Just Ice Age Erosion
[0.08] What we just looked at, Mount Robson, it
[2.56] was a nun attack. A nun attack. That's
[4.56] That's what British Columbia in the
[6.08] Rocky Mountains looked like at the end
[8.24] of the last ice age. Wow. Wow. Was
[10.559] right. Yeah. The one you're hovering
[11.84] over there right there. That's probably
[13.28] exactly what it would have looked like
[14.639] from the air 15,000 years ago. Everybody
[17.44] calls that a pyramid. They don't know
[19.039] about nun attacks, I guess. But here's
[21.039] the thing. It is normal under certain
[23.279] cir uh erosional regimes for the end
[26.56] result to be a pyramid-shaped rock from
[28.8] glacial erosion and water erosion both.
[31.679] Well, you just answered a lot of
[33.28] conspiratorial questions here. I don't
[35.28] even think you realize what you just did
[36.719] to the internet, Randall. Sorry guys,
[38.64] but this is normal to the plane of the
[41.2] picture, isn't it? Aren't we looking
[42.559] perpendicular? This is a satellite
[44.48] image. That's a two-dimensional
[46.239] essentially a planer surface there,
[48.16] isn't it? But that actually is very
[50.239] normal glacial erosion. That's not
[52.32] atypical. Why is that? You got to
[54.32] picture if you've got a a glacier moving
[56.719] through. It looks like up there just
[58.399] above the red flag. That would be like a
[60.399] base of the thing. Well, that's a
[62.16] valley. That valley was occupied by a
[64.32] moving glacier. And that moving glacier
[66.64] is gouging and stripping the bedrock as
[70.4] it's plowing its way through. What you
[72.72] end up with is is natural. You can see
[74.88] it in water erosion, too. Mhm. What you
[77.28] end up with is triangular planer
[79.759] surface. Got Mount Robson and you've got
[81.68] Mount Edith Caval. You've got the
[83.759] Aabaska River debushing from the Rocky
[86.479] Mountain front turning south at Hinton
[89.119] and then following more or less
[90.799] parallel. We started at Mount Robson and
[93.36] we followed the river on out and then we
[96.479] came out here and let's see what did we
[98.56] do? stopped in Calgary. And this is
[100.56] where we met Graham Dunlop and and
[103.119] Darren Grimes because they were living
[104.88] in Calgary. Gonna spray like this,
[107.36] right? Oh, yeah. See, I'm I'm leading
[110.32] you right up to the precipice of the
[112.079] rabbit hole.

Title: Egypt’s Deepest Secret Is Buried Beneath the Nile
[0.16] Basically what we can show in terms of
[3.12] global changes and mega floods is we can
[6.56] show that pretty much every place on
[8.48] earth has at one time or another been
[10.4] subject to extreme pluvial events and
[14.4] that includes North Africa. It includes
[16.8] Egypt. That became apparent back in the
[19.64] 1980s with the shuttle radar that first
[22.64] was able to peer through the sand sheet
[24.72] there in the Sahara Desert. What they
[27.039] were able to see under the sand was a
[30.0] whole network of erosional features that
[34.48] had been carved by running water. It's
[36.719] become very apparent since the late
[38.64] 1980s. When you think of the Nile and
[40.719] you talk about the Nile Valley, you're
[42.879] looking at this nice fairly level layer
[46.079] of alovium that the all the agriculture
[48.239] of Egypt is being undertaken on in the
[51.36] Nile Valley on these nice flood terraces
[54.399] and the whole history of Egypt and why
[57.28] it was able to emerge from the barbarian
[60.48] backdrop in that particular area was
[62.64] because of the fertility of the Nile
[64.479] Valley. what's happening here below on
[66.88] the planetary surface with the annual
[69.04] flooding of the Nile that was a result
[71.36] of the monsoon rains over the southern
[74.799] highlands in the headarters of both the
[76.64] blue and the white Nile. So those rains
[78.88] would come in and then you'd have that
[81.2] flow north. Now you're picturing the
[82.64] Nile it's flowing north that flows into
[84.72] the Mediterranean. So you got this nice
[86.56] verdant valley you know the river comes
[88.56] through even during the flood it's
[90.08] somewhat vigorous but it's still do well
[92.64] doiciled river. The thing of it is is
[95.28] that if you're standing there next to
[97.04] the actual river, you're standing on top
[98.96] of a column of alovvium that includes
[102.0] both material washed down from the
[105.0] highlands, but also marine material
[107.759] that's been backwashed up from the
[110.159] Mediterranean. If you were to now scoop
[112.399] out the infill, the sedimentary infill,
[116.24] you'd be looking at a canyon 6,000 7,000
[120.32] in in some places even 8,000 ft deep.
[123.68] It's a gigantic deep gash in the earth.
[127.68] But it has also served as a repository
[130.64] for the infill of all of this material
[133.28] that has been washed into it. The waters
[136.0] of the
[137.0] Mediterranean dried up. The whole
[139.8] Mediterranean disappeared I think
[142.4] between five and seven million years
[144.239] ago. At some point, the Atlantic Ocean,
[147.2] which was barricaded, the dam if you
[149.599] will, at the Straits of Gibralar burst
[152.72] and the waters of the Atlantic poured in
[156.319] and filled the Mediterranean basin.

Title: The Mysteries Of Stonehenge: Uncovering The Origins Of The Stones
[0.08] Hello everyone. Welcome to another
[2.639] episode of Squaring the
[6.15] [Music]
[17.72] Circle. In this episode, I'd like to
[20.08] talk a little bit about Stonehenge, the
[22.24] famous monument on the Salisbury plane
[25.439] in southern England. I think most
[27.92] everybody knows
[30.08] about the existence of
[31.88] Stonehenge and there's been some very
[34.16] interesting speculation around its
[36.64] purpose and meaning is and what I'd like
[39.28] to do is look at it in the light of some
[41.44] new evidence that has emerged within the
[45.2] last year and that has to do with the
[48.879] lithology of the monument. By that I
[51.84] mean the rock types, the type of rocks.
[54.879] So we basically have three types of
[57.44] rocks. We have a sandstone rock which
[60.8] forms the
[62.84] outer large stones that are called the
[65.92] sarsson stones which we're going to look
[67.439] at in a second. Inside there we have
[69.6] another type of rock. It's it's a called
[72.0] a blue stone and they have different
[74.4] lithologies and then there's a third
[76.32] type of rock that forms the alter stone
[80.4] and it's a completely a third type of
[83.36] rock. And then once you have the
[84.799] lithology
[86.36] of of rocks, you can then or hopefully
[91.36] if you have enough data available, you
[93.759] can determine the provenence of the
[96.96] rocks, which is where they came from.
[100.32] What part of a larger rock mass are they
[104.0] derivatives of?
[105.88] So lithology you you you identify the
[109.92] rock type and then the providence you
[111.92] can identify where is that rock type
[114.079] found in the earth right so for many
[118.56] years the blue stones which and it's
[121.119] still believed that they came from Wales
[123.92] and this is I think about 125 mile
[126.479] transport distance something like that
[128.959] 125 mi from Wales and it was believed
[131.44] that the Sars stones came from
[133.04] relatively nearby quarry maybe within
[135.2] and 30 mi
[137.319] away. But it was believed that the that
[140.239] the blue stones from Wales were
[143.28] transported the farthest distance.
[145.8] Well, over the last few years, doubts
[148.72] have crept in as to whether or not the
[151.84] lithology of the altar stone is the same
[154.16] as that of the blue stones that form the
[157.36] blue stone circle and the blue stone
[159.44] horseshoe. Well, more indepth studies
[162.56] showed that it was indeed
[164.76] different. So, we're going to talk about
[167.36] that and plus some of the other factors
[170.56] associated with Stonehenge, some of its
[173.879] attributes, and then see if
[176.519] we might surmise that there could be
[179.519] some
[180.599] implications as far as the meaning and
[183.599] purpose and function of Stonehenge. So,
[187.04] I think we'll just get right down into a
[190.08] slideshow here where we can start
[191.599] getting some images and see what we're
[193.28] talking
[195.319] about. And this is the monument, the
[198.72] full moon rising in the
[201.0] distance.
[202.519] And we're going to go through some of
[204.879] this
[206.2] here.
[208.28] And here's the larger context of the
[211.84] structure. Now, as you can see, it's in
[215.2] pretty rough shape. It's gone uh
[218.56] deteriorated much. There are stones that
[220.4] are missing, probably car hauled off and
[223.84] used for other
[225.4] purposes. But there's enough of the
[227.92] stones left to
[230.44] reconstruct the original monument to
[233.44] pretty darn close. I mean literally to
[235.76] within a few inches almost because
[238.959] anytime you have like say have the arc
[240.48] of a circle you can use simple geometric
[244.64] processes and get the center of that arc
[248.159] right and then once you have the center
[249.519] of that arc then you can recreate the
[253.04] entire circle. Okay so this is the
[255.68] stonehenge from the air. Now a couple of
[257.12] things I want to call your attention to
[259.12] here is that you've got this moat around
[263.199] here. what was once a moat, the ditch
[265.44] and a bank. Now, we're not going to talk
[267.36] about those in this episode, but we will
[269.44] talk about those in in future episodes,
[273.44] but that is part of the much larger
[275.84] structure here. It was probably the
[277.52] first thing that was appeared on the
[280.56] site. But the point is is that
[283.12] Stonehenge is much more than just the
[285.52] circular stones that you see here. It
[287.36] also
[288.52] included major earth, in this case,
[292.08] ditch and a
[293.72] bank. Okay, let's take a little closer
[296.08] look
[297.32] at the sarsen stone ring. This is the
[300.32] outer ring. You've got the uprights, the
[302.96] sarsen stone uprights as they're called,
[304.96] and then you've got these lentils. So,
[307.52] at one time there were 30 of these, and
[310.32] they formed a complete ring. And the
[312.4] lentil stones on the top then formed a
[315.919] cap a capstone if you will. So with the
[318.56] 30 uprights and 30 lentils and you can
[321.36] see through when you look through the
[322.56] aperture here you can see one of the
[324.72] so-called horseshoe
[327.0] triilathons which if I go back you'll
[329.44] see those are the big ones here towards
[332.72] the center of the monument and the
[334.16] sarsson stones are the outer ring.
[339.479] Okay. And here's just another view of
[342.759] the the sarsen stone uprights and the
[347.36] the capstones or the
[350.28] lentils. Okay. Now, here's basic ground
[354.639] plan of the monument.
[358.44] And I've for the blue stone ring, I've
[361.84] just superimposed, you know, a blue
[364.16] circle. And for the Sarsen stone ring,
[367.28] I've superimposed a red circle. Now the
[371.28] black stones are the ones that are
[373.44] remaining and the hollow or the white
[376.24] interior ones are
[379.319] missing. One of the interesting things
[381.52] here is the summer solstice sunrise axis
[385.919] which leads
[387.16] to position of the sun when it's at its
[392.08] farthest north position at summer
[394.88] solstice on the horizon at its rising
[397.44] point.
[399.199] I'm not showing it here. It doesn't you
[401.12] don't see it in the ground plan here,
[402.639] but there's another upright stone out
[404.479] here in the field called the heel stone
[406.72] that marks that position very
[409.16] accurately. Right here you see is the
[411.28] altar stone. And the ultra
[414.52] stone may have fallen over. I'm not.
[417.759] It's got a couple of other large rocks
[420.24] more or less on top of it. So, it's
[423.199] different difficult to discern its exact
[425.599] position. I have a nice little model
[428.8] here, a 3D model to help
[431.24] visualize the layout of Stonehenge in a
[433.919] reconstructed form. So you can see we've
[436.88] got the Sarsen stones which are a
[439.44] sandstone rock basically forming the
[442.16] horseshoe trilons. So there were five of
[445.0] those. You've got the blue stone
[447.919] horseshoe inside which is not a complete
[450.639] circle. It's not a closed circle.
[452.08] However, the ark is tangent to a circle
[455.44] and that circle is right at roughly 39
[458.4] 1/2 ft, possibly a little bit more. You
[462.24] got the blue stone circle here on the
[464.44] outside the I mean the the just inside
[468.72] the sarsson stone. You've got the the
[470.639] blue
[471.8] stones and there's debate about how many
[474.4] of those there were. I think it's I've
[476.879] seen 56 and I've seen 60 being
[480.28] the generally the the numbers that are
[483.759] usually invoked and interestingly both
[485.84] those numbers have significance. Now the
[489.12] alignment is directly along that
[491.44] solstitial axis that you see here. And
[494.319] in the assumed reassembly of the
[496.8] monument, you would have had an opening
[498.879] all the way through here marking that
[500.56] line on the summer solstice where the
[503.52] sun would be
[505.56] rising. Should go this way. Okay. Like
[511.32] this.
[512.919] So I hope that kind of gives you the
[515.36] picture, the general picture of it.
[518.0] You can see here that the lintil stones
[521.68] are mortised and tended
[523.56] together like this. We know that
[527.32] because we've seen that in
[531.0] the in the remaining ones. We actually
[533.44] see this mortise and tenoning tenon
[535.92] effect. This tongue and groove effect
[538.24] here that you see recreated in the
[541.44] model.
[543.92] Okay, let's see if we can navigate our
[546.8] way back
[550.68] to our PowerPoint. And there we are. So,
[555.04] here's some dimensions. The Sarsson
[557.839] stone
[558.68] circle, the center line of the stone is
[562.56] 100.8 ft. Now, as far as these
[565.2] dimensions go, obviously there's going
[566.88] to be some some variability in these.
[570.08] These dimensions that I've got here have
[572.08] taken from the three separate surveys of
[574.959] the monument that I was able to access.
[577.36] Okay. Now, they've all varied
[580.519] slightly. What I was doing though was an
[583.12] attempt to reconstruct the original.
[586.08] Okay.
[587.32] And if you do this and you use these
[590.0] dimensions here, you will come up with a
[591.8] template which if you used to actually
[595.12] attempt to build a a reconstructed
[599.68] duplicate of the model, you would come
[602.0] up with one that would be so close to
[604.88] the speculated model here that for all
[607.839] practical purposes, you could almost
[609.44] consider them to be identical. Right?
[612.24] But again, you know, you can quibble
[614.32] over a few inches here or a few inches
[617.8] there. I think though that the accuracy
[621.279] of what's here is enough to reconstruct
[625.68] the original geometric template. And I
[628.24] think we can safely conclude or at least
[631.0] surmise that there was a exercise in
[634.399] geometry going on here that there was a
[637.12] template of geometry rather than just
[639.839] randomly laying it out. We know and it
[643.2] has been known for a long time that
[644.64] there is this significant astronomical
[646.8] alignment. So we know that the
[648.16] orientation of the model of the
[650.24] structure was not just randomly placed.
[652.959] You had to have this allimp important
[654.72] alignment this axis to begin with. Once
[657.76] you've got that, it would only make
[659.2] sense that you would then use a very
[662.8] rational and specific sequence of steps
[665.92] to determine the distances and
[668.56] proportions and ratios of the rest of
[671.12] the monument that's now going to be
[673.76] juxtaposed onto that solstitial
[676.399] alignment if that makes sense. So what
[679.12] we have here in these in these
[684.6] dimensions is we have dimensions that
[687.68] are very very close and several of them
[689.68] will give us indications that we are on
[691.36] the right track because it turns out
[694.48] that the average distance of
[696.92] the center line of the stones which is
[700.079] marked by
[702.36] the marked by
[704.44] the the the average length of the
[707.04] lintils is 10.56 feet. Right now,
[711.04] there's enough of them that remain and
[712.32] the tooling of them is highly accurate.
[715.04] So, from that, one comes up with a
[717.76] number that's very close to 10.56 ft,
[720.399] which would also represent the center
[723.2] line of the Sars Stone uprightes. Well,
[726.399] if you measure on the Sarsen stone
[728.72] circle the outer face, the outer face,
[732.639] it works out to be very close to
[735.16] 105.6 ft. Now, this suggests something,
[739.04] right? It suggests that there's a a
[741.04] common unit of measurement here being
[743.36] involved that you've got 10.56
[746.92] ft for the average length of the
[750.8] separation of the Sarsson stone lentils
[754.079] and you got 105.6 ft, give or take a few
[757.44] inches, being the outer the diameter of
[759.92] the outer face. Right? Now, those
[763.519] numbers to me are very interesting and
[765.76] and here's the reason why. If you put
[769.959] 105.6 into a
[772.36] calculator and then you multiply that by
[776.12] 50, you've got exactly our modern mile,
[779.88] 5,280 ft.
[782.48] Now, so now if you have the average
[785.36] length of the Sarsson stone lentils and
[788.16] you multiply that by 500, you get
[793.88] again you get the length of our modern
[796.56] mile 5,280 ft. Now, does that suggest
[802.56] the
[803.88] possibility that there was a unified
[806.16] system of measurement here that was
[810.16] based upon our what's still extent as
[813.76] the modern imperial
[816.519] mile and sub multiples of that unit or
[821.76] multiples that started out let's say at
[824.839] 10.56 ft maybe that was the fundamental
[827.959] unit 10 of those then gave the outer
[831.68] face of the Sarsen stone circle and then
[835.04] 500 of those fundamental units gave the
[838.12] mile which it turns out happens to be
[841.04] very very close to 1,000
[844.519] paces of an individual counting out
[848.72] paces who is just perhaps over a little
[851.279] bit over 6 feet in height. Okay, 5,280
[855.519] ft. So, if you have a a a pace or
[859.279] perhaps we could call it a stride, let's
[861.279] say you're out pacing off a distance,
[863.6] right? Every time your right foot hits
[865.839] the ground, you count the pace. Now,
[868.079] let's say you count out a,000 of those
[871.6] and it turns out you measure a,000 of
[873.68] those paces and it's
[875.88] 5,280 ft. You see, now you've got a
[879.199] derivative length for the pace of
[881.8] 5.28 ft. And in fact, the word mile
[885.279] actually comes from the same origin as
[888.079] the word mill, which means 1,000, right?
[891.839] So 1,000 paces of
[894.519] 5.28 ft each gives you the mile of 5,280
[899.68] ft. And it appears as if a sub multiple
[903.279] of that unit of measurement, which is
[905.76] still in use today, may have been
[909.92] utilized in the laying out and measuring
[913.12] the dimensions of
[915.079] Stonehenge. Is it possible that our feet
[918.16] and our miles are as old as
[921.16] Stonehenge? That's possibly an
[923.68] implication
[925.32] here. Now, I did say that there was some
[928.56] geometry involved. So, let's explore a
[930.959] little bit of it, and we're only going
[932.24] to unpack some of this stuff. Now,
[934.639] there's way more that we could get into,
[936.959] but for the purposes
[938.76] of keeping this into a manageable chunk
[942.32] of information, we're going to kind of
[944.079] limit ourselves to what we get into. But
[946.959] we've seen that there is an astronomical
[950.199] component. And it starts with something
[952.48] as simple as that one alignment that
[955.92] occurs in the northern hemisphere one
[958.24] time each year on the longest day of the
[961.04] year. And on that morning, the rising of
[964.16] the sun is captured in that alignment of
[967.6] Stonehenge.
[969.56] Okay. Question we'll come back to
[971.759] shortly. Directly here is is there
[975.32] more more astron astronomy involved in
[979.279] the layout of Stonehenge? And I think
[980.88] the answer is probably yes. Okay. But
[984.16] first, let's look at some
[985.959] geometry. Okay. So here we have what's
[989.279] called the golden rectangle or sometimes
[992.399] the rectangle of the whirling squares
[995.12] because once you know how to lay out the
[996.72] golden rectangle with those proper as
[1000.16] they have been called to divine
[1002.279] proportions you can create this
[1006.04] logarithmic spiral that looks something
[1008.24] like this that we actually find
[1010.68] reproduced in various natural phenomena.
[1014.16] So this is the rectangle of the whirling
[1015.92] square. It's also known as the golden
[1017.519] rectangle. It was very important to
[1019.36] artists and architects and builders
[1021.839] throughout the ages, including, I would
[1025.0] suggest, possibly the builders of
[1028.48] Stonehenge. Because one very prominent
[1030.559] place this particular rectangle shows
[1034.839] up here, I'm going to flip it up on its
[1038.72] vertical axis.
[1040.799] And here we have a an elevation diagram
[1044.88] of the Sarsen stone, the horseshoe
[1048.24] triilathon, the big rocks in the middle.
[1051.039] And here the red B border gives you a
[1054.559] golden rectangle. It looks like the
[1058.2] five horseshoe
[1060.28] triilathons
[1061.799] were quarried and shaped and assembled
[1066.6] to reproduce the golden rectangle.
[1070.0] either that or it's just
[1073.559] coincidence and they just luckily hit
[1076.48] upon this particular rectangle. The dash
[1079.52] lines here show that you've got a
[1081.36] mortise and tenon type construction
[1083.76] between the lentils and the uprightes.
[1086.24] The uprightes had a carved knob in the
[1088.96] top and there was a tongue if you will
[1092.08] and then there was a groove or an
[1093.679] indentation in the bottom of the lintil
[1096.08] stone so they could fit together.
[1102.559] And here we
[1105.24] have sort of the summary of what we've
[1107.84] seen here, what we've been talking
[1109.44] about. Here's your
[1111.32] 10.56 ft that forms the distance, the
[1115.6] length of the
[1117.08] lintils, and it's also the center line
[1120.88] forms the center line of the Sarsen
[1123.52] stone uprightes.
[1128.2] So here is
[1131.88] our sunrise alignment through the
[1134.72] aperture. Now you can just barely make
[1136.799] out the heel stone right here. The heel
[1139.28] stone marks that position on the
[1141.48] horizon. So now if you are facing east
[1146.72] right here at the alignment, north is
[1149.039] going to be to your left, south is going
[1151.44] to be to your right. Okay. So what's
[1154.08] happening now? This is the longest day
[1155.76] of the year. So from now on the the days
[1158.48] are going to be getting shorter after
[1160.08] this. So each day the sunrise is going
[1163.6] to be shifting away from the north
[1166.72] towards the south and eventually
[1169.6] standing in this same position. The
[1171.52] rising of the sun will be blocked by
[1174.6] this upright right here. You won't see
[1176.96] it. You'll have to wait a whole year for
[1179.52] the sun to migrate. Once it gets to
[1181.679] winter solstice, turns around, starts
[1184.559] coming back, it'll take another 6
[1186.32] months, and then on the morning of the
[1188.16] longest day of the year, it's going to
[1189.96] arrive rise above the horizon right
[1192.96] along the axis of the
[1196.28] structure. Okay. Now, what about other
[1200.76] alignments? Well, it's very probable
[1203.679] that there are major lunar alignments
[1205.919] built in as well. And as it says here
[1208.32] from this
[1209.72] website, Stonehenge is famous for its
[1212.16] alignments with the sun. But did you
[1214.559] know that the ancient monument may have
[1216.16] also been carefully designed to align
[1218.4] with the movements of the
[1219.96] moon? 2024 is a special year and it
[1223.44] actually bleeds over into 2025 as well
[1226.48] as an astronomical
[1228.36] phenomena phenomenon called the major
[1231.76] lunar standstill.
[1234.0] This rare celestial phenomena presents
[1236.159] an opportunity to explore the connection
[1239.28] between Stonehinge and the moon. Now the
[1242.32] likely connection is what is called the
[1244.72] station stone rectangle. Now the station
[1247.28] stone rectangle can you
[1250.2] can is defined right here. If you look
[1254.96] at this aerial view, there's a
[1257.28] rectangle. There's two stones that still
[1259.84] define the rectangle and there's
[1261.679] depressions in the ground that define
[1264.08] the positions of the two missing stones.
[1266.08] So the the rectangle can
[1268.36] be recreated pretty accurately. Okay.
[1272.32] Now you'll notice that the rectangle is
[1274.32] almost looks virtually like it's tangent
[1277.52] to the circle upon which the Sarsen
[1279.919] stone circle is
[1282.44] drawn. Okay, let's see if we can. Yeah,
[1286.88] Stonehenge is going to stream the
[1288.559] exciting lunar standstill live.
[1291.84] Researchers are investigating whether
[1293.52] the Neolithic monument is aligned with
[1295.679] the moon. I'm going to suggest that if I
[1298.24] had to place my my bets, I would place
[1300.64] it that yes, it's definitely aligned
[1303.2] with the moon.
[1305.72] Okay, but let's go here to this diagram.
[1308.88] This shows the lunar alignments. Now,
[1310.72] here you see the axial line. Look, mid
[1314.559] mid- winter sunset following the blue
[1317.679] arrow and you have midsummer sunrise,
[1321.039] the the orer colored arrow. This
[1324.0] particular diagram shows us the heel
[1326.48] stone, and it also shows us the ditch
[1328.48] and bank complex. And this dash line
[1331.6] here is the the lunar rectangle. And
[1336.32] notice this right here, this line right
[1338.76] here, that points to the
[1341.48] southernmost moonrise at the major
[1346.6] standstill. So it looks like this
[1349.96] monument also, like other monuments,
[1353.08] memorialized
[1354.919] the the subtle motions of the moon
[1357.919] throughout the course of its 18.6 year
[1362.0] cycle.
[1364.24] very much in fact like we find at this
[1366.799] monument way over in Ohio. This is
[1369.36] called
[1370.2] Newark and Newark
[1374.679] is laid out according to both sun and
[1378.799] moon alignments. Now let's go back to
[1381.2] this one. This is showing the major axis
[1383.919] of Newark points to the horizon points
[1387.6] to the position on the horizon where the
[1391.52] maximum northern moon rise occurs. Now
[1395.6] let's go back to here and what do you
[1398.48] see here? You have the southernmost moon
[1401.6] rise and so this is going to be also a
[1404.76] maximum
[1406.919] lunar rise.
[1410.48] Why are why were these people over in
[1413.4] Ohio building this enormous structure
[1416.36] that required an enormous volume of
[1419.6] work, a lot of work, a lot of
[1423.0] labor to build this huge structure to
[1426.36] memorialize the entire cycle of the
[1429.52] moon, 18.6 year cycle of the moon. And
[1433.36] here you have all of the alignments, all
[1435.6] the significant key alignments built
[1437.84] into the monument. And if you have the
[1441.039] correct perspective, the correct
[1443.12] position within the monument, then these
[1445.6] alignments will these moonrise positions
[1449.039] will show up between the gaps, the
[1452.76] apertures. You see, look at the look at
[1454.96] the octagon here. There are gaps in the
[1457.6] octagon. You see that? Knowing where to
[1460.88] position yourself, you will then can
[1463.039] witness the moon's motions with a high
[1466.64] degree of precision.
[1472.0] Now let's go back to the basic
[1476.159] concentric circle configuration of
[1479.64] Stonehenge
[1481.4] here and let's abstract that by going
[1484.88] like
[1486.279] this and then
[1488.44] this. So here we have just abstracted
[1492.24] the red circle representing the center
[1494.6] line of the sarsen stone circle and we
[1498.64] have the blue
[1501.64] ring marking out
[1503.96] the center line of the blue stone
[1507.48] circle. Now what I'm going to do is I'm
[1509.679] going
[1510.919] to show you the dimensions here just as
[1514.159] a reminder. Now this is to the center
[1515.84] line not the outer face because those up
[1518.96] the sarsson stones are thick right? So
[1522.24] you can measure to the outer face but
[1523.919] you can also measure to the center line.
[1526.96] Right? If you wanted to have them
[1528.88] accurately positioned you would probably
[1530.799] go ahead
[1531.96] and put down a couple of different lines
[1535.12] in order to have a way of calibrating.
[1538.0] But anyways we can see right at 100.8
[1540.559] ft. Okay, that's for the outer the
[1543.919] center line of the outer Stonehenge
[1546.88] Sarsson stone
[1550.039] circle and let's see let's go here
[1553.279] first. Okay, so here we have now the
[1555.84] center line of
[1557.96] the let's go back here of the blue stone
[1562.0] right here at 79.2 ft. So up here in the
[1566.24] right hand corner what what I've done is
[1567.679] I've taken the ratio of the two circles
[1570.559] the red circle the red ring and the blue
[1572.72] ring. So 100.8 ft then divided by 79.2
[1577.36] ft gives us the ratio
[1581.4] 1.2727. Now to show you some of the
[1584.48] geometry that's been encoded into this
[1587.559] structure. I'm going to show you first
[1589.679] of all
[1591.48] pi with three three dots right here
[1594.88] represents that
[1598.919] 3.141592654 goes on forever and forever.
[1601.679] It's an irrational number that never
[1604.48] terminates and never repeats.
[1608.2] Now, it's been known that amongst
[1610.799] different cultures, even right on down
[1612.64] to the medieval Freemasons, down to our
[1614.64] own time, builders have typically use
[1617.279] these two whole numbers, 22 / 7 to get a
[1621.36] value of pi that's very close to the
[1625.2] very refined value. Notice that in the
[1629.2] 10th's position, it's the same. In the
[1630.96] fourth pos, I mean, in the hundreds
[1633.52] positions, it is the same. And then when
[1635.76] you get to the thousandth position, it's
[1637.84] it's off by one digit. So it's basically
[1641.2] 1 1,000th of off in accuracy when you
[1644.799] get to the third decimal point. Right?
[1648.24] So for practical work, 22 over7 is
[1651.919] perfectly acceptable, right? If you're
[1654.4] building a structure on the size or
[1656.64] scale of Stonehenge or anything else,
[1659.44] that would be typically room sized,
[1662.4] house sized, building size,
[1665.4] etc. Okay, so now here's where the
[1669.039] interesting geometry comes
[1670.84] in. You know that if we have this circle
[1673.52] here, the blue ring, and it's 79.2 2
[1676.799] feet. You can see right here that the
[1678.64] diameter of that circle is going to be
[1681.279] the same as the side of a square
[1684.919] enclosing that circle where the midpoint
[1688.64] of each side of the square is precisely
[1691.64] tangent to the four quarters of the blue
[1695.919] ring. Right? Now, if I draw that square
[1700.0] around it and its side length is 79.2 2
[1702.88] ft. Then its total perimeter is
[1706.6] 316.8
[1708.44] ft. If I go over here, remind you
[1711.279] builder's pi 22 / by 7. So instead of
[1715.279] multiplying
[1716.76] 100.8 by the exact value, which you
[1720.96] can't get anyway. You have to round it
[1722.48] off. But using that times builder's pi,
[1726.08] we see that the circumference of the red
[1728.0] ring is 316.8 ft. So in other words,
[1731.84] look back at this diagram. What we've
[1733.919] essentially done here is we've shown
[1736.159] that
[1737.24] Stonehenge represents the squaring of
[1739.679] the circle geomet geometric
[1742.76] exercise or we have to assume it's just
[1746.399] another
[1747.399] coincidence and okay one coincidence
[1751.44] I'll buy it. Two coincidences maybe
[1754.399] three coincidences. At that point I
[1756.48] think we have to start looking beyond
[1758.88] coincidence and look at pattern and
[1762.279] intent and not
[1765.559] coincidental. But if it's not
[1767.44] coincidental then of course there's
[1770.159] meaning
[1771.159] implied. Okay. So let's keep moving on
[1774.88] here. We've shown now that we've got
[1778.08] manifest showing up within this
[1780.799] structure within the design in the
[1782.24] elevation. We find that probably the key
[1785.0] elevation of the whole monument is the
[1787.52] Sarsen stone ring. I'm sorry, the the
[1791.24] the horseshoe triilathon. They're the
[1793.76] biggest, most massive of the stones and
[1796.96] they embody the golden rectangle. Now,
[1800.0] we go over here to the the ground plan
[1803.12] and we see that the two prominent rings,
[1805.2] the sarsen stone ring and the blue stone
[1807.32] ring manifest the squaring of the
[1810.919] circle. Okay. Let's keep moving here. If
[1815.44] I
[1816.679] now add in the Star of David, all right,
[1820.399] also known as the seal of
[1823.32] Solomon. We have some interesting
[1825.6] geometry that we're not going to explore
[1827.679] in this, but we do explore all of these
[1831.52] related geometries in my geometry
[1835.279] workshops and classes that I do. And at
[1838.08] the end of this, I'll talk about one
[1839.76] that's coming up very soon at the end of
[1842.12] February that's going to be open to the
[1845.36] public and in a very special place. And
[1848.32] this is sort of some of the kind of
[1850.399] stuff we dive into. But so now what I've
[1853.52] done here is I put the seal of Solomon
[1855.679] within this within the blue ring and it
[1859.36] gives us this hexagon in the center of
[1863.12] the seal of Solomon. And the distance
[1866.64] from the centers of each edge across
[1871.279] gives us a diameter of a circle. And we
[1875.679] can just put that di put the ground plan
[1879.52] back in. And you can see how the blue
[1883.52] stone horseshoe is defined. Now my
[1886.559] somehow my my red star here has gotten
[1890.0] slightly off. It should be a little bit
[1892.559] adjusted, but you get the point. The
[1895.36] blue stone horseshoe fits right
[1898.08] commensurate with the hexagon inside the
[1901.519] star of David. Okay. Now, I am going
[1906.919] to jump 2,00 almost 2,500 years into the
[1914.76] future nearby to
[1917.88] Glastonberry. And there is a building
[1920.24] there's the the ruins of a building on
[1923.279] part of the ruins of the Glastonberry
[1925.2] Abbey. And this goes back, this is a
[1927.519] middle age, a chapel from the middle
[1930.039] ages. And it's one of the few things
[1932.48] that's mostly intact, remnant from the
[1936.559] rest of the monument of Glastonbury,
[1939.919] which if you know any of the legends
[1942.799] associated with with
[1945.72] Glastonberry, you know that the it is
[1949.24] associated traditionally with the Holy
[1952.399] Grail. And there's a whole story about
[1954.72] the Holy Grail being hidden at
[1956.6] Glastonbury in the very early days of
[1959.48] Christianity. In fact, it is said that
[1962.24] the first Christian church according to
[1964.679] legend was a small circular chapel that
[1968.96] was built right on the site where St.
[1971.919] Mary's Chapel is now built and the for
[1975.679] some reason according to the legend the
[1978.32] original dimensions of that circle were
[1980.48] very important and so they were
[1982.96] preserved through several incarnations
[1986.24] of a temple being built on that spot up
[1989.36] to I think the building of St. Mary's
[1991.279] Chapel the temples were always circular
[1994.0] with the building of St. Mary's Chapel.
[1996.559] The width of the original circular
[1998.64] temple was incorporated into the width
[2001.919] of St. Mary's Chapel. And if we look at
[2005.6] the ground plan here of St. Mary's
[2007.44] Chapel, let's go back. You can see the
[2010.24] the doorway here, right, would
[2013.08] be this opening right here. And it's
[2017.559] 68.4T on the long axis, 39.6 ft on the
[2023.279] short axis.
[2024.88] which if you're at home and you're so
[2027.799] inclined, grab a calculator or do it
[2030.84] longhand. Divide 68.4 by
[2035.32] 39.6. And what you end up is with is the
[2039.2] discovery that this is a rectangle that
[2041.279] is called the root3 rectangle.
[2044.919] And the this particular rectangle has a
[2048.399] very easy very logical way of being
[2053.399] derived simply and naturally from some
[2057.679] of the most fundamental
[2059.72] geometric exercises that you can
[2062.04] perform. And let's take a look here. We
[2065.679] go back to Stonehenge. The plan was St.
[2068.079] Mary's Chapel. I mean, Stonehenge with
[2071.24] the Star of David in there. And what I'm
[2074.8] going to do now is I'm going to
[2076.52] juxtapose the
[2079.48] the ground plan of St. Mary's Chapel at
[2082.879] the same scale directly
[2085.639] onto this diagram of Stonehenge. And
[2089.2] what we discover is very
[2091.879] interesting that that particular
[2094.0] rectangle is exactly the rectangle
[2098.16] Whoops.
[2100.04] produced by the four
[2103.24] points four of the points of the star of
[2106.4] David or seal of Solomon. Here's the
[2108.24] same rectangle right here. See it? And
[2111.52] same rectangle right
[2115.88] here. Now, do we call that a
[2120.2] coincidence? Well, obviously it has to
[2122.56] be a coincidence, right? Because we
[2124.48] assume that there's no connection
[2126.079] between the builders of St. Mary's
[2128.64] Chapel in the 1100s. I'm pretty sure was
[2131.2] in the 1100s or early 1200s and the
[2134.64] ground plan of Stonehenge.
[2137.4] Right? So clearly all these things are
[2140.92] coincidences and they there there can't
[2142.96] be any meaning to this or
[2146.04] significance
[2147.72] really.
[2149.24] Anyways, maybe maybe at some point
[2153.28] though we've got to go beyond
[2155.44] coincidence. I would like to mention
[2157.119] that one of our original sponsors at
[2159.8] Cosmographia, CBD from the Gods, is
[2162.96] following us here to our new podcast,
[2165.119] Squaring the Circle. As many of you
[2167.52] know, I've been using their products for
[2169.28] going on four years now. And having
[2172.079] tried a number of CBD brands, CBD from
[2175.359] the Gods seems the most effective for my
[2177.92] needs, which is primarily as a sleep aid
[2180.88] and as a remedy for inflammation and
[2183.359] associated pain. I use both the oil and
[2187.2] the sav. My wife also likes their
[2190.0] products, especially the sav, which
[2191.839] alleviates the pain in her hands, which
[2194.4] is the result of working for years as an
[2196.76] electrician. If you've been thinking
[2198.56] about trying a CBD product and
[2200.56] experiencing the benefits for yourself,

[2222.28] Thanks. Now, let's get to some updating
[2225.52] here. some news that has come out from
[2227.52] some some of the most recent research on
[2230.32] to Stonehenge in the uh August August
[2236.2] 15th 2024 issue of the British
[2241.28] prestigious British Science Journal
[2243.88] Nature. An article was presented and the
[2247.76] title of this article was this. A
[2250.4] Scottish
[2251.56] providence for the alter stone of
[2255.079] Stonehenge. H Scottish providence.
[2258.72] Right.
[2260.24] And so the the article opens by saying
[2263.2] Stonehenge, the Neolithic Standing Stone
[2266.119] Circle located on the Salisbury plane in
[2270.04] Wiltshshire, England, offers valuable
[2272.88] insight into
[2274.359] prehistoric Britain. Construction at
[2277.599] Stonehenge began as early as 3000 BC,
[2280.88] that's 5,000 years ago, with subsequent
[2284.2] modifications during the following two
[2286.68] millennium. Okay. The megaliths of
[2289.76] Stonehenge are divided into two major
[2292.599] categories. Sarsson stones and blue
[2296.599] stones. The larger sars comprise
[2300.44] duracust silcrete predominantly sourced
[2304.0] from the westwoods marlbarrow
[2306.0] approximately 25 km. Okay. So yeah
[2310.4] little bit I think I said 25 miles. So
[2313.839] this would be less 25 km would be
[2318.359] oh little bit probably around 15 miles
[2322.96] 16 miles somewhere in there.
[2325.8] Okay. And they the blue stones the
[2329.52] generic term for rocks considered exotic
[2332.88] to the local
[2334.68] area includes volcanic tough riolyte. I
[2338.4] think riyolyte and dolerite are the the
[2340.64] dominant rock types in there.
[2343.68] and sandstone. So there's some sandstone
[2346.079] mixed in with
[2347.56] it. Some lithologies are linked to with
[2351.04] Neolithic quaring sites in the Pcelli
[2354.64] area of West Wales. So that's where they
[2357.2] would have come from. An unnamed lower
[2359.359] Paleozoic sandstone associated with
[2363.0] Wales, West Wales area on the basis of
[2367.68] fossils is present as widely
[2371.359] disseminated as deotage which is the the
[2374.56] the flakes and the wastage left over
[2377.48] from quarrying and from shaping stones,
[2380.8] flintnapping and so on.
[2383.599] So, it's widely disseminated at
[2388.599] Stonehenge. But now, here's where we get
[2392.0] to an anomaly. The central megalith of
[2394.8] Stonehenge, the altar stone, is the
[2398.0] largest of the blue
[2402.28] stones.
[2404.76] And let's
[2406.68] the the largest of the blue
[2409.8] stones measures 4.9. 4.9 * 1.0 * 0.5 m.
[2418.4] Okay. So, what does that work out to be?
[2420.88] Let's see here. I think I've worked that
[2423.44] out a little
[2426.04] bit. It's easy enough to do. So it works
[2429.52] out to
[2430.839] be I'll just grab my calculator here. So
[2434.16] 4.9
[2436.04] m would
[2439.32] be
[2442.359] 4.9. So that's 16 ft. So it's 16 ft
[2447.24] long. It's 1 m wide. So it's about 4t w
[2450.56] a little over 3 ft wide and then half a
[2453.2] meter thick. So it's about a little bit
[2456.64] more than a foot and a half thick. So if
[2459.119] if you can picture that.
[2462.68] Okay. So what they realized was that the
[2467.119] altar stone didn't match the type of
[2471.16] stones that were quarried in Wales to
[2475.28] that were then utilized as the blue
[2477.52] stones. So where did it come from?
[2481.68] that becomes the mystery. What they
[2484.48] realized was that they took the rock
[2489.04] database. There's a rock database that
[2491.319] exists that's been compiled for decades
[2494.56] and decades. And what it does is is if
[2496.88] you've got a rock and you're trying to
[2498.16] figure out where it came
[2499.56] from. This database has ge is is derived
[2504.319] from the study of geological strata from
[2506.4] all over the planet. It's
[2509.48] particularly profuse let's say in Europe
[2512.56] and the British Isles, North America,
[2514.48] right? Where most of the rock types that
[2517.44] are accessible to the surface have been
[2519.8] mapped. Okay. So by accessing this
[2523.04] database, there was a a group
[2525.16] of scientists led by Anthony J. Clark
[2528.64] was his name and he worked with five
[2531.0] others and he was an expert in minology,
[2534.16] right? He was actually a graduate
[2535.599] student when he was doing this work. So
[2538.48] what he did was he procured some samples
[2541.28] of that had fallen on the ground that
[2544.079] had come loose from the recumbent altar
[2547.04] stone at the site. So he got these
[2550.319] flakes and he was able to match them to
[2553.28] the database. So here we have a map of
[2556.8] the British Isles and you see down here
[2558.48] very prominently displayed the
[2560.4] Stonehenge.
[2562.56] Where did the altar stone come from? It
[2566.079] came from all the way up here. There's a
[2568.96] type the same type of rock here pops out
[2572.72] at the very northern tip of Scotland. It
[2574.96] actually also shows up on the Orcne
[2576.8] Islands
[2577.88] here. Well, depending on where it
[2582.16] sourced here or even up in the
[2585.64] Orcnees, turns out this is a long way.
[2588.96] It it varies 460 miles or more depending
[2592.4] if it came from New York news it was
[2593.76] more. It's getting closer to 500
[2596.2] miles. Okay, so that's a long way. Now
[2601.839] the weight of this was is was 6 tons.
[2606.64] Okay, that's 12,000 lbs. That's a big
[2610.0] old heavy stone to
[2612.839] transport. So what's the problem here?
[2616.839] Obviously, some method of transport had
[2620.079] to be utilized to get that stone 460
[2623.599] plus miles from the northern tip of
[2625.68] Scotland down to the building site at
[2628.4] Stonehenge. Right? So, in this article
[2632.56] which appeared in nature, it's entitled
[2634.319] a Scottish Providence, the altar stone
[2637.359] of
[2639.16] Stonehenge. Now, I'm going to quote from
[2641.04] the article.
[2642.88] We posit that the altar stone was
[2646.52] anthropogenically transported to
[2648.92] Stonehenge from northeast Scotland
[2652.64] consistent with evidence of Neolithic
[2655.76] inhabitation in the region.
[2658.72] Whereas the ignous blue stones were
[2661.28] brought around 225 kilometers or 140
[2667.72] miles. A Scottish province for the
[2671.079] alterone demands a transport distance of
[2674.48] at least
[2676.28] 466 miles.
[2679.319] Nonetheless, even with assistance from
[2682.24] beasts of burden, rivers and
[2685.96] topographical barriers, including the
[2688.88] Grampians, southern uplands, and the
[2691.319] panines, all mountain ranges, along with
[2694.72] the heavily forested landscape of
[2697.68] prehistoric Britain, would have posed
[2701.2] formidable obstacles for overland
[2705.079] megalith transportation.
[2708.64] Yes, it would
[2709.8] have.
[2711.88] Now, when this news broke in
[2716.839] August, BBC did some extensive, the
[2719.599] British Broadcasting Corporation did
[2722.079] some
[2723.56] extensive coverage of this story here.
[2727.28] And this is in one of the reports.
[2730.44] They state the obvious when they say,
[2733.76] "The discovery shows the construction of
[2736.839] Stonehenge was a far greater
[2739.44] collaborative effort than scientists
[2743.24] realized. It also means that the ancient
[2745.76] monument near Salsbury in southwest
[2748.079] England was built with stones from all
[2750.96] parts of Great Britain."
[2753.359] Now, here's quoting a professor Pierce
[2755.68] who was one of the people involved in
[2757.28] the in the study. It blew our socks off
[2761.68] when we discovered it was from Northeast
[2764.359] Scotland. Yeah. Okay.
[2767.48] Yeah. It was a shock to say the least.
[2773.2] Coming from that distance, more than 700
[2776.839] kilometers was remarkable. The Neolithic
[2780.48] people must have been pretty well
[2782.599] connected, far more connected than
[2785.04] people give them credit
[2787.16] for. They must have been well
[2790.44] organized. Stonehenge seems to be this
[2793.52] great British endeavor involving all the
[2796.88] different people from all over the
[2801.56] island. So another participant in the
[2804.8] alter study was a Dr. Robert Iiker
[2808.56] Aisher, I'm not sure I pronounce it.
[2810.16] It's spelled
[2811.8] Ixer. He was from the University College
[2815.119] in London. He is quoted by the BBC as
[2818.319] saying this. The work prompts two
[2822.0] important
[2823.64] questions. One, how is the altar stone
[2827.44] transported from the very north of
[2829.28] Scotland a distance of more than 700 km
[2832.8] to Stonehenge?
[2835.2] And more
[2837.16] intriguing,
[2839.56] why there are obvious physical barriers
[2842.64] to transporting by land and an equally
[2846.4] daunting journey if going by
[2849.0] sea. These findings will have huge
[2853.04] ramifications for understanding
[2855.119] communities in Neolithic times, their
[2858.319] levels of
[2859.8] connectivity, and their transport
[2862.319] systems.
[2864.4] Yes, indeed. Their transport systems.
[2868.28] Now, I would like to know what kind of
[2871.92] seafaring vessel was capable of carrying
[2875.599] this 12 ton stone through the the stormy
[2882.319] North Seas.
[2884.16] If you're going to go
[2886.04] around the the island all the way and
[2890.76] then land somewhere down near Stonehenge
[2894.319] and then offload the 12tonon boulder and
[2897.92] then transport it over land to the
[2899.76] position of
[2901.64] Stonehenge. I want to know what kind of
[2904.0] a what kind of a sailing vessel were
[2906.72] they incorporating where it would not
[2909.2] become destabilized by carrying a load
[2912.16] this
[2913.16] heavy? But I've not yet been able to
[2916.16] find any specific
[2918.839] information. In fact, I think that the
[2921.119] that the question is wide open as Dr.
[2924.319] Aisher says raises questions about their
[2928.2] transport systems.
[2932.24] One of the senior curators working for
[2935.68] English Heritage and they oversee and
[2939.24] manage the Stonehenge site. Heather Seb,
[2943.359] I hope I'm pronouncing her name correct.
[2945.76] She was compelled to make this
[2948.92] comment. It is phenomenal. It is
[2952.16] phenomenal that the people of the time
[2955.44] brought such a large stone all this way.
[2959.839] They must have had a compelling reason
[2962.0] to do it. In an interview with fizz.org,
[2966.8] Seb speculates that Stonehenge isn't a
[2970.48] settlement site, but it's a place of
[2973.04] ceremony or
[2974.68] ritual. Oh, okay. Well, then here's what
[2980.24] I have to wonder
[2981.88] about. First of all, I'll say yes. go to
[2985.04] all that effort to transport these
[2987.92] stones. And look, hey, even from from 17
[2991.76] or 20 miles
[2993.24] away, transporting the the the Sarsson
[2996.16] stones for the for the outer ring and
[2998.16] for the horseshoe
[2999.64] triathon, that's going to be a major
[3002.839] effort. Now, 140 miles transporting all
[3006.24] of the blue stones, that itself is no
[3009.28] minor effort in its own right. So
[3012.559] obviously a great deal of effort. They
[3014.64] they didn't choose the site of
[3017.04] Stonehenge based on oh here's a
[3019.599] convenient source of rock right here at
[3022.88] the site that we'll dig up and use to
[3025.28] build this monument. No, they went to
[3027.76] great lengths to import stone from three
[3031.2] different areas. Right. So she says they
[3035.76] must have had a compelling reason to do
[3038.48] it.
[3040.48] Yes, they must have had a compelling
[3042.8] reason for doing
[3044.28] so. What is the and I would also ask
[3047.2] what's the nature makes reference to a
[3049.839] ceremony or ritual. So now I'm curious
[3052.88] as to what is the nature of this
[3056.559] ceremony or ritual that is being
[3058.559] conducted at this site that I think we
[3061.92] can now safely speculate incorporates
[3065.4] astronomy. It incorporates geometry and
[3069.359] obviously I think
[3071.8] it implies that there were major
[3075.559] concerns about where it's going to be
[3078.44] placed right because they obviously hey
[3081.28] if you wanted to have maximum
[3082.72] convenience like using the sarsson
[3084.72] stones why didn't you shift the whole
[3086.0] monument 20
[3087.319] m away to the source of the quarry from
[3090.64] which the sarsson stones were removed
[3093.119] why do you trudge all the way up 140
[3096.079] miles away to Wales to get the blue
[3099.8] stones. Let's consider the dating of
[3102.52] Stonehenge. It's placed at between
[3105.48] 4,500 and 5,000 years ago. Okay, the
[3109.359] period of time called the Neolithic, the
[3111.359] new stone age. So, there's implications
[3114.079] that name, the Stone Age, right? So one,
[3118.0] what's implied almost in that name is
[3121.48] that we're pretty primitive in terms of
[3125.76] our knowledge of any matters of science
[3128.64] or technology and so on, right? The
[3131.359] stone age, right? People are still
[3133.2] living in the stone age. When did we
[3135.52] come out of the Neolithic? Well, it was
[3137.44] with the rise of writing primarily in
[3142.0] Sume Sumer Sumeriia and Egypt.
[3146.0] So
[3147.559] uh typically writing is dated both in
[3151.28] Egypt and to Samaria somewhere around
[3154.0] 2600 to 2700 years ago I'm sorry BC
[3158.64] which places it 4,600 to 4,700 years
[3162.24] ago. Now the major campaign of
[3165.92] construction on Stonehenge is estimated
[3168.319] to have been between 4,500 and 5,000
[3171.76] years ago. So basically what we're
[3175.76] learning there is that while writing was
[3179.599] being invented in the Middle East and
[3182.359] around the
[3184.359] Mediterranean, well at the same time we
[3188.079] have the major building campaign
[3191.119] constructing
[3193.079] Stonehenge. Coincidence and timing.
[3196.16] Well, again, for the sake of argument,
[3200.24] let's just say coincidence that there's
[3202.319] no relation between these two very
[3205.44] culturally significant phenomena
[3207.599] occurring simultaneously. Okay.
[3211.44] Now uh so going back to our study the
[3215.76] Scotty's providence for the alter stone
[3218.64] of Stonehenge lead author Anthony Clark
[3222.24] he was with the time scales of mineral
[3226.16] systems group
[3228.359] earth earth and planetary sciences in
[3231.64] Australia. Okay he was working with a
[3234.72] team five earth scientists and
[3237.359] archaeologists.
[3239.359] Now, I'll mention that Clark himself is
[3242.079] Welch, so he kind of, you know, had a a
[3246.64] an incentive to want to find that the
[3249.76] ultra stone came from Wales. Here's what
[3253.2] they found. They referred back to
[3255.76] earlier work that occurred in
[3258.2] 2023 on the altar stone. And it was this
[3261.2] work in 2023 that called into question
[3264.079] these assumptions about the origin in
[3266.8] the the province of the altar stone.
[3269.44] Date for the construction of Stonehenge
[3272.079] is 3000 BC.
[3275.599] From Clark and others, we learned that
[3277.44] constraining the provenence of the altar
[3279.839] stone could give insights into the
[3282.839] connectivity of Neolithic people who
[3285.359] left no written record. When the altar
[3288.16] stone arrived at Stonehenge is
[3290.52] uncertain. However, it may have been
[3292.64] placed within the central triilathon
[3295.2] horseshoe during the second construction
[3298.0] phase around 2600 to 2500
[3303.24] BC. Okay.
[3307.28] We get the then they comment this about
[3310.8] the alter stone. The central megalith of
[3314.079] Stonehenge. The altar stone is the
[3316.8] largest of the blue stones measuring
[3320.44] 4.9x 1.0 by.5 m or 16 ftx 3.3t x 1.64
[3327.839] ft.
[3329.359] is is a recumbent stone, meaning it's
[3331.44] laying
[3332.2] over and it weighs 6 tons or roughly
[3338.079] 12,000 lbs. And now here's the
[3339.92] interesting part. It's composed of a
[3343.119] pale green micious sandstone with
[3347.359] distinctive
[3349.72] minology. Two things to note here. Size
[3352.64] of the stone at six tons, more than
[3355.68] 12,000 pounds. But even as importantly,
[3359.28] the distinctive minology. Till very
[3362.079] recently, as mentioned, it was assumed
[3363.76] that the alter stone came from Wales,
[3365.839] part of the lithology known as the old
[3368.559] red
[3369.64] sandstone. But this work that was
[3371.68] published in October of
[3373.559] 2023 by a group of scientists, they
[3376.48] concluded that it was not from the from
[3379.68] Wales. So then where did it come from?
[3381.76] That's what led to this this new study
[3383.839] that was published in August. So this
[3386.16] interesting archaeological development
[3388.64] development from
[3390.52] 2024 with regards to Stonehenge is
[3393.2] prompting a reconsideration of
[3394.96] prehistory in the British Isles. And
[3398.16] this has resulted in a determination of
[3401.839] the providence or place of origin of the
[3404.72] stones, the type of stone used for the
[3408.0] so-called altar stone at Stonehenge.
[3410.319] Just to recap where we're at with this
[3412.92] thing, since history is usually assumed
[3415.599] to have begun with the invention of
[3417.2] writing in Egypt and Samaria, typically
[3420.24] dated to around 2600 to 2700 BC.
[3424.64] Anything earlier than that would be
[3426.96] considered prehistory. Okay? So, we're
[3429.2] now with the the first stages of
[3430.799] Stonehenge. We're back in prehistory.
[3433.04] We're back in the Neolithic or the New
[3436.319] Stone Age. So, let that image get in
[3438.88] your mind. the stone age we're talking
[3440.72] about even though it's the new stone age
[3442.72] we're talking about a stone age right
[3445.68] which carries the implications that
[3447.44] we're dealing with primitive cultures
[3449.839] okay so now the invention of writing
[3452.72] 2600 to 2700 BC in Egypt and
[3456.119] Samaria the main building campaign of
[3459.2] Stonehenge is going on at the same
[3461.599] period of time these two things are
[3463.28] happening simultaneously is there any
[3465.72] connection I'm not going to say that
[3467.76] there is Just noting that temporally
[3471.119] they are happening
[3473.24] concurrently. The date the century or
[3475.68] two to which we give the origins of
[3478.359] writing coincides precisely with the
[3481.839] major building campaign of Stonehenge.
[3486.319] These two things are happening
[3488.119] simultaneously. Okay. So in this study
[3491.68] the lead
[3492.76] author and leader of the investigating
[3495.44] team was Anthony Clark. He was with the
[3499.2] time scales of mineral systems
[3502.599] group with the school of earth and
[3504.88] planetary sciences in Australia and he
[3508.319] was working with a team of five others a
[3511.28] combination of earth scientists and
[3515.0] archaeologists. Clark himself is Welch
[3518.079] so he may have a preferred outcome of
[3521.119] this to show that the ultra stone did in
[3523.839] fact come from Wales. Authors begin
[3526.24] their report by saying that the that
[3528.24] Stonehenge or the Neolithic Standing
[3531.2] Stone Circle located on the Salisbury
[3533.52] plane in Wilshshire, England, offers
[3536.16] valuable insight into prehistoric
[3538.4] Britain. Construction at Stonehenge
[3541.44] began as early as 3000 BC with
[3544.319] subsequent modifications during the
[3546.559] following two millennium. The megaliths
[3549.44] of Stonehand are divided into two major
[3552.599] categories. The Sarsson stones and the
[3555.359] blue stones. As we talked about, the
[3557.92] larger Sars comprise what's called the
[3560.92] Duracrust Silcrete predominantly sourced
[3565.4] from Marlboro, which is approximately 25
[3569.319] kilometers north of Stonehenge, maybe
[3572.64] roughly 14 or 15 miles north.
[3575.96] So that's still a long way cuz these
[3578.799] these stones are huge and they weighed
[3581.2] many
[3583.0] tons. So there was earlier work that was
[3587.2] completed in 2023 that first called into
[3589.76] question however the origin of the altar
[3592.96] stone. So if the altar stone was not
[3595.76] part of the type of stone, the lithology
[3598.48] that came from Wales and it was not part
[3600.4] of the leth which was where it was
[3602.319] previously believed to have come
[3604.2] from. What kind of stone was it and
[3606.48] where did it come from? So it was in
[3609.2] this earlier work that was published in
[3610.88] October of 2023 that determined it was
[3613.52] not a part of the same stone from Wales.
[3619.839] Now, when did the altar stone itself
[3621.76] arrive is probably it's not really known
[3624.319] for sure. It was probably during that
[3626.559] first 500 years of the building
[3629.28] campaign. So, the here's what the Clark
[3633.76] and his colleagues had to say in their
[3635.68] paper about the altar stone. The central
[3639.76] megalith of Stonehenge, the altar stone,
[3642.319] is the largest of the blue stones, and
[3644.16] it measures in meters 4.9 by 1.0 by 5
[3651.079] by.5 m. Well, that works out to be about
[3654.88] 16 ft long, 33 ft wide, and
[3659.72] 1.64t thick.
[3662.28] Okay, it weighs about 12
[3664.92] tons. And it is of a, as they describe
[3668.16] it, a pale green micious sandstone with
[3672.72] a distinctive
[3675.48] minology. Distinctive minology. So that
[3678.24] should cause your ears to perk up right
[3680.16] there. It has a distinctive minology.
[3682.96] Hm. I
[3684.04] wonder what's distinctive about this
[3687.0] minology.
[3688.839] So, first thing keep in your mind, the
[3691.359] size and mass of this stone and the
[3693.119] weight. Okay. The second thing to keep
[3694.96] in mind the distinctive minology. What
[3698.4] about this distinctive minology? In the
[3701.44] BBC report that I referred to earlier,
[3705.2] it describes first the protocol and then
[3708.4] the results.
[3710.559] So these earlier scientists from from
[3714.079] 2023 compared the analysis of the altar
[3717.48] stone with 58 samples of old red
[3721.119] sandstone from across Wales and the
[3723.599] Welch borders. And then they found that
[3725.44] the alter's composition could not be
[3727.359] matched with any of them.
[3730.2] Right? But here's the interesting point
[3733.04] in
[3733.96] the BBC report. According to the
[3737.68] researchers, the altar stone contains a
[3740.88] lot of barerium, a kind of metal. The
[3745.52] university said this was
[3747.64] unusual and it could help reveal its
[3750.68] source. Well, because of the unusual
[3754.44] metallic composition of this rock, it
[3758.16] did indeed lead
[3760.28] to assist in finding its source.
[3764.079] So they used the Clark team used what's
[3767.04] called the very comprehensive global
[3770.559] rock fingerprint
[3773.559] database. Turned out that the closest
[3775.76] match to the prology of the ultra stone
[3779.119] was with rocks located in the Arcadian
[3781.839] basin in northeastern Scotland. This
[3784.48] raises some interesting
[3786.44] questions to say the
[3788.92] least. And they go on to say, the
[3791.839] authors say, "We posit that the altar
[3794.24] stone was anthropogenically transported
[3796.559] to Stonehenge from northeast
[3798.76] Scotland, consistent with evidence of
[3801.599] Neolithic inhabitation in the
[3804.76] region." One of the senior cur curators
[3808.72] working for the English Heritage, which
[3810.88] oversees and monitors Stonehenge,
[3813.039] Heather
[3814.2] Sabay, was compelled to comment this
[3817.2] quote. It is phenomenal that the people
[3820.4] of the time brought such a large stone
[3822.799] all this way. They must have had a
[3825.44] compelling reason to do it. In an
[3828.4] interview with f.org, Sabayer speculates
[3830.96] that Stonehenge isn't a settlement site,
[3833.52] but a place of ceremony or
[3836.76] ritual. Yes, I would agree. They must
[3840.079] have had a compelling reason for doing
[3842.16] this. And we might ask, what is the
[3845.119] nature of a ceremony or ritual that
[3848.16] requires a sixton stone being hauled
[3851.28] over 460 m? To simplify it, say it had a
[3856.559] ritualistic or ceremonial function, that
[3859.44] tells us nothing. I'd submit that it was
[3862.48] a the unique minological properties that
[3865.68] compelled these megalithic builders to
[3867.64] undertake such a daunting task, whether
[3871.039] by land or by sea.
[3874.0] But this opens a can of worms most
[3876.559] archaeologists are loathed to
[3879.16] acknowledge. It has been demonstrated
[3881.359] convincingly that these builders were
[3883.839] also astronomers. It's also obvious that
[3887.359] they were very proficient
[3891.88] engineers obviously to be able to quarry
[3895.359] cut and quarry and transport these
[3898.24] stones and erect these stones. Yes, they
[3900.48] had to have been highly accomplished
[3903.559] engineers. Also can make a very strong
[3907.44] case way beyond what I just presented
[3909.44] tonight that these people were
[3911.72] geometricians as well. They had a very
[3916.16] strong working knowledge of geometry.
[3919.839] Okay. Now, is it possible that we can
[3923.359] add to that list of attributes that they
[3926.319] were minologists as well or
[3929.559] geologists and that in addition to the
[3934.079] the geometry of the site, the the
[3938.559] orientation of the site, the
[3940.4] astronomical orientation of site, the
[3943.4] engineering capabilities of these
[3946.039] people? Are we now adding to that list a
[3950.68] geological component to this
[3953.96] mystery? And why are all of these
[3958.2] elements confluing in this one
[3960.64] particular
[3961.64] structure? I think this is a question
[3964.319] that needs to be asked. But like I just
[3967.2] said, this opens up a can of worms that
[3969.28] it seems like a lot of archaeologists
[3971.52] are loathed to acknowledge.
[3975.72] So the fact that they were
[3978.92] astronomers and
[3980.92] engineers and
[3983.64] geometricians, probably geographers as
[3986.0] well, and now possibly minologists or
[3989.64] geologists, I would say this is some
[3992.68] relatively serious conjecture that we
[3995.44] have
[3996.52] to consider around these questions that
[3999.76] are being raised. Who are these people?
[4002.96] What was their motive?
[4005.039] This
[4005.96] conjecture that's implied here carries
[4008.559] some seriously thought-provoking
[4010.839] implications. Perhaps the takeaway here
[4013.599] is that it's time to expand our thinking
[4015.44] and realize that the ancient ritualistic
[4018.079] functions of these forgotten people were
[4020.96] not predicated upon superstitious and
[4024.0] groundless beliefs. that they were not
[4027.119] just relegated to the category of
[4030.599] barbarians, stone age barbarians, but
[4034.079] that this structure evinces a
[4038.359] design that has a scientific rationale
[4041.52] to
[4042.76] it. So this leads us to a conjecture
[4046.079] I've been proposing for decades. The
[4048.64] sacred structures found all over the
[4050.72] world, all over the ancient world,
[4052.88] whether temples, pyramids, earthworks,
[4056.4] megalithic structures, cathedrals,
[4059.839] etc.,
[4061.119] exhibits such striking parallels in
[4064.4] design and function, reaching across
[4067.44] time and
[4069.0] space that I think we are justified in
[4074.28] speculating that these may have been
[4076.839] components of an archaic technology. A
[4080.64] technology that has been lost for
[4083.64] centuries, if not for millennia, and now
[4087.4] perhaps is on the verge of being
[4091.319] rediscovered. Thank you for joining me
[4093.52] tonight on this or this episode of
[4097.679] Squaring the Circle and I will see you
[4100.159] next time. I'm Randall Carlson. Over and
[4102.4] out.

Title: The Bonneville Flood & Hell's Canyon
[0.0] Remember Tam Bar, Tamin Bar along the
[2.399] Snake River. It's just north of the
[4.24] mouth of Hell's Canyon. So the last
[6.64] major significant flow or story of that
[10.32] Bonavville flood was its passage and
[12.719] undoubtedly its deepening of Hell's
[15.36] Canyon, which is deeper actually than
[17.359] Grand Canyon in places. Once it got out
[19.76] of there, you can see that it opens up
[22.08] considerably in that the basin that
[24.64] Lewon and Clarkston are. If you it
[26.8] actually is like in a bowl. And so once
[28.72] those flood waters of the Bonavville
[30.32] flood have come through and enlarged and
[32.719] downcut eroded Hell's Canyon, which was
[35.76] undoubtedly already there, but what
[38.079] would have happened is it would have
[39.44] been enlarged by 40 million cubic feet
[42.48] per second passing through there for
[44.399] maybe up to a year, up to a year perhaps
[47.76] because remember you had this huge
[50.48] inland sea almost of a lake in the
[53.92] Bonavville Basin in Utah where Great
[57.6] Salt Lake is now. And we saw evidence
[60.0] that you had this huge body of water
[62.399] almost 1,000 ft deep. It remember it
[65.28] dropped by 350 ft or so when it burst
[69.04] through that northern passageway. Now,
[71.92] how long did it take for that entire 350
[74.88] ft? Well, I've seen various estimates
[77.759] and it's all comes down to well, how
[79.6] fast was the water moving out? If it was
[81.439] moving out at a slower rate than a
[83.92] faster rate, it's going to take longer.
[85.84] But the range was somewhere I think
[88.4] initially maybe a year and then they
[90.88] realized that the flow rates were
[92.88] greater which actually would have mean
[94.56] implied that it was more catastrophic
[96.4] than they thought and so now the total
[99.28] duration of the lake emptying estimated
[102.32] between 3 and 6 months.

Title: Is CO₂’s Role in Warming Overstated?
[0.24] Not saying that humans don't have an
[2.879] effect on the climate because good lord
[4.48] we do. It's just overblown. It is the
[6.56] the role of carbon dioxide in the whole
[8.639] warming scenario is overblown. So why do
[11.599] you think carbon dioxide is the thing
[14.48] that they're tracking? Obviously people
[16.16] have economic incentive by this. But is
[19.359] there a reason they chose carbon dioxide
[21.6] levels? Oh yeah. It's totally not
[23.199] arbitrary. It's because you know carbon
[25.279] dioxide is the fundamental molecule of
[28.32] the whole process. There's talk about,
[30.24] you know, methane and talk about
[31.76] nitrogen, but carbon dioxide is the
[34.16] primary known greenhouse gas. So, you're
[36.8] starting from a well-known premise that
[38.879] carbon dioxide is a quote unquote
[42.239] greenhouse gas. In other words, it
[44.559] captures longer wavelengths and
[46.48] reraiates it to the earth, right? It has
[48.96] this sort of insulation or you almost
[51.039] think of it as a canopy because
[52.96] fastmoving radiation comes in and it's
[55.199] transparent. The atmosphere is
[56.8] transparent. comes in, it is absorbed
[59.359] into the solid mass of the earth and is
[61.359] reraiiated at a different wavelength. It
[63.6] is not transparent to carbon dioxide. So
[65.92] carbon dioxide then catches some of that
[68.08] and reraiates it back to the earth.
[70.479] There's a point at which that process
[72.96] ceases to function in any meaningful
[75.119] meaningful respect. And that's pretty
[77.439] much where we're at

Title: North America Was Ground Zero
[0.16] We can conclude pretty confidently that
[2.96] North America was ground zero in the
[5.44] younger dus. We can talk about why, but
[8.32] in order to understand why, it's
[10.24] necessary to look at a more detailed
[13.519] picture of the events. So, we haven't
[16.32] looked, for example, in the southwest.
[18.4] We haven't looked in the southeast. We
[20.08] haven't really looked in the northeast.
[21.92] The Dennisens of North America know that
[24.4] no matter where you live, the imprints,
[26.48] the evidence of these cosmic convulsions
[30.48] are all around you. They're in your
[32.48] backyard. You might be living right on
[34.239] top of them and not even know it. If you
[36.079] go to work and you're in a building made
[37.6] out of concrete, yeah, that concrete is
[40.559] uh pretty much the byproduct of, you
[43.68] know, reassembling the leftovers of the
[46.32] last or previous several global
[48.879] catastrophes.

Title: Russia’s “Altai Flood” Was as Big as Missoula
[0.08] Once the cold war ended and uh the
[2.56] Soviet Union ended up you know there
[4.24] began a lot more scientific exchange
[6.48] between the US and Russia and one of the
[9.679] outcomes of that was is the geology
[12.32] started getting access to a lot more of
[13.679] the geological studies from Russia and
[16.64] that's a big chunk of the earth's
[18.4] surface right people want to look it up
[20.64] it's called the Alai flood what do we
[22.64] start seeing there same thing there's a
[25.279] whole region up there that was subjected
[27.199] to flows catastrophic flows on the same
[31.199] scale as the Missoula floods. We're
[33.44] talking 700 800 million cubic feet per
[36.719] second and that's dated around the same
[38.719] time. Well, apparently, but I have
[41.44] recently gathered a lot of the available
[44.44] information and I've archived it and
[46.96] I've not yet gone through it, but the
[49.44] preliminary uh examination of this and
[52.64] the dating suggests that yeah, it was
[54.96] commensurate with the melting in North
[57.52] America. Wow, that would have been a bad
[59.44] period of time to be around.

Title: Where Two Ancient Superfloods Collided
[0.08] But here's the thing is that at Tam Bar,
[2.879] that's where the great Missoula flood
[5.04] met the Bonavville flood. And sorting
[7.279] out that relation between those two
[10.0] enormous hydraulic events, some of the
[12.719] most stupendous, epic hydraulic events
[16.64] in North America. Now, Missoula,
[18.96] remember, was actually one order of
[20.72] magnitude greater than Bonavville, but
[24.08] the Bonavville was still a very
[26.48] impressive flood, and it was focused. it
[29.199] w it tended to be more focused along a
[31.599] narrower area than the Missoula flood.
[34.399] It still did an enormous amount of very
[36.8] impressive geomorphic work in its
[39.239] passage. And in fact, that's what we're
[41.52] going to go in May. We're going to start
[43.52] in Lake Bonavville by Salt Lake and
[46.239] we're going to head north and we're
[47.76] going to go through Red Rock Pass, which
[49.76] was the outburst point. We're going to
[51.84] see where these waters poured through
[54.48] this aperture in the mountains and then
[56.8] we're going to follow that north. It'll
[58.559] cut to the west and it'll we'll see
[60.719] where it emerged out onto the Snake
[62.48] River plane. Then we'll follow the
[65.36] evidence from Pocutello where uh it
[68.4] discharges out onto the Snake River
[70.24] plane all the way to the southern mouth
[72.479] of Hell's Canyon.

Title: Have We Survived 10 Cataclysms Already?
[0.08] If that's true, what that means is that
[2.24] in a couple of hundred thousand years,
[4.24] our ancestors from time to time
[6.52] underwent multiple events because even
[9.679] if you set a timetable of every 10 or
[11.92] 20,000 years, well, boom. And we
[14.0] certainly have enough data in hand to
[15.44] think that a periodicity of impact
[18.08] events uh on the scale that could be
[20.88] major effects on civilization or on
[24.32] human species. Well, if those happen
[26.24] every 20,000 years, well, you can see
[28.16] we've got 10 of them in the time that
[30.32] our humans have been around. The younger
[32.0] driest event appears to have been most
[34.079] severe seems to have been the most major
[36.64] event like that that would that occurred
[38.0] on a global scale. However, all we have
[39.84] to we can look at the ice cores, we can
[41.52] look at sea level cores, we can look at
[43.2] tree rings, we can blah blah blah, we
[45.68] can go down the list of of proxies we
[47.6] can look at. They're all pointing to the
[50.16] fact that, you know, there have been
[51.84] multiple times when the normal nice
[54.92] sedate placid background change has been
[58.399] the order of the day when that suddenly
[60.239] gets interrupted and the whole realm of
[62.8] nature is just convulsed for a short
[65.519] period of time. And when the convulsions
[68.0] are over, there's a whole new regime
[70.56] that's settled into

Title: The Giant Flood That Rewrote Geology
[0.08] I believe and others I think are
[2.08] starting to believe that we're actually
[4.24] looking at some kind of an accelerated
[6.24] melting because for one thing the
[8.08] conventional explanations for this giant
[9.92] lake do not ever explain how that lake
[12.4] got there. So this is Montana. Yeah.
[15.28] Here we go. This would have been showing
[16.8] graphically kind of the configuration of
[18.8] the ice at the late glacial maximum.
[20.8] This would have been about 16 to 20,000
[22.8] years ago. Here you can see the two ice
[24.48] sheets, the Cordieran and the
[25.68] Laurentide. And this this is the area
[27.439] where the uh ice free corridor would
[29.599] have been. This box right here shows the
[31.84] area of the Missoula floods they're
[34.0] called. This would have been Lake
[35.28] Missoula and this would have been all of
[37.36] the area that we were just looking at
[38.96] where it's eroded. All that water would
[40.8] have come down flowed through the
[42.239] Columbia Gorge here. This Portland is
[44.32] right here would have turned north and
[46.32] right here at Atoria would have drained
[48.48] into the Pacific Ocean. This is
[49.84] basically configuration because Jay
[51.76] Harlon Brett who was the geologist who
[54.559] first theorized this. He was considered
[56.239] a crackpot because he was talking about
[58.16] giant floods back in the 1920s and 30s
[60.96] but of course he was proven right and
[63.28] end up being the recipient of the
[64.799] Penrose medal in his '9s. So he was the
[68.159] first one to speculate. Yeah. And what
[70.08] was his reasoning? Like where where did
[72.0] he see the evidence for the for some
[74.24] sort of a flooding? He was doing
[75.76] research along the Columbia River and he
[77.92] kept seeing evidence like these gigantic
[81.04] gravel bars and boulders and things that
[83.36] seemed out of place. This new
[85.36] topographic map came out 1910 and he was
[88.24] regularly getting maps. He loved to look
[90.72] at maps and he was looking at this
[92.159] feature and he said, "What the hell is
[94.479] the explanation for this?" And this is
[97.119] what started him on this quest. This
[98.88] thing right here, it's called Potholes
[101.28] Cataract. And pothole cataract is a
[103.759] giant erosional feature the edge of the
[106.32] basalt plateau and the water came from
[108.32] the right that is a result of what's
[110.079] called culking. When the water gets so
[112.36] turbulent that it's doing this like a
[115.079] tornado and it literally can drill into
[117.92] the rock in a matter of days it can
[121.439] drill and what you see here is the
[124.64] evidence of gigantic turbulence and this
[128.239] is called a recessional cataract. So, as
[130.319] the water pours over this and at the
[132.64] time the spiggots, the flood spiggots
[134.48] are turned off, you're now left with
[136.56] this fossil feature.

Title: Did We Redefine Climate Change?
[0.16] Let's say you get a heavy rainstorm and
[2.24] you get a 50 or 100redyear event. Well,
[4.4] now you go back and you're going to
[5.759] notice that there have been more changes
[8.32] made within 2 or 3 days than probably 20
[12.4] years. And that kind of happened in
[14.0] western North Carolina recently be an
[16.56] example. That would definitely be an
[18.48] example. To find an equivalent level of
[20.72] geomorphic work done on that region of
[23.439] North Carolina, I believe we have to go
[25.68] back 1916. And in 1916, there was uh an
[30.24] anomalous extreme weather event that was
[32.8] of an equivalent severity to what
[35.12] happened. The knee-jerk reaction to
[37.12] something like this among certain
[38.96] political factions is to blame this on,
[41.36] you know, climate change, which has been
[43.559] redefined to exclude everything except
[47.28] for anthropogenic climate change. That's
[49.6] how it's the the narrative has been
[51.92] contrived in order to redefine the
[54.719] terms. If you'd said climate change 25
[57.52] years ago, you could be talking about a
[60.16] whole spectrum of things. And anybody
[61.76] who was in a conversation or reading a
[64.32] paper or whatever that said climate
[66.439] change, they wouldn't just be thinking
[69.2] carbon dioxide and greenhouse warming,
[72.64] right? They wouldn't be thinking about
[73.92] global warming. You'd have to be
[75.52] thinking about a bunch of things. You
[77.36] might be thinking about ocean currents.
[79.36] You might be thinking about volcanic
[81.36] eruptions which can produce effects that
[84.56] can last for years. You might be looking
[87.119] at changes in solar radiation which was
[91.439] always considered to be a possibility up
[94.479] until the '9s, the 1990s. And then what
[97.439] happened? Well, solar science kind of
[99.84] got sidelined, right? Because the focus
[102.56] was on carbon dioxide. So the solar
[105.439] physicists and solar scientists are busy
[107.52] studying and learning a lot about the
[109.04] sun and realizing that the sun is a
[111.52] whole lot more dynamic than anybody had
[113.6] assumed a decade or two or three
[115.72] earlier. Although there were those who
[118.079] always were speculating and and seemed
[120.32] to draw a direct connection between what
[122.479] the sun was doing up there and what was
[124.399] happening in the in the world down here
[126.24] below in terms of climate change. All
[128.56] that had got excluded. See, with the
[130.239] politization of the climate science, the
[134.16] climate change science, uh, it all
[136.879] became directed towards anthropogenic

Title: Earth’s Annual Meteor Encounter
[0.08] Between the 3rd and 15th of November
[1.92] each year, the Earth runs through a
[3.36] meteor stream coming from a small area
[5.359] in the constellation of Taurus, the
[7.16] Bull. A young stream made up of meteors
[10.08] not long released from their parent
[12.08] comet would be narrow and probably
[14.799] strong, and the Earth would pass through
[16.88] it in a half a day or so. The Geminid
[19.68] meteor stream is one such, the Earth
[22.32] encountering it on the 10th of December
[24.24] each year and the shower being over by
[26.8] the 12th of December. The torid meteor
[29.84] stream on the other hand takes the earth
[32.079] 12 days to cross and it is not very
[34.96] intense. It looks old. It has two main
[38.0] branches northern and southern emerging
[39.92] from slightly different parts of the
[42.12] constellation. The branches being about
[45.2] equal intensity. Orbiting the torid with
[48.559] the torid meteor is a small comet
[51.36] discovered in 1818 by pawns. An orbit
[54.8] was calculated for this comet by Johan
[57.44] Enki, a pupil of the famous
[59.199] mathematician Gaus, who had developed a
[61.84] method for calculating the orbits of
[63.84] bodies from their movement across the
[66.159] sky. There are about a hundred known
[68.88] short period comets. All of these, with
[72.08] the sole exception of Anki's comet, are
[74.479] in orbits which sooner or later lead to
[77.52] a close encounter with Jupiter and
[80.0] ejection from the solar system by the
[82.799] powerful gravitational pull of that
[85.36] planet. But Ankkey's comet has somehow
[87.52] established itself in a stable orbit
[90.0] such that it never comes with the within
[92.64] the Jovian sphere of influence. It does
[95.52] however come close to

Title: The Frozen Beresovka Mammoth
[0.16] You showed some images also of what it
[2.24] looks like mammoths with broken legs.
[4.48] Yeah. That look like they had just been
[6.08] blown away by impact. Could have been
[9.04] like the the Barerasovka mammoth. I
[10.88] think that's the one I showed which was
[12.559] um a mammoth that was frozen in
[15.2] perafrost and it was a particular I
[17.279] think 1901 was a particularly warm year
[19.84] that year in in Siberia and there was a
[22.8] collapse of the ground that exposed this
[25.119] mammoth, right? and he was sitting on
[28.4] his honches and both of his hips were
[31.48] broken and he had food in his mouth and
[34.88] in his stomach. He'd been eating
[36.399] flowering plants. But now he was a six
[39.36] six tons in weight and even the contents
[42.719] of his stomach had not putrified which
[44.8] meant that it got frozen and the
[47.12] scientific study suggested that the
[49.039] entire carcass would have had to have
[50.48] been frozen within about 10 hours to
[52.48] prevent putrifaction of the material in
[54.879] the stomach. So, how do you freeze a
[57.36] six-tonon mammoth in 10 hours?

Title: Castle Bravo vs. Tunguska
[0.16] This was a Castle Bravo March 1st. The
[3.36] reason I'm using this is because it's 15
[5.359] megat ton explosion which is pretty much
[8.0] in the same ballpark as Tungusa. All
[11.28] this nuclear testing we did, there was a
[13.599] huge downside to it, but you know the
[16.24] the upside is is it gave us a lot of
[18.64] insight into the power of cosmic
[21.48] impacts. So, let me just play this and
[23.84] see what
[27.96] happens. There we go.
[36.17] [Music]
[45.8] Yeah. This is the largest uh bomb ever
[49.52] tested by the UN by the United States.
[62.32] Uh, this would have been probably the
[64.159] Marshall
[64.95] [Music]
[67.64] Islands. So, a lot of this is recently
[71.0] declassified within the last 5 to 10
[73.439] years, I
[78.28] think. Yeah. Even when I was like first
[81.92] grade, I knew this is ridiculous.

Title: The New Moon Race Has Already Begun
[0.08] If we can bring that spirit back, fuse
[2.24] NASA with the same spirit it had back in
[4.799] then, and we ally that with the private
[7.72] sector, we're going to see this thing
[10.16] really go. We're going to see it expand
[12.639] exponentially. And this is going to be
[14.559] an exciting thing in my opinion. Website
[17.279] NASA says that it's working with several
[19.279] American companies to deliver science
[22.16] and technology to the lunar surface
[25.039] through the commercial lunar payload
[27.199] services or clips initiative. These
[30.08] companies ranging in size and this is a
[32.32] good thing too because even some of the
[33.76] smaller companies are being given
[35.6] opportunities here bid on delivering
[37.92] payloads for NASA. This includes
[40.079] everything from payload integration and
[42.32] operations to launching from Earth and
[44.719] landing on the surface of the moon.
[46.8] Under Artemis, commercial deliveries
[49.039] beginning in 2023 will perform science
[51.68] experiments, test technologies, and

Title: What Melted the Ice So Fast?
[0.0] So one of the mysteries that actually
[1.6] began to be noticed in the early '7s was
[4.56] what is called the energy paradox advent
[7.2] of radiocarbon dating in the 1950s. What
[10.0] happened is you accumulated a couple of
[11.599] decades of radiocarbon dating. After a
[14.48] couple of decades, the geologists and
[16.72] the climatologists and so on, they're
[18.48] looking at that data and they're going,
[19.6] "Wait a second. Our old models of
[21.84] glacial period, the termination of
[23.6] glacial period were tens of thousands of
[26.24] years." Radiocarbon dating is now
[27.84] showing it happened way way faster than
[30.16] that. For example, radiocarbon dating
[32.48] showed that where the hell did all the
[34.48] energy come from to melt that much ice?
[36.48] Well, what is the greatest concentration
[38.879] of available thermal energy on the
[41.6] planet today to melt ice? Well, it looks
[44.239] like it's equatorial regions over
[46.16] equatorial oceans. Okay. So, if we
[48.079] applied that much thermal energy to
[50.0] these ice sheets, how long would it take
[52.16] to melt? 20 to 25,000 years to
[55.36] completely melt away.

Title: What You See Isn’t the Comet’s Tail
[0.16] Comets, a celestial body moving about
[2.399] the sun in an elongated orbit, usually
[5.12] consisting of a central mass, which is
[7.04] the nucleus, surrounded by a misty
[9.28] envelope, the coma, which extends into a
[11.92] stream, the tail, in the direction away
[14.4] from the sun. Now, the tail or the
[15.92] stream is a essentially a stream of
[18.24] ionized gas. It's not a debris stream.
[21.439] That's the the trail is the any debris
[24.64] coming off the comet. And that's
[26.16] different than the the tail, which is
[28.08] the ionized gas. So when you see a
[30.8] comet, the tail that you see in the sky
[33.12] is always pointing away from the sun.
[36.399] The architecture of the cometary zone in
[38.879] the solar system, we can think now that
[41.04] the solar system doesn't end at Pluto or
[44.239] Neptune. It continues out into the zone
[46.719] of comets. Originally, the Torid meteor
[50.16] stream or the the comet Anki was
[52.239] believed to be on a parabolic orbit, but
[55.12] then was later discovered by Fred
[57.039] Whipple to be on an elliptical orbit.

Title: Evidence of The Cataclysm That Destroyed North America | The Big Picture Ep 6
[0.16] Break free from this realm of
[2.12] superficiality and take the big picture
[4.799] in
[7.42] [Music]
[18.32] Becket. Um, you've been in contact with
[23.119] members of the comet research group. I
[26.0] would really like to get caught up to
[27.439] speed on that. Um, we could launch in
[30.48] like that and you start telling me about
[32.32] it and then you can tell me about Allan
[34.64] West and I can talk to you about how
[37.92] much I respect Allen West and the work
[39.92] he's doing and then we could Yeah. And
[42.96] he's going to be at the cosmic summit
[45.6] and then we could talk about that.
[48.239] Yeah. And I think how we can kind of
[49.6] start it off is be like, okay, well,
[52.079] over the last two episodes, we've been
[54.0] looking at how ice age floods are not
[56.96] just ge geological events, that they
[60.079] could be the gateway to us rethinking
[62.64] our entire civilization,
[64.96] which is kind of where we're going today
[66.72] with these comet impacts, cosmic impact
[70.56] events, or we could say cataclysmic
[72.4] events. And the Comet Research Group is
[76.08] kind of the leading I guess you I I
[79.28] guess they are. They are now. They I
[81.28] would say they're the they're the the
[83.119] tip of the spear when it comes to um
[86.0] doing major impact research right now as
[88.56] a as a coherent group rather than just
[91.079] isolated. A lot of people are doing
[93.28] research on on impacts. But the that's
[96.72] you know that organization is I think
[99.68] definitely laying down the most relevant
[102.64] and important information uh in our
[106.439] ongoing uh increasing knowledge of
[109.119] impact events. Uh primarily because what
[112.159] they're doing brings it home, puts it
[114.159] right in our lap, right? Rather than
[116.0] being something very interesting,
[117.6] profoundly interesting within the
[119.119] history of life and in the geological
[121.28] history of the earth and all of that,
[123.36] right? But it doesn't have that same
[125.52] direct bearing of and immediiacy onto
[130.64] the human level like the work of the
[133.44] comet research group. Because what this
[135.76] does is it just it opens the it opens
[138.319] those windows of heaven to this whole
[140.16] possibility that major impact events
[142.72] have occurred during the time the the
[145.04] the reign if you will of our species
[148.72] Homo sapiens sapiens. however long we go
[151.2] back. Um maybe a hund couple hundred
[154.48] thousand years maybe. It's sure starting
[156.64] to look like it. But uh so if that's
[159.92] true, what that means is that in a
[162.0] couple hundred thousand years, our
[164.599] ancestors from time to time underwent
[167.76] multiple events because even if you set
[170.48] a timetable of every 10 or 20,000 years,
[173.76] well boom, if even if you make it every
[175.44] 20,000 and we certainly have enough data
[177.12] in hand to think that that the uh
[179.599] periodicity of impact events uh on the
[183.12] scale that could be major effects on
[186.72] civilization or on human species, human
[190.0] and humans and other species. Well, if
[192.48] those happen every 20,000 years, well,
[194.48] you can see we've got 10 of them in the
[197.36] time that our humans have been around.
[199.28] Yeah, humans have been around and and
[201.599] it's 20,000 years now. The younger dest
[204.959] appears to have been the most most
[207.04] severe seems to have been the most
[209.72] recent major event like that that would
[212.0] that occurred on a global scale.
[214.08] However, all we have to do we can look
[216.08] at the ice cores. We can look at sea
[217.599] level cores. We can look at tree rings.
[219.84] We can blah blah blah da. We can go down
[221.68] the list of of proxies we can look at.
[224.159] They're all pointing to the fact that,
[226.56] you know, there have been multiple times
[228.56] when the normal nice sedate placid
[232.159] background change has been the order of
[234.64] the day when that suddenly gets
[236.159] interrupted and the whole realm of
[239.04] nature is just convulsed for a short
[241.76] period of time. And when the convulsions
[244.239] are over, there's a whole new regime
[246.879] that's settled into place. Yeah. And the
[249.92] Comet Research Group has kind of been
[251.28] the group that's been looking at places
[253.2] all over the world. So, we've focused a
[256.4] lot of our last two podcasts directly on
[259.6] the northern northwestern United States
[263.12] and Bonavville, Missoula flood regions.
[266.24] What other areas around the world are we
[268.72] going to explore for as evidence of a
[271.28] cataclysmic event? Oh, we've got plenty
[273.6] of places. And and what's emerging from
[276.4] this is we're we've kind of Yeah, we we
[278.72] essentially we're connecting the dots
[280.32] here. We we put a fairly dense cluster
[282.72] of dots up in the Pacific Northwest over
[284.96] the last two episodes. What I'd like to
[287.12] do now is put some more dots in other
[289.28] places around the the country. Uh and
[291.68] well, oh, let me say the continent. the
[294.08] continent particularly of North America
[297.12] and I think there's enough to uh enough
[299.28] evidence accumulating there now that
[301.28] yeah we can conclude pretty confidently
[304.56] that North America was ground zero in
[307.6] the younger dus I we we can conclude
[310.16] that I mean I I think that's pretty
[312.0] overwhelmingly clear and we can talk
[314.88] about why but in order to understand why
[317.84] it's necessary to look at a more
[320.56] detailed uh picture of the events. So,
[324.8] we haven't looked, for example, in the
[326.56] southwest. We haven't looked in the
[328.32] southeast. We haven't really looked in
[329.759] the northeast. So, I thought we should
[332.72] go some of these areas up in up into
[335.36] Canada and let these the Dennisens of
[337.84] North America know that no matter where
[339.919] you live, the the the imprints, the
[342.88] evidence of these cosmic convulsions are
[346.96] all around you. They're in your
[348.639] backyard. You might be living right on
[350.4] top of them and not even know it.
[352.96] And if you're if you go to work and
[354.72] you're in a building made out of
[356.0] concrete, yeah, that concrete is uh
[359.36] pretty much the byproduct of, you know,
[361.919] reassembling
[363.52] uh the the leftovers of the last or
[366.56] previous several global
[368.919] catastrophes because what's the you know
[371.039] what what goes into the primary
[373.12] ingredients of of um concrete is what?
[377.12] Well, the l the lime and the gravel.
[379.919] Yeah. The cement. Okay. Particularly the
[383.24] gravel when you I've been to probably 50
[386.96] gravel pits on my travels around, right?
[391.199] And you learn a lot from a gravel pit.
[394.639] But one of the things that is consistent
[396.72] about pretty much all of the gravel pits
[398.639] is they're all byproducts of enormous
[402.319] extreme upheavalss and
[405.56] catastrophes. Because what's the the
[407.68] primary byproduct of of a flood? Well,
[410.479] you get sediments. floods will you'll
[413.199] have the background flow which is you
[415.199] know in a normal river normal creek it
[417.12] might be vigorous but it's not
[418.8] catastrophic obviously and if you go to
[422.639] any creek uh or river and you walk along
[425.84] the the banks of the creek or river and
[427.919] you look at the channel and you look at
[429.36] the channel geometry it's not going to
[431.599] change much from year to year to year
[434.08] but then you might get a hundredyear
[435.68] event let's say you get a heavy
[437.28] rainstorm and you get a 50 or 100redyear
[439.68] event well now You go back and you're
[442.0] going to
[442.84] notice that there have been more changes
[445.759] made within two or three days than
[448.52] probably 20 years. And that kind of
[451.039] happened in western North Carolina
[452.639] recently. Yes. Be an example. That would
[455.36] Yes, that would definitely be an
[457.24] example. That's exactly what happened.
[459.599] And there was more geomorphic
[461.84] to to find an equivalent level of
[463.919] geomorphic work done on that region of
[466.639] North Carolina. I believe we have to go
[469.52] back to n Yeah, I'm pretty sure 1916.
[472.56] And in 1916, there was uh an anomalous
[476.479] extreme weather event. Yeah, check. I
[479.44] think that's the year Asheville. Put
[481.36] Asheville flood 1916.
[485.84] See if I'm I think I think I'm pulling
[488.8] this out of my memory from the great
[491.52] flood of 1916 in Asheville, North
[494.0] Carolina was a devastating event caused
[496.16] by two back-to-back hurricanes that
[498.319] dumped torrential rain leading to
[500.08] widespread destruction and the loss of
[502.24] at least 80 lives. Yeah. So that's what
[505.52] I'm referring to. So that was of an
[508.0] equivalent severity to what happened. I
[510.96] mean, so and there's your hundredyear
[512.8] cycle right there. There's your 100year
[514.32] cycle right there. Yeah. So, you know,
[517.279] the the the knee-jerk reaction to
[519.2] something like this among certain
[521.64] politically political factions is to
[524.08] blame this on, you know, climate change,
[526.64] which has been redefined to exclude
[530.08] everything except for anthropogenic
[532.399] climate change. That's that that's how
[534.8] it's the the narrative has has been
[538.0] contrived in order to redefine the
[540.8] terms. If you just said climate change
[543.12] 25 years ago, you could be talking about
[546.08] a whole spectrum of things. And anybody
[547.92] who was in a conversation or reading a
[550.48] paper or whatever that said climate
[552.519] change, they wouldn't just be thinking
[555.36] carbon dioxide and green greenhouse
[557.92] warming, right? They wouldn't be
[559.519] thinking about global warming. You'd
[561.279] have to be thinking about a bunch of
[562.64] things, right? You might be thinking
[564.64] about ocean currents. You might be
[566.56] thinking about uh you know changing uh
[569.68] you might be thinking about volcanic
[571.279] eruptions which can produce effects that
[574.56] can last for years. You might be looking
[577.12] at changes in solar radiation which was
[581.44] always considered to be a possibility up
[584.399] until the '9s the 1990s. And then what
[587.36] happened? Well, solar science kind of
[589.839] got sidelined, right? Because the focus
[592.48] was on carbon dioxide. So the solar
[595.44] physicists and solar scientists are busy
[597.519] studying and learning a lot about the
[599.04] sun and realizing that the sun is a
[601.44] whole lot more dynamic than anybody had
[604.04] assumed, you know, a decade or two or
[606.399] three earlier. Although there were those
[608.8] who always were speculating and and
[610.959] seemed to draw a direct connection
[612.56] between what the sun was doing up there
[614.8] and what was happening in the in the
[616.48] world down here below in terms of
[618.24] climate change. But all that got
[620.88] excluded. See with the politization of
[623.839] the climate science, the climate change
[627.12] science, uh it all became directed
[629.44] towards anthropogenic because
[631.12] anthropogenic is going to give the uh
[635.12] give um partisan
[638.519] factions control whether it's social
[641.76] control, political control or economic
[643.839] control. Because if you look at all the
[645.68] policies that were are being proposed to
[648.64] combat carbon dioxide driven global
[650.8] warming, they all have enormous economic
[653.2] consequences. And they they they favor
[656.16] favor a few. You definitely can see.
[658.24] Yeah, there are favored groups within
[660.959] that and the reallocation of money and
[663.04] resources towards addressing what I
[665.6] consider to be a completely
[667.959] overblown narrative that of of
[670.88] greenhouse global warming. Right. And if
[673.76] so you mentioned the volcanic you
[676.24] mentioned activity with the sun you
[677.76] mentioned volcanic eruptions they do
[681.04] impact the climate. So oh what you're
[684.079] saying is that anthropogenic clim
[686.48] anthropogenic effects on the climate are
[690.72] what's been overblown. Not that the
[692.24] climate doesn't change. Of course not.
[694.72] No. And and and I'm of course not saying
[698.64] that humans don't have an effect on the
[701.12] climate because good lord we do. It's
[702.8] just overblown. It's just overblown,
[705.519] right? It is. The the role of carbon
[707.279] dioxide in the in the whole warming
[710.399] scenario is overblown. So why do you
[712.8] think carbon dioxide is the thing that
[716.48] they're tracking? Obviously, people have
[718.399] economic incentive by this, but is there
[721.279] a reason they chose carbon dioxide
[723.44] levels? Oh, yeah. It's totally not
[725.04] arbitrary. It's because, you know,
[726.88] carbon dioxide is the
[729.639] fundamental molecule of the whole
[731.88] process. Um, yeah. I mean, there's talk
[735.44] about, you know, methane and talk about
[737.36] nitrogen, but carbon dioxide is the
[740.16] primary known greenhouse gas. So, you're
[742.88] starting from a a well-known premise
[745.2] that carbon dioxide is a quote unquote
[748.959] greenhouse gas. In other words, it it
[752.36] alters it captures longer wavelengths
[755.279] and rerairadiates it to the earth,
[757.04] right? It has this sort of insulation or
[759.68] you almost think of it as a canopy
[761.839] because the fastmoving radiation comes
[765.36] in and it's transparent. The the the oxy
[768.32] the the atmosphere is transparent. comes
[770.639] in, it was absorbed into the solid mass
[773.04] of the earth and is reraiiated at a
[775.12] different wavelength that um to which uh
[780.56] it is not transparent to carbon dioxide.
[783.279] So carbon dioxide then catches some of
[785.519] that and reraiates it back to the earth.
[788.48] But there's a point at which that
[790.8] process ceases to function in any
[793.2] meaningful meaningful respect. And
[795.44] that's pretty much where we're at now.
[797.6] And I mean, you would have to dump
[799.2] 10,000 parts per million into the
[801.88] atmosphere really to to And of course,
[804.639] like anything, if it's out of balance,
[806.8] yeah, it's not going to there's going to
[808.8] be negative consequences.
[811.12] But carbon dioxide, you know, at 406 410
[814.399] parts per million that it is right now,
[816.639] um, is still at the some of the lowest
[818.88] it's been in the whole Fannerizoic or,
[822.48] uh, period, uh, eon of visible life,
[826.639] which is what that means. The
[828.519] fannerizoic fins means light, zoic means
[832.24] life. So you light and life together
[835.04] give you fannerizoic. So we talk about
[837.6] the
[838.519] phenorizoic which is the the the great
[841.44] period of time earth history that
[843.199] engulfs life
[845.36] that started with the most primitive
[847.36] microbial life on one end and ended up
[850.399] with us on the other end. You and me
[852.959] sitting here having this conversation.
[854.959] That's a strange period of time, isn't
[857.04] it? Yeah. And then not to exclude what
[860.399] seven or eight billion other people.
[863.199] Yeah. Those those too, right? Well,
[865.6] yeah. So, um, I didn't mean to ramble
[868.88] there, but No, it's it's interesting. I
[871.44] I had questions for you about that. And
[873.12] sometimes I read the comments on this
[874.8] and it seems like people don't think
[877.04] that you believe that the climate
[878.88] changes or maybe that that term is just
[882.079] not really fair to use. It's a term. I
[885.92] think what we what we want to do is
[887.839] redefine that term. Let's do it. And
[890.88] because it is completely
[893.56] ridiculous to say that I'm you know I
[896.56] and I well he's a climate change denier
[899.839] and and it was getting called that
[901.76] prompted me to write a very long essay
[905.199] of like what 30 or 40 pages
[908.32] uh entitled who are the real deniers.
[912.16] Well the real deniers is not me. I
[915.04] because look do I is there anywhere that
[918.8] you see me any I challenge anybody find
[922.399] somewhere where I'm denying that the
[924.32] climate changes I mean now there is one
[927.72] um there is one one um recording of me
[931.92] I'm outside
[933.92] uh I don't it's been a few years now but
[936.32] I'm outside and I'm just I'm looking up
[938.079] at the sky and I'm waving my fist and
[940.88] I'm I'm shouting out I deny that you
[944.48] exist. I deny that climate changes.
[949.6] I did. Oh, no. So, obviously, we can't
[953.44] take anything you say moving forward
[955.36] serious. That's right. Because no matter
[957.839] it didn't matter with what force or or
[960.48] projection, um it did it didn't stop
[964.16] changing. Yeah. It just continued
[966.48] changing right on. So, you must have
[969.199] been wildly wrong then, apparently. So
[972.48] what are we going to do? Yeah. So
[975.759] anyways, yes, let's give that lie the
[979.279] rest that it deserves. I do not deny the
[982.079] climate changes at all. In fact, what I
[984.48] keep preaching about and talking about
[986.959] and ranting about is how much the
[989.68] climate changes and that we have to get
[992.399] the big picture of climate change and
[994.24] not just focus on one variable in a very
[997.04] complex equation.
[999.199] Right? And we looked at this every
[1000.959] single time we've talked about impact
[1002.88] events, too. You've shown the chart of
[1005.199] how much the climate changes. And when
[1008.16] you look at this small little window of
[1010.72] the last thousand years, it's very
[1012.88] difficult to get the big picture of just
[1016.079] how much the climate has changed. You've
[1020.24] Yeah. Well, okay. So we last time, just
[1024.799] to kind of pick up where we left off
[1026.88] from last episode and where we're going
[1029.28] with this climate change cosmic impact
[1031.559] conversation. Last time we kind of left
[1033.839] off at finishing looking at the
[1036.72] Bonavville and Missoula floods and
[1039.28] showing what had happened in Northwest
[1041.439] United States and in North
[1043.48] America. Are we exploring different
[1046.079] parts of America today? Are we I think
[1049.039] you are. they're going to be surprised
[1050.48] at some of the things that we look at.
[1052.559] But I I want to say that if if if
[1054.559] there's a takeaway from what we've done
[1056.72] so far, it's we we addressed I think we
[1060.0] did what even a couple of episodes to
[1061.76] the Missoula floods and we did one
[1064.24] episode to the Bonavville flood. Right.
[1066.48] What the takeaway is I want people to it
[1068.88] was like that that uh focus on remember
[1073.28] Tam Bar. Yes. Tam Bar along the Snake
[1076.799] River. It's just north of the mouth of
[1078.72] Hell's Canyon. So, the last major
[1082.799] uh significant flow or story of that uh
[1087.44] Bonavville flood was its passage and
[1089.84] undoubtedly its deepening of uh Hell's
[1094.32] Canyon, which is deeper actually than
[1096.24] the uh uh Grand Canyon in places. Right.
[1100.32] So, um once it got out of there, it it
[1104.16] you can see that it opens up
[1106.0] considerably in that the basin that uh
[1109.28] that um Lewon and Clarkston are if you
[1112.16] it actually is like in a bowl, right?
[1114.64] And so once those flood waters of the
[1116.48] Bonavville flood have come through and
[1118.32] and enlarged and downcut eroded um
[1122.799] Hell's Canyon, which was undoubtedly
[1124.799] already there, but what would have
[1127.52] happened is it would have been enlarged
[1129.84] by 40 million cubic feet per second
[1132.08] passing through there for maybe up to a
[1134.4] year, up to a year perhaps, but probably
[1137.76] closer somewhere between three and six
[1139.76] months because remember you had this
[1142.48] huge inland sea almost of a lake in the
[1146.72] Bonavville basin in Utah where Great
[1150.32] Salt Lake is now. And we saw evidence
[1152.799] that you had this huge body of water
[1155.12] almost 1,000 ft deep. it. Remember, it
[1158.0] dropped by 350 ft or so when it burst
[1161.84] through that northern passageway. Now,
[1164.72] how long did it take for that entire 350
[1167.64] ft? Well, I've seen various estimates
[1170.48] and it it's all comes down to, well, how
[1172.32] fast was the water moving out? If it was
[1174.16] moving out at a slower rate than a
[1176.72] faster rate, it's going to take longer.
[1178.64] But the range was somewhere I think
[1181.12] initially maybe a year and then they
[1183.6] realized that the flow rates were
[1185.6] greater. M which actually would have
[1187.84] mean implied that it was more
[1189.28] catastrophic than they thought. And so
[1191.679] now the total duration of the lake uh
[1196.08] emptying was I think estimated between 3
[1198.88] and 6 months. But here's the thing we
[1201.679] want to remember and then we'll move on
[1203.039] to the next po part of this
[1205.4] investigation is that at Tamony Bar
[1208.32] that's where the great Missoula flood
[1210.559] met the Bonavville flood right and
[1213.12] sorting out that relation between those
[1215.44] two enormous hydraulic events some of
[1218.799] the most stupendous epic hydraulic
[1222.679] events in North America now Missoula
[1225.919] remember was actually one order of
[1227.679] magnitude greater than Bonavville, but
[1231.76] the Bonavville was still a very
[1234.08] impressive flood and it was focused. It
[1236.799] w it tended to be more focused along a
[1239.28] narrower area than the Missoula flood,
[1242.24] right? So, it it it still did an
[1244.72] enormous amount of very impressive
[1246.559] geomorphic work in its passage. And in
[1249.919] fact, that's what we're going to go uh
[1252.159] in May. We're going to go and we're
[1253.679] going to actually with Brad, you know,
[1255.679] Brad Young, we're going to do we're
[1257.84] going to start in Lake Bonavville there
[1261.2] by by Salt Lake, and we're going to head
[1263.919] north and we're going to go through Red
[1265.679] Rock Pass, which was the outburst point.
[1268.4] We're going to see where these waters
[1270.559] poured through this aperture in the
[1272.559] mountains, and then we're going to
[1274.159] follow that north. It'll cut to the west
[1276.48] and it'll we'll see where it emerged out
[1278.72] onto the Snake River plane. Then we'll
[1281.2] follow the evidence from from Pa
[1284.2] Pocutello where uh it discharges out
[1287.039] onto the Snake River plane all the way
[1289.2] to the southern mouth of Hell's Canyon.
[1291.919] And we'll follow that whole route
[1294.4] looking at the evidence and the
[1295.919] different kinds of evidence in the
[1297.52] landscape that and so by the time we get
[1299.76] to the end of it anybody who
[1301.039] participates in it is going to have a
[1302.64] pretty good idea of a cross talked about
[1306.72] over the last two episodes and it's like
[1309.6] you know what it's like here's an
[1311.12] analogy I'd like to you know if you go
[1312.88] spend two weeks in France I I know like
[1315.12] when I did I came away you know with
[1317.039] some I could carry out a very
[1320.0] rudimentary conversation
[1322.4] I come back come away with some uh some
[1325.039] French vocabulary, right? Uh if I see,
[1328.88] you know, I'm meeting some lady and she,
[1331.679] you know, has a oh a a
[1334.84] young I would say
[1340.88] don't do it to the ladies, Randall.
[1343.52] Don't start speaking French now.
[1346.799] But most of my French I forgot. But
[1348.96] here's my here's what I'm getting. Okay,
[1350.64] you go hang out somewhere people are
[1352.48] talking and you listen and you try to to
[1355.28] learn. Yeah. You're going to soon start
[1357.12] picking up the vocabulary. That's what
[1358.72] this is like. Are you just to be clear,
[1360.96] are you comparing yourself to a
[1362.32] beautiful French woman? And no, I'm
[1364.159] comparing myself to a suave deonire
[1367.039] French playboy. Okay, there we are.
[1369.6] There we are. That's more fitting, isn't
[1371.919] it? I guess. I guess. Well, hopefully
[1374.559] people learn as much by paying attention
[1377.6] to the do the swab debonire French
[1380.88] gentleman. Yeah. Well, you know, because
[1384.0] I am the Okay, so I'm half Swedish,
[1387.2] right? But the next uh most
[1390.919] predominant national ethnic nationality
[1394.08] is French. Yeah. My mother's uh mothers,
[1398.96] their whole line of family was the
[1400.679] Pettits, immigrants from France. Oh,
[1403.28] okay. Yes. My my mother my mother's
[1406.799] mother was a pettit and a lot of the
[1409.84] French settled in Louisiana.
[1412.72] You might have known that. So your
[1414.559] background is at least partly French,
[1418.08] Swedish, French. Yeah, I would say it's
[1421.52] Swedish is the big one and French is the
[1423.44] next one. And then a mix of some other
[1426.32] some Welch. We there's some Welch in
[1428.64] there, some Cherokee Indian because we
[1431.679] have two lines of the family, the Derens
[1434.32] and the Pettits when they came to
[1435.84] Georgia both intermarried with the
[1437.44] Cherokee. And I forget the exact, but I
[1439.36] mean it's it's back there. It's so small
[1442.48] like maybe a 32nd. I don't think it's
[1444.799] more than a 32nd, but they actually show
[1447.679] up in our family tree. I got an aunt
[1450.559] that that did the whole thing on that
[1453.039] side of the family. And we had a family
[1455.12] reunion. This is 25 years ago. I could
[1457.279] see at least my mother's side of the
[1459.76] family. Yeah. Father, I don't know. But
[1463.2] but one thing I I I don't really know
[1465.52] any of my, you know, beyond my uh my
[1469.6] grandfather who was an immigrant from
[1471.279] Sweden. He came over uh from Sweden in
[1474.4] in about 1910 and he was 15 or 16 years
[1478.88] old and then he never went back. But I
[1481.919] have a a a an uncle, not a an uncle, a a
[1485.919] cousin, second cousin. He was my dad's
[1488.559] cousin. All right. Okay. So, my dad's
[1490.76] cousin went back to uh to Sweden where
[1495.52] my grandfather came from and he found
[1498.4] out that my grandfather had a what was
[1502.0] like a nephew. I think that was what it
[1504.0] was, a nephew over in
[1505.96] Sweden. And the nephew was the same age
[1508.72] as my dad. And so I guess him and my dad
[1512.72] would have been like I don't know second
[1514.32] cousins, third cousins somehow. I I I I
[1516.88] forget the exact geometry of it, but uh
[1521.12] he came back. He said, "Well, I met your
[1522.88] uh your cousin over there." I think they
[1524.4] were cousins maybe. Anyways, I met your
[1526.0] cousin over there, you know, cuz he was
[1527.279] the same age as my dad and he had three
[1529.44] sons and the three sons were all the
[1532.32] same ages as as me and my two brothers,
[1535.44] which was weird. What are the odds of
[1537.52] that? I know. That's what I wondered.
[1539.679] What are the odds of that? I I have no
[1541.6] idea. But he said it was pretty weird.
[1544.0] There's a mirror there's a mirror
[1545.84] picture of the Carlson family living in
[1548.159] Sweden.
[1549.72] Yeah. So somewhere I've got like these
[1552.559] second or third cousins over there.
[1554.24] There's this family with the with the
[1556.72] dad same age as my dad and he's got
[1558.72] three sons. So yeah, and they're the
[1561.679] same age as myself and my two younger
[1563.919] brothers. Anyways, that's very
[1565.36] interesting. Very interesting. It is
[1567.279] interesting and an interesting little
[1568.64] sidlight and I will say that you know my
[1570.64] grandfather coming over that was post
[1573.679] glacial meltdown because you know Sweden
[1575.679] was completely covered in in glaciers in
[1578.159] ice during the late it called the
[1582.12] Wellian it's the counterpart to the
[1584.6] Wisconsin but during the Welian in
[1587.84] Europe northwestern Europe all of
[1590.4] Scandinavia was buried when was that how
[1592.88] long ago well that was same period of
[1594.799] time and it's and its
[1597.0] catastrophic destruction and melting was
[1599.84] occurring apparently at the same time as
[1602.559] the as the ice complex over North
[1605.679] America.
[1607.44] Yeah. Which is interesting. And we're I
[1610.159] I'm not prepared to go there yet, but we
[1613.039] need to look because there's a lot of
[1614.4] new information that's come out. Plus a
[1617.679] lot of information since the end of the
[1620.0] Cold War. And of course, all of that got
[1622.24] subverted with all this stupid
[1624.0] geopolitics that that these idiots that
[1627.279] are in charge are stirring up. But once
[1631.36] the cold war ended and uh the Soviet
[1633.919] Union ended up, you know, there began a
[1635.679] lot more scientific exchange between the
[1638.4] US and Russia. And one of the outcomes
[1641.039] of that was is the geology started
[1643.6] getting access to a lot more of the
[1644.88] geological studies from Russia. That's a
[1648.0] big chunk of the earth's surface, right?
[1650.24] Yeah. Well, what what's what do we start
[1652.559] seeing there? Same
[1654.279] thing. Alte Mountains, there's there's
[1656.88] there's a whole region up there that was
[1659.279] subjected to
[1660.6] flows, catastrophic flows on the same
[1663.76] scale as the Missoula floods. We're
[1666.0] talking 700 800 million cubic feet per
[1669.36] second. Yeah. So, and that's dated
[1672.159] around the same time. Well, apparently,
[1674.88] but that's I I have recently gathered a
[1677.919] lot of the available information and
[1680.64] I've archived it and I've not yet gone
[1682.88] through it, but the preliminary uh
[1686.0] examination of this and the dating
[1688.159] suggests that yeah, it was commensurate
[1690.559] with the melting um in North America.
[1695.12] Wow. That would have been a bad period
[1696.88] of time to be around. Yes, it would
[1699.279] have. Yes, it would have. It's you could
[1701.12] People want to look it up. It's called
[1702.24] the Al Thai flood. Al T ai. Al Thai
[1704.96] flood. But we we it maybe even in the
[1708.0] next episode we'll talk about that that
[1710.32] we record. Um that'll give me a little
[1712.72] time to put together a presentation.
[1715.12] I've got some images and some graphics
[1717.36] and maps and things that would of course
[1719.44] be uh very helpful in getting the
[1721.919] picture. But I think that the thing to
[1725.039] understand is that yeah, what what's
[1727.6] happening is we're discovering that this
[1731.0] this story, if you will, is definitely
[1734.64] planetary in its scale and it's left
[1737.679] imprints that once you know how to read
[1740.0] them,
[1741.6] uh to decipher them are are embedded in
[1745.36] the whole planet in the in in various
[1748.0] ways. some places subtle, some places
[1751.279] extreme,
[1754.36] but we're at a position now where we can
[1758.0] actually begin to read this stuff
[1760.799] because, you know, 50 years ago, we
[1763.039] didn't have LAR. We didn't have ground
[1765.52] penetrating radar. We didn't have um
[1768.88] digital elevation maps and models like
[1771.84] we have now. We didn't have the data of
[1774.399] tree ring uh um climate changes. We
[1778.64] didn't have the the ice cores like we
[1781.36] have now that have been analyzed. We
[1783.279] wouldn't didn't have the the seafloor
[1785.559] cores. Um it goes on and on. Yeah. Well,
[1790.08] I have to ask Randall because you're
[1791.76] talking about the technology that we
[1793.36] have recently. Did you see what has kind
[1797.2] of happened? I would be very surprised
[1798.88] if you haven't seen the scans, the new
[1800.72] scanning technology that they used for
[1803.2] the pyramids. I'm sure people want to
[1804.96] hear what your p perspective is on the
[1808.6] underground supposed underground
[1810.96] structures and tunnels that Well, I I'm
[1813.6] going to record something next week
[1815.039] where I talk about it in more in depth,
[1817.12] but for now just I don't want to get too
[1820.159] sidelined from what I actually had
[1821.84] prepared, but good question.
[1824.039] Um basically what we can show in terms
[1827.36] of you know uh global changes and uh
[1832.08] mega floods is we can show that pretty
[1834.559] much every place on earth has at one
[1836.559] time or another been subject to extreme
[1839.679] pluvial events and that includes North
[1843.039] Africa. it includes Egypt. And you know
[1845.84] that became apparent back in the 1980s
[1849.279] with the the the uh oh what is it? The
[1852.72] uh the shuttle radar
[1855.24] um that first was able to peer through
[1857.919] the sand sheet there in the Sahara
[1860.24] Desert. Um and what they were able to
[1863.919] see under the sand was a whole network
[1867.84] of erosional features that had been
[1871.2] carved by running water.
[1873.44] Uh so it's become very apparent since
[1876.799] the late 1980s. I think this first
[1878.72] shuttle overflight that imaged this was
[1880.799] in I think it was 1988. Um I could
[1884.64] actually pull it up on break except I am
[1886.559] going to do a more uh more comprehensive
[1889.36] more comprehensive. Okay. Then we also
[1892.399] have like the Nile Valley, the Nile
[1895.84] canyon we'll refer to it because the
[1897.84] valley when you think of the Nile and
[1900.159] you talk about the Nile Valley, you're
[1902.32] looking at this nice fairly level layer
[1905.6] of alovvium that that the you know that
[1907.76] the all the agriculture of Egypt is
[1909.919] being undertaken on in the Nile Valley
[1913.039] on these nice flood terraces and you
[1916.24] know the whole uh history of Egypt and
[1919.12] why it was able to uh emerge from the
[1922.64] barbarian backdrop in that particular
[1924.88] area was because of the fertility of the
[1926.96] Nile Valley and the the fresh soil top
[1930.96] soil that was deposited during these w
[1933.84] these uh Nile River floods that came
[1936.559] every year almost like clockwork uh but
[1940.08] maybe with some important disruptions to
[1943.039] that process as a matter of fact but for
[1945.76] the most part yeah coming like clockwork
[1948.88] and the the the clock that was used to
[1951.76] time it. It coincidentally was this
[1954.399] relationship, this correspondence
[1956.559] between what's happening here below in
[1959.84] in on the planetary surface with the the
[1962.48] the annual flooding of the Nile because
[1965.2] that was um sub that was a result of the
[1968.32] monsoon rains over um the southern
[1972.0] highlands in the headarters of both the
[1973.84] Blue and the White Nile. So those rains
[1976.64] um would come in and then you'd have
[1979.6] that flow north. Flow north. Now you
[1981.919] picture in the Nile it's flowing north.
[1984.039] Um and um good to put that conspiracy to
[1987.519] rest. Put that conspiracy to rest. That
[1990.159] uh yeah that it's that the direction of
[1993.44] the Nile River was mysteriously reversed
[1995.76] last night. Hey, do you guys know that
[1997.44] if you go and look at what AI says, it
[2000.48] says the Nile River flows from south. I
[2004.0] mean, from from north to south,
[2007.039] somebody needs to retrain that AI.
[2009.36] Somebody needs to retrain that. Now,
[2011.44] it's going to hear this and somebody's
[2012.88] going to look and it's going to be fixed
[2014.399] by the time. South to north. It flows
[2017.039] south to north. It flows into the
[2018.559] Mediterranean. It starts in Ethiopian
[2022.08] highlands, flows north. Now, here's the
[2024.96] thing I wanted to get at back to the
[2027.12] question you asked. Um, so you got this
[2030.08] va nice verdant valley, you know, lush,
[2033.84] you know, the river comes through even
[2035.2] during the flood. It's it's somewhat
[2037.2] vigorous, but it's still, you know, a
[2039.76] pleasant do well doiciled river, right?
[2043.48] Um
[2045.08] well the thing of it is is that if
[2048.159] you're standing there next to the actual
[2049.919] river you're standing on top of a column
[2052.399] of alovvium that includes both material
[2055.839] washed down from the
[2057.399] highlands but also marine material
[2060.159] that's been backwashed up from the
[2063.96] Mediterranean. Right? If you were to now
[2066.879] scoop out the infill, the sedimentary
[2070.2] infill, you'd be looking at a canyon
[2073.52] 6,000 7,000 in in some places even 8,000
[2077.599] ft
[2080.44] deep. It's a gigantic deep gash in the
[2084.52] earth. But it has also served as a
[2087.679] repository for the infill of all of this
[2090.24] material that has been washed into it.
[2093.44] And the material that's been washed into
[2095.119] it is material that's been
[2097.16] carried stripped from the the uplands,
[2100.48] stripped from the ground above, carried
[2103.44] in flood waters. That flood water has
[2105.76] become channelized and most likely
[2108.44] repeated catastrophic floods
[2111.8] down that that slot right that
[2116.079] discharges into the eastern
[2118.16] Mediterranean.
[2119.92] Well, this process began when for
[2123.359] whatever reason and however we explain
[2126.359] it, the waters of the
[2129.32] Mediterranean dried up. The whole
[2132.119] Mediterranean disappeared. I think
[2134.72] between five and seven million years ago
[2139.44] and at some
[2141.079] point the ra the Atlantic Ocean which
[2144.24] was barricaded and I haven't I haven't
[2146.88] studied the most recent research on this
[2149.92] the Xan Clean flood was when the when
[2154.079] the the the dam if you will at the
[2157.68] Straits of Gibralar burst and the waters
[2160.72] of the Atlantic poured in and filled the
[2165.68] Mediterranean basin. But when it was
[2168.8] dry, if you were down on that floor,
[2171.04] which I think was like a mile lower than
[2174.4] the the the ocean surface now, and you
[2177.2] were standing where the Nile Delta is,
[2181.119] right? And you were looking south, you
[2183.839] would have been looking at basically a a
[2186.96] canyon that was as deep as the Grand
[2190.0] Canyon in front of you. And that is
[2193.04] what's now filled with sediment. And
[2194.88] that's the the Nile Valley. And coming
[2198.079] that sediment spllays out from the Nile
[2200.4] Valley and forms the delta. And then the
[2203.2] delta transitions to below sea level,
[2205.68] right? But that whole delta is now being
[2207.92] used for agriculture and so on. Um and
[2210.48] was was inhabited in Neolithic times. Um
[2214.24] but see PE so here here's the point.
[2217.76] There's been enough
[2220.0] erosion of that
[2222.119] limestone and it's mostly limestone. The
[2225.04] Giza plateau is is mostly limestone.
[2227.28] Eocine limestone, thick
[2230.359] limestone. The point is that we have
[2232.72] evidence, growing evidence that there
[2234.48] have been enormous flows of water over
[2237.839] the surface of what is now the Sahara
[2240.079] Desert, including Libya and western
[2242.72] Egypt. Right. Some of that water
[2245.599] undoubtedly discharged through the Nile.
[2248.0] Some of it probably discharged straight
[2250.0] north into the Mediterranean basin by
[2252.56] various routes, right?
[2255.72] Um, and we have evidence of enormous
[2259.359] amounts of erosion. Now, that channel
[2262.48] that I just described and talked about,
[2265.04] I mean, that's just within, you know, a
[2266.72] few hundred yards of the edge of the
[2269.04] plateau there where the pyramids are.
[2271.119] Mhm. So, here's what I'm getting at is
[2274.16] that it would be perfectly believable
[2278.24] that there could
[2279.64] be caverns, cavities, caves, some of
[2283.839] them pretty large,
[2285.88] uh, honeycomb through the limestone
[2288.92] bedrock under the pyramids. Now, at this
[2292.72] point, I would not be willing to go any
[2295.119] further than that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I
[2298.079] think it's worth it to show the actual
[2300.16] scan because most people who are talking
[2303.119] about this have just seen like this 3D
[2305.8] artistic depiction of what this scan
[2309.04] could be. And this is Janna James post.
[2311.52] Yeah. Shout out to Janna. It it is an I
[2314.64] mean, I look at that and I go, okay,
[2316.8] what actually is this showing? And and
[2319.359] I'm not prepared to go from the image on
[2321.359] the left to the image on the right. No,
[2323.44] it's a jump. It's a huge jump. Now there
[2327.28] is
[2328.92] uh uh there is examples of very
[2334.04] large shaftlike caves. Let's see what
[2337.44] there's one right there along the coast
[2339.04] of Libya to the
[2341.48] um let's see I can tell you what it is
[2344.32] here.
[2346.2] Um let's see here. Uh so further
[2349.2] investigation is needed and you're going
[2350.96] to be making a more comprehensive video
[2352.88] about this for people. Yeah. I mean, I
[2355.28] wanted to talk in more detail about the
[2357.44] the the Zantan event and the um yeah,
[2361.28] and and the erosion and what might that
[2363.359] have to what that might how that might
[2366.56] be related to the controversy about the
[2368.88] age of the
[2369.96] Sphinx because clearly, you know, the
[2373.839] the the uh controversy with the Sphinx
[2376.72] was well, does the Sphinx u have
[2380.88] evidence of major water erosion?
[2384.56] Well, if it does, then you have to go,
[2386.64] okay, when was there enough water
[2389.04] available to erode to to create that
[2392.16] level of erosion? And you know, when I
[2395.359] went there, what I saw was that they've
[2399.28] been doing so many reconstruction
[2401.28] campaigns, restoration campaigns on the
[2403.8] Sphinx that it's hard to determine what
[2406.56] was the original, you know, if they had
[2409.119] not done any restoration campaigns in
[2411.359] the recent centuries or even even, you
[2413.839] know, uh, in in older times, what would
[2417.119] we be seeing? You know, because you look
[2419.28] at it and a lot of what you're seeing is
[2421.119] restored masonry. So it I think perhaps
[2425.04] kind of misleading, but if you look at
[2427.2] the walls of the ditch around it,
[2430.8] nobody's tried to restore those that and
[2434.0] to me that's now almost more valuable
[2437.119] than the Sphinx itself because clearly I
[2440.72] mean I I think mean it has in every way
[2443.52] it it's consistent with water
[2445.72] erosion. And that's my opinion on that.
[2448.32] And I' I know there are others who have
[2450.48] other opinions such as
[2453.32] um you know, groundwater sapping and
[2456.319] things like that. But I think I think
[2458.16] there's enough evidence to suggest that
[2460.0] it was a that it was a surface flow,
[2463.04] that it was an overwash, that it was a
[2464.96] sheet wash moving over the thing. It was
[2468.16] probably coming from the from the west
[2470.8] because that goes up in elevation. And
[2473.2] that would be consistent with the fact
[2475.68] that there are uh channels insized into
[2479.52] the bedrock under the sand sheet. That
[2481.76] was the whole importance of and value of
[2485.04] the shuttle overflights is because for
[2487.04] the first time we're able to peer
[2488.96] beneath the sand and see that that the
[2491.599] bedrock under the sand is all completely
[2494.76] channeled paleo channel you would call
[2497.359] it with uh evidence of overland sheet
[2502.28] floods washing over uh what is now
[2506.16] pretty much the Sahara
[2508.2] Desert which I think would be have to be
[2511.839] attributable to pluial events and that's
[2514.72] what they're calling them like pluvial
[2516.24] period which means
[2517.56] rainfall. Question is is to now refine
[2521.28] that. You could say okay there was a
[2523.359] broad span of 3,000 years or 5,000 years
[2526.72] where rainfall was more plentiful than
[2529.52] now. And that's absolutely the case
[2532.72] because we can see the evidence of when
[2536.319] the Sahara was basically green and
[2539.68] occupied and had lakes. So obviously
[2542.24] that was a very different climatic
[2544.359] regime. So I find it really rather
[2547.839] ironic that one could be talking about
[2550.24] such things on that scale, climate
[2552.72] changing on that scale, and yet have
[2555.44] someone accuse you of being a climate
[2557.52] change denier. I just find that very
[2560.2] interesting. Um well I So here's Did you
[2564.079] find I was going to I was going to um I
[2566.72] wish I could remember the name of that
[2567.92] cave because I want to put it it's a
[2569.359] good example. You said in Libya. It's in
[2572.4] Libya right along the north coast. It's
[2574.88] actually one of the deepest caves in the
[2576.92] world. Uh or biggest caves in the world.
[2581.28] That might be the one I'm thinking of.
[2583.28] Yeah. Well, there are there are caves,
[2585.68] very large caves.
[2588.52] um that actually exists. So I guess the
[2591.44] point I'm I'm I'm I'm getting at here is
[2593.599] that yeah, all the pieces fit for, you
[2597.2] know, enough erosion taking place over
[2600.0] this terrain that there could be large
[2601.92] cavities and
[2603.96] caves, you know, and but the question
[2607.68] is, is that what this uh synthetic
[2611.599] aperture radar is showing? I don't know
[2613.52] what that is. Yeah, it sure looks, you
[2616.56] know, uh well, the go pull that back up
[2620.0] again and look and you look that
[2625.24] um the central one there looks like it
[2628.0] has the most coherent organization to
[2630.079] it. That one right there. Yeah.
[2635.839] Well, I want to see more evidence. I
[2637.76] want to see some I want to see some peer
[2639.52] review. I want to see some independent
[2642.319] uh
[2643.72] corroboration. Uh I just want to see
[2645.76] more studies because I look at that and
[2647.44] I go, "Yeah, I mean, what the hell is
[2649.119] that?
[2650.8] Is it natural?" That's a great question,
[2653.2] isn't it? That's the question we should
[2654.64] be asking. Yeah. What the hell is that?
[2657.2] Now, here's if it wasn't entire maybe
[2661.92] it's something that could have been
[2664.04] natural and then got modified because we
[2666.88] see many examples of that. You start out
[2669.599] with a cave and you enlarge it. You you
[2672.599] remove you resculpt it into
[2675.96] a Yeah. So it could very well be natural
[2679.359] cavities that were then modified. Mhm.
[2682.72] But then you have to get access to that.
[2684.319] I mean and certainly caves you could be
[2686.319] looking at going down thousands of feet.
[2690.56] So if you had natural caves now, could
[2692.319] it be that there are connections, there
[2695.68] are entrances to those caves, but
[2697.359] they're within or under the pyramids?
[2701.28] I mean, now that's not so pl you know uh
[2705.04] um implausible. No, it's not
[2707.359] implausible. And what um uh you know uh
[2711.28] Oh, Andrew Collins, he wrote a book
[2713.359] about that. Yeah, I haven't read it yet,
[2715.2] but now I want to check it. So he might
[2717.119] have been kind of ahead of the game on
[2718.48] this. Yeah, Andrew B. Collins. There we
[2720.16] go. He's with Shock and Armon.
[2723.56] Uhhuh. So he was proposing that there
[2726.0] were caves under the Giza
[2728.52] Plateau. But that's I mean that's
[2730.56] something I've thought for a long time.
[2732.4] I mean when I first learned about um
[2735.76] reading about the uh article they it was
[2739.359] on the SEMA Selma Sandhee. Pull up
[2743.48] sea salma sand sheet mapping. Yeah.
[2748.0] Paleo hydrography. Look at that. Paleo
[2750.68] hydrography in deserts. Spaceborn
[2754.0] imaging radar. That's your SRI. Here's
[2758.16] the abstract of a paper. Paleo drainage.
[2761.04] There we go. in the Selma sand sheet
[2764.48] were determined using high resolution
[2766.319] multi-wavelength multipolarization
[2768.48] spaceorn imaging radar
[2771.4] data and the global land onekin base
[2776.2] elevation project digital elevation.
[2779.72] Okay. Yeah. Okay. There we go. The
[2782.4] combined use of these two data sets
[2784.319] shows that both large flood features and
[2787.839] later superimposed drainage channels of
[2790.72] var variable morphology all drain
[2793.839] northeast and eastn northeast from
[2796.88] northwest Sudan toward the car
[2799.44] depression in southern Egypt. Okay, this
[2802.88] is actually not the particular study I
[2804.8] was referring to, but it's I mean it's
[2806.64] the same thing. It's just showing again
[2809.76] that hidden beneath the surface are
[2813.48] these is this whole landscape showing a
[2817.119] completely different Yeah, let's see.
[2820.24] Yeah, these directions are opposite to
[2822.079] those of the transaffrican drainage
[2824.0] system model in which the large flood
[2825.92] features are considered to flow
[2827.839] southwest across northeastern Africa
[2830.48] into the Chad basin. Uh internal
[2833.68] drainage operated in the gentleman.
[2835.76] Okay. Okay. So, when I hear that, when I
[2837.359] hear that they're opposite in direction
[2839.52] of that, it makes me think that there is
[2842.24] some type of and this could just be my
[2843.92] ignorance, but it makes me think that
[2845.04] there's some type of massive force of
[2847.599] water going the opposite direction than
[2849.68] what we see today. Yeah, it's one you
[2852.72] could Yes, you could look at that way.
[2854.079] In fact, I my first impression would be
[2857.119] is once we're understanding the the
[2859.599] magnitude and how dynamic these uh paleo
[2863.2] hydraulic events are, we have to begin
[2865.76] to realize, oh my god, we're we're
[2867.44] looking at sometimes where you can have
[2868.8] a maybe a cataclysmic flow in one
[2870.96] direction followed by a cataclysmic flow
[2873.52] in a completely different direction. But
[2876.079] how do you explain that? Well, I mean,
[2877.76] you know, in terms of tsunami deposits,
[2879.76] it's it's obvious to explain because you
[2882.079] have the the uh the runup on the land
[2884.96] and then you have the backwash into the
[2886.96] into the ocean. So, you've got up and
[2889.72] reverse, right? So, anywhere you where
[2891.92] you would have something like say a
[2894.839] basin that filled with
[2897.72] water and then empties, you're going to
[2900.56] get a birectional flow. And I don't know
[2903.28] I haven't studied enough on Africa
[2904.96] otherwise I other than to know that
[2908.079] Africa has a interesting sort of
[2910.64] subsurface geommorphology and or
[2913.16] topography in that it's a series of
[2915.96] basins surrounded by highland highland
[2919.079] areas. So you could have uh a lot of
[2923.52] rain filling one basin and it could
[2925.52] overflow into another one and perhaps
[2928.8] that could reverse. I I hadn't wasn't
[2932.16] intending to talk about that. I will
[2934.72] show that in the uh the the the
[2938.319] presentation I'm going to do um next
[2941.2] week. I I'll show that because it so the
[2944.72] takeaway from this again relative to the
[2946.88] question is that we know that there have
[2949.599] been largecale pluial events and fluial
[2953.119] fluial meaning flowing water, pluial
[2955.359] meaning rainfall. And of course
[2956.72] obviously they're related to each other.
[2958.8] If you have a heavy rainfall pluial,
[2961.2] you're going to also have a heavy fluial
[2963.68] consequence of it. Right? So the it the
[2968.24] argument could be made that particularly
[2971.44] limestone bedrock terrains could be
[2974.16] honeycombed with
[2975.64] caves. Now to what extent were those
[2979.44] caves accessed by humans, that's an open
[2983.04] question. And I don't think anybody to
[2984.8] my knowledge has really
[2987.16] proposed, you know, anything beyond the
[2989.52] typical caveman scenario. Nobody's
[2992.16] assuming that maybe people are going
[2994.48] into caves hundreds of yards under
[2997.68] ground and maybe there are large areas
[3000.16] that could have been inhabited. Uh but
[3002.559] that seems entirely
[3005.4] feasible. And so again, I don't know
[3009.2] what we're looking at there. that one
[3010.88] central column in particular looks looks
[3014.359] like too um too organized to be natural,
[3019.52] but I don't know. We're gonna wait and
[3021.04] see. Yeah, we will. Well, thanks for uh
[3023.359] thanks for diving into that, too. I I
[3025.359] was very curious what your perspective
[3026.72] was thus far. So, where are we picking
[3029.359] up? Where are we picking up in North
[3031.839] America? Okay. So, what I'm going to do
[3034.24] here is I'm going to open uh Google Maps
[3038.48] to start
[3041.4] and we're going to go up
[3044.119] to British Columbia.
[3049.92] Have you ever been to British Columbia?
[3051.92] Oh, yeah. Multiple times to research
[3055.2] what I'm about to show
[3058.52] you. Uh, when was the last time you
[3061.28] went? Oh
[3065.16] god. 10, 12 years ago, I guess.
[3069.04] Yeah, 10 to 10, 12 years ago somewhere.
[3071.76] I'm going to guess because I I think the
[3073.92] last time I was there, I I visited the
[3076.24] studio of um the Grim America Boys,
[3080.0] Darren Grimes and uh Graham Dunlap. Uh,
[3084.8] and we did a podcast together and
[3087.359] Bradley Young was there and several
[3089.68] other people were all gathered around
[3091.52] and crammed into their studio which I
[3094.079] think they've upgraded since then. Um,
[3097.28] but that was the last time. So, I'm
[3098.96] guessing that was 10 years ago now. Wow.
[3102.079] Maybe. And I think that was my third
[3103.839] time up there. I guess while you're
[3106.4] pulling that up, we could do a little
[3108.0] plug for the Bonavville flood. You
[3110.319] Bonavville flood tour that you're doing.
[3112.24] you started talking about it earlier,
[3113.92] but that's in May, May 11th, something
[3117.839] like that. May 11th. And yeah, we're
[3120.48] going to be traveling the route
[3122.64] following the route of the great
[3124.0] Bonavville flood, right? And seeing what
[3127.04] happens to landscapes when 40 million
[3129.52] cubic feet per second flows over those
[3131.92] landscapes for a period of three or four
[3133.76] or five months and what what it does in
[3136.64] the aftermath. And uh so it's going to
[3139.2] be uh not just looking at some amazing
[3142.24] landscapes, but it's also going to be
[3144.8] learning to read this script, if you
[3148.16] want to call it that. This epic tale of
[3151.04] which the Bonavville flood is a part,
[3153.839] right? Being able to speak a little bit
[3155.599] of flood French, as you There we go.
[3158.16] Yes. There we go. I like I like that. Um
[3162.24] Awesome. Well, there's a couple spots
[3164.24] left, I presume. There's a few. I Yeah,
[3167.04] I think the last I heard there was six,
[3168.96] but that was a while ago, so I don't
[3171.839] think it's sold out. I think there's
[3173.599] three or four spots left if I had to
[3175.76] guess. So, three or four spots left. If
[3178.319] you guys want to see what we're talking
[3179.599] about, get them. Snap. Oh, yeah. Check
[3181.52] it out. We're going to have a uh Yeah.
[3184.72] So, if you go to
[3186.359] randler.com and put in um Bonavville
[3189.68] Flood May, I think we've got some
[3192.52] uh some more information on
[3196.119] it. But if you're interested at all in
[3200.0] understanding the big picture of earth
[3202.319] change and this is a very good way to
[3206.8] introduce yourself
[3209.4] um into into that realm of knowledge
[3214.079] and one of the consistent uh reports
[3218.079] feedbacks that I get from people that
[3219.599] have attended these tours is that they
[3222.079] really begin
[3224.24] uh yeah there we
[3227.76] Join Randall Carlson, Brad, and the Grim
[3230.559] team for an unforgettable six-day
[3232.64] adventure as we trace the path of the
[3234.64] ancient Bonavville flood through Utah
[3236.8] and Idaho. This immersive geological
[3239.839] tour offers a rare opportunity to
[3242.64] witness the remnants of one of North
[3244.72] America's most significant cataclysmic
[3247.2] events, the massive flood that reshaped
[3249.92] the landscape as Lake Bonavville burst
[3252.8] its natural dam thousands of years ago.
[3256.079] Guided by Rand's deep knowledge of
[3258.16] Earth's catastrophic history, this trip
[3260.319] will take you to iconic locations
[3263.599] showcasing the incredible forces that
[3265.76] carved out the landscape. Each day will
[3268.4] feature hikes, geological discussions,
[3270.48] and moments of awe as we delve into the
[3273.68] story behind the terrain. I couldn't
[3277.04] have said it better myself.
[3281.359] Did I say that? I don't know who wrote
[3283.2] that. I don't think I did, but that was
[3285.119] really well who wrote that. Was that
[3287.359] Darren? That's really what was it? Brad
[3289.599] H. Who knows? It was well written. It
[3291.839] was well written. It was It was very uh
[3294.559] We're going to use that audio for an ad.
[3296.4] We didn't even have to script it. It was
[3298.16] already done for us. Hot dog.
[3301.28] Hallelujah. There we go.
[3305.52] Okay, let me get my map over on this
[3309.48] monitor. Uh yeah, Canada indicates
[3312.72] detachment of the Laurent Tide ice sheet
[3314.96] from the Rocky Mountains at
[3316.24] approximately 15,000 years ago. I would
[3319.119] suggest that it's probably closer to
[3320.72] 14,06.
[3322.8] um and cons which would make it more
[3325.04] consistent with meltwater pulse 1A but
[3328.48] it's certainly within that
[3330.44] window because meltwater pulse one wait
[3333.68] there uh I saw 14.9 there it is let's
[3337.04] see based on a group of 12 samples well
[3340.4] clustered in time we date the detachment
[3343.76] of the western Laurentide ice sheet
[3346.0] margin from the Rocky Mountain front to
[3348.64] approximately 14.9 plus or minus.9 9,000
[3352.799] years ago. This is a thousand years
[3355.359] later than previously
[3357.559] assumed. Yes. And I think that could
[3359.839] still be a thousand years. Maybe not.
[3362.88] Maybe maybe 300 400 years cuz I said
[3366.359] 14.6 is I think the latest date for
[3369.839] meltwater pulse
[3371.72] 1A. And my first impression would be
[3375.68] that this is probably going to be
[3379.68] uh a
[3380.76] regional manifestation of whatever
[3384.64] triggered that melting event at at 146.
[3388.319] Mhm.
[3389.88] Um so let's see. A later separation of
[3392.559] the western Laurentide ice sheet margin
[3394.319] from the mountain front implies higher
[3396.72] ice margin retreat rates in order to
[3399.119] meet the younger dus ice margin
[3401.04] position. Well, we knew that yes, it
[3404.24] implies higher ice margin retreat rates.
[3407.52] This is I mean this is the the whole
[3410.24] direction and and um uh that this that
[3414.72] this research is moving is that these
[3417.28] things are happening a lot more uh a lot
[3421.319] faster than people were imagining a few
[3424.319] decades ago.
[3426.319] And we're having to rethink some of the
[3428.4] the the temporal models for these
[3431.68] events. And I think what we're going to
[3433.799] do like here if we Okay, so I'm saying
[3438.319] 146. This is 149. Yeah. Um so you're
[3442.64] only what 300 300 years off
[3447.04] just about. And yeah, I I so I'm gonna I
[3451.2] want to read this study here. Okay. So
[3453.839] this Yeah. Okay. So, this introduces
[3455.68] Let's Let's go. Do you have images? Um,
[3458.559] yeah.
[3460.079] Let's see. Go to go to images. Yeah.
[3464.88] What do we want to look at here? Let's
[3466.88] see here. Okay. I've got uh the Foothill
[3470.72] Glacial. Okay. Yeah, that second from
[3473.839] the left that that shows the map. Get
[3476.559] can get the picture there. Okay. So, you
[3478.559] see right there the origin. You see this
[3481.599] right here? this the the the um the
[3484.96] boundary between British Columbia and
[3486.839] Alberta forms the continental divide of
[3489.68] the western North American continent.
[3492.16] Right? That's that's the divide right
[3494.559] there. So you can see that this thing
[3497.599] the the erratics train originates right
[3501.119] there on the continental divide and then
[3502.88] it follows this route down. It goes by
[3505.28] Calgary right in here. Loops to the east
[3508.4] and then finally comes to an end in
[3511.119] Montana.
[3514.079] So what is it exactly? What is the
[3516.799] erratics train?
[3519.599] Okay. Well,
[3522.2] um Okay, scroll down and you will see
[3526.24] second from the left. You're you're
[3528.319] hovering right there. Yeah. Open that.
[3531.28] Okay. So, as you would guess from a
[3533.359] train, this is it's something on the
[3536.4] order of 500 miles from its source there
[3539.599] uh on the British Columbia Alberta
[3541.76] border where we saw to its final uh
[3545.76] example there in Montana. Uh and there's
[3549.52] there's hundreds of them, but these are
[3551.359] examples here of and they're all of the
[3554.0] same type of rock. It's a type of meta
[3556.4] quartzite. It's a metamorphic rock.
[3560.359] um similar to granite in a way, meta
[3564.599] quartzite. So the question then is that
[3569.839] what are we looking at here? We're
[3571.2] looking at we're looking at a a a string
[3574.64] of these boulders. And you can see look
[3577.359] at the uh top row third from the left.
[3581.2] You can see that's a pretty big rock
[3582.88] there. Yeah. Right. You see the guy
[3584.88] standing next to it. You go to the next
[3587.04] one at at D. Same thing there. That's a
[3589.52] pretty good sized rock. Yeah. And you
[3592.64] can trace these things in this line that
[3595.52] we just saw on the
[3596.92] map over 500
[3601.16] miles.
[3604.52] Wow.
[3607.24] So if you
[3611.079] were this is to me is it's very much
[3613.52] like forensic geology.
[3616.319] Okay, we're looking at this and we're
[3617.76] trying to
[3618.52] go, okay, this rock didn't move itself
[3623.48] here. So, by what exact mechanism of
[3628.28] transport can we attribute to the
[3632.2] geographic disposition of these
[3635.64] rocks? How do we do that?
[3638.559] I mean, we chalk it up to giants moving
[3640.88] rocks and we well well there's that but
[3644.76] um well in a way there is a certain
[3647.52] element of truth to that. So this is the
[3651.04] kind of thing that you know I mean who
[3653.68] who knows about this who thinks about it
[3656.72] um
[3658.76] who has any concept really of what the
[3662.24] significance of this would be. Well, not
[3666.079] very many people. I can tell you that.
[3668.0] And you're about though to become one of
[3671.16] them. If if that's if you feel intrepid
[3675.44] enough. Mhm. It is of interest to me to
[3678.4] become one of them. Become one. So, this
[3681.68] is the foothills erratic train. Okay.
[3684.0] The foothills are the foothills of the
[3687.04] Rocky Mountains. Okay. And you have this
[3689.599] region called the Rocky Mountain uh
[3691.68] front. And anybody who's been to Denver
[3694.799] and looks to the west sees the Rocky
[3697.599] Mountain front right there played out.
[3700.4] Right. Well, it goes all the way up into
[3702.24] Canada. And so you've got the uh what
[3706.319] I'll do here is I am going to share
[3709.76] screen
[3711.72] and we're going to take a look here.
[3715.2] Okay.
[3716.44] So if we go to
[3720.76] Calgary, right? So all of this is part
[3723.2] of the Rocky Mountain front. So check
[3725.04] this out. All of this is the Rocky
[3727.44] Mountain front. And then you go east of
[3730.24] the Rocky Mountain front now you're out
[3732.0] onto the great prairie, the
[3734.079] mid-continental
[3735.559] prairie. And you know, it's always so
[3738.559] fascinating to me how especially if
[3740.96] you're coming from the east and you're
[3742.559] traveling across the prairie and the
[3745.2] Rocky Mountain front just looms up in
[3747.359] front of you. It's such a dramatic
[3749.68] change in landscapes. It's I never cease
[3753.44] to be impressed when I make that run.
[3757.52] Okay. So, anyways, we can go up
[3760.119] here and we can see that this right here
[3765.76] by the little town of Hinton, we've got
[3769.28] 16. And here we've got the Aabaska
[3771.76] River.
[3773.68] And there there since we were getting
[3776.0] earlier uh talking about the French, the
[3779.68] French have a term that is often used
[3783.2] for what's happening here with the
[3786.0] river. You'll notice that it's flowing
[3789.28] in this confined channel, right? Mhm.
[3792.799] And then it opens up, you know, it it
[3796.76] it moves out of and in front of the uh
[3801.359] of the mountains and the confinement
[3803.599] within the the mountain canyons. And the
[3806.4] French term is deouch
[3808.96] deouch.
[3811.319] Deouch. The river douches.
[3815.0] Deouches. I guess that's it. It done it
[3818.559] done debushes here from the from the
[3820.88] river among from the
[3822.76] mountains. Uh, no, it's a French term.
[3825.72] Deouch. How do you spell it? Deouch.
[3829.039] Deouch. D O U C H E. D E B O U C H E is
[3834.72] probably the spelling. Probably right.
[3837.44] Are you looking it up? Yeah, I'm
[3838.96] googling. Okay, good. Let's Let's get
[3841.039] this settled once and for all.
[3847.68] Deouch debushing river. Um,
[3852.96] no e d e b o u c h. Oh, well that's
[3858.48] probably the Americanized way of
[3860.16] spelling. Okay. So, what does it say?
[3861.92] What's the definition? In hydraology, a
[3864.599] deouch ah or deouch with an e on the end
[3868.16] is a place where runoff from a small
[3870.72] confined space discharges discharges
[3873.119] into a larger broader body of water.
[3878.599] Okay. So, I'm not as dumb as I look
[3881.119] here.
[3883.44] Yes. The uh Aabaska River deouch. Well,
[3887.359] how what's the plural of debes?
[3892.559] It must be. Let's see. It it debes here.
[3895.68] Deouches.
[3898.4] Well, darn. Hey, we didn't even have to
[3901.76] question it. We just could have kept
[3903.44] rolling right through.
[3905.039] We could have. Okay. So, I'm not as dumb
[3907.44] as I think I am
[3909.799] sometimes. Uh, okay. So, but that's
[3912.799] important. Okay. All kidding aside,
[3915.52] that's important. So, let's back out
[3917.68] here now. Why do I have Mount Edith
[3920.0] Caval
[3921.319] flagged? Well, I actually should also
[3924.16] flag Mount
[3925.799] Robson, which is right here. Ah, look at
[3929.68] this. There we go. There's Wow, Mount
[3933.039] Robson.
[3936.96] Wow is right
[3939.64] now the what's really the row is that at
[3943.68] the end of the last ice age at the
[3946.2] LGM remember the LGM late glacial
[3949.48] maximum the only thing of this mountains
[3952.48] that you saw was just like the uppermost
[3955.119] peak that's all you saw uh and how the
[3960.4] mountain oh gez let's see it's got to
[3962.839] the I think what 3,000 ft above the
[3965.76] valley floor. I can tell you right here
[3967.44] because well, let's see. I would want to
[3970.0] open Google Earth. It says
[3974.359] 3,954 m meters. Yeah.
[3977.72] 3,954 m.
[3980.799] That's a That's
[3983.4] 12,989 ft. 12,900. So almost 13,000
[3988.359] ft. Okay. So that is
[3993.64] uh Mount
[3995.799] Robson. Um the other one was Mount Edith
[3998.64] Caval. So I wanted
[4000.92] to I wanted to pull that up too because
[4004.559] the the the very similar metacortsite
[4008.599] rock composes both Mount Edith Caval and
[4011.76] Mount Robson.
[4013.839] I think there has been some discussion
[4017.359] uh as to
[4021.319] um which one it came from. I think more
[4024.64] have come down on the side of Mount
[4026.4] Edith Caval than Mount Robson, but it's
[4029.44] a very similar type of metamorphic rock,
[4033.599] the meta quartzite. Okay.
[4036.68] So, uh, look up now the word nuna.
[4042.359] Nunac. Nu n a nun. N U N A. T A
[4047.96] C. Nun talk. I think with a K or a C.
[4052.319] Yeah, I think it's a K. It's a K. Yeah.
[4054.72] Nut talk. A mountain peak or ridge that
[4057.44] protrudes from an ice field or glacier,
[4060.24] often forming a rocky outcrop above the
[4062.799] ice. The word comes from the Inuit
[4065.76] language and mean the excuse me Inuit
[4067.839] language and means lonely mountain.
[4070.88] Lonely mountain. Yeah.
[4072.52] Because you don't Yeah. Right. Because
[4074.88] all you're seeing is the isolated
[4076.72] mountain peaks and then everything in
[4079.28] between is just a Yeah. Pull up some
[4081.92] images and see so we can see what it is.
[4084.24] Because this here we go. Because this is
[4086.079] what I say. This is what what we just
[4088.799] looked at. Mount Robson. It was a nun
[4091.359] attack. A nun attack. That's what
[4093.359] British Columbia and the Rocky Mountains
[4095.039] looked like at the end of the last ice
[4097.279] age. Wow. Yeah. Wow.
[4106.799] Wow. Was
[4108.839] right. That's a pretty So yeah, the one
[4112.4] you're hovering over there right there,
[4113.759] that's probably exactly what it would
[4115.199] have looked like from the air 15,000
[4117.44] years ago.
[4126.359] Wow. Aha. Here's that famous Antarctica
[4130.759] picture. Everybody calls that a pyramid.
[4134.799] Oh, well,
[4136.719] they don't know about none attacks, I
[4138.48] guess. No, but but here's the thing. Um,
[4141.839] it is normal under certain cir uh
[4144.64] erosional regimes for the end result to
[4147.44] be a pyramid-shaped rock. both from
[4150.48] glacial erosion and water erosion both.
[4155.52] Well, you just answered a lot of
[4157.199] conspiratorial questions here. I don't
[4159.839] even think you realize what you just did
[4161.279] to the internet, Randall.
[4163.52] Oh, sorry. Sorry, guys. But I mean,
[4166.4] we're looking This is a This is normal
[4169.52] to the plane of the picture, isn't it?
[4171.52] Aren't we looking perpendicular?
[4174.08] Yeah, it is. So, well, yeah. So, this is
[4177.12] a satellite image. Yeah. So that's a
[4179.92] two-dimensional essentially a planer
[4181.92] surface there, isn't it? But I see. So
[4184.88] there's uh Yeah, I got it. So but that
[4190.08] actually is very normal glacial erosion.
[4193.04] That's not that's not atypical.
[4196.88] Why is that?
[4199.36] Well, it's because of the way Yeah. I
[4201.92] mean, okay. So when we get I can show
[4205.199] you like examples of it. I have
[4208.159] photographs that I've taken on trips
[4210.96] where you see exactly that same kind of
[4212.88] erosion
[4214.84] um on on on varying scales, but you got
[4218.88] to picture if you've got a a glacier
[4221.44] moving through it looks like up there
[4224.159] just above the the the red flag right
[4226.719] right in there. Okay, that would be like
[4229.12] a base of the thing. Well, that's a
[4231.12] valley right there, right? That valley
[4233.76] was occupied by a moving glacier. And
[4236.08] that moving glacier is gouging and
[4240.56] uh stripping the bedrock as it's as it's
[4243.679] plowing its way through.
[4248.199] Now what you end up with is is is sort
[4251.84] of is natural. You can see it in water
[4253.92] erosion, too. What you end up with is a
[4256.64] a triangular planer surface.
[4260.8] I'll I'll pull up in some examples and
[4263.12] and show you here in a minute if you
[4264.8] want me to. Um uh okay. So anyways, but
[4268.0] back to this. You got Mount Robson and
[4269.76] you've got Mount Edith Caval. You've got
[4272.0] the Aabaska River Debushing from the
[4274.56] Rocky Mountain front turning south at
[4277.28] Hinton and then following more or less
[4280.04] parallel. Okay. So here's Mount Robson.
[4284.159] Mount Edith Caval is right down.
[4288.12] Uh yeah, right
[4290.28] here. Now, notice that you've got the
[4293.36] river flowing here. This
[4297.0] is the Yellow Head Highway. Oh, wow.
[4300.32] Yellowhead Lake. I forgot that. That's
[4302.8] right. Yellowhead Pass. Boy, this is a
[4305.44] trip, let me tell you. The going through
[4307.04] Yellowhead Pass. So, this is what what
[4308.88] Bradley and I did. We we followed the
[4312.28] route of the uh erratics train which was
[4316.239] a very interesting thing to do. So we
[4319.28] started at Mount Robson and we followed
[4321.44] the river on out and then we came out
[4324.48] here and let's see what did we
[4327.0] do? What did we do? Did we come all the
[4329.36] way out here and come south or was there
[4331.199] a road? I need to go back and backtrack
[4334.4] because I photographed everything as we
[4336.159] went. But anyway, so we followed the the
[4339.52] route of the erratics train. We stopped
[4342.32] in Calgary and this is where we met um
[4345.36] Graham Dunlop and and Darren Grimes
[4348.159] because they were living in Calgary. And
[4350.719] the reason we were there is we were on
[4352.56] our way to this right here, Oktokes,
[4356.96] which I believe, if I remember right,
[4358.719] was in the Blackfoot language and meant
[4361.04] Big Rock. M and Okatoes was the biggest
[4365.88] of the erratics train.
[4372.08] Wow. So, did you find something? Yep, I
[4375.12] got it. Okay. So, I'm going to stop
[4377.199] sharing and let's see what you
[4379.719] got. Ah, there it is. In fact, no, that
[4384.0] was okay. Yeah, you had the bunch of
[4386.48] pictures of it.
[4388.96] Look at that. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. Go
[4391.679] back. I wonder if any of my photos are
[4393.679] up there anywhere. Let's
[4395.64] see. Uh oh, there's a good one.
[4400.08] Oh, yeah. That's the one I took. That
[4402.32] was the That was the first time I was
[4403.92] there. Ah, yeah.
[4408.04] Uhhuh. Uh,
[4412.239] this is one rock.
[4414.8] Yes. Oh my gosh. How big is the rock?
[4419.52] Well, let's see. Tell you what we'll do
[4422.719] is we'll go back. Well, you can see a
[4425.28] person standing there right here. Yeah.
[4427.44] Yeah. 18,000 tons.
[4433.199] So, you see how it's sitting out there
[4434.8] in the prairie? Yeah.
[4437.48] Okay. So, how far is it from uh say from
[4443.04] Mount Robson to Calgary?
[4447.76] Mount Robson to
[4451.08] Calgary. How far is that? See? Oh, look.
[4454.159] That's a great aerial shot of it. Yeah.
[4457.12] It looks like it's about
[4459.64] 495 kilometers. So, call it 300 miles.
[4463.92] Mhm. So, this rock, 18,000 ton
[4468.6] rock, boulder of metacortsite, has been
[4471.719] transported 300 miles from its source.
[4476.52] Wow. Okay. So,
[4479.08] now when you look at let's go back to
[4484.32] Oh, yeah. Look.
[4485.88] Yeah. The legend of Big
[4489.719] Rock. So, let's go through a little
[4493.52] exercise in forensic geology.
[4497.76] I'm ready for it. So, there we go. So,
[4501.52] this uh let's see. You can see Brad
[4503.52] Young right here in the foreground.
[4506.44] So that gives you a sense of the scale
[4508.88] of this thing. It's
[4511.4] enormous. 18,000 tons. And we just
[4514.239] determined that it's it's been
[4516.239] transported about 300
[4519.0] miles from its source, from its bedrock
[4521.92] source.
[4523.44] So those two, so just to be clear, Mount
[4526.4] Robson and uh Mount Edith Cavill, if I'm
[4530.8] remembering the name correctly, are the
[4532.719] only two places where this type of rock
[4535.6] is found. Those are the two two
[4537.84] mountains that look like either. Yeah,
[4540.96] basically. Yes.
[4543.199] Yes.
[4545.52] I think I think most of the opinion has
[4548.64] been that it was sourced from Mount
[4550.56] Edith Cavell.
[4552.48] Okay. So, a little bit closer than Mount
[4554.4] Robson to Calgary. Little bit. Yeah, a
[4556.88] little bit. But you still got a
[4559.4] problem. Both of those mountains, as it
[4562.56] turns out, are on the west side of the
[4564.88] Continental Divide. This is on the east
[4566.64] side.
[4568.12] H. So what you have to do now is you
[4571.84] have
[4572.6] to come up with a
[4575.56] means of first of all you have to quarry
[4579.84] these rock. Now this is this is part of
[4581.92] this 500 mile foothill doratics train.
[4584.32] This just so happens to be the biggest
[4586.6] one. The ones we pulled up we saw those
[4589.199] others before. It's the same rock from
[4591.28] the same place.
[4593.36] right now. I don't know how what the
[4596.4] total weight of all of them is because,
[4598.56] you know, there's a lot of smaller stuff
[4600.96] strewn in that long 500 mile pathway,
[4604.32] right?
[4606.239] I don't know the total. I've never
[4607.84] somebody may have calculated the total
[4609.92] volume of the but I'm I don't know what
[4612.88] it is. But but in any case, you've got
[4616.239] this train of this
[4618.28] stuff going.
[4621.32] strewn about 500 miles there from where
[4625.28] the Atabaska River debushes at the at
[4628.719] the mountain front by Hinton there all
[4631.92] the way down into
[4635.08] Montana. So, and the largest one some
[4639.52] many of them weigh many many tons. This
[4641.84] happens to be the largest which weighs
[4644.08] 18,000 tons. So, let's focus on this one
[4648.08] because we can come up with an
[4650.88] explanation for this. Let's see here.
[4653.28] Um, are there any other close to that in
[4655.92] scale or is this by far the biggest? Oh,
[4658.64] this is by far the the biggest in the
[4660.64] foothills gerionics train. I'm guessing
[4663.28] there's several others that might be one
[4666.08] quarter to half this size. We could go
[4668.64] back. I've actually documented it, but
[4670.56] it was so long ago. I mean, I've got the
[4673.199] charts. I didn't pull them up because I
[4675.36] have a whole list of all of the
[4676.92] identified larger ones. Um, you know,
[4681.04] maybe two dozen, three dozen of them and
[4683.199] are of substantial size. You can go, you
[4686.08] know, visit them, but none of them are
[4687.6] this big. But let's take a look here at
[4692.8] what just looking at this at this
[4695.28] boulder here, Okatoes. Let's just see
[4698.4] what looking at Okatoes can tell us.
[4701.84] So describe to me what you see here. I
[4704.96] see what appears to be a cut through. If
[4708.56] that's one rock, it's either cut through
[4710.719] one rock or a divide between them. It's
[4713.28] kind of flat on top on the left. Flat.
[4715.76] Yep. And on the right. Yep.
[4718.84] Flat. That's good. And kind of Yeah. I
[4721.28] mean, they're they're there's a notch
[4723.679] here on the left. I don't know if people
[4725.44] can see my mouse, but in that left
[4729.12] structure right in the middle of it, it
[4730.96] looks like there's notch. Well, that
[4733.6] notch goes all the way through. Okay.
[4737.12] So, it's like a crack. It's like a more
[4739.92] like a crack that goes through. So, so
[4743.04] far, yeah, I mean, you're pointing out
[4744.64] some good good stuff there.
[4746.6] um the
[4748.28] the now look at also the the uh like
[4752.8] positions of the rock. What what can you
[4755.28] say about them? Um would from looking at
[4759.36] this, do you think it would be a a a
[4761.84] safe assumption to think that the
[4765.36] surface of this of these rocks are more
[4767.52] or less
[4768.84] continuous? Like if let's say you were
[4770.96] looking at a battleship that got blown
[4772.88] in two and it's sitting on the bottom of
[4774.48] the ocean. Mhm. Right. And you look at
[4776.64] and it's, you know, it's all it's
[4778.159] oblique sitting there on the ocean
[4779.679] bottom. Right. But you would look at
[4781.44] that and you would go, well, obviously
[4782.96] at one point, at some point this was one
[4786.679] structure, right? So if this was one
[4791.04] structure, one
[4793.08] rock, you basically have to come up
[4795.76] first with a way of quarrying it from
[4798.96] the nunitak or nun attack.
[4802.32] Then you have to get that quarried
[4804.64] 18,000 ton
[4806.28] rock 300 miles and deliver it to this
[4810.56] spot
[4812.88] uh on the on the right where the prairie
[4815.12] meets the foot of the
[4817.159] mountains. And how do you do that?
[4821.28] I mean, from what we've looked at over
[4822.88] the last couple of
[4825.4] uh episodes, I would say that you need a
[4828.4] lot a lot of water and you probably need
[4831.32] something to help dislodge it. Some type
[4834.56] of impact or something like that. Yes,
[4837.199] you would need a
[4838.44] force, right? You would need something
[4841.04] to separate this because at one time,
[4843.84] obviously, this was part of the
[4845.76] mountain, right? It's part of the
[4847.44] mountain, right? So, okay, as I look at
[4850.8] this, a couple of things that I would
[4852.159] point out is that
[4854.6] um you look at the thickness of the rock
[4857.76] here and that looks like it's good 30
[4860.239] feet. If you look at Brad and he's six
[4862.239] feet tall, you know, is there five
[4865.199] Brads? I would think that there's five
[4867.04] of this guy's at least 30 feet tall.
[4869.76] Yeah. And you can see over here it's not
[4873.76] quite as high, but but by the time you
[4875.76] look at this back here, Yeah. This looks
[4877.44] like it's about as high as the
[4878.88] prominence that Brad's standing on
[4881.08] almost.
[4883.32] Now here you're obviously much closer to
[4886.96] the ground. You're probably 15 20 feet
[4889.76] from the ground here, right? 15t say.
[4893.52] Now does that mean that the bottom of
[4896.32] this rock is flat and it's just thinner
[4898.92] here? Or was it a rectal linear block of
[4903.04] rock and right here this face of the
[4906.56] rock would continue
[4909.719] underground about this distance here.
[4913.28] Mhm. Same over here.
[4916.32] You see what I'm saying here? Is that
[4919.12] because that is in fact what the case
[4920.8] is. Well, you can see right now this
[4924.88] block is not sinking into the ground, is
[4927.6] it? No. But at one point a big part of
[4930.88] it sank into the
[4932.679] ground. And that's what we're seeing
[4934.639] here. We're seeing that this was a soft
[4937.48] surface and this huge boulder sank. And
[4942.08] as it sank, where did it separate? It
[4945.36] separated uh what would have most likely
[4948.719] just been natural fracture lines in the
[4952.199] rock, right? Mhm.
[4955.4] So we can reconstruct a scenario here
[4958.96] that this surface on the
[4961.96] left would match this surface on the
[4964.76] right. The thickness of this slab here
[4968.08] is continuous. Let's just call it 30 ft.
[4971.679] Same here that this block is is uh a big
[4976.8] portion of this block is underground.
[4980.84] And now we have to think in terms of how
[4984.0] this was delivered. It's likely I think
[4987.92] we've just could surmise that at the
[4990.88] time this rock was deposited here, the
[4993.52] ground was soft
[4995.08] enough that like now it's not soft
[4998.32] enough. This thing doesn't sink into the
[5000.08] ground there. You know, I mean, could
[5002.239] you have enough of a not at any fast
[5005.04] pace when it's dry? Right. Right. No,
[5007.6] it's not. In fact, in the lifetime of
[5009.84] the people living here in the Indians,
[5011.6] it has not really it hasn't sunk into
[5014.32] the ground, but it did sink into the
[5016.48] ground at some point. And what that
[5018.56] tells you is that the the ground was
[5021.0] unconsolidated. It was probably
[5023.04] fluidized, right? Which would be
[5025.76] consistent with deposition from uh water
[5029.199] flow, wouldn't it? Mhm. Especially if
[5032.32] the deposition of the of the the strata
[5035.76] here the the of the uh sediments on the
[5039.04] bottom was followed very quickly by
[5041.76] deposition of the
[5043.719] rock. Okay. So now how do you get okay
[5049.04] so we can see that the rock it's it was
[5052.0] not structurally
[5053.639] sound because it's it's broken into
[5056.239] three pieces and those three pieces have
[5058.4] most likely formed simply because of the
[5060.639] effects of gravity on the rock once it
[5064.159] was deposited onto this aluvial flood
[5067.44] plane here which was still soft right so
[5071.36] it was able to sink
[5075.28] But here's you know now we could say
[5078.88] well it was a was it transported by
[5081.12] glacier? What are the options for
[5083.159] transport? Well I think there's only is
[5086.239] there two or three? One we could say
[5089.239] glaciers. Okay but in normal glacier how
[5093.28] fast is the glacier moving? If the
[5095.6] glacier is
[5096.92] moving, you know, 50 to 100 feet per
[5099.76] year, which is going to be a typical
[5102.8] rate of glacier ice move, let's just say
[5104.88] 200 feet a year. If we've got 300 miles,
[5108.48] well, even just from from its position
[5111.199] at the mountains to the Rocky Mountain
[5113.36] front, let's say it's 30 miles. 30
[5116.159] miles, right? Well, so 30 miles is going
[5118.88] to be 5,280 ft. And if we divide that by
[5123.239] say 150 ft per year, well that's going
[5126.719] to take a thousand
[5128.44] years,
[5130.28] right? But right I think unless I No, I
[5134.48] think if it's
[5136.719] Wait a minute. What did I say,000 years?
[5139.04] So I think it's Let's see. 30 miles
[5140.719] would go times 5,280. So that's
[5145.239] 158,400 feet. And if it moves 100 feet
[5149.6] per year, yeah, I'll go 150 feet per
[5153.52] year. Yeah. 1,56. Just about a mile. I
[5156.639] mean, just about a thousand years. Yeah.
[5158.0] About a thousand years. Okay. Now, in
[5161.679] that thousand years, let's say you've
[5165.44] got to you've got to extract somehow you
[5168.4] have to separate this rock from the
[5170.239] mountain that it was a part
[5172.04] of, right? And we assume that this
[5175.76] happened. Do we assume are we a fair to
[5177.92] assume this happened when there was a
[5180.639] big ice sheet and this was a nun attack?
[5182.639] I mean is that a an assumption or would
[5185.44] this have been disconnected from the
[5187.76] mountain say in its modern condition? Of
[5191.04] course the big problem there is if
[5193.04] there's no mechanism if you were to
[5195.84] dislodge an 18,000 ton boulder from the
[5199.84] one of the flanks of Mount E Edith Caval
[5202.56] and it fell down into the valley. It's
[5205.44] not going to end up 300 miles away out
[5207.92] on the edge of the prairie, is it? No.
[5210.719] No. In fact, it's probably going to bust
[5213.04] into a mill a million pieces on its way
[5215.6] down. Yeah. On its way down. Exactly.
[5218.159] So, you can begin to see the problem
[5219.679] here. We We're going to have we're going
[5221.28] to quarry an 18,000 ton boulder. We now
[5224.0] have to transport it 300 miles, dump it
[5226.8] onto the out down edge of the prair
[5229.44] where the prairie meets the mountains
[5231.679] right now. And that's only Wait, wait a
[5234.32] minute. That that's only if it ch moved
[5236.8] 30 miles. Yes. 1,000 years. 30 miles,
[5241.36] which would which would get us to the
[5243.92] prairie essentially. Well, if it was if
[5246.96] it was ice glacier transport the entire
[5250.719] way. Now we've got 300.
[5254.48] Now you're looking at what? 15,000
[5257.48] years. Okay. Now, what's going to
[5259.44] happen? Let's go back. Let's go back to
[5261.52] the 30 miles and say a thousand years.
[5264.56] That means a thousand years, a thousand
[5268.0] winters of snowfall, right? We can also
[5272.0] assume what is the snowfall going to be
[5273.6] greater than now? I mean, because after
[5275.76] all, there was so much snowfall and so
[5278.48] little melting away that you were able
[5280.159] to fill those mountain valleys with
[5282.0] thousands of feet of ice of glaciers,
[5285.159] right? So, how rapidly is that going to
[5288.56] continue to accumulate? So in other
[5290.8] words, how much glacial ice could
[5292.239] accumulate in a thousand years? So in
[5294.8] other words, in a thousand years, by the
[5296.96] time if if that rock right there is
[5300.48] placed on top of the ice sheet and the
[5303.12] ice sheet is moving and it's being
[5304.92] transported, I mean, hell, we we we
[5307.12] could double it. It doesn't matter. And
[5308.56] say it's delivered in 500 years. It
[5311.44] doesn't change the basic scenario is
[5313.84] that during that time it's going to get
[5316.32] buried under 500 or a thousand years of
[5319.28] additional accumulation of glacial ice.
[5322.239] Right?
[5324.199] So what's going to happen is that as
[5327.36] that overlying ice begins to amass, it's
[5332.48] putting pressure on anything that's
[5335.679] within that ice
[5337.48] mass. Could you under those
[5341.0] circumstances if this thing right here
[5344.56] is entrained within thousands of feet of
[5348.639] glacial ice under these extraordinary
[5352.28] pressures? Could it be delivered to this
[5355.36] site
[5357.159] intact? And the answer is under what
[5360.0] conceivable circumstances could this
[5363.04] rock not be essentially more fractures,
[5366.48] more pulver
[5368.679] pulverized under the enormous pressures
[5371.12] of the overlying accumulating glacier
[5373.76] mass that's going to occur that's going
[5376.719] to accrete over the thousand or
[5379.28] thousands of years that it would take to
[5381.84] move this rock from its source to where
[5385.28] it is now if you're looking at ordinary
[5388.52] glacier accumulation glacier movement
[5391.76] and so on.
[5393.0] So we have to look at something else and
[5396.4] at this is where we have to go okay it
[5398.719] had to have been catastrophic. Now at
[5401.12] the very best think about this I want
[5403.52] you to look at this picture here and I
[5405.76] want you to look at these edges. Do you
[5408.0] see how these edges are very sharp
[5411.88] angular? See that? Okay. Well, this
[5416.159] would be completely contradicted by
[5418.96] nlacial transport which would grind off.
[5422.32] There would be no sharp
[5424.199] corners surviving in trainment within a
[5427.84] glacier and then being carried hundreds
[5431.04] of miles without and still showing up at
[5435.6] the at its destination with this kind of
[5439.44] articulated sharp angular corners still
[5442.239] intact. So, it's not like it was frozen
[5445.04] in an ice cube and then slid all the way
[5448.239] down here and then it melted. Pretty
[5450.88] much. Yeah. But you have to think of
[5452.639] you've got this glacier mass and in this
[5455.04] glacier mass you've got this dynamic
[5457.04] flow of ice, right? So now this rock is
[5460.56] put on top of it and as it slowly moves
[5463.28] down 100, 200, 300 feet per year with
[5466.96] some exceptions because there will be
[5468.639] some surge events within there. um as
[5471.36] it's moving down, it's continually
[5473.679] snowing each year. So each year it's
[5476.199] accumulating another three, four, five,
[5479.04] six feet of snow, then the next year,
[5481.36] then the then it's buried. Then as that
[5484.48] continues to accumulate those layers of
[5487.199] snow that came down immediately
[5490.239] subsequent to that rock being placed on
[5493.04] that glacier it's going to get buried
[5495.84] under hundreds first hundreds then
[5497.679] thousands of feet of additional
[5499.04] accumulated glacial ice. So that is the
[5502.639] problem where we see boulders that we
[5505.36] know have been entrained and carried
[5508.0] within glaciers. They don't come out
[5510.4] with this kind of pristine angular
[5513.0] corners. They're ground. You think think
[5516.08] of if you throw a throw a rock in a in a
[5518.96] rock tumbler, right? Well, with the
[5521.6] glacier, it's like a slow motion rock
[5523.76] tumbler, but the end result is that it's
[5526.56] going to shear off corners, sharp
[5528.679] corners, that sort of thing. You don't
[5531.199] see that here. That's what I'm trying to
[5532.88] call your attention to. So, you had to
[5535.44] have a method of transport that's not
[5537.28] going to have that grinding
[5539.92] uh effect on the boulder. It has to be
[5542.88] transported more or less pristine. In
[5544.8] other words, these fracture lines here
[5548.4] are only slightly younger than the
[5551.92] fracture line that separated, let's say,
[5554.8] this face here from the original
[5557.32] mountain. And there's been very little
[5559.679] erosion on it, right? It's it was
[5561.84] carried this far, 300 miles, set down in
[5565.76] this floor of unconsolidated alovvium.
[5569.44] It came in with its angles intact.
[5573.88] Uh, how do you do that? Well, here you
[5576.4] have several things happen to be
[5577.76] simultaneous. The only way you're going
[5580.4] to get this rock here carried, you can't
[5584.0] bring it in the water itself, right?
[5586.32] Because if if the water is turbulent and
[5588.88] forceful enough that this that it's
[5592.199] transporting that this 18,000 ton rock
[5595.36] could be transported within the within
[5597.52] the flow. Well, it's going to get busted
[5600.32] up long before it gets here. It's going
[5604.0] to get busted up in the first 10, 20, 30
[5606.239] miles of transport. Boom. That rock
[5607.92] ain't that rock by the time it got to
[5610.56] here, it's gravel. See, you're not going
[5613.04] to have this. Not not in water
[5614.96] transport. So, we can exclude that. We
[5617.92] can
[5618.6] exclude end glacial or within the
[5621.199] glacial transport because wouldn't
[5623.36] necessarily turn it into gravel, but it
[5625.36] would definitely grind it up and and it
[5627.92] would start with any sharp corners, any
[5630.08] angularities, any fresh uh exposed rock
[5634.56] is going to be the first that that
[5636.4] succumbs to the to the slow motion
[5640.4] uh tumbling and rolling of the block
[5642.639] within the glacier mass. So, what does
[5645.36] that leave? Well, it couldn't be
[5647.92] transported. I think we can exclude
[5650.0] transport within the glacier. It's
[5652.96] certainly not going to be under the
[5654.679] glacier. That's not going to survive. It
[5657.28] had to be on top of the glacier, right?
[5661.32] But that
[5663.56] glacier has to be in water. It has to be
[5667.12] an iceberg.
[5671.04] Okay. Yeah. So, it's on top of the
[5673.639] glacier or it's an iceberg essentially
[5676.32] moving through. I mean, I would I would
[5679.04] guess rapidly moving water. Yes. That's
[5682.239] loaded with sediment and it's dropping
[5684.719] all of these these rocks along the way.
[5688.0] Well, what you picture is a very large
[5691.4] flood choked with
[5693.8] sediment, choked with icebergs. And on
[5696.719] many of these icebergs are the remains
[5700.4] of this Mount Edith Edith
[5704.12] Caval rocks that have been quarried from
[5709.12] the mountain which we assume at the time
[5711.76] was a nun attack. So if if you know and
[5715.84] of course all of these assumptions can
[5717.84] you can go into them much more
[5720.159] specifically and you know when you begin
[5722.56] to really look at each one there is each
[5724.4] one seems to have evidence in its favor.
[5726.96] What we're describing here is somewhat
[5728.48] speculative, but it's still it's
[5730.08] consistent with what we know about the
[5731.679] whole
[5732.44] process, but there are big blanks like
[5737.12] by what process are the original
[5741.88] rocks excised or uh disconnected from
[5747.36] the original
[5748.6] mountains placed onto the ice. And what
[5751.92] it looks like is you have a scenario
[5754.08] that would
[5755.8] require almost instantaneously the imp
[5759.6] placement of the the boulders onto the
[5762.4] ice, the fracturing of the ice, and the
[5765.92] melting of the ice. The melting of the
[5768.56] ice provides the flow that then
[5771.84] transported the icebergs which were the
[5775.199] fractured pieces of the ice that were so
[5778.8] you had part of the ice sheet basically
[5781.239] smashed into
[5784.92] icebergs. Presumably the same
[5787.639] force smashes the the Rocky Mountain
[5791.36] peaks that are now shoveled or
[5794.32] avalanched out onto the ice sheet
[5797.199] itself. The ice sheet is undergoing
[5800.32] massive melting. And so now the broken
[5803.679] pieces that have the massive
[5807.239] boulders avalanched onto them are now
[5809.92] being swept down into the meltwater
[5812.239] flow. It discharges from the Rocky
[5815.52] Mountain front. Topography directs it to
[5818.08] the south. And most likely what happened
[5820.639] was when you on the other side of the uh
[5825.28] of this
[5826.84] corridor through which these uh erratics
[5830.239] are
[5831.0] strewn stood the uh the Laurentide ice
[5834.56] sheet front. So the water couldn't just
[5838.0] flow to the east because the front of
[5840.96] the Laurentide the great Laurentide ice
[5843.04] sheet stood in its way which would have
[5845.84] deflected the flow to the south. So
[5848.679] interestingly the or foothills erratics
[5852.08] train defines the same thing that is
[5854.96] known as the icefree corridor which was
[5858.08] assumed to have been a passageway for uh
[5862.32] the migration of both people and animals
[5865.76] and this probably would have happened
[5868.08] pre younger
[5870.119] dus to the to the east of the ice free
[5875.04] corridor is there more glacial structure
[5877.84] structures. Is there more glaciers?
[5879.679] Well, yeah. I mean, there's moranes,
[5882.0] huge morine deposits that were created
[5884.0] by the Laurentide ice sheet. And we can
[5886.719] see some of the the the rocks that are
[5888.56] in that have been transported hundreds
[5890.56] and hundreds of miles from further east,
[5893.28] carried by the glaciers, and then dumped
[5895.44] as terminal morings immediately to the
[5898.08] east of the erratic train. So you had
[5901.44] these two great ice sheets and they met
[5904.32] the Laurent tide the bigger of the two
[5906.96] centered over Hudson Bay reaching all
[5909.36] the way to the foot of the rocky see and
[5911.119] and in fact during the late glacial
[5912.6] maximum there was no ice free corridor
[5915.199] the Laurent tide and the cordier and ice
[5917.119] sheets they met and and and flowed
[5920.04] together. This did not happen apparently
[5922.8] then but I you know again it says this
[5925.679] was about 14,000 and we 15,000 and we
[5928.719] saw
[5929.639] 149 and I was suggesting 146
[5933.76] um but that remains to be seen because
[5936.4] if this 146 then it puts this um exactly
[5940.88] consistent with
[5943.159] um meltwater pulse 1A. So so let's kind
[5947.76] of put together what we've got here. We
[5949.36] have to contrive a scenario that will
[5953.48] fracture huge amounts of bedrock. Let
[5956.32] let's say Mount Edith Caval, avalanche
[5959.199] this stuff out onto the glacier surface.
[5963.04] Then the glacier has to be broken
[5965.28] because the only way you're going to
[5966.88] transport these boulders from their
[5969.76] source is through iceberg transport.
[5972.239] just like we know has happened and we've
[5974.08] looked at and documented and we've seen
[5976.239] the evidence for for that mode of
[5978.639] transport in the scandal channel
[5981.52] scablands. Right. Yeah. Right. We saw
[5984.32] boulders there that were transported by
[5987.04] icebergs and and we saw some of we
[5990.08] learned about Berg mounds. Remember Berg
[5991.84] mounds? Yes. Right. Because let's say
[5994.4] you've got a big dirty iceberg but you
[5996.4] don't have a boulder sitting on it. But
[5999.28] then that dirty iceberg comes to ground.
[6001.76] it melts and all of that dirt and debris
[6004.88] and gravel and everything that's in it
[6006.719] will make a pile.
[6008.88] And you can trace these piles once you
[6010.88] know the genesis of these these piles
[6012.96] over the landscape that they're Berg
[6014.56] mounds. That's one of the proxies we use
[6016.96] for at least up in the glaciated
[6019.56] terrains to to to uh identify flow
[6023.719] pathways, you know. Okay, if you see a
[6025.92] field full of Berg mounds, you know,
[6027.6] okay, there was a current flow that
[6029.679] swept over this. There were icebergs in
[6031.6] it. Those icebergs came to ground. So,
[6034.96] what we've what we've be able to deduce
[6037.199] now from all of this, we've looked at,
[6040.119] okay, we're looking at water transport
[6042.639] and that is that is confirmed by the
[6045.52] fact that the valley floor would would
[6047.6] have is the valley floor is consistent
[6049.76] with having been unconsolidated alvium,
[6052.639] which if you've got the water flow, it's
[6055.199] going to be choked with sediment right
[6057.119] within. It's not clean water at all.
[6059.199] It's dirty water. And when that flood
[6062.0] water subsides, it leaves behind
[6064.239] essentially a big thick layer of mud.
[6066.96] Mhm. So now here's what you can picture.
[6070.96] You have to come up with a source, a
[6073.84] force, an energy that can simultaneous,
[6076.56] virtually
[6078.199] simultaneously
[6080.04] fracture the flanks of the mountains
[6083.44] extending above the glaciers in the form
[6085.199] of nun attacks. fracture those,
[6087.36] avalanche them out onto the ice. At the
[6089.28] same time, huge volumes of that ice are
[6091.52] being melted. And then there's enough of
[6093.6] a current that that current is taking uh
[6096.48] these chunks of ice and washing them
[6098.719] out, washing them through the Atabaska
[6101.92] Valley, discharging at the Rocky
[6104.32] Mountain front, washing up against the
[6107.04] wall of the Laurentide ice sheet and
[6109.679] being deflected to the south. So all of
[6112.08] this stuff is surging out. Let's go back
[6114.6] to the mountain. I mean to the to the um
[6118.96] the map. The map. So, I'll stop and then
[6122.159] I'll reshare. I'm getting really good at
[6124.8] this. Yeah. Um well, you might want to
[6127.92] keep going on this point, but I have a I
[6129.44] have a question about it. I mean, what
[6131.36] did they find underneath the rock? Has
[6133.28] anybody looked under? No, I don't think
[6135.119] anybody's excavated under it. I mean,
[6138.159] actually dug under it. Any scans? Yeah,
[6142.32] there there have been some Yeah, there
[6143.679] have been some stuff. That's why it's I
[6145.92] can say that this is like a thick part
[6148.239] of this rock is actually buried
[6150.679] underground. Okay, we're now back here.
[6153.04] Let's go to Mount uh let's see, Mount
[6156.159] Edith Caval. Okay, let's say that we go
[6159.28] in here and we look and we see several
[6162.159] Let's focus in. I hope it focuses it
[6164.239] better than this. Uh, but we can see
[6168.159] several places that look like they could
[6169.92] be good candidates. Like look at this.
[6172.56] This has been scooped out here by
[6175.0] glaciers. Um, let's see if we get some
[6177.76] pictures of Mount Edith
[6179.96] Caval. There we go.
[6187.159] So those rocks came from somewhere were
[6192.32] part of this mountain once and they
[6194.719] would have been from up near the top
[6196.32] because the assumption is is that at the
[6198.96] time uh they were quarried most of these
[6203.6] valleys were completely filled with ice.
[6206.28] So it' be interesting and I haven't done
[6208.8] this but I would guess you could go
[6211.92] maybe using uh
[6214.76] OSL looking at just the geomorphology
[6217.679] and and actually finding the spot where
[6221.6] these if you were to reverse if you were
[6223.679] to play this film backwards 15,000 years
[6227.36] and then see this stuff going back up
[6229.119] and then becoming part of the mountain
[6231.36] where exactly was it? I don't know. But
[6236.0] you can actually see, and I have looked
[6237.92] on Google Earth. We maybe should pull
[6239.92] that up in a minute.
[6242.36] Um, let's see if I close this
[6245.48] out.
[6247.08] Uh, maybe was it going to focus for
[6251.48] us? Well, there's plenty of candidate
[6254.4] locations of where this sculpting could
[6256.719] have taken place, but you have to
[6259.6] transport it through this valley here.
[6261.84] And and look at the floor of the valley.
[6265.76] You see these long linear trends and
[6268.639] look up here. You can see Oh yeah, here
[6270.719] very clearly the results of this
[6272.679] catastrophic flow through this valley.
[6276.159] You can see it very clearly right
[6278.48] through here. So you had water flows
[6280.4] coming down. Let's see. There's Mount
[6284.119] Robson right
[6286.52] here. Oh yeah, now we're getting it. Now
[6288.88] we're starting to get some resolution.
[6291.119] So it could have been anywhere along
[6293.84] this probably along this western
[6296.159] southwestern flank that that if Robson
[6299.199] was the source. This southwestern flank
[6302.32] looks like it would have been the most
[6303.6] likely location. Like look at this right
[6306.08] here. This could have been this could
[6308.4] have been
[6310.239] uh quarried out right here.
[6313.56] Um Google Earth could probably tell you
[6316.08] something. But in any case, either way,
[6318.48] you can see that the rivers
[6321.96] uh
[6323.88] converge right
[6327.4] here and then flows up to the
[6332.36] north.
[6334.04] And oh, you look, you see the flat floor
[6336.96] here. That's all sediment left. Comes
[6340.32] out this way. And we should be able to
[6343.6] actually find the channels.
[6346.239] probably let's see through here because
[6349.04] I don't know exactly where the
[6350.8] Laurentide front was but it was
[6352.48] somewhere out in here and that's why the
[6356.0] water couldn't keep flowing east it had
[6357.92] to get turned to the south and then Okto
[6362.719] got dumped here so there would have been
[6366.56] a very large iceberg necessary to
[6369.679] transport Okatoes so the size of that
[6372.719] iceberg might give one a idea of the uh
[6377.28] magnitude of this flow that's coming
[6379.04] through here because that iceberg is
[6381.44] probably the size of a tanker ship
[6383.36] that's carrying this as it as its cargo.
[6386.56] Now, you got to picture that the final
[6388.4] stages of that process is that the
[6390.8] iceberg is being swept along in the
[6392.679] flow. And because it's the biggest
[6395.679] iceberg, it probably was one of the
[6397.6] first ones to come to ground. But so the
[6400.0] iceberg comes to ground literally,
[6402.88] right? It stalls at some point because
[6405.76] as the flood waters are declining, it's
[6408.08] losing its competency to transport mass.
[6412.159] So the first thing that settles out is
[6414.56] going to be the heaviest and biggest
[6416.159] stuff. So the iceberg comes to ground,
[6419.84] it's in a bed of of soft material, but
[6423.52] then the iceberg itself has to melt
[6425.679] away. Now, it might take years for that
[6428.32] iceberg to melt away, but bear in mind
[6430.96] that that iceberg melting away is also
[6433.44] going to keep that the substrate, the
[6436.159] ground underneath perpetually wet and
[6438.28] soft until the iceberg is gone and then
[6442.32] the modern climate regime can come in
[6444.4] and all of that. But so the final stage
[6448.48] of this process is actually rather slow
[6450.719] and gentle because the the force to
[6455.199] create this flood and the uh and the
[6459.04] armada of undoubtedly hundreds or
[6462.08] probably thousands of icebergs being
[6464.8] carried along. The water flow had to be
[6467.639] enormous. There had to be a lot of
[6469.76] icebergs because each iceberg every
[6472.639] iceberg isn't going to be carrying a
[6474.159] rock. So you probably got for every
[6476.0] rock, you probably got 10 or 20 or more
[6478.4] icebergs being carried along in there.
[6481.119] But there's enough rocks to show that
[6484.48] there had to have been more than just
[6486.159] melting of the of the glaciers because
[6489.92] you have to you have to impose enough
[6492.119] force that you're going to fracture the
[6495.679] flanks of the mountains, the shoulders
[6497.76] of the mountains protruding above the
[6500.0] ice
[6500.92] sheet. So how do you do that? I don't
[6503.679] know other than I could speculate and I
[6506.8] would speculate some type of an impact
[6509.719] event whether an atmospheric explosion
[6513.4] or actual impacts but where would you
[6516.32] look for actual impacts? Um I don't know
[6520.8] other than if we go north of
[6524.92] here you'll notice you've got this long
[6527.679] trough and you can see that the valleys
[6531.04] are all interconnected here.
[6533.76] See this? Mhm. Look at this. Okay. But
[6537.92] then you trace this channel
[6542.52] north all the way up to
[6545.719] here and you get up to Prince
[6549.159] George. Uh, and all of this area up in
[6552.8] here. Let's see. Where's Prince George?
[6555.52] Let's zoom out. There it is. Prince
[6557.84] George. Right there.
[6562.4] And there's something interesting going
[6563.92] on when you start looking at the
[6565.28] landscape around Prince
[6569.159] George. And here you can
[6572.04] see what we're getting into. Do you see
[6574.8] what we're looking at here? Yeah.
[6576.88] Chevrons.
[6578.639] Drumlands. Drumlands. Thousands and
[6581.679] thousands of
[6583.239] Drumlands. We've looked at Drumls,
[6585.44] haven't we? Mhm. I think we've actually
[6587.679] looked at Prince George very briefly
[6589.84] before.
[6592.639] Now, Drumlands are a paleocurren
[6596.04] indicator. They can tell us which way
[6598.32] the water is
[6601.4] flowing. The blunt end faces of a of a
[6604.719] drumland. The blunt end faces up
[6608.36] current faces upstream. So, if you're
[6611.28] looking at this, what was the direction
[6612.719] of flow that sculpted these drumlins?
[6616.48] The blunt end faces upstream. Yes. The
[6620.159] blunt end
[6622.04] faces the direction that the current is
[6624.719] coming from. Yeah. Well, they're they're
[6627.52] coming south.
[6631.679] Do you see a blunt end? When I say blunt
[6634.4] end, look at this right
[6637.159] here. This is blunt. You see this? This
[6639.76] is the blunt end. And then you have a
[6641.52] tapered end. Look at Look at these.
[6643.44] These are more clear. See the south ends
[6646.56] of them are blunt and then they taper
[6650.48] as you go north. So this is telling you
[6652.8] which direction.
[6654.88] Now these are subglacial flows we're
[6657.199] talking about. This is a movement
[6659.639] massive subglacial water movement has
[6663.36] created this landscape that you're
[6665.04] looking at here. And which way is this
[6667.92] flow going? It's going southsoutheast. I
[6672.32] mean souths southwest to
[6675.08] northnortheast. And it's coming right up
[6677.639] here headed like it's going straight for
[6680.32] Prince
[6682.28] George. And you see that over
[6686.6] here the top end of the Rocky Mountain
[6689.32] trench. It goes all the way down all the
[6694.88] way down.
[6697.119] all the way
[6698.52] down all the way down to Flathead
[6702.76] Lake. And then it opens into the uh into
[6707.36] the uh basin here, the Mission Basin
[6711.28] it's called, because these are the
[6712.56] Mission Mountains here. And at the south
[6715.679] end of Flathead
[6719.08] Lake, you've got this hummicky stuff
[6722.0] which is terminal morane. And I think
[6725.52] we've defined terminal morine, haven't
[6727.36] we? I believe so. I I know we've defined
[6730.4] more rain,
[6732.199] right? There's more rain and then
[6734.8] there's less rain. And if you have no
[6737.599] rain at all, it's known as a drought,
[6739.76] right? Okay. Good. I'm glad you you're
[6742.239] straight on that. Thank you. Oh, thank
[6744.4] you. What is what is terminal
[6747.719] morraine to bear?
[6751.84] So, we'll look it up. Terminal morine.
[6754.56] So first of all, let's define morine.
[6756.48] Morane is the ground mass that's created
[6758.719] by the glacier grinding over and
[6760.56] pulverizing the landscape. The terminus
[6763.52] of the glacier is where the snout of the
[6766.159] glacier where the glacier ends, right?
[6768.96] That's all also called the zone of
[6770.88] ablation. It's where the the the tip the
[6774.639] end of the glacial
[6776.76] tongue tends to melt back as fast as
[6779.679] it's growing. Right?
[6782.08] The moringane that piles up at the
[6785.52] glacial terminus is called terminal
[6788.679] moring. So right here you have terminal
[6791.679] moring. And what this terminal moring
[6794.08] that you see right here does is it tells
[6797.84] you that this was the southernmost
[6800.28] extension of this lobe of ice because
[6803.36] here's the here's the moring right here.
[6805.52] And you can go through it. I've been
[6807.119] through this many times and you know
[6809.28] we've take groups to outcrops to show
[6811.599] there's some great outcrops where you
[6813.36] can just really see okay this is morine
[6815.52] doesn't seem very interesting because
[6817.04] it's just there's nothing there except a
[6818.96] jumbled mass of incoherent stuff chaotic
[6823.119] stuff from sand to gravel to to cobbles
[6826.239] to boulders to you know other kinds of
[6829.36] stuff but mostly that and there's no
[6832.08] structure to it there's no architecture
[6834.56] there seems to be no stratification to
[6836.8] it. And that is what how you distinguish
[6839.76] a deposition from a glacier because it's
[6842.32] a structural mass structureless mass
[6845.52] from the deposition of water that will
[6847.52] usually have some kind of architecture
[6849.44] within it. Um showing bedding and and
[6852.48] sorting of of the constituents of of the
[6857.04] deposit, right?
[6858.679] So structure architecture in water
[6862.84] flow chaos no structure in glacier flow.
[6867.04] So morane but see here's where where
[6869.84] where drumlands get interesting because
[6872.8] drumlands start out as incoherent
[6875.76] chaotic jumbled pulverized glacier mass
[6879.599] subglacial
[6881.08] mass. But then you look at a at a
[6883.679] Drumland field and there's structure to
[6886.239] it. Like just compare what we just saw
[6888.719] with Drumland swarms compared to this.
[6891.599] This well there's some structure here,
[6894.239] right? You can kind of almost see that
[6896.88] there's kind of a a recessional effect
[6899.44] going on right here. Mhm. So you've got
[6902.08] this mass here and then probably a short
[6905.599] passage of time because this glacier is
[6908.719] now melting back right after the
[6912.32] catastrophic
[6914.04] disruption which completely
[6917.84] uh causes the the the conversion of
[6921.119] large amounts of glacier into first of
[6924.32] all water and then of
[6926.599] course you know solid chunks of ice. But
[6930.32] then after a period of time, the point I
[6933.76] guess I'm trying to make here is that we
[6935.92] could estimate maybe a quarter maybe a
[6938.32] third of the of the I don't think as
[6940.719] much as a half of the glaciers are
[6943.719] destroyed in these convulsive events
[6946.92] because what happens is it seems like
[6949.84] the convulsive
[6951.88] event separates two glacier regimes. One
[6956.32] is that prior to that the glaciers are
[6958.719] living glaciers. You have a zone of
[6961.48] accumulation. You have a zone of
[6963.32] ablation. The the you know in the
[6965.679] highlands the the glaciers are
[6967.84] accumulating. Each year's mass of snow
[6971.44] adds to the growth of the glacier. The
[6973.92] weight of that pushes the on the glacier
[6976.639] and causes a dynamic flow downhill all
[6980.0] the way down to the snout of the glacier
[6983.52] where most of the melting takes place.
[6986.08] In between the zone of accumulation and
[6989.28] the zone of ablation, there's this
[6991.599] inflection point, the equilibrium point
[6994.84] where accumulation where the transition
[6998.08] occurs from the glacier growing to the
[7001.28] glacier shrinking, right? That's called
[7003.84] the equilibrium line. So in colder times
[7006.96] the equilibrium line uh goes up. In
[7011.04] warmer times the equilibrium line
[7012.88] equilibrium line comes down. Okay. So,
[7015.92] if it comes down, it's going to be more
[7017.92] readily melting. But in either case, you
[7020.639] see what you've got right here is
[7022.8] terminal morine. We can zoom out and we
[7026.0] can go oh, let's go up here. We can see
[7029.679] here's another example of terminal
[7031.639] moring. So, what happened was you had
[7034.0] this major glacier lobe coming down and
[7037.679] it tricated into three sublobes. One of
[7041.76] them got diverted right back to the
[7044.52] northwest. One of them got diverted to
[7046.96] the west and another one got diverted to
[7049.28] the south. The one that diverted to the
[7051.44] south left its calling card in the form
[7053.679] of this morine called the Pulson morine.
[7057.119] This lobe terminated right here. You can
[7060.679] see, look here, you've got the flat
[7063.36] outwash plane that was in front of the
[7065.76] glacier snout. And here's where the
[7068.08] glacier snout was. Mhm. So all of this
[7070.8] here's all of this right here is lateral
[7073.199] morane because it was on the side of the
[7075.92] glacier. Then this is the terminal
[7078.28] morraine right here. And there was a
[7081.199] natural breach of meltwater through that
[7084.159] terminal morraine which provided the
[7086.159] most convenient and economically uh
[7088.639] feasible place to route state to place
[7091.599] state route 28. So here's an example of
[7095.52] you know humans coming by thousands of
[7098.239] years later and taking advantage of the
[7101.199] features in the landscape that were
[7102.96] created by these natural events. But
[7105.84] interestingly there was another major
[7108.52] flow. We looked at this came down right
[7111.28] through this way and just like when
[7114.719] right it it was this the glacier lobe
[7117.44] was here. So when this water flow came
[7120.4] down and hit the glacier lobe, it was
[7122.159] diverted to the west and you can trace
[7124.56] its path right down this way and it
[7127.76] flowed out. So if you were looking at
[7129.44] this over at the time this flood
[7132.159] happened, this would have been a nun
[7133.92] attack right here, right? All of this
[7136.639] was buried under ice and now you've got
[7138.639] this major subglacial flow coming from
[7142.159] the north here. So why did it divert to
[7145.119] the northwest? Why did one of the loes
[7147.04] divert to the northwest? Uh well, I
[7150.0] would imagine I would imagine that you
[7152.56] know if you look at this is this is a
[7154.32] smaller lobe than this lobe and that's a
[7157.44] smaller lobe than this lobe. I see.
[7159.679] Right. And it was probably just because
[7162.56] if you can see here the mountains are
[7165.28] bottlenecking. So that means that the
[7167.76] ice would have been piling up here,
[7170.32] right? It's being fed from the ice is
[7172.56] continuing to flow south. The big main
[7175.679] trunk has got this big glacier flowing
[7178.32] south, right? Well, when this diverts to
[7181.44] the west, what's happening? It's trying
[7183.679] to go into this this V-shaped valley.
[7186.4] You can see how the valley is getting
[7187.92] narrower. So, that causes the ice to
[7190.32] pile up. And when it does, the path of
[7192.8] least resistance probably was this to
[7196.0] the north. However, when that lobe did
[7199.04] divert to the to the northwest, it it
[7202.159] left its own hand, you know, sculpting
[7204.239] of the landscape. And I mean, you can
[7206.159] see where the the glaciers came ground
[7208.639] their way around this way. And then you
[7210.8] can come up here and here's terminal
[7212.719] morine right up
[7214.52] here, right? And then you had this huge
[7218.0] flow that came down. And prior to that
[7221.119] flow, this ridge was would have been all
[7224.48] connected. So this island wouldn't have
[7226.48] been an island. It would have been a
[7227.76] continuous ridge going right up here.
[7229.84] This right here now is a 500 ft cliff.
[7232.159] This trough, you can see this was a
[7234.719] spillway right here. And right here
[7237.84] where there's a a lake that occupies the
[7240.639] bottom of this trough, this spillway
[7242.719] trough, because as the water rounded
[7244.96] this curve, it was particularly
[7246.96] turbulent. And because it was turbulent,
[7249.199] it was able to ground to erode up the
[7251.679] the the bottom of the channel quicker.
[7254.32] You see? So you've got a scour trough
[7257.52] right here and there's another one right
[7260.0] up
[7261.719] here. So this was a water flow pathway.
[7265.04] So you can chart all this and this is
[7266.4] where Google maps and Google Earth and
[7268.96] all comes in so handy. Um because you
[7271.76] know few generations we ago we didn't
[7273.84] have these tools.
[7275.76] Um, so all of this is just this clogging
[7278.96] of sediment that occurred between the
[7281.28] mountain ridge here and the the thick
[7283.84] glacier lobe here. So you had this
[7285.52] trough between them. So that became a
[7288.159] conduit and it flowed down and the whole
[7291.36] floor of this valley here has all of the
[7294.719] the sculpting of the side show the
[7297.199] turbulent verticular motion of the water
[7300.0] as it's moving through. It was choked
[7302.32] with sediment because when the flood
[7304.48] waters finally subsided, it left this
[7307.119] flat area here. And if you were to dig
[7310.719] down, if you were to flush all of this
[7312.4] out, you would have seen that pre flood,
[7314.48] it was a V-shaped valley floor. And if
[7317.84] you filled this up, I don't know, two to
[7320.32] 300 feet. There's probably two to 300
[7322.239] feet at least of a flat sedimentary
[7325.32] floor in in uh this is called big draw
[7329.04] here. Okay. And on our on our uh Montana
[7333.76] tours, we follow this route because we
[7336.639] follow the route of the flood water. And
[7339.599] it Okay. So then it filled up with two
[7342.0] 300 feet of sediment making it flat.
[7344.48] Yes. Yeah.
[7346.639] Yep. And then look, the water gets
[7348.639] diverted to the south right here and
[7351.36] flows down through the little bitter
[7353.76] root
[7354.679] valley and and it's diverted because is
[7357.679] there a glacier there or is there some
[7359.36] type of Yes, there's Yeah. Yeah. There
[7361.119] the glaciers would have been probably,
[7363.44] you know, right in here. I don't know
[7364.88] exactly where they were because part of
[7367.44] the problem is and I haven't been up
[7368.88] here. You know, this could be remnants
[7370.32] of morraine here. I haven't been up
[7372.8] here. I've been down 28 many times, but
[7375.92] I've never gotten out and explored
[7378.239] intimately this area up here. But it's
[7380.159] likely that, you know, if you picture
[7382.239] this is buried in glaciers here, that
[7385.199] glacier line is going to come across
[7387.199] right in here. So yeah, you're going to
[7388.48] have these mountain glaciers that are
[7390.48] part of the cordier and ice sheet. This
[7392.96] is probably where they stopped right
[7395.08] here, right? It would make sense because
[7397.679] right here the glacier lobe is usually
[7400.4] going to project further south than just
[7404.639] the normal edge of the ice. You'll have
[7406.639] the normal edge of the ice sheet and
[7408.8] then in places where the topography is
[7411.44] conducive, you will have these tongues
[7414.32] flowing off, right? And so those create
[7416.88] those glacier lobes. So, it's most
[7420.08] likely what you're going to have is the
[7421.599] glaciers are covering these mountains,
[7424.08] but there would have been enough open
[7425.76] area in the valley here that this water
[7428.639] came down, rushing down, and then it hit
[7430.96] these hills right
[7432.679] here. And you can see that there are
[7435.119] several places where the water breached
[7437.28] the hills right here. And here you see
[7440.48] some scour trough lakes right here,
[7443.599] Schmidt's Lake. Uh where else? Uh there
[7446.719] would have been a flow that came down
[7448.8] this way as well. And if I go
[7452.199] to satellite view and I zoom in, we
[7456.239] looked at this. Remember this? Yes.
[7459.04] There's your giant current ripples. Mhm.
[7464.08] And you can actually see there's
[7465.52] multiple stream, multiple mega flows
[7468.4] coming through here. Um so look at this.
[7471.36] Here's a mega flow coming through here.
[7476.4] Right here is a mega flow. You can see
[7479.679] it. Look, two flows right here. Here's
[7482.4] one. Here's one. There. They're almost
[7483.84] conjoined right here at the hip. And
[7486.48] then they separate down
[7490.76] here. the the the the the peak here of
[7494.159] the the depth of this water through this
[7496.56] camis prairie here was we we can know
[7500.0] because we know the the uh elevation
[7502.159] above sea level of the of the basin
[7504.719] floor and we can we can trace the high
[7507.52] water mark up on the valley walls and on
[7510.719] the valley on the mountain walls the the
[7513.119] the water high water mark was at 4,200
[7516.719] ft above sea level 4,200
[7520.4] so the alley floor is 2,800 ft above sea
[7523.88] level. So from that we can determine
[7526.719] that it was the water at its maximum
[7528.4] depth coming through here was 1,400 ft
[7530.56] 1,400 ft deep and it's 5 miles wide
[7534.32] there and it's probably moving at 40 to
[7537.199] 50 m an hour and it would have been
[7539.199] choked again with icebergs. But see
[7543.48] this so now we've kind of raised an
[7547.36] interesting question. I've kind of
[7549.28] showed you this connection now between
[7551.92] the Rocky Mountain Trench with it with
[7554.639] at its south end is feeding into Lake
[7557.84] Missoula. Yeah. And at its north end is
[7560.96] up here on this interesting terrain up
[7563.44] here that's characterized by these
[7565.199] massive drumland swarms.
[7568.719] Now, could all of this be related to
[7571.76] what's going on over here with the
[7574.599] foothills trains? I would say it's
[7578.0] almost 100% certain. It would be quite
[7580.96] the coincidence if not if not.
[7584.84] Yes. But you see, here's the thing.
[7587.119] Here's here's here's again
[7589.48] uh
[7591.32] mainstream doesn't just like in the same
[7593.44] way. Bonavville flood and Missoula flood
[7595.84] are two separate unrelated events. Yep.
[7598.88] Oh, here's another one. Here's another
[7601.76] this event if we want to call it the the
[7604.48] Calgary flood or the Aabaska flood. I
[7607.599] call it the Aabaska flood because of the
[7610.56] Aabaska River, right? Well, is that also
[7614.76] unrelated? But if it's related to the
[7617.119] Missoula flood and the Bonavville is in
[7620.0] some way related to the Missoula flood,
[7621.679] then they're all three related to each
[7622.96] other, aren't they? I would think so.
[7625.199] One would think so. Let's go
[7628.52] back
[7630.28] to my other screen. Yeah, this might be
[7633.52] jumping ahead here, but are we looking
[7636.159] at Prince George as a potential point
[7640.599] where that catalyzed this?
[7644.96] Well, I think that Yeah, and in fact,
[7647.28] that's exactly where I'm going with
[7649.079] this. Okay, so let's just continue on
[7651.76] with the slideshow. Next slide. See the
[7654.8] yellow line that represents the Alberta
[7658.4] Montana state line.
[7661.76] You see what we're looking at here?
[7665.76] Ah, it looks
[7668.599] like giant a giant ripple train. And you
[7673.52] see this white line here? Mhm. That's a
[7676.96] mile long. Whoa. So these are massive.
[7682.679] Well, if you go back and you follow the
[7685.28] erratic strain to where it passes into
[7688.32] Montana, this is what you see. So, this
[7691.84] is further. This to me is confirmation.
[7694.159] Yeah, we're talking about really large
[7697.92] water flows. This is further west
[7701.04] um of further east. Further east.
[7704.719] Further east. Yes.
[7709.0] Uh, in fact, it's the Milk River that
[7712.44] flows through here. So, let's go back up
[7715.84] where you can see where Calgary is. So,
[7718.8] the train comes right down this way,
[7721.84] comes
[7722.84] over, and you can actually start seeing
[7726.48] there's a pathway right in here by Milk
[7729.239] River. And if we zoom in, let's see if I
[7732.48] can catch this on the first attempt.
[7736.159] Uh, let's see if we zoom in. Let's see.
[7740.159] We should be able to see them. They're
[7741.84] right in here. Let's
[7744.52] see. Where is it? Where is They're right
[7747.199] in here. You can see the giant ripple
[7749.32] train. Um, Milk River. Okay. Maybe it's
[7753.28] over here. Let's see. Yeah, there it is.
[7756.239] Right there it is.
[7758.32] So that water came flowed down this way
[7762.84] and passed over
[7766.119] from Alberta into what is upper
[7770.4] uh Montana. And you can see where
[7772.4] several places it starts down cutting
[7775.96] channels.
[7777.719] And we have if I go back to
[7780.92] here, let's see here, Milk River. We
[7785.52] should be able there. Look. So this
[7788.96] should be recognizable to you now.
[7791.119] Underfit river, right? Yeah. A modern.
[7795.119] So this this is the Missouri River.
[7799.199] So in other words, this flood that came
[7803.52] from these
[7805.0] melting huge ice sheets over the
[7807.52] continental divide washed down along the
[7810.639] Rocky east of the Rocky Mountain front,
[7812.96] loaded and choked with gigantic icebergs
[7816.239] that were loaded with huge boulders of
[7819.119] metacortsite that came most likely from
[7822.079] the flanks of Mount Ether
[7824.599] Caval strewn for a line of 500 miles
[7828.159] along the corridor between the Cordieran
[7831.52] ice sheet and the Laurentide ice sheet.
[7834.079] At the end of where the we see that
[7837.36] right there where the erratics train
[7839.96] stops is pretty much where we start
[7842.239] seeing the giant current ripple field
[7844.96] and then that goes in and begins to
[7847.199] carve down the valley that is now
[7850.079] occupied by the Missouri River. So
[7853.04] ultimately where was all this water
[7854.4] headed? It was headed for the Gulf of
[7855.92] Mexico.
[7858.8] So if you were in a raft sitting up on
[7862.079] the sitting on the glacier next to Mount
[7864.48] Edith Caval and somehow you survived,
[7867.199] the end of your journey would be the
[7868.96] Gulf of Mexico. Hey, I'll take that
[7870.88] journey. I'd do it for the weather.
[7873.44] Yeah. Well, maybe maybe I'd take it like
[7876.96] the second half. Yeah. Not the first. Um
[7881.28] but so you're beginning to get the
[7883.76] picture here, I hope. Is that Okay. So
[7886.48] now Missouri River, right? When you
[7890.079] think of the Missouri River, you're not
[7891.44] necessarily immediately the first thing
[7893.599] that pops into your mind is not any of
[7896.4] what we've just just looked at here.
[7899.44] Yeah. Gigantic catastrophic floods
[7901.92] sweeping over the land, probably
[7904.159] hundreds of feet deep, carrying gigantic
[7906.92] icebergs by the hundreds or probably
[7910.36] thousands. Right? You're not picturing
[7913.04] any of that. But that essentially is
[7916.679] realistically the scenario that created
[7919.84] what we now see as the end
[7922.199] result. The Missouri River Valley, the
[7925.84] giant ripples, the aluvial floor, the
[7929.679] giant boulders that had to have been
[7931.92] transported by icebergs,
[7935.639] etc. So that's what we're trying to get
[7938.88] at here with why we're calling this the
[7941.199] big picture. Yeah.
[7943.199] And you see how we've just now outlined
[7946.48] a whole another piece of this puzzle
[7948.719] that we've
[7949.88] now put into the this emerging storyline
[7954.8] or scenario, whatever you want to call
[7956.719] it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's very
[7960.28] very I I mean, last time we talked about
[7962.719] this, last last episode when we talked
[7964.719] about this, I it was so much information
[7967.84] and I was kind of foggy on where we're
[7970.639] going with this because we had talked
[7972.159] about Prince George a long time ago. We
[7974.56] had talked about Bonavville,
[7976.199] but this is
[7978.44] uh I would say the the I'm guessing the
[7982.0] picture expands farther beyond this, but
[7984.48] this is painted a much more clear
[7986.96] picture where at least we have an idea
[7989.199] of what could be the catalyst of it
[7991.28] before we were looking at what the
[7993.04] consequences were of something that we
[7994.88] weren't quite sure where it was coming
[7996.239] from or what it was.
[7998.96] Well, let's do a little bit more
[8001.199] forensic geological thinking. Let's do
[8003.44] it.
[8004.96] Okay. So, here we have we're back to the
[8006.56] Drumland swarm. Are we still sharing
[8009.36] screen here?
[8011.0] Okay. Remember I said that the blunt end
[8014.76] uh focus is is is facing upstream. Yep.
[8019.92] So, imagine that you've got a bridge
[8021.76] pier and that water is flowing down and
[8023.92] it hits the bridge pier and it cuts
[8025.76] around it. Right. In a sense, it's it's
[8028.159] like that. So, this is a water flow
[8031.119] that's flowing from down here going this
[8034.199] way. Well, where's it coming
[8038.44] from? If I zoom out, where's it coming
[8043.719] from? Where was the source of this
[8046.44] water? Now, this was a lot of water that
[8049.679] created this Dublin swarm here.
[8054.04] So, either there was ice there or there
[8056.56] wasn't ice there. Now the the theory is
[8060.0] that drumlands are formed by massive
[8062.159] subglacial flows. So once again now what
[8065.28] we have to assume is if that's correct
[8068.4] then there was ice here a lot of ice
[8070.96] thousands of feet thick but at some
[8072.719] point there was this huge onrush of
[8076.04] water headed essentially towards Prince
[8079.36] George but where's it coming from? And
[8082.079] then we've got this long linear feature
[8084.48] here. And we've just seen what happened
[8087.76] in
[8088.679] here. Right now, is this creation of the
[8092.96] Drumland swarm connected with the
[8095.52] creation of the foothills erratic train?
[8098.32] I would think so. Well, how do we tie
[8100.96] them together generically then? Well, if
[8104.079] there's water coming from the southwest,
[8107.04] where's it ultimately coming from? The
[8109.28] ocean.
[8110.88] Well, it would have to be salt water. I
[8112.96] don't think there's any evidence of
[8114.159] marine. So, there must be some type of
[8117.52] of water
[8119.52] there was a whole lot of glacier over
[8122.04] here. Probably, you know, couple of
[8125.36] thousand cubic miles of ice minimum over
[8127.679] this plateau region. Probably way more
[8129.52] than that. Probably 10,000 by the time
[8132.679] we figured it all out.
[8136.32] Well, 10,000 ft of ice sitting right
[8139.28] there then. I don't think it would have
[8140.719] been 10,000. Um, probably more like
[8143.92] 5,000. Probably a mile thick on top
[8146.88] because sometimes up on the the the high
[8149.679] uplands like this, the ice is not as
[8152.0] thick as it actually is in the valleys.
[8154.159] M
[8158.84] um so for a while this Drumland
[8163.44] orientation confused
[8165.239] me because my research led me to think
[8170.079] that Prince George was an
[8173.719] epicenter because for one thing like
[8175.84] look over here you can see the
[8178.36] direction of flow in all these cases.
[8181.84] Look at these scour trough lakes. Now,
[8184.4] if they're not exclusively sculpted by
[8187.4] glaciers, there would have been water as
[8189.96] well. And if you look here, you'll see
[8194.08] immediately to the west, your
[8195.84] orientation is east, west. As you go to
[8198.88] the northwest, the orientation is
[8201.679] northwest, southeast. Right? Of course,
[8204.24] here we have the mountain blockading.
[8206.96] So, you've got this long trough here
[8209.84] that goes right on up. It's almost like
[8211.679] it's a continuation of the Rocky
[8214.399] Mountain Trench. You see that?
[8217.28] But the Rocky the the uh eastern flank
[8219.92] of the Rocky Mountain trench here has
[8221.679] been
[8222.679] obscured. Why? Well, that's speculation.
[8226.08] There's a lot to still be teased out of
[8228.639] all of this. But in either case, we have
[8231.28] this very large water subglacial water
[8234.559] flow
[8236.359] uh here flowing towards Prince George.
[8240.319] Well, that would seem to contradict
[8244.2] uh the idea that Prince George was an
[8247.359] epicenter, wouldn't it? Yes.
[8250.639] Unless that was not the original flow
[8254.92] direction.
[8256.519] Now, in order to try to make sense out
[8258.96] of this, I I took a look at um ocean
[8263.639] impacts. So, what happens in an ocean
[8266.08] impact? Well, and this in our laboratory
[8269.599] confirmations of this, if you fire a
[8272.479] projectile into the water, it penetrates
[8275.439] the water. It creates an outward
[8278.96] expansion of the water and leaves a
[8282.24] void, a transient
[8284.88] uh a transient crater, it's called. If
[8288.0] the object is big enough and has enough
[8290.479] force, the transient crater will go all
[8293.04] the way to the bottom of the water
[8294.479] column. Now, if that's an an ocean
[8297.84] that's a mile deep, it might take uh an
[8302.12] asteroid maybe one quarter of that in
[8305.84] diameter to penetrate a full mile of
[8308.639] ocean water and and actually hit the
[8311.439] bottom of the of the ocean, right? And
[8315.28] leave it
[8316.359] crater, right? Except this is going to
[8319.84] be very different than an impact of the
[8322.0] same sized object on land. Why? Well,
[8325.2] you've got the water. So, instead of a
[8327.84] crater form that may last for thousands
[8331.28] and thousands of years in the aftermath,
[8333.599] you have this water crater, transient
[8336.0] crater it's called, that only lasts
[8339.0] for, you know, maybe minutes. It depends
[8341.599] on the size of the projector and how how
[8345.359] much water is displaced by the passage
[8348.16] of that object through the water column.
[8350.96] Well, it's going to rush outwards, isn't
[8353.12] it? But is it going to keep rushing
[8355.12] outwards indefinitely?
[8358.88] No. No. What's it going to do? At some
[8362.12] point, it's going to stop, reverse
[8365.439] directions, isn't it? Yeah. And it's
[8368.319] going to flow back
[8371.88] in. I think that's what we're looking at
[8374.24] here. There's even a term, it's called
[8376.8] the research wave.
[8380.24] So after the
[8382.2] hypothetical and we know from actual the
[8385.76] the very limited discoveries of craters
[8387.84] on ocean bottoms that one of the things
[8391.28] that'll happen is there the research
[8392.88] wave like if the same crater was on land
[8395.68] there might be a prominent very uh uh
[8399.439] easy to distinguish rim around the
[8402.04] crater but with the research wave it can
[8405.04] wash away a lot of the upraised rim.
[8408.319] Makes sense, doesn't it? Yeah. Because
[8410.24] this onrush of the water back in to the
[8413.92] into the cavity is going to be pretty
[8416.88] darn forceful and turbulent, isn't it?
[8420.399] It might leave vestigages of the ring
[8422.479] that could be identified. But just like
[8424.56] we saw with um the Elmo moring there,
[8428.24] there was a breach. Remember there was a
[8429.76] breach. 28 went through that breach,
[8431.76] right? Well, in the case of a research
[8434.24] wave, it would create multiple breaches
[8436.399] on the crater rim, but it might actually
[8438.24] leave enough of the crater rim that you
[8439.84] could reconstruct it. But in any case,
[8442.24] it's going to largely make it much more
[8445.04] difficult to identify the crater rim.
[8447.68] The other thing that it's going to do is
[8449.28] it's going to wash a lot of sediment
[8450.88] back into the crater. So, not only is
[8453.28] the water going to lower the rim and
[8455.68] obscure the rim, it's also going to dump
[8457.76] material into the crater form that fills
[8460.56] it up. So now the crater isn't nearly as
[8463.6] prominent as it would be had the same
[8465.84] event occurred on land. Makes sense,
[8467.76] right? Yeah.
[8469.76] So, what I would speculate here is that
[8474.319] we have some force that was able to
[8476.399] drive this
[8477.72] water under the ice
[8480.68] subglacially, but it was only able to
[8483.2] travel so far before it reached its
[8486.96] limit and then it reversed directions
[8489.92] and started flowing back. So, only field
[8492.88] research, I think, would determine that.
[8495.28] But if you go here, you're going to see
[8497.359] you've still got drumlenoid forms in the
[8499.76] landscape. So you're still got and
[8501.359] there's still blunting. The flow
[8503.439] direction has changed somewhat. You can
[8505.6] see look, the orientation is this way.
[8509.12] And then up here it's more this way,
[8511.76] isn't it? Mhm. So what needs to happen
[8514.319] is there needs to be a lot of field
[8516.24] work, probably liar because a lot of
[8519.439] these drumland forms you can't see them
[8521.68] because they're under
[8523.0] forests, which is frustrating because uh
[8527.439] a lot of you can drive up there, right?
[8529.04] You can drive I've driven through this
[8530.479] drumland field right here and you can't
[8532.16] see any of it from the ground because
[8534.399] it's all forested over.
[8537.52] So there needs to be fieldwork and
[8539.92] probably uh you know high high
[8543.68] resolution mapping to figure out
[8546.6] where that reversal of current direction
[8549.6] like maybe look at this rim right here
[8551.359] that might be a candidate for the
[8552.96] reversal point and we can go to Google
[8555.6] Earth. Yeah, look at here. Okay, so you
[8557.84] still got water flow to the north there
[8560.88] but now you lose the Drumlands down in
[8563.28] here.
[8565.84] So any case, you know, we've been
[8567.84] talking about drumlands, and I've showed
[8569.439] I showed you the Wisconsin drumlins,
[8571.28] didn't I?
[8573.68] No. Did we see those? Okay. So, I'm
[8575.6] going to come here just to show you
[8577.52] examples of
[8579.08] Drumlands. Green Bay, right? Here's
[8581.68] here. This is called the Door Peninsula
[8583.6] coming up into Lake Michigan. This is
[8585.6] Green Bay coming down here. And then
[8587.92] this is Lake Wnebago. Now, if I zoom in,
[8591.439] uh, let's see. I'm still on terrain,
[8593.359] aren't I? Yeah. Okay.
[8596.76] Uh so there was a trough. You can see
[8599.68] that this is essentially is a gigantic
[8602.16] scour trough. There was a huge water
[8604.479] flow coming under the glacier here. Uh
[8608.399] Lake Wnebago would have been an
[8610.0] extension of or a part of this same
[8611.84] trough that is now occupied by Green
[8614.439] Bay. Okay. But this is a bunch of
[8617.12] sediment that got dumped in here. So if
[8619.6] you were to sweep this sediment out
[8621.12] though, you'd have one continuous
[8622.56] channel down here. So, there was a water
[8625.04] flow coming this way and then it flowed
[8628.08] down here. Let's see. By Beaver Dam. And
[8630.88] let's see if we zoom in here. There we
[8633.92] go. There we go. Look at
[8636.2] this. Drumlands. Now, these are
[8639.359] interesting because they're a little
[8640.479] different. They're not as blunt, but
[8642.399] they're definitely Drumlands. So, we're
[8644.8] still under the ice sheet here, right?
[8648.399] There's this is not a water flow with a
[8650.8] free surface. It's a water flow. Now
[8653.28] notice the the change in the
[8654.96] orientation. Right. Right. That's very
[8657.88] prominent. Well, what it's doing is it's
[8660.68] converging from a point right up in
[8663.12] here. You can see it's a single
[8664.88] channelized flow that then spread out
[8667.68] and most likely as it's getting near the
[8670.56] the uh the margin of the ice sheet, the
[8674.319] the ice is getting thinner, right? So
[8677.84] what probably happened here is that as
[8680.479] you go north, the ice is getting thicker
[8682.319] and thicker and the water flow was not
[8685.2] enough to cause the uplifting of the
[8688.12] ice. But then as the overlying ice mass
[8692.84] thinned, it became possible for the
[8695.68] water to literally temporarily uncouple
[8699.12] the ice from the substrate. And then
[8701.84] right there is where the um rather than
[8705.2] being forced into a single channel, the
[8707.359] water can now spread out because there's
[8709.6] been a pressure relief. The water
[8711.52] spreads out, it starts carving the
[8713.68] drumlins and then it discharges from the
[8717.439] uh the edge of the ice sheet and then
[8720.399] it's got a free surface. And without
[8722.16] that overlying pressure, it's not it's
[8725.359] not reshaping the drumlins in reshaping
[8729.439] the ground mass into these drumlized
[8732.04] forms. I hope all this is starting to
[8734.399] make sense. It is. It is starting to
[8735.84] make sense. So, okay, this is another
[8738.8] example of a lot of water flowing at
[8742.96] rapid speed underneath a glacier. Under
[8745.68] underneath? Yes. And did we look at the
[8748.64] New York drumlands? No. Oh, we're we've
[8752.8] stayed on the west coast for the most
[8754.24] part. Okay. Well, we're going to come
[8756.0] back in here and we're going to look at
[8758.0] Lake Ontario. All right. Now, if we were
[8761.12] look at a baometric chart of Lake
[8763.12] Ontario, which I have one here, I could
[8764.8] I could actually pull it up, but for the
[8767.04] sake of of of keeping the moving here,
[8769.359] there's a there's a basin, the deepest
[8771.2] part of Lake Ontario. It's called the
[8773.2] Ontario Basin. It's right in here. Okay.
[8776.319] And now we come south of there and you
[8778.399] can see the Fingerlakes.
[8781.2] Now, if anybody's watching this that's
[8782.88] up in New York, you you know you know
[8784.56] the Fingerlakes. They're beautiful. I've
[8786.319] been up there. I can't wait to go up
[8787.84] again. Um because the story that it has
[8790.399] to tell here is very very interesting.
[8792.8] But I want you to take a look here like
[8794.64] at Lake Saga and Lake Kauga, the two of
[8797.76] the biggest of the of the fingerlakes.
[8800.08] See how they're long trough-like lakes?
[8803.28] Right. Uh, now I'm going to just zoom
[8805.6] out and we're going to go all the way
[8807.76] back over here to Washington State and
[8811.12] we're going to zoom in on upper Grand
[8813.84] Coulie.
[8815.359] Long trough-like lake. A long
[8817.359] trough-like lake. Roughly the same
[8819.92] width, the same length, and the same
[8823.64] depth
[8825.24] as Lake Senica and Lake Kauga. Now,
[8830.0] could the genesis of these two features
[8833.76] of these features be the same? Well, we
[8836.72] accept a catastrophic flood origin for
[8840.319] Grand Koulie, don't we? Yes. Now, that
[8842.64] lake that you see in Grand Coulie is an
[8844.479] artificial because the Koulie, which is
[8846.24] just a big long dry trough, serves as a
[8849.72] useful valuable receptacle for a as a
[8853.12] storage reservoir. So, Grandi Dam is
[8856.319] siphoning water out of the Columbia
[8858.319] River and storing it in upper Grand
[8861.76] Coulie. But one of the things that by
[8864.319] doing that it turns that upper Grand
[8865.92] Koulie into a lake and it really kind of
[8867.72] emphasizes the similarity between Grand
[8871.12] Koulie and Lake Senica and Lake Kauga.
[8875.12] These long and then another very again
[8877.439] we're doing some more uh forensic
[8879.6] geology here. Look at this. You'll
[8882.0] notice that the finger lakes look at the
[8884.8] orientation. Let's see. I forget the
[8886.72] names of these little ones. a
[8889.24] scan. I didn't know how to pronounce
[8891.439] this once, but anyways, you see these
[8893.68] smaller lakes in here, right? Now,
[8895.6] you'll see they're oriented, right? You
[8898.399] also see that they're just they
[8901.12] partially occupy these troughs that have
[8903.76] been insized into the
[8906.2] landscape. Well, where have we just seen
[8908.399] that? The other side of the United
[8911.12] States. Yeah, up there in Montana. Yeah,
[8913.76] in Montana we saw erosional trough. We
[8916.96] saw the that there are lakes occupying
[8919.439] those erosional troughs and now look
[8921.04] what you got here coming
[8923.56] down all the way down here and you've
[8926.0] got all of these interesting erosional
[8927.96] features. Um Watkins Gland Montour
[8931.68] Falls. Oh man, these these are magical
[8934.96] in landscapes down there. But notice
[8937.2] again here what I'm trying to get you to
[8939.359] see. Notice the axial orientation of
[8942.92] this like canand
[8946.76] conda. Notice that. Then notice
[8950.52] this. Notice this. This. And then you
[8954.56] see
[8955.319] how just hold up your hand like this and
[8958.08] think of your fingers as being actually
[8960.319] it would be upside down like this.
[8962.08] Right. Yeah. The finger legs. The finger
[8964.319] legs. Perfect. Right. But notice when
[8966.72] you hold your hand out like this,
[8968.08] they're all converging back onto it's
[8971.04] one hand. They're not your fingers are
[8974.0] not independent distinct entities.
[8976.08] They're all part of your hand, right?
[8977.68] Part of this greater feature right here.
[8980.76] Well, so if you follow those that
[8986.04] orientation, what it does is it takes
[8988.399] you right to the center of this basin.
[8991.28] And I can I can pull up a baometric
[8993.76] chart that I have of Lake Ontario and it
[8996.08] stands out really clearly. But then you
[8999.359] have this region between the south shore
[9003.28] of Lake Ontario and the northern ends of
[9005.68] the Fingerlakes. And when we zoom in on
[9008.479] that
[9009.8] area, look at what shows up. Drumlands.
[9014.24] Yeah. Thousands of them. Wow. Look at
[9017.52] this.
[9021.28] I mean, this is
[9024.12] extraordinary. And see, this is here and
[9027.2] people just don't
[9028.92] know. People don't know what's hiding
[9031.359] right under their feet. What's in their
[9034.12] backyards? But look at this. When we go
[9036.399] here to the west, what do you see
[9037.84] happening with the drumlands? Let's see.
[9040.56] Look at this. Orientation changes headed
[9044.16] back to Lake Ontario.
[9046.12] Yes. This This essentially is the same
[9049.52] radial orientation as the lakes.
[9054.72] What is this telling us?
[9058.399] There might been something that uh Okay.
[9061.6] So, what happens when you shoot you
[9063.359] shoot something?
[9065.52] Let's just say you shoot something. It's
[9068.64] going to spray like this, right? Oh,
[9071.28] yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe it's pointing
[9074.56] to Lake Ontario. Okay. So I'm going to
[9077.28] stop sharing for the moment. Uh you know
[9080.479] what? I think I might have that. Let's
[9083.28] see here. I may have I may even have
[9086.16] that. Let's
[9087.96] see.
[9089.88] Uh okay. So now you've taken me
[9093.24] to Eastern United States, more East
[9098.04] Wisconsin, Michigan, New York area.
[9101.92] But you've left
[9105.64] me interested in how they connect. And
[9110.399] in the western United States of British
[9112.24] Columbia, well, it's really uh British
[9114.96] Columbia.
[9118.72] Yeah.
[9120.04] Uh well,
[9122.2] that's right. That you're going exactly
[9124.64] where I want you to go.
[9127.24] I'm See, I'm I'm leading you right up to
[9130.24] the precipice of the rabbit
[9131.68] [Music]
[9132.92] hole and I'm hoping you
[9135.56] just before you realize you've stepped
[9138.24] off the edge and you're and you're
[9141.12] plummeting into the down the rabbit hole
[9143.6] is non-reversible. Well, I feel like if
[9146.64] I start speculating here, you're going
[9148.319] to drop some other evidence on me. That
[9150.16] makes me feel like I should have waited
[9152.08] for it before I started speculating. But
[9154.56] I'm starting to see a larger picture
[9156.24] here. Okay, I'm going to show you. Uh
[9160.64] this will help. This this will help. I
[9162.96] think uh certainly pertains directly
[9165.72] to what you're what you're trying to do.
[9169.439] Uh we'll go back here. There we go.
[9176.04] Okay. This is what I like to see. We've
[9178.319] got a much larger picture here of North
[9181.68] America.
[9184.0] Okay.
[9185.08] So, right here, look at this. Aabaska
[9188.359] floods. Look at the arrow. It points
[9190.64] right to that right where the Aabaska
[9193.92] River deouches from the Rocky Mountain
[9197.24] front. We got the Missoula flood that
[9200.319] we've already talked about. Here's the
[9201.92] Basalt Plateau down
[9204.04] here. The Bonavville flood pointing here
[9207.12] to the Snake River plane. Ultimately, it
[9209.52] it uh originated right here at Great
[9213.6] Salt Lake. But look what else we got.
[9216.479] Silver Lake, Soda Lake, Manley,
[9220.439] etc. Val Caldera overflow
[9224.68] here. Southern Appalachian Pluvio floods
[9229.399] here. Lake Wisconsin
[9232.52] here. Ontario mega floods here.
[9237.28] Superior floods, Lake Agaze super
[9241.479] flood, McKenzie River cataclysmic floods
[9246.0] right up here. Now there's more. I could
[9248.56] add more to this, but those are really
[9250.72] the biggest of the flows as it says here
[9253.84] partial listing of various terminal
[9256.72] place to scene mega flood events in
[9258.72] North America.
[9261.84] So what I'm suggesting here is that we
[9264.56] really need to
[9266.92] uh look for and ask this question is
[9270.16] there a coherent model that can link all
[9273.28] of
[9274.76] this or do we have to single some things
[9278.16] out and say okay well southern
[9279.68] Appalachia and that didn't have anything
[9281.28] to that was something completely
[9282.64] independent right or lake Wisconsin what
[9286.0] was that that or Valis caldera overflow
[9289.12] right What are those? Well,
[9292.92] um, so we have explored the regions
[9296.64] affected by the two greatest
[9298.8] acknowledged floods in the history of
[9300.72] North America, the Great Missoula and
[9302.8] the Great Bonavville floods. For peak
[9305.439] discharge and raw stream power, these
[9308.0] events are not likely to be surpassed.
[9310.8] However, the effects of mega-cale
[9313.2] catastrophic floods are by no means
[9315.2] limited to the region directly affected
[9317.76] by these two floods. It will be the
[9320.16] purpose of this episode of the saga to
[9322.96] elucidate the myriad effects of colossal
[9325.68] floods on a variety of landscapes around
[9328.56] the remainder of the North American
[9330.479] continent and to demonstrate the
[9333.28] probability that the Missoula and
[9334.88] Bonavville floods were actually a
[9336.72] limited regional manifestation of a much
[9339.84] larger event.
[9349.68] Wow.
[9351.479] So, uh, we'll skip the glossery
[9355.96] now, but this is a good place to help
[9359.76] get your thinking kind of in some kind
[9362.399] of a defined order. The two major
[9366.16] categories are erosional and
[9367.76] depositional, right? And we can go
[9370.319] through like erosional we'll have scab
[9372.68] land but and basin
[9375.96] topography. Depositional will be large
[9378.72] gravel beds and bars. Right? That's
[9382.52] deposition. Deposition always implies
[9385.2] that it was preceded by
[9387.64] erosion somewhere
[9390.359] upstream. Erosional would be sheerwalled
[9393.12] canyons and gorges.
[9395.56] Depositional blow boulder streams and
[9397.84] block fields. And I'll show you some
[9400.24] pictures of boulder streams and block
[9402.319] fields coming up. Erosional oversized
[9405.439] stream and river
[9407.8] channels. Depositional large erratic
[9410.92] boulders. Erosional coolies and
[9414.359] spillways. Grand is an example of
[9417.84] a majestic gigantic but there's
[9421.359] hundreds and hundreds of them. They're
[9423.2] just not quite as grand. Um, and
[9426.52] spillways. Uh, we saw some examples.
[9429.6] We'll be seeing lots more. Depositional
[9432.399] aluvial and debris fans. Uh, erosional
[9436.319] strand lines and shorelines on, you
[9438.479] know, the shorelines on the mountain
[9440.2] sides. Depositional fossil lake
[9443.56] beds. Uh, erosional dry
[9446.52] cataracts. Depositional. Although this
[9449.439] isn't technically correct because giant
[9451.52] current ripples are actually kind of
[9453.12] both erosional and
[9455.16] depositional. Erosional but pinnacles
[9458.319] and pedestal rocks depositional
[9461.2] imbrecation and I'm going to show you an
[9463.12] example of imcation
[9465.6] erosional
[9467.24] potholes and then things that are likely
[9471.2] the combination. And notice the first
[9473.359] thing I've got is drumlands. Yeah.
[9475.92] escers, tunnel valleys, terraces and
[9479.72] benches.
[9482.359] Okay, so this shows the maximum extent
[9486.72] of Wisconsin glaciation at this
[9489.439] particular time. This is uh let's see
[9493.52] this is uh yeah there's this is Lake
[9496.16] Agazy here and you can see that Lake
[9498.72] Agazy is bigger than Hudson Bay. Lac
[9501.439] Agazy is so big that if you were going
[9503.28] to sail across it, you could be lost for
[9505.52] days and see no coastline at all.
[9509.04] Uh and then you can see how the ice
[9511.04] related to the Great Lakes because you
[9514.64] better believe the Great Lakes factor
[9517.2] into this whole
[9521.08] scenario. And here colossal for set
[9524.8] gravel deposits in the Fraser River
[9526.96] Valley in British Columbia, Canada. This
[9529.68] is evidence for giant flood flows from
[9532.08] the melting cordieran ice sheet. The
[9534.92] glaciofluvial meaning both glaciers and
[9537.76] flowing water. This glaciuial flooding
[9541.359] did not contribute to the formation of
[9543.28] the channel scabland of eastern
[9545.08] Washington. Instead, it discharged into
[9547.84] the straight of Georgia at Vancouver,
[9549.92] British Columbia.
[9552.08] And here you can see the tilting down of
[9554.88] these sediments uh shows the direction
[9557.84] of water flow from right to
[9562.04] left. And this is up near Prince George.
[9565.2] Okay. Yeah.
[9567.68] And of course you've seen this. We've
[9569.52] been through this. Let's just keep
[9571.319] moving. Right.
[9574.439] Uh then we get to this glacial lake
[9577.52] spillway incision and deposition of a
[9580.08] coarse grain fan near Wattuse,
[9583.319] Saskatchewan. Canadian Journal of Earth
[9585.52] Sciences published in 1994. And this is
[9588.399] what they're talking about across the
[9590.479] prairie region. Uh right, the legacy of
[9594.24] catastrophic drainages of proglacial
[9596.96] lakes is a characteristic suite of
[9600.0] erosional and depositional features.
[9602.64] Spillways generally lack deposits from
[9605.28] the flood themselves because of the
[9607.84] intense erosion that accompanied lake
[9610.359] drainage. The size and morphology of
[9613.52] these channels are the best indication
[9616.64] of magnitude and duration of these
[9620.52] events. The morphology of the Watrus
[9623.6] spillway is similar to many proglacial
[9626.96] lake spillways in the midcontinent
[9629.439] prairies of Canada and United States.
[9632.319] These channels were rapidly insized by
[9635.76] erosive flows of high
[9638.92] discharge, not normal glacial melting,
[9643.88] but rapid incision by erosive flows of
[9648.16] high discharge. Despite the problems of
[9651.2] quantifying the characteristics of
[9652.96] glacial lake outbursts, the channels and
[9655.76] deposits
[9656.84] themselves provide confirmation of the
[9659.84] impressive magnitude of these events.
[9663.359] Now, these
[9666.72] uh impressive events that he's talking
[9668.64] about here, that they're talking about
[9669.76] here, they occur across the entire
[9672.24] Midwestern
[9673.72] prairies all the way from the Rocky
[9676.08] Mountain front there by Milk River and
[9677.92] where those giant current ripples are
[9679.76] all the way over to the Great
[9685.72] Lakes. Wow.
[9690.6] And this is now from a previous Mark
[9693.92] Lord Alan Kihu sedimentology and
[9697.16] paleohhydraology of glacial lake
[9700.0] outburst floods in southeastern
[9702.88] Saskatchewan and northwestern North
[9704.64] Dakota.
[9706.16] Glacial lake outbursts occurred in the
[9708.96] northern Great Plains as ice marginal
[9711.439] lakes suddenly drained, forming an
[9714.84] interconnected system of glacial lake
[9717.64] spillways. The outbursts were highly
[9721.72] erosive. Interconnected spillways of
[9724.439] these large magnitude highly erosive
[9728.12] floods forming an interconnected network
[9730.88] across the whole mid-continental region.
[9734.64] And who is aware of it? Just a few
[9737.28] specialized geologists. In fact, look,
[9739.439] this is was published in 1987. This has
[9742.479] been largely
[9744.92] forgotten, but they're still
[9748.92] there. The Manitou fan, a giant boulder
[9751.92] bar in Saskatchewan left over from
[9753.92] catastrophic melting meltwater floods
[9756.64] circa 12,000 years before present.
[9760.64] So, these are fossil features on the
[9762.96] landscape that you learn to recognize.
[9764.72] Now, these boulders obviously aren't on
[9766.8] the scale of some of the ones we've
[9768.24] seen.
[9769.88] However, since the deposition of this
[9772.24] boulder bar, no force of nature has been
[9775.2] really enough to destroy them or
[9777.28] significantly modify them. They're
[9778.8] basically in the same shape as when this
[9780.88] boulder bar was built 12, 13, 14,000
[9783.84] years ago by these high discharge
[9786.479] meltwater floods. And so this is more
[9789.359] evidence. You can see these kinds of
[9790.96] things sineu like sineuous around on the
[9793.92] prairies. These boulder
[9796.84] bars a section of we didn't even see we
[9799.68] didn't even look at this one yet. This
[9801.6] is the Livingstone Lake Drumland
[9806.76] field. Wow. And look at this flow
[9809.359] direction. You can tell the flow
[9811.04] direction.
[9812.56] There's a Google Earth oblique view of
[9816.399] the Drumland field. There's an aerial
[9820.319] view of a forested Drumland in
[9822.68] Saskatchewan. Now, this is what this is
[9825.12] roughly the size of a lot of these
[9826.56] Drumlands. This is kind of what they
[9828.16] look like. You can see it's forested.
[9829.76] Now, the reason this one stands out so
[9831.92] clearly is because it's in the lake, but
[9833.92] if you were to drain the lake and look
[9835.76] at this, you can see there's another
[9837.359] Drumland form right here. The the the
[9840.399] picture high quality. There's probably
[9841.76] another one right here that that the
[9843.439] quality of the picture isn't that great,
[9844.96] but you can see how, you know, you've
[9847.359] got thousands of square miles of
[9849.0] drumlands and they're hidden under the
[9851.84] forests. Mhm. So, people just don't know
[9854.8] what's
[9856.359] there. But now we do. We're finding
[9861.16] out.
[9866.68] Um so subglacial sheet floods were
[9870.439] proposed on the basis of land form
[9873.359] evidence in the Livingstone Lake
[9875.12] Drumland Field to northern Saskatchewan.
[9878.16] Such floods require required the release
[9881.2] of enormous volumes of stored water and
[9884.64] it is important to demonstrate that such
[9887.12] such large storage and subsequent
[9889.76] catastrophic releases are feasible. Some
[9893.359] Laurentide subglacial sheet floods were
[9896.319] at least several hundred kilometers wide
[9900.16] and tens of meters
[9902.04] deep. Tens of meters. Well, you're
[9905.04] probably talking at least 30 to 50 feet,
[9907.279] maybe deeper, but a 100 kilometers,
[9909.52] that's 60 feet wide. So, what's being
[9912.16] described here is a flow of water. It
[9913.84] could be, you know, uh, tens of meters
[9916.399] deep, could be 50, could be 100 feet
[9918.479] deep, 60 miles wide, flowing rapidly
[9922.16] under the ice
[9923.8] sheet. Mean velocities at maximum
[9926.64] discharge are estimated to have been at
[9928.479] least 5 m per second.
[9931.479] instantaneous discharges in excess of a
[9934.96] million cubic
[9936.52] meters/s and total flow volume of about
[9939.68] 8.4 4 * 10 4 cubic kilm that's
[9944.2] 84,000 cubic kilm of
[9947.96] water that into totality sculpted these
[9951.68] drumland this particular Drumland
[9954.6] swarm. Now change that to miles uh what
[9957.76] is it about four? So
[9960.84] 84,000 five somewhere in that range
[9963.52] let's say divide by four. Yeah, it's
[9967.279] going to be like 20,000 cubic miles of
[9969.92] water. Now, what's interesting about
[9971.92] that is because one complete filling of
[9975.439] Lake Missoula is about 600 cubic miles.
[9978.88] So, I divide 21,000 by 600 and this is
[9982.56] the equivalent of 34 Lake
[9985.399] Missoulas flowing under the ice sheet.
[9988.319] Oh my god.
[9991.92] Now, how how
[9993.399] come this kind of information is not
[9996.08] more widely known? Why do you think?
[10000.08] Well, I think two things. I think the
[10003.2] scale of it is such that, you know, it's
[10006.24] it's the way science is oriented. I
[10008.399] mean, you've got all these geologists
[10009.84] working on this, but they're all looking
[10012.0] at just one part of the elephant. Yeah.
[10014.56] Here's my box. This will be your box.
[10016.96] Yeah. Our boxes don't touch. You
[10018.96] remember the uh the the the uh allegory
[10022.0] of the was it five blind men and they
[10025.12] were bringing an elephant into the
[10026.56] village and the blind men had never seen
[10028.16] an elephant. So they wanted to know what
[10030.96] so they they somebody brings the five
[10034.0] blind men or five blind brothers or
[10035.76] whatever they were out uh to see to try
[10038.08] to get a sense of what this elephant is.
[10040.319] So one of them goes up and feels its leg
[10042.319] and says some oh like it's it's like a
[10044.56] pillar like a tree. Somebody else goes
[10046.88] up and feels its, you know, its trunk,
[10048.88] says, "Oh, it's like a big serpent. It's
[10050.64] like a snake." Somebody else goes up and
[10052.72] feels the elephant's ear and says, "Oh,
[10054.399] it's like a, you know, it's like a big
[10056.479] such and such leaf or something."
[10058.16] Somebody else goes up and grabs the
[10059.92] elephant's tail, whatever that, you
[10062.319] know, and somebody else feels the
[10063.52] elephant's sigh. So, they all have this
[10065.439] different interpretation of what it is,
[10066.88] but of course, it's all one elephant,
[10068.8] right? Well, it's kind of like that, you
[10071.279] know? It's
[10073.16] um and it goes on to say here that this
[10076.72] 8.4 * 10 4 cubic kilmters 84,000 cubic
[10081.04] kilmters let's say 20,000 cubic miles
[10083.92] are conservative estimates for the
[10086.399] Living Stone Lake event. And of course
[10089.04] it goes without saying that flows of
[10091.359] this magnitude must have had dramatic
[10094.08] effects all along the flood route. Of
[10097.12] course they did.
[10100.319] There are widely divergent theories on
[10102.96] the formative processes of giant
[10105.12] flutings and drumlins. If the drumlings
[10108.08] get long enough and skinny enough,
[10110.24] they're called flutings. But there seems
[10112.8] to be no clear line of
[10114.92] demarcation between what is called a
[10117.2] classical drumland and a fluting which
[10119.12] is a much longer almost tailike but
[10122.319] there's enough intermediate forms to see
[10124.56] that they're you know they're ultimately
[10127.92] created by the similar process. Um early
[10131.6] work in western North Carolina invoked
[10133.52] variations of direct ice erosion andor
[10136.399] deposition as explanations. Right.
[10139.439] Numerous researchers continue to support
[10141.6] these explanations despite recent work
[10144.56] in northern Saskatchewan, Ontario,
[10147.2] Quebec, and the Northwest Territories.
[10149.439] This work has shown that enormous
[10151.88] turbulent subglacial water flows better
[10154.96] account for a variety of erosional bed
[10157.319] forms, including giant flutings, ice
[10160.88] cavity fil depositional forms, and some
[10163.92] types of drumlands.
[10166.399] But mainstream geology has been very
[10168.96] very reluctant to go there. Why? Because
[10172.319] the magnitude of these things are so
[10174.96] gigantic, so awesome, so beyond the
[10178.64] scale of things that most and and rates
[10181.52] of change that most geologists think in
[10184.56] that it's it's difficult, I think. And
[10190.12] um so let's see here.
[10194.96] Okay. So, we're seeing evidence of this
[10196.96] all across North America. Yeah. And
[10202.16] here's a beautiful example of an
[10204.08] underfit river from the ground. Yeah.
[10206.64] I'm standing up on the rim of the
[10208.64] ancient river that was part of the same
[10211.68] water flow that put Okatokes where it
[10214.479] is. Right. and it carved out on its way
[10217.68] to the ocean seeking the the the path of
[10220.8] least resistance led it through what is
[10223.359] now the Missouri River Valley ultimate
[10225.84] to join forces with the Mississippi at
[10228.0] St. Louis. But here you can see the
[10231.04] modern Missouri is flowing. It's a
[10233.84] perfect example of underfeit. You see
[10236.16] the ancient channel, the meltwater
[10238.56] channel and then of course the modern
[10240.479] rivers that occupy these gigantic fluial
[10244.08] channels. Well, they're stuck there.
[10246.399] They ain't going
[10247.56] nowhere. Not unless you get, you know,
[10250.319] however much this flow was, 50 to 100
[10253.2] million cubic feet per second is
[10254.88] probably realistic. You would have to
[10257.2] get a flow of that magnitude to spill
[10260.16] over the banks of this. They would then
[10262.24] have to cut a new channel to another
[10265.0] another channel, another outlet. But
[10268.399] yeah, nothing like that's going to
[10269.92] happen in the near future. So the
[10272.16] Missouri River, all of the rivers that
[10274.0] we see are underfits. They're stuck in
[10275.92] those channels. They're not going to
[10278.08] suddenly leap up out of their modern
[10280.56] channel up and and go over the one.
[10283.439] Right.
[10286.439] Right. And here you can really begin to
[10289.279] see the magnitude of some of those
[10291.359] mid-continental
[10293.88] flows. See what you're looking at.
[10295.84] Here's Lake Superior over here.
[10299.359] And then look at you can see the flows
[10301.52] coming down this way. These are dozens
[10303.279] of miles wide. Each of these is this is
[10305.92] about 20 miles at least across these.
[10309.359] You can see the flow separated right
[10311.479] here flowing south. This is again headed
[10314.0] for the Gulf of Mexico.
[10316.399] But this is coming right from the north
[10318.88] now. And you can see these were
[10320.439] temporary isolated islands. But the
[10324.479] thing is is that you have to realize is
[10326.479] that these are remnants of the pre flood
[10330.16] landscape that was
[10332.439] originally part of this until this down
[10336.0] cutting occurred. This was a single
[10338.8] landscape across here.
[10341.84] And then we come to Lake Superior and we
[10343.84] look at the baometric map of Lake
[10345.68] Superior and we see gigantic channel
[10348.56] scablands forms on the bottom of the
[10350.88] lake.
[10354.24] And we can keep going here. So this is
[10356.64] streamline mega flood features at the
[10358.56] junct. This is on Mars
[10361.04] and your flow is from left to right,
[10364.24] right? You can see the tapered
[10366.68] here, right?
[10369.0] Um and then we have that last picture
[10371.52] you showed is on Mars.
[10375.56] Yes. Yeah. So we'll at some point want
[10378.399] to talk about mega floods on Mars. Yes,
[10380.64] we will. Mhm. Okay. Well, I won't I
[10383.92] won't derail us there, but Right. We
[10385.68] don't want to We're not going to jump
[10387.2] that quick over to Mars. That's why I
[10389.84] was surprised. You just dropped a
[10391.2] picture of Mars on me. Different
[10392.8] evidence. Uhhuh. We'll skip through some
[10396.24] of this. Uh let's see. This this kind of
[10399.04] takes us back to what we said at the
[10401.439] beginning of this
[10402.92] podcast where we talked
[10405.399] about shotguns and snipers, let's say,
[10409.359] versus a 45 caliber or 50 caliber
[10412.399] bullet.
[10414.399] And
[10417.16] it's if I'm understanding what I'm
[10420.24] looking at better, then we're starting
[10423.76] to see across the northern part of North
[10428.2] America some type of series of impacts
[10431.439] or something just parading this sending
[10434.88] all of
[10435.96] this
[10437.72] south. Say it. Well, not all of it went
[10440.88] south because Oh, yeah. And north.
[10444.24] Well, we'll go up here. If I go back up
[10446.96] to my uh where was it?
[10450.68] Uh where I have my map of the of the
[10455.399] floods. Right. You see the McKenzie
[10457.76] River, right? You're not sharing anymore
[10460.8] by the way. I will though. I will right
[10462.64] now. Yep. McKenzie River. There is a uh
[10467.52] in fact there's all a whole Yeah. scab
[10469.92] lands right up here and all the all the
[10474.479] features you would be looking for for
[10476.0] catastrophic flows. So you had a flow
[10479.04] coming up this way that discharged cat
[10481.6] catastrophically discharged into the
[10483.439] Arctic
[10485.12] which would have
[10486.6] ultimately come down and flowed headed
[10489.76] mostly for the North
[10491.56] Atlantic and all of these the Lake Agaze
[10494.88] super flood that had it discharged
[10498.399] subglacially towards the
[10501.72] uh Hudson Bay. It discharged north this
[10505.76] way. It discharged south through here.
[10509.92] You can see I don't know if you can see
[10510.8] it, but there's that great bifurcation
[10513.2] right
[10514.359] there. Uh flowed down to the Gulf of
[10517.12] Mexico.
[10518.84] Um Superior Lobo that was flowing to the
[10521.52] Gulf of Mexico. Lake Wisconsin was to
[10524.0] the Gulf of Mexico. I'm not showing it.
[10526.56] I should I need to update this, but
[10528.56] there was a also a catastrophic flow
[10531.04] coming up this way that carved out the
[10532.8] St. Lawrence Seaway and that's what this
[10534.88] is, but I'm not showing that here. And
[10537.6] it would have been water coming down.
[10539.2] All of the meltwater from here, a lot of
[10542.08] it went out this
[10544.04] way.
[10546.439] Um,
[10548.439] so it's uh it's quite an epic story and
[10553.439] I don't think anybody's told the whole
[10555.279] story yet. So, um, we're going to keep
[10558.24] going on it.
[10561.52] Well, I don't know. You think you can
[10564.0] think you can handle it? I think you
[10566.479] can.
[10568.04] I Okay. So, how much longer do we want
[10571.2] to keep going here? I mean, I think now
[10573.359] is probably a good stopping point. We're
[10575.52] three and a half hours in. We'll
[10577.359] probably We might cut off some of the
[10578.64] beginning, but it's over three hours
[10580.479] that we've been on here. Okay. Well,
[10582.72] then let's stop here then and we'll pick
[10585.84] up the next episode because we want
[10589.2] people uh we've got a little more to do
[10592.56] up there uh in the uh
[10595.8] northeast that's connected with the
[10597.92] Fingerlakes and some more research up
[10600.08] there. uh looking into Pennsylvania at
[10603.439] some of the pretty unusual and and
[10607.359] remarkable boulder fields that are there
[10610.72] and and what they might result from.
[10613.279] Then we want to take a tour of the
[10614.8] southern Appalachians and I want to show
[10617.2] people the evidence that you find all
[10619.279] scattered through the southeastern
[10620.96] United States. And we'll take a look at
[10623.359] the southwest where it's you know all
[10625.6] desert now the Sonoron desert
[10629.08] um and the other desert regions of the
[10632.56] southwest. looking along the mucky muggy
[10635.279] rim and some of the erosion along there.
[10638.08] Um
[10639.76] uh the
[10641.16] um
[10643.0] um calder Vis calderas that's what I'm
[10646.399] trying to say calderas because this is a
[10650.0] 11 12 mile wide extinct volcanic crater
[10654.16] that on a number of occasions has filled
[10656.88] up with water and catastrophically
[10659.24] overflowed. So, we'll look at that. Uh,
[10662.8] because Volis Calderas is definitely
[10665.2] worth a trip. We've done a number of
[10667.04] field trips that have taken us through
[10669.6] Volos Calderas. It's just immediately to
[10671.6] the west of Los Alamos, New Mexico. Like
[10674.479] I said, you're actually going into an
[10676.0] extinct volcano. Wow. So, that in itself
[10678.96] is a very interesting excursion. And
[10682.0] then you add to that the evidence that
[10684.56] this volcanic cone 11 miles wide filled
[10688.08] up with water and
[10689.56] catastrophically
[10691.16] overflowed, flowed down into the valley
[10693.52] and cut large channels, insized channels
[10696.399] into the rim of the volcano and created
[10699.359] gigantic boulder deposits and so on
[10701.6] around the the floor of the around the
[10703.92] rim of the volcano. It's it's very
[10706.0] impressive stuff. So, we'll look at
[10708.0] that. Uh that will uh will kind of cast
[10712.8] our net out wider. Um we'll something
[10716.16] like this must have
[10718.2] global effects. Yes. And of course I you
[10722.96] know well at some point we can talk
[10726.08] about um you know the evidence emerging
[10728.399] for catastrophic floods in North Africa
[10731.6] and Egypt. when you look at um Egypt and
[10734.64] Libya and uh
[10737.399] Algeria, Morocco, that whole area up
[10740.24] there, people don't realize that. And
[10742.479] we'll look at that. The look at the Nile
[10744.319] Valley. The Nile Valley is a nice flat,
[10748.319] you know, it's actually a canyon filled
[10750.16] with sediment and the modern Nile River
[10752.16] flows on top of that sediment. And it's
[10754.64] such a long river and so low gradient
[10757.12] that it's not really erosive. When it
[10759.76] comes down at higher velocities from the
[10762.479] Ethiopian highlands, it's charged with
[10765.12] sediment, but then the river slows down
[10767.439] because it's such a low gradient from
[10769.359] say right roughly from Azwan up to up to
[10773.279] the uh to the delta, right? So there's
[10776.399] not much erosion going on there. This is
[10778.399] what the the the ancient Egyptians built
[10780.72] their civilization around was the annual
[10783.68] flood of the Nile River and its
[10785.6] deposition of, you know, a new layer of
[10788.399] top soil of of fertile material that
[10791.52] they would then plant their crops in.
[10793.56] Right.
[10795.96] However, just a little, you know, in the
[10798.72] Nile River, the valley flows right next
[10800.64] to the Giza Plateau, immediately to the
[10803.04] east of the Giza Plateau.
[10805.359] If you were to dig that sedimentary
[10808.16] infill out, which is both material that
[10812.64] was brought up from the south, the
[10815.04] Ethiopian highlands in that area at the
[10817.439] headarters of the White Nile and the
[10819.04] Blue Nile,
[10821.24] and
[10822.84] backwash marine sediments that came
[10826.439] from the
[10828.359] Mediterranean. But if you were to clean
[10830.96] out that thick infill package of
[10835.319] sediment out of the canyon, it would be
[10839.279] deeper than the Grand
[10841.56] Canyon. In some places, it's over 7,000
[10844.8] ft deep. See, this is what you were
[10846.96] teasing us with earlier at the beginning
[10848.8] of the podcast when I asked you about
[10850.56] what's underneath the pyramids
[10852.08] potentially. Well, you've got you've got
[10854.399] a a mile deep chasm just hundreds of
[10858.12] yards from the plateau and the edge of
[10862.319] the plateau where the pyramids are
[10864.8] built. This picture now if you were to
[10867.12] clean that out again, you would have
[10869.12] this sheerwalled
[10871.479] canyon again 7,000 ft deep for crying
[10874.64] out loud.
[10876.56] So what kind of erosional forces were at
[10878.96] work there? All right, big ones.
[10883.52] impressive ones. I'd say that. Let me
[10885.359] sit up straight. I'm As I'm going
[10887.84] through this, I'm sinking lower and
[10889.279] lower into my chair. Well, that it's
[10892.479] probably time for us to wrap it up.
[10895.0] Yeah, but I think we've covered a good
[10897.279] bit here. Oh my gosh, we did. Yeah. No,
[10900.8] this was this was satisfying to say the
[10903.04] least. Uh, we've been building up this
[10904.8] picture for a while and I've been
[10906.319] sitting here listening, taking notes,
[10909.04] researching after the fact and you gave
[10911.12] me a little bit a little taste of the
[10913.359] spice that
[10916.64] if we keep doing this, Beckett, you're
[10919.279] going to get you need to get some kind
[10920.72] of certificate of recognition that
[10923.68] you've achieved some level of See,
[10927.12] that's one of my goals right now is I
[10928.8] want to and I, you know, look, I am not
[10931.12] a professional geologist, but But I've
[10933.12] studied geology for more than 40 years.
[10936.16] I ma I I majored in geology in college
[10939.6] and I did extremely well in it. In fact,
[10942.399] I got the highest honors of my class for
[10945.439] whatever year I was in, you know. Um,
[10949.64] and I've been out in the field with
[10952.8] dozens of geologists.
[10955.399] Uh so I've had the opportunity to learn
[10958.92] directly from geologists in the field
[10961.84] that are studying different aspects of
[10963.76] this geologists that have come on my
[10965.92] tours to get my perspective on a
[10968.72] particular geological question. Right? I
[10972.64] have read conservatively oh I don't even
[10974.72] know thousands of geological papers.
[10977.279] thousands. I if I sat there, you know,
[10979.439] if I conservatively thought one a day,
[10982.8] that's three say 300 a year. So if I've
[10986.399] done that for 10 years, that's 3,000.
[10988.72] And I've done that for for 35 to 40
[10991.84] years. So yeah, I mean, I've literally
[10993.64] read thousands of papers. I've sought
[10996.76] out author uh many of the the key
[11000.16] researchers that have written these
[11001.8] papers, been out in the field with them.
[11004.68] So, I've and I've covered I've logged up
[11008.399] like with with Brad Young and myself,
[11010.8] just the two of us together have logged
[11012.96] up probably going on a couple of hundred
[11015.92] thousand miles in the field. Uh, in all
[11019.92] of these areas that we've been looking
[11021.2] at, looking meticulously at hundreds and
[11024.52] hundreds of outcrops, of formations, of
[11028.24] features, of things in the landscape,
[11030.64] cataloging them, photographing them,
[11032.88] videoing
[11034.8] uh droning drone footage correlating
[11038.72] with with digital elevation maps now
[11041.359] with LAR investing hundreds and hundreds
[11044.72] and hundreds of hours in doing this. And
[11048.8] I still get people online going, "Oh,
[11050.96] he's not a he has no he has not a real
[11053.2] geologist. He's this." Okay, dude. You
[11056.08] can believe whatever you want. We'll
[11057.6] read the funniest ones next time. I'll
[11060.0] give you some good comments, some
[11061.76] humorous ones. based nothing. But I
[11065.359] mean, it just tells me these people have
[11068.24] no
[11069.64] concept. They don't even know how to
[11071.68] think because if they did, they they're
[11073.84] going to look and go, "Well, I saw one
[11076.319] comment where he's a big phony because
[11078.8] he never provides
[11080.84] references." And I'm like, "What are you
[11083.359] talking about?" So if you watched 10
[11086.08] minutes of my presentations, you would
[11088.24] know that I constantly provide
[11090.88] references and sources. But you haven't
[11093.52] watched 10 minutes or 15 minutes, but
[11096.08] you are going to come on publicly online
[11099.52] and bloate some opinion that has no
[11102.96] merit to it, no basis to it at all. And
[11106.0] what you are to me is like evidence of
[11108.64] some kind of pandemic of idiocracy that
[11111.68] is consuming our country right now. Um
[11115.2] because we're seeing these products of
[11117.439] education that don't know how to
[11119.04] critically think. So all they know is to
[11121.359] say something he's not a
[11124.2] geologist. Well, I mean what is a
[11126.319] geologist? Do you have do you have to be
[11128.08] paid to be a geologist?
[11130.8] Do you have to be working for the
[11132.479] government to be a geologist? Or do you
[11135.279] have to be working for industry, let's
[11137.68] say, the fossil fuel industry, who are
[11140.399] probably the two biggest employers of
[11142.24] geologist. Do you have to be working for
[11145.76] those organizations to be considered a
[11148.76] geologist, right? Well, maybe if that's
[11152.72] your definition.
[11154.72] But see, I mean, what does it even
[11156.16] matter? What it doesn't matter. It
[11158.399] doesn't matter. I'm just, you know, I
[11160.88] guess since a lot of these clips have
[11163.2] been going up and I've started reading
[11164.72] them, uh, I see a lot of that and I and
[11167.68] it's like, don't read it. Don't read it
[11169.359] too closely, Randall. Well, I read
[11171.68] there's a lot of good ones and I go,
[11173.04] "Okay, here's people that really, I
[11174.96] think, um, understand what I'm trying to
[11176.88] do here. Um, if I get paid for doing
[11179.76] this, fine. But I've been doing it for
[11181.2] years and years, long before I ever got
[11182.96] paid for doing it." In fact, I scraped
[11185.52] money together in order to do these
[11188.24] excursions. Yeah, exactly. Worked long
[11191.12] weeks in my building business and saved
[11194.319] up the money or tutoring kids in, you
[11197.359] know, mathematics, whatever it might be
[11199.12] to raise enough money, then go on these
[11201.6] excursions to collect this data
[11203.439] firsthand. So, you know, my response to
[11207.04] this this kind of idiocy is like a big
[11209.359] fat f you, you know, because these
[11212.56] people that that come on with this, they
[11215.04] they have not earned the right to have
[11217.68] an opinion. And I would even say that
[11219.84] your response to it is what we're doing.
[11222.399] It's going more into it. It's teaching
[11224.479] people how to critical think. I mean
[11226.64] obviously you'll talk more about your
[11229.04] vision for an education center in the
[11231.68] future but this goes so much more so so
[11235.6] far beyond whatever any internet comment
[11238.64] is about this you're putting into effect
[11242.8] I mean you're putting into a more and
[11245.04] more organized format and farther and
[11247.439] farther out in the world your life's
[11249.6] work and you're trying to do that to
[11252.399] help the world from my perspective to
[11255.2] critically thing to see the bigger
[11257.04] picture. So, I would say that's your
[11259.04] biggest response because that'll be the
[11260.8] thing that consistently makes an impact
[11263.68] and is remembered. Well, thank you,
[11265.84] Beckett. Um, I was thinking about just
[11269.2] giving up and just quitting. Um, and but
[11272.64] now that you said that, I think I'll
[11274.96] I'll stay with it for another for a
[11276.72] little while longer yet. Well, then me
[11278.72] sitting here was worth it.
[11281.439] Well, you know, I I just it's very
[11284.56] gratifying to me because what I need and
[11287.279] you're not a professional geologist, but
[11288.96] what you're getting is a concentrated
[11290.8] dose of catastrophist geology, which is
[11294.92] no subheading that's being taught in
[11298.52] universities. So, I've had to pretty
[11300.64] much go and do my own work to pull all
[11303.92] of this together. Oh, what I'd like to
[11306.0] see is a curriculum emerge that
[11308.479] essentially that's a whole subbranch of
[11310.64] geology just like sedimenty,
[11312.92] strategraphy, geomorphology. You've got
[11315.359] catastrophice geology where you people
[11318.479] and and and see the the reason we don't
[11320.72] have that is because for more than a
[11322.72] century we were locked into this
[11324.8] straight jacket of strict uniformitarian
[11327.319] thinking, right? And at the very same
[11329.84] time that
[11331.08] catastrophism is now becoming an
[11333.6] acceptable subject for scientific
[11335.96] discourse, we have billions of dollars
[11339.359] being funneled into the anthropogenic
[11341.68] climate
[11342.6] change narrative, which would prefer not
[11346.88] to have people thinking about the stuff
[11348.96] we're talking about because the the the
[11351.6] the goal here is to convince people that
[11355.359] up until the human contribution to
[11357.68] environmental and climatic change. And
[11360.64] believe me, all of this stuff that we're
[11362.56] seeing here, this evidence in the
[11364.479] landscape, in the field, is the
[11366.64] consequence of climatic change of some
[11369.96] kind. And without a doubt, these are
[11372.479] climatic changes that are extreme and
[11374.88] beyond anything that we've experienced
[11377.439] in our modern civilization. But the idea
[11380.319] was is that it the science, I think, has
[11382.8] been preceding absolutely by these
[11385.6] different venues. And like I I pointed
[11387.92] out last episode, the the study of the
[11390.479] Missoula flood, nobody's that's not
[11393.52] being bankrolled by industry or
[11395.2] government. It's it's a geologists who
[11397.68] are pretty much funding their own
[11399.68] research out of pocket. Yeah. And and
[11403.04] and so what you got there is room for
[11406.0] somebody who wants to come in and
[11407.76] dedicate themselves to trying to
[11409.52] integrate a lot of this together. That's
[11412.399] what I'm doing. And there's others that
[11414.0] are doing it and it needs to be
[11415.439] appreciated and not denigrated, right?
[11419.08] Because, you know, I have no particular
[11421.68] agenda other than than, you know,
[11424.0] getting a authentic vision of reality.
[11426.56] What really happened, you know, and more
[11428.96] and more when you're looking at the
[11430.24] past, you can't integrate this stuff
[11433.76] within the current dominant models of of
[11436.72] global change. it it's demanding a a a
[11440.399] reconsideration and an and an alteration
[11442.8] a transformation of our thinking about
[11445.04] the history of this planet and of course
[11447.92] the subtext is the history of our
[11450.479] civilization on this planet but if
[11453.68] you've got a
[11455.0] gigantic agenda a powerful agenda that
[11458.96] is looking for a specific outcome and
[11461.68] that outcome is that human beings and
[11464.88] human beings uh civilization
[11468.399] is responsible for provoking this
[11471.2] impending climate crisis which is now
[11474.08] being compared to one of the great five
[11476.04] extinction episodes in the history of
[11478.319] the earth which is completely
[11480.16] ridiculous. And we'll devote it we'll
[11482.479] devote an episode to looking at the the
[11486.08] big five. You know when when 3/4 to 90%
[11490.24] of all species on Earth terrestrial and
[11493.84] marine went extinct suddenly within the
[11496.88] geological framework, right? Once you
[11499.92] see that and get your mind wrapped
[11501.279] around what we're talking about in terms
[11503.439] of those events, when you see the when
[11506.16] we talk about and break down what's now
[11508.0] known about the Cretaceous tertiary
[11509.76] event that killed the dinosaurs, you're
[11512.08] going to go back and you go, "Well,
[11513.12] yeah, of course." Any comparison to say
[11515.76] that what's going on now is equivalent
[11517.92] to that is is ridiculous. It's
[11520.2] ludicrous, right? Because if that was
[11523.04] happening, boom, we'd be gone in an
[11525.439] instant. We would be gone in an instant.
[11527.439] And we'll we'll break it down. We'll
[11529.279] look at what is now known about the
[11531.92] specifics of that event at the KT
[11534.96] boundary or events, right? Um, but
[11538.24] here's what I'm getting at. The point is
[11540.16] is the whole conversation has been
[11542.0] diverted away from natural planetary and
[11545.52] climatic change to focus almost
[11547.68] exclusively on human contribution. And
[11551.84] the motive for that is that if you have
[11555.279] a true and accurate and authentic
[11557.72] understanding of the magnitude of these
[11561.6] ancient changes, by contrast, you're
[11564.56] going to see what's going on right now.
[11565.92] And you're going to realize, well, the
[11567.68] the current changes that we're seeing
[11569.92] are
[11570.92] insignificant within this larger context
[11573.52] of catastrophic natural change that's
[11576.319] been an intrinsic part of our planet's
[11578.319] history and undoubtedly an intrinsic
[11580.72] part of our own human history. But we
[11582.8] don't want to go there. See, because
[11585.04] there's this whole political momentum
[11586.8] behind this other narrative that's
[11589.12] that's put hundreds of billions of
[11591.52] dollars behind the promotion of that
[11594.16] narrative. Yeah. And it's very strange
[11595.92] because it's it's very self-absorbed.
[11598.399] It's like making everything human
[11600.88] centric. It's like, okay, well, the
[11602.8] reason why all these things happen,
[11604.64] which is kind of a a strange way of
[11608.56] creating a disconnect between finding
[11611.6] more and more fulfillment and finding
[11613.12] more and more meaning beyond ourselves.
[11615.6] So, there's a word for what you just
[11617.439] said,
[11620.76] anthropocentric. You can add that to
[11622.64] your vocab. anthropocentric. Somebody,
[11625.359] how are you doing today, Becket? I'm
[11627.04] feeling a little anthropocentric.
[11629.439] Now, coffee, please.
[11634.96] So, um, okay. Well, that's probably
[11637.76] after that rant, it's probably a good
[11639.279] time to pull the plug on this tonight.
[11641.2] It's getting really late here where I'm
[11642.72] at, and I've still got things to do.
[11645.6] Yeah. So, we'll just I'll just say this
[11647.2] one thing because after that rant, I
[11649.279] think it's important to highlight that
[11651.359] we just started the membership part of
[11654.16] YouTube and you guys probably see ads on
[11656.96] these videos and stuff as well. Okay,
[11659.279] what what are we trying to do with the
[11661.12] membership part of this? Why are we
[11662.72] monetizing this? Exactly for what
[11665.6] Randall just said. We're trying to fund
[11668.8] this research. We're trying to be able
[11670.84] to make this not just about I mean
[11674.239] Randall doesn't want it to just be about
[11676.08] him. He wants it to be about more and
[11677.68] more people to have students to have
[11679.279] other professors to have other people
[11680.96] teaching these things. So what we're
[11683.2] doing with membership is you can join.
[11686.08] It's like $2 a month or something like
[11688.399] that. And it's for the community members
[11691.04] who also want to like vote. We're going
[11693.04] to have membersonly polls where you can
[11695.04] say, "Hey, I like this. I want to hear
[11696.64] about this." you're going to have member
[11698.0] only chat where essentially we're trying
[11700.16] to insulate a community of people who
[11702.8] are willing to spend $2 to at least be
[11706.239] good actors who are trying to contribute
[11708.399] to this and also the funds help. Well,
[11710.479] that'd be awesome because you know even
[11713.279] before even when I was funding it on
[11715.2] myself that by myself that was my my
[11718.239] priority was getting out there doing the
[11720.239] research and sharing the research. So if
[11723.04] I have more resources to do that, I will
[11725.52] be doing more research because look, I I
[11728.0] now know that there's a lot of young
[11730.239] recently graduated geologists and in
[11733.04] related disciplines that are coming up
[11735.52] and that are more open-minded than some
[11737.84] of their elders that are still locked
[11740.8] into the uniformitarian paradigm and
[11744.279] who who h have uh mastery of a lot of
[11747.68] the new technologies and stuff. Yeah. to
[11750.16] to bring some of those in and re
[11752.239] literally create a a discipline that the
[11755.439] a geological discipline whose focus is
[11757.68] on catastrophism. And it would tie in
[11760.0] with catastrophic climate change, the
[11762.08] mass extinctions, all of these things
[11764.319] that I think are interrelated, impact,
[11767.16] geology, all of that. And it needs to be
[11769.68] a grand synthesis of these things that
[11772.0] we now know about the way our planet
[11774.64] changes. Yeah. And it ties into even
[11777.12] more than that, even more than geology.
[11779.359] It ties into all these different ideas.
[11781.52] And I mean a good example of people,
[11783.92] young people who are doing this too is
[11785.52] at the cosmic summit. Like you have
[11787.52] people that are content creators and
[11789.68] also young academics who are coming
[11791.76] together to explore these heterodoxical
[11794.08] ideas and do it responsibly, not just
[11797.84] sure come here and say something. So
[11800.399] it's a good venue for that as well. You
[11802.56] can look to people who are speaking
[11804.56] there to at least start that research.
[11806.8] But we want to build that community more
[11808.56] and more and more. And what I like about
[11811.52] the Cosmic Summit is George isn't
[11814.92] really reluctant to say, "Yeah, we're
[11817.6] we're bringing a spectrum of of
[11820.64] viewpoints and perspectives together
[11822.319] here. It's not going to be limited to
[11824.16] only a narrow range dry specific uh
[11828.56] discipline and anything outside that has
[11831.68] has no place or you know a a very narrow
[11836.16] uh interpretation of what's possible
[11839.0] within the whole realm of nature. Uh
[11842.399] hearkening back to uh the uh oh the
[11845.84] famous paper by um William R. Davis, the
[11848.8] founding father of geomorphology, called
[11850.88] the value of outrageous
[11853.08] hypothesis. And in there, he excoriates
[11855.68] his colleagues for just getting too, you
[11858.88] know, too dogmatic about what's possible
[11862.0] and what's not possible. And he cites
[11864.08] this whole litany of things that were
[11867.04] considered impossible that had become
[11870.399] demonstrated be had become reality. Um,
[11873.92] and and we need more of that. We need
[11875.76] more because there are people out there
[11877.12] that think, you know, uh, any, oh,
[11880.0] that's fringe, that's they're too ready
[11882.239] and willing to sling the the the label
[11885.88] pseudocience. And and the thing of it is
[11888.88] is is they in the big picture if they're
[11893.2] if they're developing models of reality
[11897.04] that has no cognizance of any of the
[11899.92] things that we've been talking
[11902.279] about. How valid are those models?
[11906.08] Yeah, I think that's a fair question.
[11907.76] It's a very fair question. And I think
[11910.2] pseudocience when it was said
[11912.76] integrously used to be because they were
[11916.399] pointing at people being lazy and now
[11918.319] it's kind of flipped too. Yeah. Or
[11920.399] accusations of pseudocience flow both
[11923.12] ways. Yeah.
[11925.279] Yep. So I I try to stick to what's
[11929.359] known. You know I I do believe in uh
[11932.8] Carl Sean's famous saying that uh what
[11936.319] is it? Extraordinary claims require
[11938.319] extraordinary proofs. My approach that
[11942.08] some people don't like because some
[11943.68] people just want the answers without
[11945.359] having to do the hard work. They just
[11946.88] want to be spoonfed. Well, what's this?
[11949.2] What happened? What do you just tell me
[11951.04] what Well, I want what I'm going to do
[11953.04] here is I am laying out the case and I
[11956.8] want you to exercise your own faculties
[11959.04] of reason and see what you conclude from
[11962.399] the evidence that I'm going to show you.
[11964.88] And I'm very interested to see if you
[11967.12] after due consideration
[11969.92] uh arrive to some of the uh conclusions
[11972.479] that I've arrived. But I'm not going to
[11975.04] sit here and spoon feed you all of the,
[11978.16] you know, the interpretations. I want
[11979.92] you to engage and do some positive
[11981.76] thinking yourself. And I've found way
[11984.56] too many people want to sit back and
[11987.68] just be spoonfed.
[11989.68] They want to be entertained, but they
[11991.12] don't want to be educated in the
[11992.72] process. And we're going to change that.
[11994.96] We want to try to make education very
[11997.92] entertaining, entertaining. And to me,
[12000.479] learning this stuff that we're talking
[12001.92] about here and then being able to go out
[12003.52] in the field and and experience it
[12005.52] firsthand, that's a very entertaining to
[12008.8] me.
[12010.479] How much better does it get? You know,
[12012.08] you're able to truly pursue truth. Sure.
[12015.439] That's it. So the the the bottom line is
[12018.56] I think we can say with confidence that
[12020.72] there's one hell of a big epic story
[12023.76] that's been waiting for us and the time
[12026.96] is right now to disclose to peel back
[12030.64] the layers and disclose this story
[12033.439] that's been
[12037.96] written able to see it because we're
[12040.68] microbes within this larger stage. And
[12044.64] now we're expanding our vision
[12048.279] technologically. We're we're getting
[12050.239] eyes and insights that we didn't have a
[12053.6] few generations ago. We're doing what we
[12056.88] have the potential to do now was
[12059.0] impossible for our predecessors of a few
[12062.64] generations ago. They could not they
[12065.279] didn't have the tools. They didn't have
[12066.56] the expanded vision and the critical
[12069.239] understanding to begin to to discern
[12072.0] this story that's been waiting for the
[12074.96] human species to to evolve to the
[12078.399] ability to to begin to read it and
[12080.72] decipher it. And I think that's where
[12083.52] we're at now. I think we're at the point
[12085.279] where yeah, we can see and you know
[12087.76] we're going to be tying together you
[12089.6] know just like we're tying together the
[12091.439] events over North America. We're going
[12094.08] to I think come to the conclusion that
[12096.479] we're looking at yeah the global events
[12100.0] and then to understand those global
[12101.92] events we have to not confine our
[12105.76] thinking to purely terrestrial domain.
[12108.8] We have to expand our thinking into the
[12111.16] cosmos and then we will have a framework
[12114.08] for understanding what's ultimately
[12116.399] driving these things, these events that
[12119.439] we're whose aftermath we're seeing
[12122.479] preserved in the landscapes of the
[12124.16] earth.
[12127.16] Amen. Amen, brother. All right. Until
[12129.92] next time. Thank you,
[12132.12] Randall. Adios. Adios.

Title: Mount St. Helens: Life After Destruction
[0.08] Oh, a few years ago I went to Mount St.
[2.08] Helens to study the how the nature was
[6.08] recovering in the aftermath because you
[7.839] had a couple hundred square miles in the
[10.08] aftermath of Mount St. Helens back in
[12.16] May of of 1980 that was just basically
[14.719] turned into a completely decimated lunar
[16.8] landscape. Yeah. But even within that
[19.6] there were little pockets of ferns that
[22.16] survived. And from those ferns, you see
[25.76] life gradually beginning to proliferate
[28.92] outwards. And then with an increasing
[31.76] pace as the years go by. And so now
[34.8] maybe a third of the area that was
[37.28] devastated is is being reclaimed.
[39.12] Forests are starting to encroach.
[41.2] Another few centuries, the mountain will
[43.36] be pretty much reforested, which is a
[45.28] very small amount of time relatively for
[47.2] the earth. Yes. Certainly by half a
[49.84] millennium, I think you're going to be
[51.32] seeing forests completely recovering on
[54.719] the

Title: What If We Built for Space Instead of War?
[0.16] This is the principal investigator and
[2.32] leader of the team here, Bethany
[4.64] Elellman, planetary geologist,
[6.72] trailblazer, lunar trailblazer,
[8.88] president of the Planetary Society. I
[11.2] like seeing this. I like seeing women
[12.88] that are getting involved on this level
[15.04] of moving science forward. This is going
[17.199] to be the most extensive map of water
[19.52] resources on the moon, and this is going
[21.119] to become immensely valuable. Well, this
[23.119] brings up what I think is going to be an
[24.8] important idea right now, and we rightly
[27.68] can criticize the fact that we're
[29.519] engaged in wars that are using
[32.88] implements, weapons of war that were
[35.04] manufactured by the aerospace industry,
[37.36] such as Lheed Martin. If we end these
[40.32] pointless wars, forever wars, if we're
[43.92] able to, like Trump is proposing, cut
[46.96] our military spending by half, but we're
[49.76] going to have that our aerospace
[51.6] industry is going to get sidelined
[54.079] because what it's going to do is create
[55.92] a whole new generation of possibilities
[59.68] for our aerospace industry. They're in
[61.76] business to make a profit. Well, if the
[63.68] politicians and them are in in alliance
[66.24] and the politicians are making forever
[68.24] wars, well, of course, yeah, they're
[69.68] going to come out come on board and
[70.799] they're going to go, "Okay, well, we'll
[72.4] get these big multi-billion dollar
[74.32] government contracts." But what if
[75.84] instead they were actually creating the
[79.119] technologies and the industrial base to
[81.68] create a cosmic space fairing
[83.68] civilization?

Title: The Ice Age Wasn’t Slow
[0.0] So there's ice age earth. Now that's
[1.68] what the earth would have looked like 15
[3.12] to 20,000 years ago. What you've got to
[5.12] do is consider that northwestern Europe
[8.0] mantled in ice. Northern America mantled
[10.96] in ice up to a mile and a half thick
[12.639] reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
[14.24] All of Canada was buried under ice.
[17.039] Well, that's becomes the question. Would
[18.96] there have been civilization in say
[21.72] unglaciated? Certainly wasn't any
[23.76] civilization in the area that of the
[25.439] glaciation. When you have a cycle of
[27.519] glaciation coming, it pretty much
[29.439] obliterates everything that was there
[31.039] before. Radiocarbon dating, you know,
[32.719] became a thing in the 1950s. And as we
[34.96] begin to to learn more, we started
[36.64] finding out, well, wait a minute, there
[37.84] were forests growing in Canada 40 to
[39.68] 50,000 years ago. How's that possible?
[41.52] Well, if if there was, you know, a mile
[43.68] of ice over Canada. What happened is the
[46.48] span of time between these events just
[48.399] kept contracting and contracting. Then
[50.96] in the 1980s, 1990s, we began to extract
[53.92] high resolution ice cores from
[56.079] Greenland, from Antarctica, from
[57.6] mountain glaciers. Yet the story they
[59.359] told was of climate change that occurred
[62.399] inconceivably fast, where you might have
[65.119] had 10 to 12° centigrade, which is close
[68.0] to like 18° F, literally in less than 5
[72.0] years. Now, this is very demonstrative.
[74.88] Really? Yeah. I'm not exaggerating.
[76.96] Excuse me. If that happened now, you
[78.799] would have a lot of dead people. We're
[80.4] screwed.

Title: What Really Happens When Craters Form
[0.08] these two diagrams showing us the
[2.639] processes of crater formation. So, we've
[5.359] got two examples here. We've got a
[6.96] simple crater and a complex crater. If
[8.88] we look right here, we'll see that that
[10.48] the complex crater has a central uplift.
[12.719] We'll also notice that there are these
[14.719] fracturing, these terrace formations
[16.96] along the rim here, which will show up
[19.6] as a multi- ringed structure. Most
[22.08] famous example is Meteor Crater in
[24.56] Arizona. There's a whole bunch of stuff
[26.32] that gets thrown up into the air as a
[28.8] result of the impact and then that stuff
[30.64] falls back to Earth. It can fall outside
[33.04] the crater or inside the crater.
[35.04] Obviously, the heavier and bigger stuff
[37.12] is going to get thrown less farther and
[39.76] the finer, smaller stuff is going to get
[41.6] thrown farther. So, a lot of the bigger
[43.68] stuff actually falls back into the
[45.52] crater. And you'll see here that there
[47.2] are two bottoms to the crater. There's
[49.92] the current the present bottom which is
[52.399] actually not the original depth of the
[54.719] hole. The original depth of the hole is
[56.8] this bottom line down here. But then
[59.12] with the because of the material that
[60.719] falls back into the crater, there's the
[62.879] final depth of the crater as opposed to
[65.36] the transient depth of the crater.
[67.28] Meaning it just lasts for a little
[68.799] while. Underneath you've got the
[70.24] fractured bedrock. That's going to
[71.76] become important down the road when
[73.439] we're talking about exobiological
[75.6] processes because fracturing in the rock
[77.92] allows the movement of water through the
[79.92] crust which is very important. The two
[82.479] things that primarily distinguish it,
[84.159] one is the larger diameter, but then is
[86.479] the the fault terracing on the sides and
[88.72] the central uplift.

Title: Is Climate Change Driven by Cosmic Forces?
[0.08] You know the climate has been extremely
[2.159] dynamic. That's the thing we have to
[3.919] emphasize all by itself without any help
[6.4] from humans. And this is what I'm been
[9.12] saying is that we have to look at that
[11.44] and and realize that yeah humans are a
[13.599] factor. You know, somebody I did post
[16.0] and said all the other factors I had
[18.16] mentioned as, you know, ocean currents
[19.92] and wind currents and geomagnetic field
[22.08] and cosmic rays and vulcanism and all
[24.32] that had all been investigated and
[26.24] dismissed and the only thing left was
[28.56] the human contribution. To me, that's
[30.64] really we're putting all our eggs in
[32.16] that basket. And that could turn out to
[33.84] be very dangerous because we're so
[36.0] focused now on our own contribution that
[38.719] we might be overlooking the fact that
[41.12] there have been natural factors driving
[43.28] climate change over and over and over
[45.52] again. I mean, because I still have not
[47.92] heard any consensus on what has caused
[51.2] the planet to first go into an ice age
[53.76] and come back out of an ice age. And I
[55.84] think that what Graham and I are talking
[57.68] about actually presents a a possible
[60.64] solution to what could have brought this
[62.48] planet out of the ice age. Something on
[64.799] a grand cosmic scale. We have to realize
[67.119] that it's part of a cosmic ecosystem.
[69.84] And the cosmos has been a much bigger
[72.32] player in what's been going on down here
[74.56] than has been a previously understood or
[76.96] appreciated.

Title: What Melted 6 Million Cubic Miles of Ice?
[0.0] Excuse me. If that happened now, you
[1.92] would have a lot of dead people. We're
[3.52] screwed. Yeah. So, what you had, there's
[5.04] this period called, you might have heard
[6.24] of it, the younger dus. It was this
[8.96] episode that brought the ice age to an
[11.519] end. Because of astronomical forces, the
[14.24] earth, its tilt, the the shape of its
[16.88] orbit and so on, its distance from the
[19.039] sun. There are gradually accumulating
[21.6] changes in the amount of thermal energy
[23.359] reaching the surface of the earth. These
[24.88] are called the Malankovich forces.
[26.56] Generally the thought was is these
[28.16] Malankovich forces what were behind the
[30.48] period of glaciation and deglaciation.
[32.48] The problem is they play out over tens
[34.16] of thousands of years. We're looking at
[36.64] episodes now that happened within a few
[39.2] thousand years because if you go back
[41.04] 13,000 years ago, 14,000 years ago, you
[44.239] had an enormous mass of ice and a few
[46.64] thousand years later it's gone. In order
[48.879] to get rid of that ice, it requires
[51.68] energy. You don't melt six million cubic
[55.039] miles of ice without some source of
[57.44] energy to do the

Title: Glaciers Are Revealing Forgotten Forests
[0.08] The global warming began 200 years ago.
[2.159] And we see that the glaciers from the
[3.6] Little Ice Age began to shrink back in
[5.6] the early 19th century, a century before
[7.759] there was any significant human
[9.519] contribution of CO2 to the atmosphere.
[11.92] It's important to realize that the
[13.36] Little Ice Age was probably the coldest
[16.16] period since the end of the Great Ice
[18.72] Age. In fact, the data overwhelmingly
[21.52] supports that and that the glaciers grew
[23.84] to their largest extent around the
[25.6] planet in 10,000 years. So when we're
[27.92] talking about glacier recession, it's
[29.679] important to understand what the
[31.519] baseline is. Our baseline in this case
[33.68] is the biggest the glaciers have been in
[35.44] 10,000 years. And what's interesting,
[37.36] and this is going on right now, as the
[39.76] glaciers have been receding, geologists
[42.32] and biologists and and glaciologists and
[45.2] so forth have been studying the
[47.6] landscapes that are being revealed as
[49.84] the ice shrinks back. And you know what
[51.44] they're finding is the remains of
[53.52] forests that had been overrun by the
[55.92] little ice age glaciers and pete bogs
[58.239] and things that would suggest that prior
[60.8] to the onset of the little ice age those
[64.0] valleys that were filled with ice from
[66.32] roughly 1400 to 1800 were actually
[69.96] forested because the ice came down and
[72.799] overran these forests and now it's
[74.88] receding back and revealing that there
[77.2] were forests there. So that tells you
[79.36] that, you know, at some point, probably
[81.52] going back to the medieval warm period,
[83.52] those areas that have been glaciated
[85.52] during the early part of the 20th
[87.04] century were actually free of Ice.

Title: Mega Impacts Larger Than Nukes
[0.32] Wars' crater Algeria ages less than 70
[4.24] million years and it's you know energy
[6.56] release is going to be in the ballpark
[8.08] of the preceding few that we looked at.
[10.32] Next one is not an actual photograph but
[12.559] it's a it's a digital elevation model of
[15.12] the the subsurface structure but it's
[17.52] very old 360 million years
[19.92] approximately. That little sign right
[21.68] there means approximately explosive
[24.16] energy. you know, because we're getting
[25.92] up. This one worked out to be a little
[28.4] bigger, 180 megat tons. You can see that
[30.96] an that an explosion of this magnitude
[34.239] would we're now getting on the level
[36.079] where immediate devastating effects
[38.64] would extend out several hundred miles
[40.399] from the zone of impact. The next is a
[42.719] fairly new recent discovery corissalt
[45.28] structure in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
[47.52] What's interesting about this one, it's
[48.96] underwater at a depth of ranging from
[51.28] 131 to 682 ft. The diameter is about
[54.32] three miles. So here now we're getting
[56.48] up in the range of 180 megat tons. So
[59.039] this is more than three of the biggest
[62.559] hydrogen bombs ever tested by the US. An
[65.28] explosion of this scale could pretty
[67.28] much wipe out most of an area, maybe the
[70.64] size of

Title: Breaking the Program
[0.08] There are things coming down the
[1.92] pipeline that if they're not squashed,
[4.16] they're going to completely change the
[5.92] world. We need a change. Yeah, I think
[8.32] change is coming. I think it is. I
[10.96] always kind of look at it in a way as
[12.88] kind of like the last great burst of
[15.36] freedom in America. And that's to me
[17.92] what the essence of it was all about cuz
[20.32] we were already becoming this regimented
[22.32] society, very militaristic, overheavy on
[25.84] the control systems. And of course
[28.24] that's why books like Brave New World
[31.32] and Animal Farm, those were really
[34.88] important books at that time because at
[37.28] the same time you're breaking out of
[38.879] this
[39.879] shell. You realize that you were living
[42.96] in a manufactured reality that had been
[46.399] contrived and spoonfed to the population
[49.039] and it was all based on propaganda.
[51.2] Well, people
[52.68] underestimate social conditioning and
[55.84] they've had decades and decades to
[59.039] finetune it. People aren't even aware
[61.199] that they're getting No, they're not.
[62.96] They just they have not a clue. If
[64.72] you're hip to it and you're aware of it,
[66.72] then you can Yeah. avoid it. You can
[69.2] avoid it because it is a to me a form of
[72.24] bondage, you know. once, like you said,
[74.0] I mean, there's so many people that are
[75.439] now completely programmed, programmed
[78.4] into this reality, and it's something I
[81.36] think that needs to be re fixed.

Title: LSD & Vietnam Changed Everything
[0.08] If you've got anybody what under 16, you
[3.04] probably should make them leave the
[4.24] room. LSD was the bomb. Changed
[6.879] everything. Well, it was I've always
[8.32] said that there was two huge factors
[11.84] that made the late60s what it was. And
[15.04] that was psychedelics in the Vietnam War
[17.52] cuz the Vietnam War was huge on the
[20.4] psyche, I think, of our generation. If
[22.56] the hordes of whoever the Vietkong or
[25.92] whoever it might be came over in their
[27.84] boats cuz they didn't have airplanes so
[30.56] it would had them in boats. If they rode
[32.719] over across the Pacific Ocean and and
[35.28] invaded us then I might have been called
[37.04] up. The war was no joke. No, the war was
[39.76] no joke. And if you weren't into the war
[42.719] and didn't want to go to the war, I had
[44.48] a number of people helping guys shoot
[46.239] off their toe trying to like a mock
[49.2] suicide, taking a whole bottle of
[51.12] aspirin and they'd do anything to get
[53.28] out. But this one guy in our school, and
[55.52] he got drafted in the induction center,
[58.16] this was in Athens, UG, and he came to
[61.28] me and he said, "Man, I I can't do this.
[63.44] I can't go." And I said, "Well, look,
[64.96] here's a little pill. Take this 45
[67.159] minutes before you go in." So he took it
[70.479] and he went in. He went crazy. He
[73.92] thought these were like he saw these
[75.68] fascists and uniforms trying to steal
[77.92] his soul and his mind. And he was like
[80.56] throwing people around, picking up
[82.479] chairs, trying to bust out the windows
[84.64] and picking up. He was a big guy
[86.32] throwing desk around. They said, "Yeah,
[88.32] this is just exactly what we want,
[89.92] right?" You would think so, but he was
[91.52] so far gone. They just said, "No, they
[93.439] just he got out. I hope we don't fall
[95.36] into some
[96.52] solaristic darkness." You know, I'm
[99.36] encouraged that there are things
[101.04] happening that are so awesome and really
[103.439] so positive. There's like this side of
[105.84] me that says as grim as it might get in
[108.56] terms of world moving towards towards
[110.799] Armageddon. If that was happening, why
[112.799] are all these other positive things
[114.64] happening parallel with it? This is a
[117.04] world of contrast.

Title: Why Were Ancient People Moving 2-Ton Stones?
[0.04] what is their motive if we place this
[2.159] back particularly within that climate
[4.279] zone at 11,6 to 12,000 13,000 years ago
[8.32] whatever it turns out to be we're
[9.719] dealing with an extremely demanding and
[12.36] challenging climate what is their motive
[14.4] for undertaking a project on this scale
[16.72] because it's an enormous project and to
[19.439] move a 20 ton block of stone is really a
[23.199] challenging task to undertake today
[26.0] today well without you know the
[27.72] infrastructure of large machines and so
[30.24] forth but to do it by hand it would be
[32.92] an enormous undertaking to me it's like
[35.32] when are they having time to hunt and
[36.879] gather when you're engage in a project
[39.0] of this scale

Title: War Below, Awakening Above
[0.08] if you go back and you look at the
[1.6] statistics there was a major shift
[3.919] between 66 and 68 66 majority of
[7.96] Americans were completely supportive of
[9.519] the Vietnam war effort in the buildup
[11.36] that lynon Johnson was doing but by 68
[15.32] they had began to turn the other
[16.76] direction and by 69 you now had a
[19.64] majority of Americans who were opposed
[21.68] to the war and this is why Nixon ran on
[23.84] the platform of peace with honor of
[26.519] course what he did is he drug out the
[28.32] peace for as long as he possi could that
[30.679] was the the strategy that they had to
[32.64] employ he was going to run on the peace
[34.28] ticket because he knew that popular
[36.0] support was now turned against the war
[38.64] we today have concluded an agreement to
[42.0] end the war and bring peace with honor
[44.399] in Vietnam and in Southeast Asia the
[48.16] following statement is being issued at
[49.8] this moment in Washington and
[51.8] Hanoi at 12:30 Paris CL today January 23
[56.039] 1973 the agreement on ending the war and
[58.6] restoring peace in Vietnam was initial
[60.6] by Dr Henry kinger on behalf of the
[62.32] United States and special adviser Le Doo
[65.119] on behalf of the Democratic Republic of
[67.28] Vietnam the agreement will be formally
[69.56] signed by the parties participating in
[71.28] the Paris conference on Vietnam on
[72.96] January 27th 1973 at the International
[76.159] Conference Center in Paris I kind of
[78.04] look at that wasn't that streaking phase
[80.079] kind of to me like the last gasp of the
[83.159] 60s before disco came in I think that
[86.159] there's kind of this parallel because
[88.36] when all of this stuff is happening you
[90.36] know all this this evolutionary stuff in
[92.88] these tribes are coming together people
[94.32] are exploring we say the inner domain
[98.2] exploring the frontiers of Consciousness
[100.759] at the same time we've got this very
[103.84] vigorous Space Program going on Mercury
[106.56] Gemini Apollo to me I always look at
[109.0] this those are almost like parallel
[111.159] tracks reflections of each other because
[114.079] on the one hand we're going out into
[115.68] space now we got that first that icon of
[118.88] the environmental movement is that
[120.68] photograph the Earth rising you know
[122.68] over the moon whatever like that and I
[125.159] think in in its own way that really
[127.039] expanded human consciousness and I know
[129.599] at the time I was really disgusted with
[132.0] what America was doing and what was
[133.68] happening in Vietnam but I was very
[135.319] proud of the fact that that the going to
[137.92] the Moon I really was into that I wanted
[139.84] to see us but then what happened was
[141.879] well we had to we had to decommission
[143.879] the Space Program basically to pay for
[145.879] the Vietnam War

Title: When the Nile Rose 120 Feet
[0.08] I'm going to refer back to several
[1.76] articles that were published in the 80s
[3.52] and 90s. This one is from uh from nature
[6.08] early 80s late quaterturnary history of
[7.919] the Nile. And what it's discussing is
[10.4] the evidence that there was a major
[12.32] shift in the in the hydraulic regime of
[14.719] the Nile River. It says between 20,000
[17.039] and 12,000 years before present, when
[19.279] timberline in the headwaters was lower,
[22.0] vegetation cover more open than today,
[24.24] the Nile was a highly seasonal braided
[26.8] river which brought mixed course and
[28.8] fine sediments down to Egypt and Sudan.
[31.519] This cold dry interval had enter ended
[34.64] by
[35.48] 12,500 years before present when
[38.0] overflow from Lake Victoria and higher
[40.96] rainfall in Ethiopia sent extraordinary
[44.239] floods down the ma main. And those
[47.84] floods have been documented to have been
[50.239] 120 ft above the modern flood plane of
[53.199] the Nile. any civilization or whatever
[56.079] you want to call it living along the
[58.16] Nile River at that time would have had
[61.28] to abandon whatever they were doing
[63.44] there in this regime, this intensified
[65.84] hydraulic regime. And it says it goes on
[67.68] to say it marked a revolutionary change
[70.64] to continuous flow with a superimposed
[73.2] flood peak. So what happened is that
[75.2] there was a major environmental change
[77.439] that occurred right there around 12,000
[79.68] to 12,500 years. The dating could be
[82.24] adjusted somewhat since the early 80s.
[84.64] But the point is made is that because of
[86.96] a major hydraological change, major
[89.439] vegetational cover change, major
[91.28] environmental change, this would have
[93.439] caused also imposed changes upon
[96.159] whatever culture was existing there or
[98.56] living there at the All right.

Title: The ’60s Are Coming Back
[0.08] We came along in a world where there
[1.92] were no computers, no cell phones, no
[5.52] presence in space when we were born. I
[8.0] think that there's kind of this parallel
[10.12] because when all of this stuff is
[12.24] happening, you know, all this this
[14.719] evolutionary stuff and these tribes are
[16.48] coming together, people are exploring,
[18.56] we say the inner domain, exploring the
[21.76] frontiers of consciousness. At the same
[24.48] time, we've got this very vigorous space
[27.599] program going on. I think in in its own
[30.24] way that really expanded human
[32.079] consciousness at the time. I was really
[34.239] disgusted with what America was doing
[36.239] and what was happening in Vietnam. But I
[38.16] was very proud of the fact that that the
[40.8] going to the moon. Some of us and I feel
[42.719] like you might even be one of them have
[44.48] tried to keep some sense of what the
[46.879] original and authentic spirit of the 60s
[50.559] was about. To keep the flame burning
[53.68] until such time that times were ripe
[56.8] again. And now with some of the things
[60.0] that are on the horizon and particularly
[62.0] we won't talk about some of the new
[63.879] potential energy breakthroughs that that
[66.56] are happening that most people don't
[68.0] know about yet but also the fact that
[70.64] like you said psychedelics are making a
[72.799] revival and we're seeing some incredible
[74.96] research post Terrence McKenna I would
[77.84] say who helped to galvanize the next
[80.159] stage of psychedelic research and that
[83.36] was how you would get information you
[85.68] wouldn't find in mainstream too much.
[87.6] There are things coming down the
[89.36] pipeline that if they're not squashed,
[91.6] they're going to completely change the

Title: Electromagnetic Conductivity in Plasma
[0.24] the interesting thing about a plasma is
[2.32] it can be electromagnetically conductive
[5.359] and it has an affinity for certain
[7.48] geometries and that's the key the
[9.679] electrons and the neutrons and the ions
[12.679] when they're in the form of plasma
[14.24] they're completely Unbound yes not
[16.88] connected at all not connected at all
[18.96] can you see them well you can see
[20.68] lightning right well yeah you can see
[22.16] lightning absolutely yeah you can see
[24.16] ball lightning you know controversial
[27.08] but it it's been proven to exist ball
[29.359] lightning is plasma it's a self- cohered
[32.8] self-organized system of of of plasma so
[36.52] the key is though with the technology
[39.0] here is being able to utilize the
[41.6] plasma and when it becomes
[44.239] self-organized into a coherent system
[46.64] that's when it's called a
[48.12] plasmoid see rather than just a free
[51.039] ocean of electrons and
[53.359] ions without a structure because once it
[57.12] becomes cohered self-organized
[60.64] into a a Taurus it can now be used as a
[64.72] source of energy

Title: Unsealing the Apocalypse
[0.4] Hello and welcome back to another
[2.56] episode of Squaring the Circle. Let's
[5.92] begin after I put my headphones on.
[8.88] There we go. All right. So, we have been
[10.88] talking in recent episodes about cosmic
[14.48] impact phenomena. We've been looking at
[16.72] the Tunguska event which occurred in
[18.88] April, excuse me, June of
[22.039] 1908. We covered that pretty thoroughly.
[24.8] Then we had a couple of episodes where
[26.4] we were looking at the proximity of
[30.08] near-Earth objects and close flybys that
[33.36] have occurred in the last three or four
[35.239] decades and have learned that those
[38.16] types of close encounters have occurred
[40.64] way more frequently than any would have
[42.8] anyone would have imagined generation or
[45.6] two ago. What I'd like to do now is get
[49.2] into the actual impact cratering
[52.48] phenomena where objects from space
[55.12] strike the earth and we'll take a look
[57.199] at a little bit of the evidence that
[59.68] it's accumulated over the last few
[61.359] decades for the formation of craters and
[64.72] astrolanes. Let's talk about the
[66.799] difference between the two. A crater
[69.2] generally, now this there's obviously
[70.799] overlap in the definition, but a crater
[72.96] generally is an open
[76.64] b-shaped structure or depression that we
[79.439] can actually see in the landscape and
[82.0] it's quite obvious such as Meteor Crater
[85.52] in Arizona near Winslow is the the type
[89.6] example that we would invoke in in terms
[92.72] of a classical crater shape where you
[95.68] have a bowl that was excavated into the
[98.88] earth by the impact the actual surface
[101.52] impact of an object. Remember the Tangus
[104.72] object was an
[106.119] atmospheric impact. It detonated in the
[109.119] atmosphere. So what we're going to be
[110.32] looking at now is the geological
[112.72] consequences of actual impacts into the
[115.2] ground surface itself. And we will look
[118.32] at in this episode. What I'd like to do
[120.799] is just sort of introduce you to the
[123.52] broad spectrum of impacts. We're going
[125.439] to be looking at a sample of the almost
[128.8] 200 now confirmed impacts that have been
[132.16] recorded in the geological record of the
[134.879] Earth. And then we will be looking
[136.959] somewhat at the biological consequences,
[139.44] but that will be primarily a focus of
[142.08] another episode of Squaring the Circle
[145.04] in our efforts to completely unpack this
[147.599] whole phenomena of of cosmic encounters.
[150.8] what it means for life on Earth, what it
[153.36] may mean for the geological story of the
[156.239] earth, and what it may mean ultimately
[158.0] for the story of civilization, human
[161.12] civilization on
[169.72] Earth. So, let's get right into it. And
[173.44] first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
[174.56] to make an obvious connection here. the
[176.48] connection between natural phenomena,
[178.239] impact phenomena, cosmic phenomena such
[180.4] as we've been talking about and some of
[183.28] the traditions that have come down to us
[186.319] through various mythic and religious and
[190.84] legendary sources about events that have
[194.239] happened in the past. So, I'm calling
[196.959] this unsealing the apocalypse because
[199.68] once we get into the the legacy that we
[203.04] have inherited of past traditions, I
[206.159] think we're going to begin to see the ex
[208.08] the quite striking and extraordinary
[210.879] parallels between the accounts of these
[213.76] events that have happened in recent
[215.36] times where people have lived to recount
[218.319] their experiences such as we saw I think
[221.519] very clearly indicated in the stories
[223.68] coming out of the Tangus event of 1908,
[227.04] we're going to see that there's a very
[228.64] strong correlation between the imagery
[231.519] of myth and legend and folklore and
[235.44] traditional sources and accounts as
[237.84] there has been from the more recent
[239.68] scientific and eyewitness accounts of
[242.4] cosmic
[243.72] phenomena. So, I'm calling this
[245.84] unsealing the apocalypse cosmic
[248.599] catastrophe. So, let's jump right into
[251.92] it.
[253.439] We'll begin with a gallery of impact
[255.28] craters and astroblams. Now an astrolam
[258.56] as I was talking about is a little
[260.239] different than a crater. It's means star
[263.68] wound and an astrolam is an impression
[267.84] in the landscape the planetary landscape
[270.08] made by an actual impact but it's not so
[272.72] evident. It's usually highly eroded.
[275.28] Sometimes it's completely buried under
[277.199] sedimentary rock or or
[280.12] other depositional material and so it's
[283.28] not really visible too much from the
[285.199] from the surface, but it's still there.
[287.28] ground penetrating radar and
[289.96] LAR surveys and so on are showing up
[292.639] things that we don't really see too
[295.16] visibly from the surface that have been
[298.16] laying there hiding just beneath the
[300.32] surface for for in some cases millions
[303.919] even billions of years. So it means star
[307.28] wound it's it's think of it as a scar in
[309.68] the landscape. So crater the hole in the
[314.0] ground. An astrolame is a scar on the
[316.32] earth that may or may not
[318.44] be readily
[321.4] discernable. All right. So
[325.4] the
[327.24] the phenomena that we hold responsible
[330.639] for this is usually the impact of an
[333.84] object from space. Typically an
[336.16] asteroid. And an asteroid can be a
[338.08] variety of things. It can be
[339.919] carbonatous, which is roughly
[342.36] the roughly the density of a typical
[346.639] rock that you would find, a typical
[348.32] sedimentary rock that you might find
[350.0] walking along a a creek bed or, you
[353.199] know, a river bed or
[355.24] whatever. An iron asteroid is going to
[357.68] be much closer in density to a piece of
[360.08] cast iron. And of course, their
[361.759] consequences are going to be different.
[363.52] A smaller iron asteroid can deliver as
[366.88] much kinetic punch as a much larger
[369.52] carbonacious condritic or stony
[372.36] asteroid. So at the lower end of the
[375.68] spectrum was what we began this
[377.199] conversation about talking about the
[378.8] Tangus object which was probably not
[382.479] much more than the density of ice. So
[385.28] each of these kinds of materials is
[388.319] going to have a different effect when
[390.16] they strike the the planet.
[393.52] In the case of a low density like
[395.039] Tangusa, they might and small enough
[397.44] they're not going to make it to the
[398.72] surface. They're going to blow up in the
[400.24] atmosphere. The denser the object, the
[402.56] smaller it can be because it's more
[404.56] capable of penetrating the atmosphere to
[406.56] strike the surface.
[408.56] This this
[410.12] particular graphic here is pretty cool
[412.4] because what it's showing us here is
[414.56] what I believe ultimately we're going to
[416.24] be moving towards is the idea of a
[418.599] simultaneous multi-impact type event
[421.12] where you have a comet nucleus or
[424.88] fragmenting or an asteroid breaking up.
[428.08] So it's not a single impact, it's a
[430.319] multiple impact event. And I think
[433.84] that's ultimately what we're going to
[435.56] see represents the greatest danger right
[438.56] now to civilization is a not a single
[442.0] Tonguska type event that could be very
[444.8] very devastating to a location or region
[448.24] but a multiple impact event that could
[450.72] be you know more continental or even
[454.0] hemispheric if not even global.
[456.8] Encyclopedia Bratannica tells us that
[459.199] med meteorite crater formation is
[461.96] arguably the most important geologic
[464.72] process in the solar system as meteorite
[467.599] craters cover most solid surface bodies.
[470.319] Earth being a notable exception. Well,
[473.039] is Earth really a notable exception?
[475.12] Well, we have no reason to assume that
[476.96] Earth is being impacted any less than
[479.52] any of the other bodies in the solar
[481.199] system. What is different about the
[483.12] Earth, of course, though, is its active
[485.12] biosphere. It's plate tectonics. All of
[488.08] the things that cumulatively will erase
[492.4] or degrade the evidence of an impact
[496.479] whether crater or astrolam craters
[499.199] become infilled with sediment. The rim
[501.36] the raised rims will erode down so
[504.479] they're not as readily seen. They will
[506.56] get consumed through plate tectonics
[509.599] through continental drift and
[511.12] subduction. in the process of subduction
[513.76] which is where one continental mass or
[516.88] one tectonic plate overrides another
[519.399] one. So you have erosion, you have
[522.0] deposition, you have tectonic processes,
[525.36] you have volcanic processes, you have
[527.76] seismic processes, you have biological
[530.959] processes. All of these things together
[533.76] tend to degrade and slowly erase the
[536.959] evidence of impact phenomena. So if you
[539.36] have a a small impact that would create
[542.48] a a depression in the ground, you know,
[545.04] a few hundred feet in diameter, which
[547.279] there are many examples of, as a matter
[549.36] of fact, they're not going to last long.
[551.68] Now, the meteor crater in Arizona that's
[554.72] so obvious and so impressive, kilometer
[557.279] wide, 600 ft deep, the estimated range
[560.959] of time is usually around 50,000 years
[564.32] old. So in 50,000 years it hasn't
[567.6] degraded much at
[569.08] all. However, under other circumstances,
[571.92] yeah, you could have accelerated
[573.839] phenomena that would cause an
[576.0] acceleration of the rate at which one of
[579.44] these features is being
[581.24] eroded. But the point is the point is
[584.08] this. Between the Earth and any of the
[585.839] other solid bodies in the solar system,
[587.839] Earth has all of these other processes
[590.48] and systems functioning that tend to
[593.76] erase
[595.519] craters when they form. If those weren't
[598.279] operational, we and we could strip away
[600.56] the biosphere and the layers and layers
[602.56] of sedimentary rock that have filled in
[604.88] a lot of the earlier impacts, great
[606.959] impacts. There's no reason to assume
[609.04] that the Earth wouldn't look very much
[610.959] like the moon. And we know that the moon
[613.519] is had hundreds of thousands of impacts
[617.44] over the life its lifespan. So, Earth is
[621.279] actually a much bigger target, a much
[623.44] more massive both gravitationally and in
[626.32] its, you know, its actual cross-section.
[629.519] So, we would assume, there's no reason
[631.279] to assume there wouldn't be just as many
[633.12] impact events on Earth as there is on
[635.04] the moon. But obviously, the Earth
[636.64] doesn't look anything like the surface
[638.32] of the moon in terms of the density of
[640.64] the cratering. But that doesn't mean
[643.04] that the Earth hasn't been struck even
[645.2] more times than the moon has. And I
[648.079] think that going back to the quote here
[649.92] from Encyclopedia Bratannica, I think
[652.0] the idea would be that we're beginning
[655.04] to learn that the impact processes are
[659.279] extremely important. I would like to
[661.76] mention that one of our original
[663.519] sponsors at Cosmographia, CBD from the
[666.8] Gods, is following us here to our new

[727.959] Thanks in the history, not only geology,
[731.04] the but the biological history of the
[733.12] planet. What we're going to do now is
[734.48] we're going to talk about some of the
[736.88] simple processes. is I got a couple of
[738.88] cross-sections here to help you
[740.24] understand the cratering process so that
[742.0] when you start looking at the images you
[744.399] can uh understand better what we are
[747.12] looking at. All right. So these these
[749.92] two
[750.839] diagrams we'll start with a simpler case
[754.079] showing
[755.959] us the processes of crater formation. So
[760.16] we've got two examples here. We've got a
[762.56] simple crater and a complex crater.
[765.36] Let's look. Some of the differences are
[768.839] subtle. Others are more prominent. If we
[771.36] look look right here, we'll see that
[773.2] that the complex crater has a central
[775.72] uplift. We'll also notice that there are
[778.16] these fracturing, these terrace
[780.399] formations along the rim here, which
[783.76] will show up as a multi- ringed
[786.92] structure. Simple crater. We'll see. Our
[790.16] first examples of craters in our gallery
[793.519] that we're going to look at will be a
[794.88] simple crater. Most famous example is
[798.72] meteor crater in Arizona. Let's learn
[801.36] some terminology here. Brees the
[803.279] fallback material. There's a whole bunch
[805.68] of stuff that gets thrown up into the
[808.68] air as a result of the impact and then
[811.44] that stuff falls back to Earth. It can
[813.6] fall outside the crater or inside the
[815.76] crater. Obviously, the heavier and
[818.079] bigger stuff is going to get thrown less
[820.639] farther and the finer smaller stuff is
[822.88] going to get thrown farther. So, a lot
[824.72] of the bigger stuff actually falls back
[826.72] into the crater. And you'll see here
[828.399] that there are two bottoms to the
[830.639] crater. There's the current the present
[832.72] bottom, which is actually not the
[835.279] original depth of the hole. The original
[837.199] depth of the hole in is this bottom line
[841.199] down here. But then with the because of
[843.36] the material that falls back into the
[845.8] crater, there is the there's the final
[849.68] depth of the crater as opposed to the
[852.079] transient depth of the crater, meaning
[853.92] it just lasts for a little while.
[856.399] Underneath you've got the fractured
[857.839] bedrock. That's going to become
[859.279] important down the road when we're
[860.88] talking about exobiological processes
[864.0] because fracturing in the rock allows
[866.279] the the movement of water through the
[869.04] crust, which is very important.
[872.24] And when we look down here at the
[873.92] complex crater, we see that there is
[875.68] this the two things that primarily
[878.0] distinguish it. One is the larger
[879.68] diameter, but then is the the fault
[882.0] terracing on the sides and the central
[884.36] uplift. So this diagram
[888.68] here actually gives us a little bit more
[891.48] detail. And we have the ejectctor being
[894.0] thrown out here. This is the excavation
[895.92] stage, which is the sole or only stage
[898.639] for a simple crater. Right? So at the
[902.48] impact a lot of material is thrown out.
[905.36] Some of it falls back into the crater.
[907.68] Some of it falls outside the crater. You
[910.16] have a shock wave that moves through the
[912.48] crust through the rock through the
[914.04] bedrock
[915.959] and material can actually be will move
[919.44] outward from the point of impact because
[921.76] of the the pressure waves which are
[923.68] represented
[925.0] by the white dashed lines here. We're
[928.04] we're moving outward from away from the
[931.199] impact point, the epicenter. If we go
[933.519] over to B, we see the end of the
[935.199] excavation stage and the start of the
[937.36] modification stage. So here you'll
[940.0] notice that the shock wave is moving
[941.88] out, but then it in a sense it it it's
[945.519] almost like the bounce effect. It it
[948.24] moves out and then it starts coming back
[950.16] in as a rebound. And that rebound is
[953.12] concentrated toward the center right at
[955.519] the impact site. And there is where you
[958.32] can see the beginning of the central
[960.0] uplift is beginning right here. We go to
[963.68] the C which is the continuation of the
[966.56] modification stage. And you see the
[969.12] rebound effect continuing. And now we
[971.44] see the forming of the downfalling along
[973.68] the rims. And we also see the descending
[977.04] ejectives falling back to Earth. Some of
[979.12] it's falling back inside the crater,
[981.12] some of it's falling outside. Now, of
[983.44] course, the distance that stuff is going
[984.959] to be thrown is going to be a function
[986.639] of the energy released upon the impact.
[990.56] And that energy released is going to be
[993.12] a function of the size of the object,
[996.44] the the speed of the descending object,
[999.6] the angle of approach. All of these
[1002.079] factors are going to play in the even
[1005.24] the material forming the target rock.
[1009.36] The final structure is what you see
[1011.759] here. a central peak surrounded
[1014.959] typically by an a melt layer, actually a
[1018.399] layer of vitrified rock in many cases.
[1020.88] And then you see this this terrace
[1023.279] effect, which is the downfalling that
[1025.76] occurs around the rim. And that is often
[1028.319] what you will see as a series of
[1030.72] multiple rings. And then again, the
[1033.36] ejecta blanket you see is the dark gray
[1035.6] area here. That's that's typically going
[1038.72] to be found almost like an apron around
[1041.76] the original structure
[1044.4] uh the original excavation cavity. Okay.
[1047.919] So, let's continue on here and we'll
[1050.72] start with small craters. This is what
[1054.08] we're going to do here. These small
[1057.72] craters, I started small and what I've
[1060.32] done here is I've taken just a sample.
[1063.039] This is far from every crater that we've
[1065.039] now confirmed or suspected of being a
[1068.08] crater just to give you an idea. And
[1070.799] what I've done is I've taken the
[1072.32] diameter, the age, and in many cases I
[1075.76] used a formula and that's given in the
[1078.4] literature and I calculated the energy
[1081.12] released upon the impact and that's
[1082.88] based upon the size of the crater. Now
[1085.2] there can be a wide range of variability
[1087.36] in that but it is going to kind of get
[1090.16] us in the ballpark so we can
[1092.84] understand the intensity of the
[1095.84] explosive phenomena that occurs upon
[1098.919] impact. So the some of these I'm not
[1101.679] sure exactly the precise pronunciation.
[1104.16] I didn't have time to learn all that but
[1107.799] al crater in Moritania. It's a small
[1112.36] one,080 ft in diameter. It's about 3.1
[1115.919] million years old, but it's, you know,
[1117.84] it's relatively young. It's undoubtedly
[1120.88] not anywhere near as deep as it was
[1123.16] originally, and the the central the the
[1127.36] surrounding rim is not nearly as
[1131.039] prominent as it would have been. You can
[1133.2] barely make out that there's you can see
[1135.039] right around here that there is you can
[1137.919] kind of make out the impact blanket
[1140.24] around it. the ejecta blanket
[1142.919] rather. Let's see. We have a photograph
[1146.24] in the next slide of the
[1149.48] Allo crater. Here's an oblique view. And
[1153.44] if you look outside, you'll see that
[1155.28] this is material that would have this
[1157.52] eroded material with the gullies in it.
[1160.24] That would have been the blanket of
[1162.08] ejecta surrounding the the impact
[1166.52] itself. Okay, let's move on here. Okay,
[1170.72] this is the Calk Crater, South Africa.
[1173.76] Its diameter is 2100 ft. It's how old?
[1178.48] Not really certain, but it's less than 5
[1180.4] million years
[1184.6] old. Let's see. So, it's it's quite a
[1188.88] shallow crater and it's probably filled
[1191.36] in, but you can also you can begin to
[1193.28] see that there's you can see this rim
[1195.36] right here.
[1197.2] That's undoubtedly what's left of the
[1199.44] ejecta blanket, the collar if you will,
[1202.24] of material that's been thrown out. You
[1205.28] see how there's this very distinct
[1207.44] difference in terrain between this and
[1209.28] this. So you've probably got several
[1212.799] hundred feet of material blanketing the
[1216.48] original terrain, the pre-impact terrain
[1219.039] here. Now the next one is the famous
[1222.16] crater in Arizona. If you haven't
[1224.0] visited this one, please do.
[1227.44] This is a little old. I was using an
[1230.28] older age for this particular
[1233.0] crater. I think it was originally
[1235.44] estimated to be about 50,000 years old.
[1237.84] Then some studies suggested it was
[1239.52] younger. Then some additional studies
[1241.28] suggested it was actually closer to
[1243.2] 50,000 years. So I'm going to kind of go
[1245.2] with the more recent studies. Again, you
[1247.679] can look at the you can actually see
[1249.6] this hummicky rim around it. That's the
[1252.32] ejecta blanket. there was actually
[1254.4] things thrown out much further that you
[1257.84] know have scattered many many miles from
[1260.32] the crater itself. This is about a,000 I
[1263.919] mean I'm sorry about 600 ft deep and
[1266.799] it's about 3/5ths of a mile or roughly a
[1269.76] kilometer across and it's definitely
[1273.88] worth visiting. I did see a comment once
[1277.32] online. Somebody commented about how
[1280.0] amazing it was that this that the
[1281.84] visitors center here came through intact
[1284.24] after the
[1286.52] impact. I said, "Well, it must have
[1288.559] obviously been some good engineers on
[1290.32] that
[1292.12] project." So, let's keep going
[1295.0] here. Okay, this is Holifford Crater in
[1298.08] southern Ontario. And here, this is a
[1300.08] good example, I guess you could say, of
[1301.679] an astro blame, perhaps more accurately
[1304.559] than a crater because you can definitely
[1307.52] see the circularity of it here. You can
[1310.48] see that there's a tree, an forested
[1313.44] area in the middle. It's not quite, it's
[1316.88] not nearly as obvious as this, is it?
[1320.0] But it's also much much older, like 500
[1323.28] million years. So, this crater being in
[1325.679] Ontario has been swallowed up by
[1327.919] glaciers multiple times. It's probably
[1330.96] had all of its rim material ground off
[1333.679] by glaciers. Glacial till probably fills
[1336.48] up a lot of the the the depression
[1338.919] itself. It's had plenty of time to
[1341.36] erode. But here's for this one. I went
[1344.4] ahead and calculated the
[1347.32] energy for a crater about 1.46 mi in
[1350.88] diameter. The explosive energy would
[1352.64] have been around 42 megat tons, which is
[1356.72] about the same size as 2,800 Hiroshima
[1360.24] bombs, atomic bombs, exploding all at
[1363.36] once. Now, 42 megat tons, little bit
[1366.559] less than
[1367.799] the Zar Bomba, which was the most
[1371.4] explosive hydrogen bomb ever tested by
[1374.08] humanity back in October 1962, was it?
[1378.24] Or 61?
[1380.24] 62 I believe nor doesn't matter but it
[1382.88] was 61 or 62 tested by the Soviet Union
[1386.32] and its energy release was estimated to
[1389.36] be about 50 megat tons. The the largest
[1392.799] bomb ever tested by the US was some
[1396.4] estimates put it at 15 most of it put it
[1399.36] at 20 megatons which would be somewhat
[1402.0] larger than the energy released from the
[1404.96] Tangusa
[1406.679] impact. Okay.
[1409.44] Then we have the BP structure in Libya.
[1413.2] Its diameter is about 10 1.92 miles in
[1417.24] diameter. Its age less than 120 million
[1421.919] years. Explosive energy. Now you see,
[1424.799] notice the difference. We've gone from
[1427.88] 1.46 to 1.92 mi. explosive energy is now
[1432.559] up to about 125 megat tons, which is the
[1436.48] same as
[1438.44] 8,350 Hiroshima sized atomic bombs. So,
[1442.08] you can see that an impact of something
[1443.84] of this size could be regionally very
[1447.679] destructive. I'm going to get into in in
[1450.88] a future episode coming up. I'm going to
[1452.799] talk about the study that was done
[1454.88] around Meteor Crater when when it was
[1458.64] formed and the effects from the shock
[1461.44] wave, the
[1463.159] fireball, the pressure pulse that moved
[1465.679] out from the impact and what what that
[1468.559] did to the surrounding
[1470.679] area. So,
[1472.679] anyways, then we'll go on. Oh. Oh, and
[1475.279] check before we move on. You'll notice
[1477.2] right here that it's got a central
[1478.64] uplift. And you can see that there's
[1481.2] there's a a rim here and then there's a
[1483.6] second rim outside of it that's highly
[1486.24] eroded, but you can still see remnants
[1488.0] of that second outer ring. So now we get
[1490.72] to something that's close to 2 mi in
[1493.32] diameter and we're getting large enough
[1496.64] that we're getting into complex crater
[1499.76] formations rather than just a simple
[1502.44] crater. Okay, let's keep going. The
[1505.12] Steinum Basin, Germany, 14.8 million
[1508.159] years old, 2 miles in diameter,
[1510.4] explosive energy. Again, about in that
[1512.96] ballpark. Now, these are only ballpark,
[1515.279] but it'll give you an idea. 125 megat
[1518.159] tons. So, now we're well beyond the the
[1521.679] power released during any hydrogen bomb.
[1525.76] 125 megatons going to be about 8,000
[1528.08] Hiroshima bombs exploding all at once.
[1532.4] So
[1533.4] obviously any you know human habitation
[1536.32] within this region is going to be
[1538.96] completely obliterated if there was such
[1541.039] a one. Of course 14.8 million years ago
[1543.919] there wouldn't have been any humans but
[1545.84] there would have been homminids. Now
[1548.0] I've always been fascinated by this
[1550.159] because you actually have two villages
[1552.799] that are inside the crater itself. And
[1555.84] you can see most of this around here
[1557.76] would have been highly eroded ejected
[1560.24] material that's been gullied and so
[1562.88] forth. Now this is going to be Steinum
[1565.12] Basin's going to put it right near the
[1566.64] Fenoscandian ice sheet. So there's been
[1569.48] undoubtedly you know glacial meltwater
[1572.799] flooding that has inundated this area.
[1574.96] So there's probably been multiple times
[1578.88] that this is actually could have been a
[1581.0] lake. And that and you'll notice how the
[1583.279] floor is quite flat. This obviously
[1584.96] would not have been the original crater
[1588.32] crater depth. It's been infilled with a
[1591.2] lot of sediment. This is probably the
[1593.64] remnant here of the central
[1597.4] uplift. Okay. Now, let's go down to
[1600.44] Australia goer which is less than 1.4
[1605.039] billion years. So, it's very old. It's
[1608.24] just showing up in
[1609.96] in satellite photography. You can see
[1613.12] the circularity of it from the ground.
[1615.44] You wouldn't even know this thing is
[1616.799] there, but it's from the air that you
[1618.96] can begin. Now, a geologist probably
[1621.039] would. They would recognize telltale
[1623.279] features that could give it away. They
[1625.44] would look at the the fractured rock,
[1627.44] typically overturned rock. If they you
[1630.64] see overturned rock around the rim,
[1632.799] that's a good idea that there had been
[1635.12] an impact there. If you go into the
[1637.279] microscopic level, you'll you'll see all
[1639.84] kinds of proxy evidence for impact. One
[1642.96] of the
[1644.36] more visible features of impacts is
[1647.279] shatter coning. And shatter coning is
[1650.08] occurs mostly in carbonatous rocks like
[1653.679] limestone and dolomite. When the shock
[1656.08] wave passes through the rock, it creates
[1658.32] a very distinct pattern within the rock.
[1660.88] And I'll show you some pictures of that.
[1663.039] Okay. So now some of these vary some of
[1665.919] these I may have taken directly from the
[1667.679] literature from the studies
[1670.039] of the public the publications the
[1672.72] scientific literature so there will be
[1674.64] some variation you know this is 2 miles
[1676.72] but it's estimated powers 125 megat tons
[1681.279] or 6,700 Hiroshima bombs so but the idea
[1684.799] here is just to give you sort of a a big
[1687.039] picture view of this not to to give you
[1689.36] anything super precise okay I might
[1692.96] mentioned, by the way, that crater width
[1696.32] is usually going to range between 10 and
[1698.72] 20 times the diameter of the impacting
[1702.0] object, just as a rule of thumb. So, if
[1704.88] you've got a crater that's 2 mi wide,
[1707.44] that's roughly 10,000 ft, say, in
[1710.0] diameter. So, if you take 10,000 ft and
[1712.88] divide it by 10, you're going to get an
[1714.559] object 1,000 ft. If you divide it by 20,
[1717.6] you're going to get an object between
[1719.44] around 500 ft. So you could picture now
[1721.84] that this particular structure was
[1725.039] created by an impact of an object
[1726.96] roughly between 500 and 1,000
[1729.88] ft. And we've got Brent Crater in
[1732.399] central Ontario approximately 500
[1735.36] million years old. Again, diameter 200
[1737.88] miles 200 sorry 2 miles. And here you're
[1741.6] going to see you can see this in
[1743.84] interior circle is now occupied by a
[1746.0] couple of lakes. Right here is what
[1748.0] appears to be a central uplift. You can
[1750.72] see what appears to be the ejecta
[1752.88] blanket out here around this area. It's
[1756.32] probably eroded on the south side here.
[1759.039] The other thing to keep in mind again is
[1760.799] that this area has been subjected to
[1762.88] repeated glacial interglacial cycles and
[1766.08] so the glaciers are going to you know
[1768.96] cause extreme erosion of these of these
[1773.24] features. Next one though is going to be
[1775.6] a very classic simple crater chub
[1778.399] crater. I don't know why we don't have a
[1780.72] central uplift here unless it's been
[1782.399] eroded away and it's maybe perhaps under
[1784.32] the water. I don't
[1785.799] know. But you can definitely see the the
[1788.399] very circularity of it. You can see a
[1791.2] raised rim around it here. And you can
[1794.48] see that that rim has been insized by
[1797.559] erosion. And I don't know how far the
[1800.32] ejected blanket goes out. But if we look
[1802.08] at this aerial photograph, we can see
[1804.399] this lighter area right here. And it
[1807.2] looks like it's more extensive to the
[1810.44] northeast, which does that mean that the
[1813.12] object came in from the southwest
[1814.72] perhaps. Or does it mean that glacial
[1818.399] processes have erased this area down
[1821.52] here? I don't know. But but you can kind
[1824.559] of see this lighter area here that looks
[1826.88] like it's
[1827.88] probably the
[1830.44] ejectum. Okay. Next we have the ores
[1836.559] crater Algeria. We're getting up a
[1839.44] little bit bigger. It's now like
[1842.039] exceeding and we're up at 2.174
[1845.559] miles. Age is less than 70 million
[1849.24] years. And it's, you know, energy
[1851.52] release is going to be in the ballpark
[1853.039] of the preceding few that we looked
[1855.88] at. All right. Next one is not an actual
[1859.12] photograph, but it's a it's a digital
[1861.12] elevation model of the the subsurface
[1865.12] structure that you can't really see from
[1867.36] the surface. Now, I visited the Flynn
[1869.48] Creek Flynn Creek structure with Brad
[1872.44] Young. We've scouted out some areas and
[1875.84] did find shattered some examples of
[1878.0] shattered and overturned rock that are
[1881.679] an indication, but it's very old. 360
[1885.279] million years approximately. That little
[1887.44] sign right there means approximately
[1889.84] explosive energy, you know, because
[1891.679] we're getting up. This one worked out to
[1894.08] be a little bigger, 180 megat tons. So,
[1898.64] you can see that an that an explosion of
[1901.08] this magnitude would we're now getting
[1904.0] on the level where immediate devastating
[1907.399] effects would extend out several hundred
[1909.84] miles from the zone of impact.
[1914.08] The next is a fairly new recent
[1916.679] discovery, the coror corissalt structure
[1920.559] in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. What's
[1922.159] interesting about this one, it's
[1923.72] underwater at a depth of ranging from
[1926.48] 131 to 682 ft. The diameter is about 3
[1930.799] miles. So here now we're getting up in
[1932.96] the range of 180 megat tons. So this is
[1937.2] more than three of the biggest hydrogen
[1941.039] bombs ever tested by the US. So this is
[1943.36] now we're an explosion of this scale
[1946.32] could pretty much wipe out most of an
[1949.44] area maybe the size of
[1954.2] Pennsylvania. The article that I the
[1957.84] report on this that I read they actually
[1960.08] estimated that the impactor size was
[1962.0] approximately 980 ft.
[1966.64] age pre- plytosine and they because of
[1968.96] the this is underwater it's been very
[1971.279] difficult to date this so there's a huge
[1975.84] age range some of the original ideas
[1978.96] where it may have actually been terminal
[1981.12] pletoine and it was put forth at one
[1983.76] point as a potential younger dus impact
[1987.36] candidate
[1991.64] oops the next one is Goat Paddock in
[1995.679] Western Australia less than 50 million
[1998.64] years. Now we're up to a diameter of
[2001.32] three three miles. The flat bottom now
[2006.0] that could be both a combination of melt
[2009.36] melting and
[2011.559] infill. I haven't seen the any core
[2014.48] samples of this particular crater
[2017.48] or subsurface studies. But if you look
[2021.76] here, you can probably also see that
[2023.36] there's, you know, a raised rim and
[2026.08] piles of material around it. Like this
[2028.48] area right up here looks interesting.
[2031.12] And then you've got this smooth area
[2032.96] right here. So something has eroded that
[2035.6] away. This may have at one time been a
[2038.08] lake. I don't
[2040.519] know. Explosive energy 500 megat tons.
[2043.679] Yeah, we're getting some serious
[2046.279] serious bi I mean environmental
[2049.76] consequences. Now the next one we'll
[2053.679] jump go back to
[2055.159] Canada. The Galo crater also about 3
[2058.48] miles in diameter. This is interesting
[2061.119] because the central uplift is is an
[2064.0] island in the center of the lake. Now in
[2065.839] some of these highly eroded craters like
[2067.76] this one, I want you to look at it. The
[2069.44] circularity is still suggested the
[2071.52] original
[2073.96] circular shape of the of the feature
[2077.599] right after it was created in its youth.
[2079.839] But you can see there's you know been an
[2082.24] extraordinary amount of
[2083.879] erosion that has damaged has has
[2088.48] compromised that original shape. You
[2090.24] have to kind of follow, you know, there
[2092.56] is a hint of circularity there, no
[2094.399] doubt, and that could be a starting
[2095.839] point of research, but then you get into
[2098.0] the proxy evidence of of, you know,
[2100.88] microsphererals, aridium or platinum
[2102.88] group metals associated with it, you
[2106.0] know, the overturned rock
[2109.0] melt microsphererals that have maybe
[2111.839] required 3 to 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit
[2114.24] to to melt. And then it's those kinds of
[2117.44] evidence that will tell you that this is
[2120.48] an actual impact
[2122.2] event. So I want you to look at some of
[2125.359] the, you know, the some of the
[2127.28] topography surrounding it. And in this
[2130.72] case, the debris blanket is not too
[2133.28] evident because probably because of
[2135.76] repeated
[2136.839] glaciation. Another view of of Gow
[2140.04] Crater where you can really Let's see.
[2143.76] Yeah, it's difficult to discern whether
[2145.44] there's any debris blanket around it,
[2147.92] but the island is undoubtedly part of
[2149.68] the
[2150.359] uplift. Pilot Crater, Northwest
[2152.64] Territories, we're up to 3.6 miles.
[2155.359] We're now looking at
[2157.0] 70,600. Again, this could be 70,000,
[2159.76] could be 80,000, it could be 60,000. But
[2162.0] it puts you in the ballpark of the
[2164.079] energy
[2166.359] released. Think of it this way. 70,000
[2169.04] Hiroshima sized atomic bombs exploding
[2171.839] off. Again this is very highly
[2176.359] eroded. This is a highly eroded
[2179.4] structure and uh its circularity is not
[2183.839] nearly as obvious as was when in its
[2187.04] youth and again this is northwest
[2189.52] territories would have been completely
[2191.079] glaciated. So you had thousand thousands
[2194.079] of feet of glacial ice traversing over
[2197.119] this feature. In fact, it may have even
[2200.0] been completely buried under sedimentary
[2202.0] rock that got by removed by successive
[2206.24] glacial interglacial
[2210.68] cycles. Decarville,
[2213.24] Missouri with a 4 mile diameter age less
[2217.2] than 300 million years. This one we're
[2219.119] going to talk about in the in the
[2220.68] future, probably the next episode
[2223.76] because one of the phenomena that's come
[2225.599] up recently is the the the possibility
[2230.8] of crater chains. Decaturville is one of
[2235.76] several craters that appear to be in a
[2238.24] line reaching east to west at about the
[2242.0] 38th parallel. But here you can see
[2244.48] there's a a central ring. I don't see an
[2247.2] uplift in there, but there is a ring, an
[2249.839] inner ring and an outer ring to this
[2253.56] structure, but being, you know, couple
[2256.96] hundred million years old again, it's
[2258.72] going to be highly
[2259.88] eroded. Check out the explosive yield
[2263.04] about a thous more than a thousand megat
[2265.119] tons.
[2269.16] Now, this this is one of the couldn't
[2272.96] find any good images of this, but I this
[2275.68] one, but I did find this. This is one of
[2278.4] those. Notice the date 320 plus or minus
[2281.44] 80 million years. This puts it possibly
[2284.8] in the same age overlap as the
[2287.839] Decaterville.
[2289.599] And it would also be one of this chain
[2292.96] of 38th parallel
[2297.16] craters. Notice this that we're really
[2299.44] getting the magnitude of this. We're
[2301.2] we're at 4.3 mi in diameter and we're
[2303.599] getting up to
[2305.0] 1,792 megat tons. So 120,000 Hiroshima
[2310.079] sized atomic bombs. You're beginning to
[2311.92] appreciate, I think, I hope the
[2314.24] extraordinary magnitude of the energy
[2316.4] released in a cosmic impact. There's
[2318.079] nothing else that even comes close to
[2320.8] these kinds of energies unless you know
[2323.119] at least on a planetary
[2326.2] surface. Kure in Quebec about 430
[2329.76] million years old. Now we're up to 5
[2332.48] miles in diameter. Again, look how
[2334.88] eroded it is. Right? So this is one of
[2339.359] the things to keep in mind if you're
[2340.88] going to go crater hunting. You're not
[2343.44] going to don't just confine your
[2345.599] attention to nice well-developed intact
[2349.4] circle simple crater formations
[2352.76] like you know like the Arizona crater
[2356.48] because some of them are going to be
[2358.4] extremely eroded. They're not going to
[2360.16] have intact rims anymore. And in this
[2363.44] case you know again we're in Quebec so
[2365.28] this was under the ice multiple
[2368.28] times. And here's just another view of
[2371.56] it. And you can see here it's interlin
[2374.079] with a bunch of lakes and and and
[2377.04] waterways and so on. A lot of the
[2380.16] craters that were in the northern
[2381.68] hemisphere have lakes in
[2384.68] them. 5 miles in diameter. The next one,
[2389.119] Gos's Bluff in
[2390.839] Australia. This is always an interesting
[2393.359] one to me. It's age approximately 5
[2396.16] million years. So that puts it very
[2397.839] close to what is known as the Hemphilian
[2400.88] event which was probably the last mass
[2404.96] extinction event on Earth that was
[2406.8] roughly comparable to the terminal place
[2409.599] to scene
[2411.16] extinction and it occurred about 5
[2413.359] million years ago and the diameter about
[2416.4] 5
[2417.64] miles energy 2,800 megat tons or 186,000
[2422.8] Hiroshima atomic
[2424.44] bombs
[2426.52] And this is one I believe that it's kind
[2429.28] of a now becoming a tourist destination
[2431.599] in
[2433.8] Australia because there's a whole
[2436.16] annular mountain. Annular meaning
[2438.48] ring-like mountain
[2442.52] formation. Batch if that's how I'm
[2445.119] pronouncing it right in Kazakhstan also
[2448.32] impacted the earth around 5 million
[2450.56] years ago. So it could be that there was
[2453.119] a clustered bombardment around this time
[2455.839] that's associated with that hemp hill
[2458.48] mass extinction diameter about 5 milesi.
[2461.76] Now compare that to this. They're
[2464.48] roughly the same age and the same size
[2466.96] which is interesting. And here you can
[2468.64] really see the part of the
[2471.079] debris blanketed around the central flat
[2475.359] interior of the crater. So this may be a
[2478.319] combination of of an uplifted ring,
[2481.2] broken rock and fallback brea that is
[2485.04] piled up which you can see if you go to
[2487.2] meteor crater you'll see something very
[2488.88] similar to this that there's large
[2490.88] broken rock and fractured rock
[2494.599] surrounding the the crater itself. The
[2498.0] next one is one that I found really
[2501.599] fascinating. A people dome in Utah.
[2506.2] So I have visited this
[2508.76] one several times with Brad Young, taken
[2513.52] groups there as
[2515.48] tours. And what you see here, let me
[2518.319] jump to the next one. You can see here,
[2520.96] look, central uplift, multiple rings.
[2524.24] Now, what's interesting about this to me
[2525.92] is that I think what we're seeing here
[2527.2] is a juxtaposition of catastrophes. On
[2530.16] the one hand, you've got the multi-ed
[2532.04] crater that clearly was at one time
[2535.359] buried under layers of sedimentary
[2538.16] bedrock, right? Oh, this is called, by
[2541.2] the way, upheaval
[2542.76] dome. It's about 6 milesi in diameter,
[2546.56] less than 65 million years old. But now
[2550.16] look at the energy that we're getting
[2551.68] into here. 6,000 megat tons. This is
[2555.76] this is now going to be something that
[2558.8] where the the consequences are going to
[2561.76] be felt around the entire planet of an
[2564.16] impact of this size. Now you can see
[2566.88] that there are layers of sedimentary
[2569.119] rock that have been stripped away. So at
[2573.2] some point and I would argue that this
[2575.52] would have been like prior to the uplift
[2577.28] of the Colorado Plateau because this is
[2579.92] on the Colorado Plateau. This is in
[2582.0] Canyon Lands National Park or
[2585.88] monument you know that you can visit and
[2588.079] you can there's actually a parking lot
[2590.319] and about a mile hike you got to go up
[2592.24] to the rim
[2593.88] here. It's a fairly strenuous hike and
[2598.24] you know it's a desert country so make
[2600.079] sure you bring if you go to see this
[2601.52] thing make sure you bring plenty of
[2604.92] water but so doubtedly I think what we
[2608.319] see happening here is that you had the
[2610.319] impact it created a buried astroblam and
[2613.52] then subsequent to that you had
[2615.76] largecale erosional phenomena meaning
[2618.72] primarily water that stripped away the
[2621.76] overlying layers of bedrock exposing
[2624.56] decor that would have been hidden
[2628.2] underneath. It's a quite an impressive
[2630.4] thing to see
[2631.48] firsthand. I highly recommend it. In
[2634.079] fact, we may be doing future tours there
[2636.68] again because we'd like to keep doing
[2639.2] more tours to the southwest because
[2641.2] there's a incredible geological
[2645.079] story to unpack in those Colorado
[2649.52] plateau from canyon lands to arches to
[2653.119] Grand Canyon to monument valley of the
[2655.76] gods. All of that stuff is extraordinary
[2659.76] and very extraordinary story there. So,
[2662.8] let's keep moving here. Next one, we've
[2665.28] got Deep Bay of Saskatchewan. This would
[2667.2] have been
[2668.44] another crater that had been overwhelmed
[2671.359] by glacial ice. And again, you as we
[2673.119] look at these, you can see how how
[2675.359] eroded they are. And again, this is
[2678.0] going to be because of the presence of
[2680.56] multiple
[2682.28] glaciations. Well, we're getting up
[2684.079] here. Deep Bay is 7.2 mi in diameter.
[2686.72] It's about 100 million years old. We're
[2689.119] really getting up there close to 10,000
[2691.2] megat tons now. So again, we've kind of
[2693.92] crossed a threshold where the the impact
[2697.04] events that we're looking at now, we're
[2699.76] going to be cons looking
[2702.04] at global consequences. Okay, so if you
[2705.599] figure that this is 7.2 mi, let's just
[2708.56] do a quick calculation here. If I go 7
[2711.2] miles, which is going to give
[2713.96] us about 37,000 ft. Now, if I divide
[2717.44] that, say by 20, I'm going to get an
[2719.76] object about 2,000 ft in diameter.
[2722.079] Roughly, just roughly 1,500 2,000, maybe
[2725.28] 2,500, but it's going to be in that
[2727.2] range. Now, once we get up to half
[2730.72] between half a kilometer and a kilometer
[2732.72] in diameter, it's now accepted by most
[2735.68] scientists that we're getting into the
[2737.52] range where we're going to be seeing
[2739.28] global effects, climatic effects. We'll
[2742.56] probably see, you know, if it's a
[2744.079] land-based impact, we're going to see a
[2746.319] dust veil that could take years to clear
[2749.04] out, which would have dramatic effects
[2751.359] on the climate. If it's an oceanic
[2754.079] impact, it could generate really
[2756.92] enormous cataclysmic tsunamis when they
[2760.16] make
[2761.48] landfall. But I mean, just think about
[2763.44] it. Look at here. You've got an
[2766.319] explosion that's going to be, you know,
[2767.76] between 6 and 700,000
[2770.839] Hiroshima atomic bombs exploding all at
[2773.8] once. Nine almost 9 thou almost 10,000
[2777.68] if you look here. Almost
[2781.64] 10,000 megat tons. So if you take just
[2784.359] 10,000 and you divide that by 50, which
[2787.28] was the largest hydrogen bomb ever
[2789.839] detonated by humans, you'd have to have
[2792.8] a couple of hundred of those going off
[2794.4] all at
[2795.72] once.
[2797.64] Next, V Vario Vario Dome Brazil about
[2802.72] the same size. Look at there. 7.2
[2805.88] miles less than 70 million. That means
[2808.72] that it could have been around the KT
[2811.52] boundary, the dinosaur extinction of
[2814.2] event. Same explosive
[2816.92] yield
[2818.52] and Spider Crater, Western Australia,
[2822.079] which we're up to 8 miles in
[2824.44] diameter. And we're getting up to close
[2828.0] to a million Hiroshima bombs once we get
[2830.56] to 8 miles in diameter. Definitely going
[2833.92] to be looking at global consequences.
[2838.88] Sierra Madera, Texas. You can see it
[2841.2] down here. It's a multi-ed
[2845.079] structure. This might be part of an
[2847.04] uplift. I know. Of course, it's highly
[2848.92] eroded. 8 miles in
[2851.72] diameter, less than 100 million
[2854.839] years. The next
[2857.24] one is
[2859.88] Bastumi Crater, which has a lake in it.
[2862.72] This is in Ghana in Africa. It's
[2867.56] 6.52 mi in diameter. It's fairly young,
[2872.92] 1.1 million years
[2875.56] old, which means that would be young in
[2878.24] terms of of crater ages.
[2881.599] There's been some interesting studies
[2883.359] particularly here because the lake has
[2885.44] preserved a very detailed record of
[2888.4] paleoclimate change which so a lot of
[2890.88] scientists have been studying deposits
[2893.44] from the bottom of the lake and studying
[2895.359] the water and so forth because it it
[2897.92] tells us a whole lot about climate
[2899.599] change in this area of
[2902.119] Africa. Here's another Google Earth view
[2905.44] of Lake Bassum tweet. I call it
[2908.76] that. There's different spellings of it,
[2912.319] so I don't know exactly what the the
[2914.96] best one is. And then here's a a ground
[2918.92] photograph where you can see the
[2920.96] surrounding
[2922.28] mountains and the
[2927.0] lake. Wells Creek, Tennessee, 7.4 miles.
[2931.52] Now, this one could also be the same
[2934.0] age. You see, 200 plus or minus 100
[2936.319] million years, which means it could fall
[2938.8] within the air band of the Decaterville
[2943.44] that we
[2944.52] saw and Flynn Creek because it's also
[2948.559] arrayed along the 38th
[2950.599] parallel. This is one I think could you
[2953.92] notice the central uplift. You know,
[2955.68] again, it's highly eroded.
[2959.28] There is a quarry. When Brad Young and I
[2962.0] went
[2962.92] there, we talked to a land owner who
[2965.52] owns land right on the rim of the
[2967.599] crater. He knew about it being a
[2970.359] crater. Said if we came back, he could
[2972.559] get us access to the rock quarry that
[2975.76] they're quaring material of the central
[2977.92] uplift and we thought that would be
[2979.599] extremely interesting to follow up on.
[2983.92] Okay, next we have Jamansen or Jamanin
[2987.2] in
[2988.76] Kazakhstan. Probably less than a million
[2990.96] years old. We're getting up here now.
[2992.319] We're at 8.7 million 8.7 miles and we're
[2996.8] well over a,200,000 Hiroshima atomic
[2999.68] bombs. So, we're all of the craters
[3002.48] we're going to be looking at now, every
[3004.0] one of them would have had global
[3007.64] consequences, perhaps related to
[3009.839] regional mass extinctions, maybe not
[3011.92] global mass extinctions, but definitely
[3014.68] regional, definitely climate changes on
[3018.24] a on a pretty s significant
[3022.2] scale. Geological changes. Let's look at
[3026.0] the next one. Ames in Oklahoma. We're up
[3029.52] to 10 miles in diameter. Look at this.
[3031.119] Now, when we get to 10 miles in
[3032.4] diameter, we're looking at 2 million
[3033.8] Hiroshima sized atomic bombs exploding
[3036.72] all at
[3037.88] once. 10 miles in diameter. This could
[3041.119] have been between half a mile and a mile
[3043.2] in diameter that struck the Earth here.
[3046.16] We don't actually have a photograph
[3047.839] because it's buried and we don't really
[3050.079] see it too well from the surface. But,
[3052.88] you know, geologists would discover the
[3055.839] secondary effects of the crater if they
[3058.16] don't see the crater itself. Again,
[3060.079] which would be overturned rock layers,
[3062.24] shocked quartz,
[3065.079] microsphererals, you know, breiated
[3067.2] broken rock, down annular or ring-like
[3070.599] downfalling in the rocks. All of these
[3073.28] kind of things would be clues. And then
[3075.359] if you can bring a a a cluster of these
[3077.76] clues together, you can pretty much
[3080.16] establish that it is now a verified
[3085.48] crater. Next, we have
[3090.2] Elij.
[3091.8] However, age 3.5 million years, diameter
[3096.48] 10.8 miles, explosive energy 40,000
[3100.64] megat tons. So 40,000 megatons. We're
[3103.96] now beyond
[3106.68] the total megat tonnage of the
[3109.68] superpowers during the peak of the cold
[3111.52] war. So yeah, we are now beyond the
[3114.8] stage of global thermonuclear war
[3117.119] energies. And so an object 10 mi in
[3121.28] diameter, 10.8 mi, it could be between
[3123.839] half a mile and a mile in diameter when
[3125.92] it strikes. So nobody has any doubts at
[3128.88] this point that an object that large
[3130.88] moving at say you know 20 m/s which is a
[3134.68] typical impact closing velocity of of
[3137.92] these objects when they hit the earth.
[3140.48] Nobody's going to doubt that the
[3141.839] consequences of that would be global in
[3145.559] extent. This next one is a pretty
[3147.68] interesting one. Arunga Chad 2 9
[3152.599] 10 2 miles in diameter
[3158.119] multi-anged and I've got this note down
[3160.319] here. It's part of a multi-impact event.
[3162.96] And you can actually see a little bit of
[3165.52] a second impact ring right up here
[3168.88] almost tangent. So this would have been
[3171.52] two objects that were very close
[3173.839] together. may have been a single object
[3176.8] that fractured would already had a a
[3179.04] fracture line or a fault line in it and
[3181.04] they separated as they were coming into
[3183.72] the into the impact zone of the earth.
[3186.96] And there's actually a third. You can't
[3188.64] see it up here, but it shows up on some
[3190.72] Google Earth if you want to look this up
[3193.359] and do your own
[3194.76] research. I hope I hope some of you do
[3197.28] that. I hope some of you are inspired by
[3198.88] this to get into it. There's and again I
[3201.839] don't even have half of the craters
[3203.28] here. I could have doubled easily what
[3206.0] I'm showing you in this. My my intent
[3207.92] here is just to sort of give you an
[3209.92] overview of crater sizes, crater energy,
[3213.119] the nomenclature and being able to
[3217.359] identify the criteria by which we use to
[3221.52] identify these ancient events in the
[3224.76] earth's crust.
[3227.52] Next one is also of Arunga. And here you
[3230.8] can see central uplift. And then you've
[3233.44] got this ring of uplifted mountains. And
[3236.96] then you've got a downfalted zone right
[3239.44] in here. And then you've got another
[3243.359] ring outside
[3247.559] it. And Wublau impact structure. If you
[3251.52] see the Oage River kind of follows this.
[3254.88] There's a large buried circular feature
[3258.52] here. It also is part of this 38th
[3262.16] parallel chain that we're going to talk
[3264.559] about in an upcoming episode. The crater
[3267.599] chains and other some of the
[3270.839] very interesting and maybe even
[3273.92] mysterious phenomena associated with
[3276.28] cratering that we need to know about.
[3281.2] But notice the age here, 335 to 340.
[3285.04] I've seen others that have a very large
[3288.16] plus or minus error bar next to them. So
[3291.92] again, it's possible that it's in that
[3294.559] same age range of
[3296.76] 300 million years. 12 miles in diameter,
[3302.16] meteoroid size about 1,200 ft.
[3306.48] I don't know that may have taken that
[3308.4] actually from the literature did not
[3310.88] calculate an explosive yield for this
[3312.96] but you know it's going to be up there
[3314.559] over a million megat
[3317.0] tons. Ghost is bluff again 14
[3321.319] miles. This one is really fascinating to
[3324.0] me because of this the central uplift is
[3327.359] is a ring of
[3329.4] mountains and the actual diameter of the
[3333.2] crater. If we go to the next one. Oh,
[3336.2] notice 2,800,000 megat tons. So, it's a
[3340.559] very large explosion. But the next one,
[3343.2] you can
[3345.079] see you can see what the area that would
[3348.319] have been the original crater is out
[3351.119] here. It's not this. This is just the
[3355.079] interior uplifted ring. The original
[3357.92] crater you can see is all the way out
[3360.48] here. And from this figure I from this
[3365.119] photo I can't really make out where
[3366.88] eject the blanket would have been. But
[3369.359] you know given its age you know there's
[3372.079] been all who knows all what kind of
[3374.0] erosive processes with this mountain
[3376.319] range nearby I would have no doubt that
[3378.88] a lot of the original crater depression
[3381.04] would have been infilled by material
[3383.44] eroded off of these
[3385.4] mountains. Okay, the next one. Rus in
[3388.64] Germany. Fairly young amongst craters.
[3391.28] Approximately 15 million years old, 14.4
[3394.88] miles in
[3396.599] diameter.
[3398.44] 7,900,000
[3401.079] Hiroshima. Now we're get some serious
[3405.319] serious global
[3410.28] consequences. This is another view of
[3412.799] it.
[3419.119] And from the ground, this is what it
[3421.04] looks like. Now, this is interesting
[3422.88] because, you know, most people, say
[3425.76] tourists going along this highway will
[3427.599] never have the
[3429.079] slightest idea that they're driving
[3431.68] through an ancient giant impact
[3434.68] crater. The mountains you see here on
[3436.96] the horizon are part of the uplifted
[3439.52] rim, right?
[3441.799] and the in the bottom being flat like
[3445.04] this is undoubtedly had you know
[3447.92] millions of years of sediment
[3449.44] accumulating within it. So it's the the
[3453.359] topography of the original crater has
[3455.52] been very heavily
[3457.72] obscured and one of the points I want to
[3461.04] really try to emphasize here is that
[3464.16] probably every square inch of the
[3465.76] earth's surface has been impacted. So
[3468.48] that means that everywhere people are
[3470.799] living on the top of what are highly
[3473.2] eroded or you know obscured or even
[3476.839] erased astro blames and impact
[3479.28] structures without even realizing it.
[3482.079] Right?
[3483.96] So this is sort of a different
[3486.72] perspective on our earth history when we
[3489.2] begin to really immerse ourselves in the
[3492.4] study of Earth's catastrophic history
[3494.559] which it has been profoundly
[3496.52] catastrophic and most of the
[3499.44] considerations about global change,
[3501.359] climate change, environmental change
[3503.92] that are current do not take any of that
[3506.48] into account. the real actual history of
[3509.52] the
[3510.68] planet. Manson impact structure. Can't
[3514.319] show you a photograph of it because it's
[3516.0] buried
[3517.96] underground. It's in Iowa. For a little
[3520.799] while, it was thought it might be a
[3522.48] candidate impact for the KT or dinosaur
[3525.68] killer event. Turns out it's a little
[3527.839] too old and it's too small. Although it
[3531.04] would have been regionally devastating.
[3532.96] If you can see, this is the structure
[3534.72] compared to the state of Iowa. It was a
[3537.52] safe bet that this impact right here, if
[3540.559] it occurred in Iowa today, would pretty
[3542.48] much erase Iowa. It would destroy
[3544.24] everything in Iowa. Southern Minnesota,
[3547.52] you know, North and South Dakota would
[3549.2] also be affected. Wisconsin over
[3553.72] here. And of course, anything say within
[3557.04] a 100, couple hundred miles of the
[3558.72] impact itself, well, it's gone. You can
[3561.92] see the diameter 22 miles. That's
[3565.04] getting to be pretty big. Notice the
[3567.52] age. So, it's a little too old. 66
[3570.319] million puts it right at the Cretaceous,
[3572.4] but this is a little too old. And again,
[3575.44] it's buried
[3576.599] underground. So, it's not observable.
[3579.28] It's not visible from the
[3581.559] surface. Okay. Caught in astro blame
[3584.64] Northwest Territories. This is going to
[3586.16] be another one that was under the ice.
[3588.72] It's about 23 million years old, 14 1/2
[3591.44] m in diameter. And again, it's not very
[3594.72] evident, but you know, you can actually
[3597.68] see there's a a ring here and then outer
[3601.359] there's actually another like this is
[3603.04] probably if you look at this right here,
[3604.88] this is probably whatever is left of the
[3608.48] of the debris apron around the thing.
[3612.079] But again, you know, it's been under the
[3613.76] ice multiple times, so it's going to
[3615.68] have been very much obscured. But you
[3618.559] can definitely you can still see the c
[3620.079] look at the circularity of the creeks
[3621.839] and rivers around it. Right? You can
[3624.48] make that
[3626.2] out. I've always been fascinated by this
[3629.28] clear water lakes about 290 million
[3631.76] years old. You've got two craters. The
[3633.44] west crater which is about 19.2 mi in
[3636.44] diameter. The east crater about 13.2.
[3639.44] Again, this would be under the ice. You
[3641.599] can see that there's a central uplift
[3643.599] ring. And of course, it's been highly
[3645.44] eroded. And now you have a kind of a
[3647.44] circular system of
[3649.64] of islands there. The smaller one does
[3653.04] not show any signs of an uplift,
[3655.04] although it may have there may have been
[3656.88] one
[3657.72] there at this size. It probably had one,
[3660.88] but it's been obscured by glaciation.
[3664.559] Check this out though. The combined. So
[3666.4] this, you know, either we had both of
[3668.96] them appear to be about the same age
[3671.44] date. So, it was probably an object that
[3674.799] came in and again like the the Arunga I
[3679.52] believe it was that we saw where it
[3681.599] looked like it was an object that maybe
[3683.04] split in two just before
[3685.96] impact or two bodies that were traveling
[3690.079] very close together when they
[3691.44] encountered the Earth and simultaneously
[3694.4] impacted. I'm inclined to think that
[3696.48] they were probably a single object but
[3699.68] were actually separated by a major
[3701.839] fracture line and then as they came into
[3704.16] the Earth's gravitational field they
[3706.0] might have separated
[3708.44] somewhat. But take a look at this
[3710.72] because uh at some point we're going to
[3713.359] when we get to the end of this we're
[3714.64] going to look at the a map showing the
[3716.24] Gulf of St. Lawrence up by New Brunswick
[3719.839] and Prince Edward Island. And it's very,
[3722.799] if you look at the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
[3725.68] it's like almost like half of this, much
[3728.24] bigger, of course. And this is almost
[3730.319] like corresponding to Prince Edward
[3732.0] Island. We'll look at
[3733.64] that
[3735.64] shortly. Teague, Western Australia, now
[3738.64] named after the late Gene Shoemaker, who
[3740.799] was one of the greats in, you know,
[3742.72] planetary research. 20 miles. I mean,
[3746.48] now we're up to 200,000 megat tons,
[3749.599] right? 200,000 megat tons. So that's
[3752.839] many nuclear wars, global nuclear wars
[3756.48] all at
[3757.4] once. If I take
[3760.839] the if I take the let's see what is
[3763.44] this? This is 200,000 megat tons. If I
[3766.48] take the total megat tonnage of the
[3770.64] superpower
[3772.2] arsenals all at once exploding, this is
[3775.2] more than 20 times more powerful than
[3777.76] that. So again, we're definitely in the
[3780.72] realm now where there's going to be
[3781.839] global consequences, right? And we have
[3785.28] to begin thinking about this in terms of
[3787.119] what this does to the biosphere, what
[3789.28] this does to the environment. And we're
[3791.92] really only just beginning because you
[3795.48] see at what point do we cross this the
[3798.48] the the threshold where we're now
[3800.4] talking about global mass extinctions
[3802.48] that the environmental consequences are
[3804.4] so great that we are looking at you know
[3808.72] mass extinctions on a planetary
[3811.96] scale. This again is still not even
[3815.28] close to the crater size for the KT
[3818.559] boundary at 66 million years ago, right?
[3821.839] But it's still within the range where
[3823.28] it's going to have global consequences.
[3824.799] Now, what if something like this were to
[3827.039] impact today? Well, I mean, obviously,
[3830.24] we're with a diameter of 20 miles and
[3833.96] and this is an object that's going to
[3836.4] be, you know, a mile to two miles in
[3838.88] diameter. So it's well within the range
[3840.799] of accepted range of global climatic and
[3844.4] environmental consequences. It could
[3846.16] have an extinction level event on a
[3848.96] regional if not even almost a
[3850.96] continental scale. It would ignite, you
[3854.559] know, major fires on a large scale. It
[3857.839] would create seismic events that could
[3860.48] be felt on a planetary scale. It could
[3863.2] have volcanic consequences. It could be
[3865.76] enough to perhaps cause a cosmic winter.
[3868.88] the onset of an ice
[3872.599] age. Okay, so our next one, again, I'm
[3875.92] not sure how to pronounce this. Push.
[3877.76] Push. I don't know. I'm not even try.
[3879.44] Katunki, I like that. Crater, Russia.
[3882.359] Age approximately 195.9 million years
[3885.839] old. Plus or minus a million years.
[3888.0] Diameter is 25
[3889.88] miles. So again, and see, here's the
[3892.64] thing. We're discovering these things
[3894.24] now all the time. Remember when I on our
[3898.64] first excursion into learning about
[3900.319] asteroids, we learned that on January
[3902.16] 1st, 1801, Cirrus, the first asteroid
[3906.079] ever
[3907.64] discovered, 1801. Right? And how many
[3912.16] impact craters did we know about in
[3913.76] 1801? Zero. Right? So now the other
[3917.52] thing to keep in mind is again we're
[3919.119] talking about actual impacts into the
[3921.839] ground that leave evidence in their
[3924.4] aftermath.
[3926.799] I'm not quite making out exactly where
[3929.039] the crater is in this
[3931.4] case. I'm thinking that you see this arc
[3934.24] right here. I think this is it right
[3936.16] here. This looks like it would be it.
[3938.0] You can see the arc, right? You can see
[3940.72] that arc coming around. You can see it's
[3942.88] not unusual for rivers and creeks to
[3945.2] flow around, especially if there's
[3947.839] uplifted rims to flow around and then
[3950.24] they will define the
[3953.079] circularity and make it much more
[3956.76] visible. This is a big one, 25 miles.
[3960.4] Next
[3961.88] one, Araguahana, Araguena, Brazil. Also
[3967.119] about 25 miles. Now here you can see
[3969.52] remnant of a central uplift. You can see
[3973.359] looks like an annular mountain ring
[3975.359] there. You can actually see the
[3977.64] circularity way out to here. So this is
[3980.88] diameter 25 miles. Now one of the things
[3984.559] I think that we're only just beginning
[3986.0] to appreciate the power of is is lidar.
[3989.119] And as we get more and more areas of the
[3991.68] Earth's surface surveyed by LAR, who
[3994.799] knows what we're going to begin to see
[3996.48] hiding under the under the surface
[3998.68] landscape. I think it'll probably we'll
[4001.2] probably see a flurry of of confirmed
[4003.92] impact structures coming up in the next
[4005.76] decade or
[4009.0] so. And then we
[4011.48] have Caracool and
[4014.44] Tajikistan about 5 million years old.
[4016.799] So, we've had, you notice that we've had
[4018.72] what now three or four of them that have
[4020.88] dated to right around 5 million years,
[4023.44] which I find to be significant again
[4025.359] because independently researching mass
[4028.119] extinctions, I wanted to go back and
[4030.4] find when was there a mass extinction
[4032.799] that was on the equivalent level of the
[4035.68] terminal place mass extinction that
[4037.839] occurred in the few millennia leading up
[4040.64] to and including the younger dus at the
[4042.96] end of the great ice age. And going
[4045.839] back, the one that I found that seemed
[4048.0] to be of a comparable magnitude was the
[4051.119] so-called hempill event, again dated at
[4054.079] about 5 million years ago. So, it
[4056.16] appears now that there's a clustering
[4058.0] around the planet of events, impact
[4061.28] events that occurred around 5 million
[4062.72] years ago. How many more were there? I
[4064.24] don't know. They didn't necessar that
[4065.76] doesn't mean they all happened at the
[4067.039] same time. And it's not like they would
[4070.319] all have to happen at the same time to
[4072.0] affect a mass extinction. One way I like
[4074.0] to look at it is I use the the metaphor
[4076.44] of mixed martial arts fighting.
[4079.2] Sometimes you might go in there and one
[4081.119] fighter will get lucky or because of
[4083.76] superior skill will be able to come in
[4085.599] and just one knockout blow, boom, the
[4087.92] fight is over. Other times the fight is
[4090.4] only won after a long period of
[4093.28] attrition or or after multiple rounds.
[4096.08] One fighter wears down the other round
[4098.48] fighter until finally the death blow can
[4101.359] be delivered or the fight is called and
[4104.319] there's clearly a winner and a loser.
[4106.64] Right? So I think that some of the
[4109.52] various scientists, whether
[4110.88] archaeologists on the one end or
[4113.0] paleontologists on the other end, have
[4115.52] said, "Well, we're not going to
[4117.279] attribute a mass extinction event to
[4120.4] impacts because that would mean they all
[4122.719] had to die at once." Well, no. What
[4126.0] there could be is a whole series of
[4127.759] events, constant, clustered through
[4129.92] time, maybe separated by thousands of
[4132.44] years. But the end result, the
[4134.839] cumulative result of that is that the
[4139.359] habitat becomes compromised severely
[4141.92] enough and often enough that we see
[4144.88] major extinctions,
[4147.239] losing, you know, losing their viability
[4149.6] and becoming
[4151.159] extinct. So this one 28 mi in diameter,
[4155.6] 65 million Hiroshima bombs released
[4159.48] here. Obviously, this is going to have
[4161.679] global consequences.
[4163.6] Is it
[4165.159] not the Siljian in Sweden? 31.2 miles
[4170.56] explosive energy. 110 million Hiroshima
[4174.56] sized atomic bombs all exploding at
[4176.799] once. This is the remnant. And if you go
[4179.92] down there and you're it's probably, you
[4182.08] know, present environment, probably
[4183.839] beautiful lakes, well, you know, with
[4187.279] great fishing in them, great camping,
[4189.12] all of this around here. And how many of
[4191.92] the fishermen, let's say, out fishing in
[4194.4] these lakes know that this was a
[4197.12] gigantic global catastrophe some 368
[4200.32] million years ago? Probably very few of
[4204.28] them. Shalvu, Quebec. Again, another
[4208.12] subglacial flood or subglacial crater
[4212.08] about 360 million years old, 34 miles in
[4215.48] diameter,
[4217.159] a,800,000 megat tons. And here you can
[4219.84] see part of it is completely erased by
[4222.0] this lake here. And but you can see at
[4225.44] least half of the circular original
[4228.48] feature still
[4231.4] exists. Acriman,
[4233.96] Australia, we're still up there in that
[4236.32] same size range. You can see the central
[4239.36] uplift
[4240.84] here. Again, highly
[4244.12] eroded. Beaverhead, Montana, 40 miles in
[4247.6] diameter.
[4250.6] 2.6 million megat tons global global
[4254.88] here. Now an event of this scale
[4257.04] happening now could ex essentially cause
[4259.679] the extinction of most life in North
[4263.08] America and there would be secondary
[4265.28] consequences. The dust fallout and the
[4267.36] the the secondary fires, the soot, the
[4271.04] seismicity, all of that would be very
[4273.84] very damaging and destructive.
[4279.0] Manquagen. Now the
[4281.96] original you can see is actually out
[4284.6] here. There's a central kind of an
[4286.88] uplift and this is actually a artificial
[4289.6] reservoir. There's a dam on some of
[4291.44] these rivers. They're utilizing the the
[4294.719] the topography that nature gave us
[4297.28] through this highly catastrophic
[4300.36] event. But look at here 50 plus
[4303.48] miles. So we're getting into explosive
[4305.92] energy.
[4307.32] 7,100,000 megat tons. Now, this is
[4310.48] falling very close to a late Triacic
[4315.04] extinction event. And in fact, let's see
[4318.08] the next slide. We'll read that
[4321.04] together. The late Triacic, which is the
[4324.159] Carneian to Raian stages, 237,000 to
[4329.719] 201,000 million years ago, has a long
[4332.96] history of geological research. Although
[4335.84] controversy remains over the precise
[4338.159] definition of key subunit boundaries,
[4340.88] including those defining the three
[4342.56] constituent stages. But all that aside,
[4345.84] within this context, at least five
[4348.64] terrestrial bolide impact structures
[4351.04] ranging from 9 to 85 km in diameter have
[4355.6] been identified at present-day northern
[4358.199] latitudes. the proximal remnant crater
[4361.199] aspects of which have been studied in
[4362.96] increasing detail over the last few
[4365.199] decades. So this is what I'm talking
[4366.4] about. Again, it looks like clustered
[4368.88] around. It's not saying they all
[4370.8] happened at the same time. What it is
[4373.12] saying though is that they were grouped.
[4374.8] They were clustered in time. And within
[4377.44] that range of this clustering of
[4380.48] terrestrial of bolite impact structures,
[4383.36] there was one of the great major mass
[4385.32] extinctions in Earth history. It's
[4387.76] considered often one of the great five.
[4390.08] And so it's very possible that just
[4393.52] because a mass extinction event is
[4395.76] spread out through time doesn't mean
[4398.4] that bolite impacts didn't play an
[4401.04] important role if not the most
[4402.8] significant role in that mass
[4404.48] extinction. Now of course the mass
[4406.08] extinction is also going to be a
[4407.76] consequence of the secondary effects of
[4410.08] the impact as
[4411.88] well. An impact of this size and scale
[4415.36] of of the Manquagen is certainly going
[4418.64] to be of the scale that would be
[4420.56] required to induce a cosmic winter or or
[4423.6] a younger driest type global cold event
[4427.28] which of course could wipe out a whole
[4429.76] lot of species that weren't adapted to a
[4432.239] to a very cold glacial or arctic
[4434.48] climate.
[4438.239] Chesapeake Bay Astroblene. This
[4441.159] is age about 35.5 million years.
[4444.64] Diameter 56 miles. So again, we're way
[4448.64] up there, well across the threshold of
[4451.28] global effects. What's interesting about
[4454.0] this, at least as a resident of Georgia,
[4456.239] is that in Chesapeake Bay when this
[4458.96] impact occurred, the the debris that was
[4461.84] thrown up into the atmosphere, much of
[4464.56] it was melted. And as it fell back to
[4466.96] earth, it assumed these aerodynamic
[4468.96] shapes as it solidified, right? Those
[4472.239] become tectites. And tectites are going
[4474.239] to be composed of both the target rock
[4477.44] material composition and the impactor
[4480.239] the bolide impactor composition, right?
[4483.6] And this is how we one of the the
[4486.239] geochemical tests of of tectites. Now,
[4489.84] there is a lot of this stuff that would
[4492.08] have rained down over the southeastern
[4493.92] United States at the time of this
[4495.64] impact. But in the subsequent 35.5
[4498.88] million years, that landscape that would
[4501.44] have been inundated with all of
[4503.4] this the the rain, the debris falling
[4506.48] back, particularly the the tectites,
[4509.92] which would have been melted material
[4512.0] that's falling back to the earth. Right?
[4514.56] That landscape number one is either been
[4517.44] eroded or buried. But just south of Mon,
[4520.96] Georgia at the fall line, the so-called
[4523.04] fall line, which is an ancient
[4524.4] shoreline, there's a very distinct
[4526.96] topographical differentiation. And that
[4530.08] land surface of 35.5 million years ago
[4533.04] outcrops right there. So this is where
[4536.56] you find the the georgettees as they're
[4540.159] called or georgites. Now in the next
[4542.199] slide we're going to see some examples
[4544.56] of that. So these are some of the
[4547.52] tectites. This was literally the splash
[4550.44] material that fell back to earth from
[4553.88] the Chesapeake Bay impact. that 35.5
[4558.8] million year ago landscapes outcrops
[4561.679] right here in these
[4563.56] counties that almost define the fall
[4566.56] line right here where we transition from
[4569.6] Piedmont to ancient coastal plane,
[4572.48] right? And particularly if you go down
[4575.199] and you know exactly where that
[4578.239] landscape outcrops, what you do is you
[4581.12] go down there after a heavy rainfall.
[4583.04] And this is often times when you find
[4585.28] these things laying on the ground. Of
[4588.239] course, they're typically going to be
[4589.52] covered in dirt, so you have to have a
[4591.12] pretty sharp eye for them. But these are
[4593.199] examples of Georgia tectites. And again,
[4595.04] this was some of the stuff that rained
[4596.4] back, the melted material that rained
[4598.88] back down on the earth in the abs in the
[4601.76] aftermath of
[4603.88] the Chesapeake Bay impact. Now,
[4606.92] interestingly, at the same time,
[4609.12] apparently, I mean, very so close in
[4611.36] time that they could have occurred
[4613.96] simultaneously, and by that I mean
[4615.92] within, you know, days or a few years of
[4618.719] each other, not necessarily tens of
[4621.199] thousands or hundreds of thousands of
[4622.8] years, but very, very close in time was
[4625.6] the Popagi in
[4628.6] Siberia, which is an astroblame. And you
[4632.88] can see the remnant of it here. Again,
[4634.719] it's just a scar in the landscape. 56
[4638.0] mi. Again, look, notice the age is
[4640.4] precisely the same age as the
[4641.96] Chesapeake. It's about the same size.
[4644.64] Let's see. Chesapeake Bay was 56 miles.
[4648.239] And this is 56
[4650.84] mi. It's also a very abundance. It's one
[4653.52] of the most abundant sources of diamonds
[4655.28] on the Earth. And that has to do 100%
[4658.32] with the tremendous pressures of the
[4660.32] impact. You know, there had to be carbon
[4662.32] based rocks. And then you have the
[4664.64] tremendous pressures of the impact. So
[4667.36] you have the two ingredients you need
[4668.88] for diamonds. So clearly if these two
[4673.92] happened back to back or simultaneously
[4676.719] or very close to each other, they're on
[4678.88] opposite sides of the world. And guess
[4682.0] what? There was a mass extinction
[4684.4] episode right around that same window.
[4687.52] And I think it would be an obvious
[4690.48] assumption to to speculate that the mass
[4694.199] extinction was related to the impact. So
[4697.6] it's also what appears to be a major
[4699.84] climate change signal as
[4702.36] well. Then we go to the Kara impact
[4705.04] structure 35.5 million years. Again,
[4709.84] diameter 75 miles. So, it looks like
[4713.44] we're seeing what could be interpreted
[4715.679] as evidence of a a clustered bombardment
[4719.56] phenomena and that bombardments impacts
[4723.8] of bolides and and asteroids and things
[4727.04] are not uniformly distributed through
[4729.199] time. They're not linearly
[4732.679] linearly distributed, but they are
[4735.28] bunched in
[4736.52] time. And this could this could pertain
[4739.36] on all scales of impact
[4743.08] phenomena. And the acriman impact
[4746.159] structure also 56 miles in diameter or
[4749.52] 56 milesi. I should have had this
[4751.48] previous. Trying to keep these in order
[4754.32] of size, but that doesn't
[4756.52] matter. 590 million years, but it's it's
[4760.08] another big one. The next
[4763.48] one is the cheek shaloo
[4766.679] astrol. Now this one notice 66 million
[4769.84] years diameter 150 miles and I have the
[4772.88] plus mark because there is some
[4775.159] controversy could be 150 up to 180 miles
[4779.84] maybe even
[4781.64] bigger. But look what we're talking
[4783.6] about here. 20 billion Hiroshima sized
[4786.719] atomic mouse 300 million megat tons.
[4790.8] This alone, I think, would be enough to
[4793.36] cause a planetarywide extinction.
[4796.08] There's also evidence again of clustered
[4798.28] bombardment, and I'm not going to get
[4800.32] into that because of the time
[4802.159] limitations in in this episode, but it
[4805.36] also appears that there was a major
[4806.96] impact that occurred in the Indian Ocean
[4810.32] right at the KT boundary as well. Notice
[4813.76] this. You can see central uplift. You
[4816.32] can see multiple rings and
[4820.88] When I look at the next one, it's an
[4822.56] artist's impression of the original.
[4825.76] He's not showing the central uplift,
[4827.52] which I think is a little bit of a
[4828.88] mistake. He should have showed it, but
[4830.88] he is showing the multiple multi-ranged
[4833.52] impact. Now, interesting about studies
[4836.56] of multi-ring impact structures, it
[4838.48] appears as if there's a scaling factor
[4840.48] that when this impact occurs, liquefies
[4844.0] the the rock, it begins moving out just
[4847.12] like you know waves, ringlet, ringed
[4850.96] waves, like if you throw a rock into a
[4852.96] pond, except that as it's moving out,
[4855.28] it's cooling. So as it's cooling, it's
[4858.0] becoming more viscous and then it cools
[4860.159] enough and it essentially freezes
[4862.239] wherever it happens to be when it
[4864.239] crosses that crystallization threshold.
[4867.96] Typically the scaling ratio of these
[4870.64] multiple rings falls right around the
[4872.8] square root of two, which
[4875.32] is a ratio that we come very familiar
[4878.08] with when we study
[4879.96] geometry. So here's your artist
[4881.92] impression of the cheek shaloo impact
[4884.08] crater. This next slide shows its
[4887.28] relation to the Yucatan Peninsula and
[4889.92] the Gulf of Mexico. So it says here from
[4893.04] this is study that was published in 1996
[4896.159] in the geohysical journal
[4898.92] international the buried cheek sha lube
[4901.44] impact structure buried right is marked
[4904.48] by a dramatic ring of sink holes called
[4907.84] cenotes if containing water and adjacent
[4911.04] less prominent partial rings which have
[4914.0] been shown to coincide with maxima in
[4917.199] horizontal gravity gradients and a
[4920.4] topographic depression.
[4922.32] You can see the topic depression is what
[4924.32] they're calling the trough right here.
[4925.84] And just inside that trough is a series
[4929.04] of cenotees sinkholes. These
[4931.76] observations along with the discreetness
[4933.92] and spacing of the features suggest a
[4936.719] formation mechanism involving falting in
[4939.6] the outer slump zone of crater which
[4942.48] would thus have a diameter of
[4944.0] approximately 180 km or 112 mi. However,
[4948.4] that is probably only the inner part of
[4950.96] the crater. It it's actually much
[4953.6] greater than that. But this was from
[4956.56] Yucatan carsted features and the size of
[4958.8] the cheek shaloo
[4960.44] crater. Okay, next
[4963.239] slide. You can actually see the ring of
[4966.56] cenotes here. Now, these are sinkholes.
[4969.92] You know that most of the Yucatan
[4971.8] Peninsula, well, pretty much all of the
[4973.76] Yucatan Peninsula is porous limestone.
[4976.32] So what that means is that the rivers
[4978.88] flowing in the Yucatan don't flow on top
[4982.0] of the surface just like in you know
[4985.12] Cumberland Plateau of Tennessee
[4988.0] limestone porous limestone it means the
[4990.48] water tends to flow under the surface
[4992.96] and that's what's happening here in the
[4995.04] Yucatan. The rivers flow under water I
[4998.4] mean under their subterranean. Okay.
[5002.199] Interestingly, this is inside this rim.
[5006.08] You have the whole mass, huge mass of
[5010.159] fallback brecha slump features around
[5013.28] the rim. And so what you have is is all
[5016.32] sorts of apertures and conduits and
[5018.56] fault lines and fractures that water can
[5021.679] move through. And if you look at this
[5025.199] previous one here, you can see that half
[5027.199] of the crater is in the Gulf. And there
[5029.6] are actually tunnels, I guess you could
[5032.08] say, conduits of water coming that
[5035.04] bubble up out in the Gulf that are
[5037.88] underground rivers flowing here. Now,
[5040.719] what's interesting about these cenotes
[5042.719] is that, you know, this was Maya
[5045.6] territory here, right? Maya had a whole
[5049.4] complex system of of esquetology which
[5053.36] is end of the world
[5056.84] concepts and one of the things that they
[5060.48] did was they held ceremonies. Now this
[5062.96] is photograph of of a
[5065.32] cenote. These are like sink holes that
[5068.4] have formed inside the rim. They're
[5070.8] they're 100% a function of the gigantic
[5074.48] buried crater. It's under about a half a
[5077.04] kilometer of limestone rock, porous
[5079.12] limestone rock and this breiated rock
[5082.32] that was the consequence of the impact.
[5084.639] Right? So the water it literally is like
[5087.84] a gigantic labyrinthine
[5091.639] tunnel
[5093.159] system and and the Mayans believed that
[5096.56] some of these cenotes were entrances
[5099.679] into the underworld which is certainly
[5102.159] appropriate.
[5103.76] A lot of them are accessible. Let's see
[5107.4] here. Some of them are pretty amazing.
[5109.76] You can go down into Some of them are
[5112.239] set up, you know, with
[5116.76] accessibility. Look at
[5125.8] this. Notice something here. the the the
[5128.239] the surface opening is smaller than the
[5130.88] actual cavity underneath. And you know,
[5134.56] I think this is one of the ones that
[5136.48] I've been in. I'm pretty sure it is. It
[5138.8] looks like one of the ones. When I spent
[5142.239] some time down there in Yucatan, I of
[5144.56] course had to visit the
[5146.12] cenotes. But you can go in and typically
[5148.88] the water which has been filtered
[5150.639] through the limestone rock is very pure,
[5152.96] very clear.
[5156.159] And some of them, you know, not all of
[5158.239] them, but a lot of them, you know, you
[5160.48] can access, you can swim in
[5162.92] them. This is one I went swimming in.
[5165.44] This is this is an a good example of,
[5168.32] you know, the the surface opening is
[5170.08] much smaller than the cavity underneath.
[5172.96] And the day that I was here with my
[5175.04] buddies, there's actually, you can see
[5176.56] right here, there's a the metal ladder
[5179.6] going down into that you have to climb
[5181.92] down.
[5183.6] There were divers coming out and we
[5185.36] talked to them for a while and they
[5186.4] said, "Yeah, people have been diving in
[5187.92] this thing for years and years and never
[5189.6] found the bottom." And you know, people
[5191.84] have gone down, divers have gone down,
[5193.6] lost and gotten lost and never been seen
[5196.0] again because it's a literal maze of of
[5200.159] uh interconnected tunnels and things
[5202.32] going through all this. So, this is an
[5204.719] entryway into the underworld. It's an
[5206.56] entryway into the the great bolite
[5209.92] impact that that ended the Mesazoic and
[5213.28] launched the
[5216.52] Cenazoic and yeah can I mean so you know
[5222.08] you got to be careful you know if you're
[5224.0] walk if you're walking in the middle of
[5225.6] the night it's dark out and all of a
[5227.92] sudden you take a step and
[5230.199] boom I think it was around 15 to 20 feet
[5234.159] down to the water. I think what we did,
[5236.56] I think we actually, if I remember
[5237.84] right, we jumped off the edge in into
[5240.92] the into the water and then, you know,
[5243.199] you climb back out the the metal
[5246.28] ladder. Here's the so-called cenote of
[5249.28] sacrifice at Chichinita. And there is a
[5251.6] bottom on this one. And for decades, if
[5255.04] not centuries, Mayans were holding
[5256.96] ceremonies around this. I'm going to
[5258.48] save the discussion of what they were
[5260.239] doing for another time. It's
[5262.36] extraordinarily interesting, but their
[5264.4] primary ceremony was commemorating the
[5267.36] end of the world. And I found that to be
[5270.159] very appropriate given that the event
[5272.159] here that created these led to these
[5275.04] cenotes was the the end of a world.
[5279.04] Here's another view of the well of
[5280.719] sacrifice as it's called because there
[5282.88] was many artifacts that have been found
[5285.6] in the uh in the bottom of this thing
[5289.199] that have been collected over many many
[5291.76] years. We're coming to the end of this.
[5294.8] Let's just jump ahead to a couple of the
[5296.88] final ones. Sudbury, Ontario, very very
[5300.32] old.
[5302.159] It's one of the largest, if not the
[5305.36] largest crater known on the planet at
[5308.8] this point. 155 miles in diameter. The
[5312.96] impactor size was is estimated to have
[5315.04] been 9 miles in diameter. I mean, look,
[5317.52] look at the energy released here. 340
[5320.56] million megatons. Turns out that this
[5323.6] site is mined for because it's such a
[5326.88] rich source of nickel, copper,
[5329.199] palladium, gold, and platinum group
[5331.48] metals. All of which are associated with
[5334.08] and a byproduct of the whatever sorts of
[5337.04] alchemy went on during the impact event
[5340.32] itself. And that's something that we
[5342.639] want to dive into and look at in more
[5345.28] detail in another episode. And then
[5348.8] finally, we get to the Vita fort
[5350.639] structure.
[5352.0] in South America, which is the largest
[5354.0] confirmed infra impact structure on
[5356.36] Earth, approximately 2 billion years.
[5359.04] Now, there's probably larger ones, and
[5360.639] I'm going to show you
[5363.159] possible larger ones, but this is the
[5365.6] largest confirmed 187 million, excuse
[5369.36] me, 187 mi in diameter, explosive
[5372.8] energy, 630 million megatons or 40
[5376.239] billion Hiroshima bombs. Now, two
[5379.12] billion years, this puts it, you know,
[5381.04] before the Phantooic. So, we're back. I
[5383.36] don't know. We can't really even begin
[5385.199] to speculate what kind of environmental
[5387.679] consequences this would have had on the
[5389.28] Earth 2 billion years ago. Clearly, it
[5392.48] would have been severe. Clearly, it
[5394.4] would have involved seism seismic
[5396.96] events. Clearly, it would have involved
[5399.36] major volcanic
[5401.4] events. There's probably been a lot of
[5404.239] studies on this since I was looking at
[5406.8] this. You know, I began pulling this
[5408.719] collection together in the 80s is when I
[5411.76] got really my my interest in this really
[5414.96] came I think it grew out of the fact
[5416.48] that as a as a boy I was obsessed with
[5418.6] dinosaurs and really got involved in the
[5421.679] whole question of the extinction the
[5424.32] mysterious extinction of the dinosaurs.
[5426.96] And then after the discovery of aridium
[5431.28] at the KT boundary back in 1980 by the
[5433.6] Alvarez team, it sort of I found that
[5435.92] was just electrifying and and the idea
[5437.92] that the dinosaurs had become extinct
[5440.239] due to an asteroid impact I found just
[5443.199] obsessively compelling and that's kind
[5445.36] of what launched my interest in looking
[5447.28] at, you know, this kind of
[5450.76] phenomena.
[5453.8] Another image of the red fork structure.
[5456.88] South Africa largest confirmed impact
[5458.88] structure on earth. Also a source of
[5462.159] precious metals and so on. You can see
[5465.36] the circularity of it. There's this, you
[5468.159] know, rippled, you know, it's was so
[5471.28] energetic that it's like it just smashed
[5474.32] these rings together. You can almost see
[5476.4] them here. But you can see you can make
[5478.639] out the circularity. would of course be
[5481.28] highly
[5482.199] eroded. Okay, so now just to speculate a
[5486.8] couple of interesting things. The
[5488.159] Nastapa
[5489.8] arc
[5492.28] here kind of mysterious. I think it's
[5494.96] very possible that we're looking at a
[5497.52] feature that's a remnant of a gigantic
[5500.719] impact that would have occurred, you
[5502.8] know, billions of years ago and mostly
[5505.719] erased. the fact that these islands I
[5508.32] think they're the Solomon is it the
[5509.679] Solomon Islands here could be the the
[5512.0] the remnant of a uplift ring here but
[5516.48] about 280 mi if you draw the circle on
[5519.12] here it's about 280 mi in diameter now
[5522.56] take a look down here
[5525.32] at Gulf of St. Lawrence and think back
[5528.8] to some of the images particularly the
[5530.88] larger clear water lakes I called
[5532.8] attention to
[5534.84] that and the island I said was kind of
[5538.4] like Prince Edward Island. So here you
[5540.32] have a semic-ircular with what could be
[5543.6] the
[5545.159] uplift central ring uplift.
[5548.199] So just for fun if you feel like you
[5550.88] know doing it you know who knows what
[5552.639] you can discover with Google Earth now
[5554.719] and and you know LAR imagery that's
[5558.239] being more and more published you know a
[5560.8] lot of this stuff is published with no
[5562.56] one really taking a closer scrutiny at
[5565.44] any particular area. There's a whole
[5567.36] realm here
[5568.84] for you know amateur researchers on
[5573.04] their own to just make discoveries.
[5576.159] Something that's interesting here, you
[5577.52] can look if if this was a a a structure
[5581.199] here and this was an impact structure
[5583.679] here. Notice there there's Man of
[5585.6] Kuragan right there. Doesn't look so
[5588.88] prominent next to these, but you know,
[5591.199] obviously locally it would have been
[5593.199] extremely
[5596.679] devastating. Here's a map. It's already
[5599.6] probably getting obsolete and there's
[5601.36] probably been a lot of new discoveries.
[5603.12] I think this might even be 10 years old.
[5605.6] But you can see the everinccreasing
[5608.159] number of craters that have been
[5609.92] identified in North America. In this
[5612.639] little survey that we've done here, we
[5615.12] probably looked at only what have we
[5617.12] looked at maybe a third of the
[5619.159] confirmed if that. So there was a whole
[5622.32] lot of them that we could
[5623.96] have talked about, but we just didn't
[5626.32] because we didn't
[5627.56] have didn't have the time.
[5631.36] So, here's the same
[5633.0] map and here's a global map of confirmed
[5636.28] impacts. You can go online and download
[5638.8] this and you see exposed and
[5642.04] unexposed. So, there's a couple. Now,
[5644.56] one of the things to keep in mind is
[5646.639] that you know, you can see how they're
[5649.84] clustered ex and this is important
[5652.159] because there's a number of reasons.
[5655.6] For example, there's a whole vast area
[5658.199] here who the density of craters is very
[5661.12] low, right? Look at this these areas of
[5664.08] South America. Look at these areas up
[5666.08] here. Look at Greenland. Right? Well,
[5668.96] here's the point. I think if we were
[5670.8] able to map all the craters on Earth,
[5674.32] all the astrols, we'd be looking at this
[5677.6] kind of density over the whole map. You
[5680.4] know what I mean? Okay. And that's
[5683.199] important. And this next map again is
[5685.36] already getting obsolete, but it kind of
[5687.199] gives you an idea of of the of the
[5691.6] impact sites. And again, you see they're
[5694.48] they're they're clustered, right? And
[5696.4] and there's reasons for that. For
[5699.08] example, you know, glaciers might
[5702.159] excavate the overlying sedimentary rock
[5705.12] and expose the
[5706.76] underlying circular features, right? But
[5710.0] the thing is is when you look at the
[5711.44] densest areas, I think if if there was
[5713.76] some way we could go back and
[5715.76] reconstruct all the impacts that
[5717.84] occurred on Earth from the, you know,
[5719.92] going back 3 to 4 billion years ago,
[5722.4] just like the moon, we would essentially
[5724.56] have a cratered surface with similar
[5727.28] density of the moon, similar density to
[5729.84] what we see here in these clustered
[5731.84] areas. You'll notice rainforests of of
[5735.04] South America. Nothing really to show
[5737.28] there, but that doesn't mean they're not
[5739.04] there. Right? Same with Greenland.
[5742.08] Right? Same with the oceans. Right? Now,
[5744.88] we see that look, there's an oceanic
[5747.04] impact. Here's one. Here's another one.
[5749.6] So, we're starting here's one over here.
[5751.44] So, we're starting to make more
[5753.04] discoveries of these impact events on
[5756.159] the bottom of the ocean. And I think
[5758.719] this is going to be a very fertile area
[5761.52] of future
[5763.239] research. Okay. The last Okay, here this
[5765.92] last one is a closer in view of the Gulf
[5769.44] of St. Lawrence. So, I could speculate
[5773.8] very easily that this might have been
[5777.52] the remnant of a very large, very
[5780.4] ancient crater. And you can see right
[5782.36] here by comparison here is Manet Kagan,
[5786.639] which is about 50 mi in
[5789.32] diameter.
[5791.0] Okay. So, where are we going to pick
[5793.44] this up? We'll pick it up by talking
[5796.84] about what is the evidence for we're
[5800.08] we're looking here at evidence of these
[5802.48] great impacts in Earth history. Right
[5805.04] now, some of the smaller ones we were
[5806.719] looking at have have occurred since
[5809.679] humans have been around modern humans,
[5812.08] but obviously the bigger ones haven't
[5814.48] because if they have, well, we wouldn't
[5816.239] be here talking about this. We would
[5818.639] have become extinct.
[5821.4] But the thing is is that we have to
[5825.36] consider I think now what evidence is
[5829.92] there that these events have
[5833.0] occurred since humans have been around,
[5836.0] right? And then we got a narrower
[5838.239] discussion even a little more to talk
[5841.0] about is there evidence for impact
[5843.8] events since humans have been trying to
[5847.84] create
[5849.56] civilizations. And the answer is most
[5851.92] definitely
[5853.239] yes. But then the question is well if
[5856.48] that's so then how many events have
[5859.119] occurred and what influence have they
[5860.96] had? What effects have they had on
[5863.52] humans attempting to build civilizations
[5866.08] on Earth? So, we're going to look at two
[5868.679] things. We're going to look at the
[5871.52] evidence, the hard evidence that there
[5874.0] have been destructive bolite impacts.
[5876.159] Let's say within the holosene. We we'll
[5878.48] narrow down to the holysine, the last 10
[5880.239] to 12,000 years. Okay? During the time
[5884.0] which we assume history has unfolded,
[5886.56] human history. Second, we're going to
[5888.88] take a deep dive into the legacy of
[5892.92] mythology and stories that have come
[5896.0] down to us from previous
[5899.159] generations that certainly seem to be
[5902.76] describing phenomena that could
[5905.639] be considered profoundly catastrophic
[5908.719] that could have have a lot of overlap
[5911.44] with what we now know about the impact
[5913.92] phenomena. Okay, so that's where we're
[5916.639] going to be going in this and I hope you
[5918.48] stick with it to get the big picture of
[5921.199] the cosmic history of this planet, the
[5924.0] cosmic history of our own efforts to
[5926.159] build civilizations on this planet and
[5929.36] the effects of these events on
[5933.8] life and what all this bodess for our
[5937.08] future. And it does. It most definitely
[5939.84] does. There are implications for the
[5942.32] long-term sustainability of our future
[5945.36] on this planet as a civilization, as a
[5949.0] species. And that's where we're going to
[5950.96] talk that's what we're going to talk
[5952.159] about. And we're going to discover that
[5953.6] the evidence for cosmic events and
[5956.48] cosmic impacts and catastrophes and so
[5958.96] on is a whole lot more abundant than
[5961.44] mainstream science has recognized up to
[5964.32] this point. But thankfully that's
[5966.639] beginning to change and that's what
[5968.159] we're going to be diving into in the
[5970.48] next few episodes of Squaring the
[5972.719] Circle. So I hope you join me. Thank you

Title: Was the Great Pyramid More Than a Tomb?
[0.04] so what is it talking about with the
[1.36] molten the molten sea what is the
[4.16] connection there well I'm not clear on
[6.16] that but that was one of the things that
[7.839] was a source of inspiration for Malcolm
[10.16] was the molten sea that is described in
[12.88] the Bible in the Old Testament
[14.559] associated with King Solomon's Temple is
[16.76] there a connection here with angles and
[19.199] measurements to different frequencies oh
[21.92] yeah again there's no proof of anything
[24.0] maybe it's just a coincidence It's the
[25.76] Great Pyramid but if it's not a
[27.519] coincidence if it's not what is that
[30.24] mean I don't know other than the fact
[33.0] that is there a hint that there may be
[36.16] some kind of a function there to the
[38.28] Great Pyramid that involves there's many
[41.719] theories that the pyramid was a power
[43.28] plant I'm sure you're definitely aware
[44.96] yeah yeah but this might support that I
[47.48] don't know because I learned that and I
[49.44] thought wait a second
[52.399] 51.84 I've seen that before right yeah

Title: Plasma: The Forgotten Force of the Ancients
[0.12] plasma is the most ubiquitous energy
[3.04] throughout the Universe it's probably
[4.839] 90% all matter in the universe right is
[8.0] mostly plasma the sun is plasma
[10.2] lightning is plasma Aurora Borealis the
[12.96] Northern Lights that's plasma okay so
[15.48] all of these things these are
[16.6] manifestations of plasma and plasmas are
[18.84] being used now uh industrially for a
[21.68] number of purposes the question is is
[24.039] could ancient cultures have known about
[26.24] it and I think the answer is yes I think
[27.92] they could have and but were they and I
[30.88] would say I think it's very possible
[33.48] that they could have been why just like
[35.84] electricity is such a ubiquitous
[37.719] phenomena and consider what we knew
[39.76] about electricity 150 years ago compared
[41.879] to what we're doing now and its
[43.16] applications you look at the whole 20th
[45.039] century you've got basic principles of
[47.64] electricity electromagnetism and
[49.84] learning how to develop Technologies
[52.76] from that an electromagnetic phenomena
[54.84] would be a natural thing for any
[58.359] evolving civilization to utilize to
[60.96] exploit plasma you've got solid you've
[63.92] got strongly bound electrons and
[66.799] neutrons and if you add energy to the
[70.4] system like if you add energy in the in
[72.88] the form of heat to a solid and every
[75.4] solid will have a different melting
[77.119] point but if you add energy the solid
[80.0] will melt okay so now it becomes a
[81.96] liquid the electrons and the neutrons
[84.28] are still bound but there there's much
[86.799] greater degrees of freedom and that's
[88.64] why a liquid will flow and and you know
[90.96] a solid if we set a solid down it
[93.479] doesn't change its shape because of how
[95.399] how strongly the electrons and the
[97.0] neutrons are bound the interesting thing
[98.84] about a plasma is it can be
[101.52] electromagnetically conductive and it
[103.399] has an affinity for certain geometries

Title: Rediscovering Lost Technology
[0.16] This is going to be crazy if this goes
[2.159] out. One of the things I kind of compare
[3.84] it to is maybe if we go back 120 years
[6.48] and the advent of alternating current
[8.48] electricity, some of the basic
[10.0] applications can be relatively simple
[11.84] and you don't need to necessarily know
[14.24] all of the physics behind it, right? To
[17.199] be able to to use it. You can, for
[20.32] example, rebuild the engine of a car
[22.96] without necessarily knowing all of the
[25.359] physics of an internal combustion
[27.119] engine. Let's say we're going to try to
[28.96] discredit Tesla's work by attacking
[32.0] Tesla the man. And you got to be able to
[34.16] separate that the two. Some of this
[35.92] technology could have been what was used
[37.92] in ancient times to build some of these
[39.68] mega structures like the pyramids or
[41.6] anything like that. I think it's very
[43.04] possible. The geometry link I think for
[45.44] me was the thing that really brought
[47.36] home that possibility. But it works.
[50.16] I've seen it work.

Title: Stonehenge & Ancient Measurements
[0.24] Stonehenge, the famous monument on the
[3.52] Salisbury plane in southern England. So
[6.08] we know that the orientation of the
[7.68] model of the structure was not just
[10.24] randomly placed. You had to have this
[12.559] allimportant alignment, this axis to
[14.96] begin with. Once you've got that, it
[17.199] would only make sense that you would
[18.88] then use a very rational and specific
[22.8] sequence of steps to determine the
[26.08] distances and proportions and ratios of
[29.119] the rest of the monument that's now
[31.039] going to be juxtaposed onto that
[34.239] solstitial alignment if that makes
[36.32] sense. So what we have here, we have
[38.719] dimensions that are very very close and
[40.879] several of them will give us indications
[42.48] that we are on the right track because
[44.239] it turns out that the average distance
[47.039] of the center line of the stones which
[49.92] is marked by the the average length of
[52.239] the lintils is 10.56 ft. Right now
[55.76] there's enough of them that remain and
[57.039] the tooling of them is highly accurate.
[59.28] So from that one comes up with a number
[62.239] that's very close to 10.56 ft which
[64.96] would also represent the center line of
[67.68] the sarsen stone uprights. Well if you
[70.24] measure on the sarsen stone circle the
[73.2] outer face it works out to be very close
[76.08] to
[76.92] 105.6 ft. Right? It suggests that
[79.6] there's a a common unit of measurement
[81.68] here being involved. Does that suggest
[84.72] the possibility that there was a unified
[87.6] system of measurement here was based
[89.84] upon our what's still extent as the
[93.2] modern imperial mile and sub multiples
[96.799] of that unit. Is it possible that our
[99.439] feet and our miles are as old as
[102.4] Stonehenge?

Title: A Monument to Lunar Alignments
[0.16] very much in fact like we find at this
[2.72] Monument way over in Ohio this is called
[5.759] Newark and Newar is laid out according
[10.48] to both sun and moon alignments the
[13.12] major axis of Newark points to the
[16.76] Horizon where the maximum Northern
[21.24] moonrise occurs you have the
[23.8] southernmost Moonrise and so this is
[26.24] going to be also a maximum lunar rise
[30.8] why were these people over in Ohio
[32.88] building this enormous structure that
[35.559] required an enormous volume of work a
[38.2] lot of work a lot of Labor to build this
[41.239] huge structure to memorialize the entire
[45.12] cycle of the moon 18.6 year cycle of the
[48.52] moon and here you have all of the
[50.52] alignments all the significant key
[52.32] alignments built into the monument and
[54.64] if you have perspective the correct
[56.52] position within the monument these
[58.28] moonrise positions will show up between
[62.199] the gaps the apertures look at the
[64.559] Octagon here there are gaps in the
[67.04] Octagon knowing where to position
[69.2] yourself you will then can witness the
[71.56] moon's motions with a high degree of
[75.119] precision

Title: Did Stonehenge Encode the Golden Ratio?
[0.04] here we have What's called the golden
[2.199] rectangle or sometimes the rectangle of
[4.839] the whirling squares because once you
[7.319] know how to lay out the golden
[9.2] rectangle with those proper as they have
[12.08] been called to Divine proportions you
[15.08] can create this logarithmic spiral that
[17.76] looks something like this that we
[19.48] actually find reproduced in various
[21.96] natural phenomena so this is the
[23.64] rectangle of the whirling squares also
[25.4] known as the golden rectangle it was
[27.16] very important to artists and architects
[30.0] and Builders throughout the ages
[31.96] including I would suggest the Builders
[35.04] of ston Hench because one very prominent
[37.52] place this particular rectangle shows up
[40.52] and here we have an elevation diagram of
[43.68] the Horseshoe triathon the big rocks in
[46.28] the middle and here the red bound border
[48.76] gives you a golden rectangle it looks
[52.239] like the five horseshoe trions were
[55.399] quarried and shaped and assembled
[57.879] reproduce the golden rectangle either
[60.199] that or it's just coincidence

Title: Rethinking Sea Level Rise
[0.16] Looking at it this way, the sea levels
[1.68] have risen in the last century about 8
[3.6] in, which is about the same as they rose
[6.0] the century before that. And at the
[8.08] current rates of sea level rise, it may
[10.96] be a couple inches more than that, but I
[13.599] think projecting current rates of sea
[15.759] level rise, we're not getting into some
[18.0] of the earlier scare stories that we
[19.84] were being bombarded with back 20 and 30
[22.08] years ago that oh my god, sea level is
[23.76] going to rise four or five or six feet
[25.519] by the end of the the century and so on.
[28.24] We've seen no indication that anything
[30.4] is going to attain that rate of sea
[32.8] level rise. For one thing, because we
[35.36] don't have six to 7 million cubic miles
[38.079] of catastrophically melting glacial ice.
[40.719] We don't have that now. In fact, it's
[42.239] even questionable how much actually has
[44.719] been lost from the the two great
[46.64] reservoirs of glacial ice on the planet,
[48.719] Greenland and Antarctica.

Title: Climate Has Always Changed
[0.16] One of the things that pertains directly
[2.32] to topics I talk about a lot which is
[5.279] climate change the dynamically
[7.52] everchanging climate of this planet is
[10.16] that we pulled out of the Paris climate
[12.559] accords and a lot of people are upset
[15.04] about that but uh I would like to
[17.6] reassure you there is no reason to be
[19.68] upset in fact that was definitely the
[22.4] move to make. Why do I say that? Does
[25.039] that mean I'm a climate change denier
[27.199] because I'm in favor of pulling o out of
[29.279] the the climate accords? No, not at all.
[32.399] What it means is is that in fact just
[34.96] the opposite. I totally affirm the
[37.68] climate of this planet changes. It
[39.76] changes all the time. It changes
[41.36] regularly and quite frequently. It
[43.84] changes a lot faster and more severely
[46.96] than we have witnessed in our lifetimes.
[49.28] And this is something uh an important uh
[52.239] insight into the way our planet works
[54.399] that is being overlooked. And we are
[56.8] spending a lot of money or have spent a
[58.879] lot of money or were going to be
[60.8] spending a lot of money to meet the
[63.199] restrictions uh and goals of the Paris
[65.68] climate agreement. And what the agenda
[67.76] was all about was a gigantic wealth
[69.92] transfer from the developed nations to
[72.479] the undeveloped nations all done in the
[74.64] name of climate justice. In effect, what
[77.2] it is is is to me a giant shakeddown
[80.159] effort. Uh and of course the potential
[83.2] recipient nations of the large s being
[86.439] transerred from primarily America and
[89.28] American taxpayers. Of course, they're
[91.439] all on a board with it and they will of
[94.0] course endorse the climate crisis
[96.32] narrative if it means that they're going
[97.92] to be on the receiving end of tens to
[100.96] hundreds of millions, maybe even
[102.88] billions of dollars. hours.

Title: Lake Bonneville Ice Age Megaflood Magnifies Snake River 2000x! Randall Carlson w/ Bradley Young
[0.56] [Music]
[10.759] unit for the man hold
[22.99] [Music]
[76.479] wait do your Lewis and Clark here do
[78.52] your Le and Clark you want me to do my
[80.159] Lewis first that way yeah ier where's my
[84.6] Lew yeah here's Clark
[91.68] hello I'm here with my colleague Brad
[94.04] young and we have been exploring the
[97.399] Landscapes of catastrophe for well over
[99.96] two decades now and one of the things
[102.28] that we've been very interested in is
[104.399] the great floods that have swept over
[106.68] North America from time to time mostly
[109.479] concentrated at the end of the last ice
[111.719] age one of these great floods was called
[114.479] the bonnaville flood named after Lake
[116.719] bonnaville in Utah which was a giant
[120.399] Lake that existed during the latter
[122.96] stages of the ice age during the what
[125.399] would we would call the lake query that
[128.44] formed on several occasions and then
[130.56] disappeared the modern Great Salt Lake
[133.84] is a remnant of the great uh Lake
[137.44] bonnaville the the famous bonnaville
[140.72] salt flats are also a relic of that Lake
[144.56] uh because all of the mineral sediments
[147.16] that swept into the lake from the
[148.76] surrounding mountains settled to the
[150.48] bottom and formed a perfectly flat plane
[153.599] that is now used for testing high
[155.84] performance
[157.92] Vehicles so we'll just jump right into
[161.4] it here Harold Maul day with the US
[164.84] Geological Survey was the geologist that
[167.76] did the original work uh demonstrating
[170.72] that there was a gigantic uh Outburst
[173.4] flood from Lake bonnaville and um that's
[176.56] what we're actually going to be talking
[177.959] about here is that flood that was formed
[181.12] from the Overflow of gigantic Lake
[184.4] Bonville malde says the enormous size of
[187.959] depositional and erosional features
[190.64] produced by the Bonville flood imply a
[193.36] peak discharge of extraordinary
[196.56] volume this is what he said back in
[199.72] 1968 when um a lot of this this period
[203.159] when uh there was a lot of recognition
[205.599] of gigantic floods which came on the
[208.12] wake of the acceptance of J har
[210.959] Brett's ideas about the Missoula floods
[213.92] and the formation of the channel
[216.08] scabs which pretty much uh became
[219.56] mainstream accepted by the mainstream
[221.959] between the mid 60s and the early
[225.08] 70s this is uh the northern part of the
[228.959] Basin you can see right here is the
[230.76] northern part of the lake bonnaville
[232.92] Basin um and this is the remnant of Lake
[237.959] uh Great Salt Lake
[241.2] and during the uh maximum high standand
[245.56] of the lake which occurred uh between
[248.72] about 15 and 18,000 years ago all of
[251.72] these valleys in here were filled and
[254.36] one of the valleys which was the lowest
[256.72] point on the perimeter of the lake was
[259.44] right up through this area and when the
[262.56] flood Spilled Out it followed this
[265.24] Valley here out onto the Snake River
[267.28] plane which is this uh large feature
[270.8] that we see right here and we can see
[272.88] the channel of the modern Snake River
[275.039] snaking its way across uh the the plane
[279.199] there Yellowstone Hots spot is right up
[283.44] here
[286.0] and the idea is is that around 17
[289.24] million years
[290.56] ago uh that Hotpot began extruding large
[294.56] amounts of lava that there's a mantle
[296.52] plume beneath uh Yellowstone there
[300.32] and over the course of 17 million years
[303.199] the North American Plate has moved over
[306.08] that hot spot and as that moved over
[308.08] that Hots spot the upwelling uh thermal
[311.16] energy basically melted the overlying
[314.0] landscape and produced this large
[316.12] sweeping feature
[319.08] here this is a study from the early 90s
[323.52] um on the Great Basin and you see Lake
[327.24] Bonville was not the only a huge Lake in
[331.16] that Basin and Range area in fact as it
[334.24] says here nearly all closed or formally
[337.44] closed basins in the Great Basin have
[340.28] ancient strand lines marked by lustrin
[342.8] bars that word lustrin simply means
[345.28] Lakes splits spits embankments Terraces
[349.759] deltas and wave cut Cliffs and
[352.52] elevations well above the plias or
[355.16] permanent Lakes of today the impressive
[358.199] Shore features of lakes lonton and
[360.639] Bondville prompted their study by the US
[363.36] Geological Survey more than a century
[365.639] ago
[367.479] about20 plal Lakes existed within the
[370.44] Great Basin during Wisconsin time I
[374.319] would mention that Wisconsin time is
[375.96] generally time from just over 100,000
[378.759] years ago to uh about 11,000 years
[383.24] ago goes on to say Lake Bonville became
[386.639] the largest plal lake in the western
[389.599] hemisphere about 17 to 15,000 years ago
[393.8] at its maximum it inundated several
[396.599] coalescent intermontane basins meaning
[400.96] in between the mountains right in
[403.52] Northwest Utah extending into Idaho and
[406.96] Nevada an area of about
[419.68] bottom I've shown you here that
[430.879] 51,70260 33
[433.56] ft today the only permanent Lakes are
[436.599] great salt and Utah lakes lake
[438.879] bonneville's history remains
[440.879] controversial nearly every serious
[443.039] researcher on Lake baville since Gilbert
[445.24] has come up with a different
[446.56] interpretation
[450.44] here is the Basin and Range Province uh
[454.24] you can see it's almost like a circular
[456.639] feature and what you have is many
[459.08] mountain ranges separated by these
[460.96] basins and all these basins have these
[462.919] flat floors and it was these flat floors
[466.319] that are remnants of these 120 lakes
[469.599] that occupied this Great Basin uh during
[473.639] uh the late Wisconsin times so in the
[477.759] next uh slide one I'm going to show you
[480.319] is a reconstruction if all of those
[483.96] basins were occupied by lakes at the
[486.44] same time which I'm not necessarily
[489.0] saying but if they were you would have
[491.879] pretty much something like this um and
[495.759] weren't all occupied at the same time
[498.68] but nonetheless there were vast bodies
[500.68] of water in what is now an extremely Aid
[505.24] environment so clearly we've had some uh
[508.68] very serious environmental changes in
[511.24] the last 10 to 20,000 years to get from
[515.159] something like this to something
[519.08] like and that image includes parts of
[521.959] Nevada Southern California Arizona yes
[525.6] Utah Southern Idaho that's quite an
[528.12] expansive view there yes and you can
[530.08] identify this dark green right here is
[533.839] Death Valley and Death Valley we won't
[536.16] be talking about this today but Death
[537.92] Valley also had a large Lake occupying
[540.399] it that was nearly 1,000 ft
[544.079] deep and as maldi said the Bonville
[548.04] flood mostly occupied the same canyons
[551.68] and valleys that exist today but it
[554.24] modified them by causing extensive
[556.36] erosion and by depositing great piles of
[559.399] flood debris it left a vivid record of
[563.279] its cataclysmic passage and that's what
[565.839] we will be looking at some of these
[567.12] slides so you can get an idea of what
[568.64] the erosion and deposition features are
[572.04] that first clued Harold malde into uh
[575.48] the realization that there had been this
[577.6] extraordinary flood so here just a few
[580.88] statistics L monaville at its maximum
[583.6] had an area of about 20,000 square miles
[586.6] a maximum depth of 133 ft I have not
[590.519] been able to find a good uh estimate for
[593.16] the volume of the lake yet so at some
[595.839] point hopefully I will find that we will
[597.48] add that into our data there the highest
[600.48] elevation of the Bondville Shoreline was
[602.72] 5,090 ft above sea
[605.32] level and the elevation of what is
[607.8] called the Provo Shoreline was
[611.56] 4,765
[613.56] just somewhat less about um just 30 what
[618.76] 325 ft less okay
[622.839] so excuse me the the highest volume of
[626.399] the lake um reached up to a
[629.92] a sill if you want to call it a sill
[631.959] there in Southern Idaho in the uh what
[636.04] is now called Red Rock pass which we
[638.079] will see a slide of in a
[639.92] second the uh elevation of that sill
[643.72] stabilized the lake at that level for
[645.92] some indeterminate time but the sill was
[650.04] composed of Highly porous tacious Rock
[653.959] to Tua which is a a volcanic rock and
[657.04] that was uh
[659.519] up over
[661.6] uh um hard Limestone Bedrock so the idea
[666.76] now is is that the great Bonville flood
[668.92] was caused because the water overtopped
[672.639] this softer Rock and eventually flowed
[675.72] over it in the form of a river ate it
[678.2] down to some level some threshold level
[681.959] where the pressure of the great body of
[685.16] water behind it was too great and it it
[687.68] was able to sweep the sof rock out and
[690.88] over a period of a couple of months the
[692.519] lake level dropped by 320 330 ft as all
[696.36] of this water poured out over Red Rock
[699.36] pass the water level dropped and then
[702.519] the lake restabilized at that Hard
[704.639] Limestone sill and that is uh the Provo
[710.279] Shoreline right here you can see that
[712.399] right now the modern uh elevation of Red
[714.6] Rock pass is right about 4770 ft above
[717.959] sea level only 5T difference so that's a
[721.88] meaningless difference um there of
[723.839] course been isostatic adjustments sure
[726.36] that would throw that off but so there
[728.36] was a shoreline then that formed at the
[731.56] elevation of Red Rock pass the Bonville
[734.639] flood itself had a peak discharge of up
[736.959] to 41 million cubic feet per second
[739.44] which is extraordinary volume of water
[741.8] it's it's an order of magnitude less
[744.76] than the Missoula floods but it's two
[747.639] orders of magnitude greater than any
[749.72] modern floods that are of
[752.199] record total volume of water discharged
[755.56] was
[756.92] 1,140 cubic miles give or
[760.279] take um or
[763.279] 4,670 cubic kilm of water that is a lot
[767.199] of
[769.88] water so here is an aerial view from
[772.92] about 25,000 ft up where you can very
[776.519] clearly see the remnant of shorelines
[780.56] along the mountain slopes here so here
[783.44] to this side which would be to the West
[785.92] is where Lake Bonville existed and I did
[789.48] a very crude graphic just so you can
[791.279] kind of see where the body of
[795.0] water generally
[797.48] occupied and left these shorelines
[801.88] behind and on this view you can very
[805.32] clearly see shorelines on the opposite
[807.88] mountains and no shorelines are roughly
[810.56] 1,000 ft actually 900 and some feet
[813.079] above the valley floor here and this is
[815.92] uh the northern section of uh Salt Lake
[819.199] City right here this is probably not
[821.959] Salt Lake City but part of the urban
[823.88] area of Salt Lake
[829.88] City and in this in this view you can
[833.92] very clearly see the the high water mark
[836.399] coming across the mountain faces right
[838.32] in here
[840.16] and that is strong testimony to the
[843.079] former existence of a lake as it says
[845.959] here this is the view looking East
[847.759] towards the wasach mountains north of
[849.6] Salt Lake City the water erosion from
[852.32] Lake Bonville is clearly visible on the
[854.56] flanks of the
[859.759] mountains and here are the two key
[862.199] shorelines the Bonville Shoreline and
[863.959] the Provo Shoreline just north of Salt
[866.079] Lake City I'll put a little simple
[868.36] graphic in here I'll do a magenta line
[870.12] so you can see the uppermost shore
[873.12] line and then I'll do a green to see the
[876.48] lower shore
[878.399] line after it dropped 300 ft
[884.399] yeah and these are features that are
[886.639] very visible on the sides of the wasach
[889.8] mountains and a million people live
[892.24] around there and some small percentage
[895.04] really recognize what what that's
[896.8] telling them some small percentage right
[899.839] yeah so you're really
[901.519] introducing the language of the
[903.399] landscape here that people can learn to
[906.04] read right and part of I think what
[908.279] we're trying to accomplish here is to
[909.959] show people that these features are very
[912.519] ubiquitous they're all over the place
[914.759] and there's pretty much nowhere that you
[917.88] cannot find some imprint of some great
[921.68] catastrophic event and we'll be covering
[925.32] other areas other geographic regions in
[927.68] in upcoming videos so people can realize
[930.6] that yeah a lot of this stuff is right
[932.12] you don't have to travel all over the
[933.519] world to see some of this stuff it's
[935.24] right in our backyards
[937.079] speciically this is the Sawtooth
[939.079] mountains and what we have here are
[940.399] called cirs These are these bow-shaped
[942.68] depressions that were the um
[945.36] accumulating grounds for Mountain
[947.88] glaciers and so this is evidence right
[950.639] here that there was once extensive
[952.199] glaciation in these mountains uh
[955.079] evidently going back to the last ice age
[958.12] um the melting glaciers on these
[960.56] Sawtooth mountains would have drained
[962.36] into the P pay River Watershed which
[965.68] flows to the Snake River via the Boise
[968.319] River and so I'm asking the question
[970.68] could the the melting of these glaciers
[973.199] contributed to the Bondville flood and I
[975.12] think the answer would be that these
[977.519] glaciers melting contributed to the rise
[980.079] of Lake boville sure which obviously was
[983.639] necessary before it could over top Red
[985.759] Rock pass
[990.12] and this is a photograph taken within
[992.12] Red Rock pass itself and this is uh a
[995.72] but within the pass where you maybe can
[998.519] see on here there's a reddish colored
[1000.16] Rock and that's where it gets its name
[1001.88] from The Red Rocks which gave their name
[1005.12] to the Overflow Spillway of lake
[1006.959] bonnaville at this point the Waters of
[1009.44] the I've got in quotes bonnaville River
[1012.279] flowed 300 ft deep The Rock outcrop and
[1015.68] that's that's actually a very
[1016.959] conservative in some places some of the
[1019.319] constrictions it deepened up to 400 ft
[1022.44] The Rock outcrop here is an a roded
[1024.28] remnant of the former
[1026.16] landscape the elevation of the high
[1028.439] point on Red Rock but is about 5,050 ft
[1032.52] which is just below the original
[1035.16] elevation of the pass um the highway is
[1039.24] about
[1041.48] 4,770 actually this is the edge of the
[1043.839] highway this is a railroad track here
[1045.52] but this whole area below here is about
[1047.839] 4,700 70 ft above sea level uh this is
[1052.559] virtually the same elevation as the proo
[1054.64] Shor line of Lake Bonville so basically
[1058.32] what we're saying is that not too far
[1060.84] above Red Rock but here was the pre
[1063.96] flood landscape surface up here got that
[1068.08] once the water flowed over it rapidly
[1071.52] ate its way down to this level and then
[1074.0] it stabilized and this is a Remnant
[1076.799] within the pass of the the former Rock
[1080.0] which would have been continuous all the
[1082.0] way across the path pass uh maybe with
[1085.4] some exceptions there may have been and
[1087.08] probably was some Canyons or or channels
[1089.919] already through there that were occupied
[1092.48] by the flood
[1093.679] waters but it's a very flat valley floor
[1096.84] there so there's sediments that have
[1098.28] been pushed through there as the water
[1100.76] channelized to escape
[1103.0] exactly and here is a digital map right
[1107.0] here is uh the this is the the Red Rock
[1109.88] pass right here and this is what we were
[1111.84] just looking at that uh Red Rock but is
[1114.919] right in here and you can kind of see
[1117.0] from this that what we have here is a
[1118.679] converging Channel That's narrowing into
[1121.679] this constriction and it widens into
[1123.84] this
[1125.679] Basin one of the things you want to
[1127.679] understand about water flow is that when
[1129.88] you have let's say that like we talked
[1132.76] about earlier there was a period of
[1135.72] several months over which this lake
[1137.96] level was droing
[1139.48] so during that several months you can
[1141.84] consider that this is more or less
[1143.24] uniform flow through here in other words
[1145.76] if you take a crosssection here and a
[1148.44] crosssection up here and you measured
[1151.039] the amount of water cubic feet per
[1153.76] second flowing past any given point it
[1156.559] would be virtually the same right okay
[1160.159] also through here so in other words
[1163.6] there's as much water flowing through
[1165.24] this wide part of the channel as there
[1167.64] is flowing going through this narrow
[1169.64] constriction on a per second basis well
[1173.12] what that means then is that as the
[1175.6] water is coming into that constriction
[1178.72] the pressure behind it builds up right
[1182.12] and it forces the water to move at a
[1185.2] higher velocity right because when you
[1187.2] have a a larger crosssection the water
[1190.32] the same amount of water per second can
[1192.12] flow then if it's
[1194.2] narrow but if it's narrow it needs to
[1196.4] speed up it need the velocity needs to
[1198.4] increase in order to to maintain that
[1200.679] that uniform flow what happens when
[1203.72] water speeds up is it becomes more
[1206.159] erosive it begins to pick up material in
[1209.2] the word is entrain material picks up
[1211.84] that material transports that material
[1215.4] once it gets through the constriction
[1217.12] and it opens up again the water now
[1219.72] slows down when it slows down it loses
[1221.919] its competency to carry materials and
[1223.799] then it begins to deposit those
[1225.799] materials and generally uh what it'll is
[1228.919] it'll deposit the heaviest materials
[1230.76] first and then as you get down current
[1232.96] it'll be successively finer degrees of
[1235.36] material so often times when you look at
[1237.88] a a flood deposited outcrop often times
[1241.72] it's some of these are called Valley TR
[1244.48] where you may have a a a a a protrudent
[1248.679] a let's say a hill projecting into the
[1251.799] flood flow so the water behind that
[1255.0] projection tends to slow down right so
[1257.919] there will it will will build a bar
[1259.919] behind the projection and it's called a
[1262.44] Valley train and you can look at that
[1264.36] Valley train and you will get what is
[1267.08] called a
[1268.52] paleocurrent indicator which is by
[1271.32] looking at the the uh size of the
[1274.2] sediment it'll diminish down current so
[1277.2] by looking at that out crop you can tell
[1279.159] which way the water was flow flow
[1281.159] correct yeah so also there there is a
[1284.159] pulloff right there's a geological
[1286.36] marker at that site so people that are
[1289.24] in this neighborhood or ring through
[1291.48] North of Salt Lake to to Pocatello or
[1295.08] American Falls there in the Idaho uh
[1298.279] yeah this photograph is probably taken
[1300.559] from the pull off this is a photograph
[1303.0] you'll see quite frequently so yes there
[1305.48] is a pull off there yeah I think there's
[1306.919] a path you can go over toward the
[1309.559] yeah yeah I CR there let's see here yeah
[1313.039] so then this is just going further into
[1315.24] the path where it's now begins
[1317.48] descending down towards a Snake River
[1319.84] plane and this is looking North into the
[1324.4] pass and this is look for those strand
[1327.36] lines on that Hillside there or this
[1330.4] just the angle I'm seeing it uh yeah
[1332.88] there yes I think I would I wouldn't be
[1335.679] surprised if those were I mean they're
[1337.279] pretty faint M but it does appear that
[1340.039] those could be strand from this angle
[1341.72] they look fairly parallel and even yeah
[1344.12] and and strand lines are basically
[1346.039] horizontal lines that are left behind uh
[1348.88] after the draining of a body of
[1351.159] water we've seen many of those and have
[1353.72] documented many of those throughout the
[1355.72] pathway of the Missoula
[1359.6] flood hi Bradley young here producer of
[1364.24] cosmography podcast co-hosting with
[1367.32] Randall
[1369.08] Carlson what we put together here was a
[1371.559] early attempt at a podcast
[1374.76] 2017 when we tried out multiple Studios
[1379.279] settings TV
[1381.76] backgrounds slide screens Etc but when
[1386.2] we did here directly related to the
[1388.72] Bonville flood I am offscreen in this
[1393.039] video and that was due to operator error
[1396.72] where we had no actual video of the wide
[1400.2] shot that had both of us included and
[1402.799] the TV so we got Randall and the
[1405.559] important stuff on the screen so that's
[1407.84] what we got for this time got a lot in
[1410.279] the archives hope to keep bringing them
[1411.88] out and also have some cosmograph is
[1414.32] coming up with Randle Carlson enjoy all
[1417.84] the different offerings that are out now
[1420.6] and thanks for checking this one and
[1423.039] we'll see you soon hopefully we'll see
[1424.88] you in person out in the field chasing
[1427.799] Mega
[1430.6] floods so this is looking West over Red
[1433.679] Rock pass um from uh the mountain range
[1438.279] to to the East do you remember the name
[1440.64] of that mountain range I remember it
[1443.24] being a hairy scary narrow road with the
[1446.2] big drop off right next to it yes it was
[1448.84] getting across there it was in fact a
[1451.52] large uh I mean a narrow scary Road up
[1455.039] into the mountains to get this
[1456.84] shot but we're looking across here the
[1459.32] water flow is from left to right this is
[1461.24] from south to North um through here you
[1464.679] know I guess the maximum discharge might
[1466.88] have been earlier the estimates of the
[1469.799] peak discharge for the Bondville flood
[1471.48] were about 30 to 32 million but I've
[1473.72] seen revisions that have placed it as
[1476.159] high as 41 million Cub feet per second
[1478.44] I've just kind of taken the middle here
[1479.88] 35 million cubic feet per second um here
[1483.72] a great uh Bondville River as I'm
[1486.039] calling it would have been about 300 ft
[1488.32] deep and 3 miles wide flowing through
[1490.84] here so uh that was impressive very
[1494.32] impressive event that had short an
[1496.24] impressive short-lived catastrophic
[1500.84] event and as we go north following the
[1503.76] path of the flood waters this is
[1506.12] um uh
[1508.559] Interstate that comes up through here it
[1511.48] comes up through this uh called Marsh
[1514.0] Valley right here um and it makes a
[1517.399] sharp Bend to the west and then another
[1520.12] Bend to the Northwest and then it
[1522.36] discharges up here this is the beginning
[1524.159] of the Snake River plane up here this is
[1525.96] the town of
[1527.32] pocatella so pocatella is right in the
[1530.32] mouth of this what's called now portn
[1533.08] Valley um which is this section of the
[1535.6] Valley and the water spread Spilled Out
[1538.679] and spread out there and then flowed out
[1541.0] onto the Snake River plane um American
[1544.279] Falls Reservoir occupies a a trough or a
[1548.36] basin that was scoured by the flood
[1550.24] waters as they passed out into uh the
[1553.279] Snake River plane uh there's a dam down
[1555.96] here at the southwestern uh Ed of the
[1558.919] American false
[1560.24] Reservoir so that feature is always easy
[1562.559] to pick out even with all the labels to
[1564.88] see that yeah zigzag right angle coming
[1568.0] across there right into
[1569.559] the exactly easy to pick up and of
[1572.799] course this is
[1574.24] a very uh impressive uh
[1578.6] Drive um you make up through
[1581.76] here and uh you can make some diversions
[1585.48] off if you want to explore some of the
[1586.84] surrounding country but the the main
[1589.12] Highway follows the path of the flood
[1591.919] out the the Bonville flood out of the
[1594.039] Basin of Lake Bonville and through these
[1597.52] through the passes and valleys and up to
[1599.24] the Snake River
[1602.24] plane and here's an aerial view nice of
[1606.12] the port pass right here you can see
[1609.96] this is that sharp right angle
[1613.039] turn and the water came through here
[1617.159] sosed around this turn SLO around that
[1620.2] turn and then down here would be the
[1622.559] Snake River plane and then it spread
[1627.44] out so is pocatella built on a Delta
[1631.12] yeah I yeah I would definitely think
[1632.84] that you would find here is pocatella
[1635.0] from the air um and yes I would you know
[1640.399] yeah it would be almost certain that
[1642.0] there would be lots of flood deposits
[1644.679] here almost like you said a Delta where
[1646.84] where this water spreads out
[1648.72] creates this fan-shaped deposit in the
[1651.12] city of Pocatello is now built upon
[1658.44] that all right so here's the Snake River
[1661.64] plane and what we were just looking at
[1664.679] if you can see this yeah here comes uh
[1668.039] 15 Interstate 15 comes up dog legs over
[1672.519] you can see that dog like right there
[1675.08] there's American Falls Reservoir so all
[1677.32] of this water FL out spread out over the
[1680.279] plane but then it begin to focus into
[1683.24] what is now the channel occupied by the
[1686.0] Snake River which snakes its way across
[1689.84] here and then heads up this way and
[1692.64] through Hell's Canyon and then it
[1695.12] discharges from the north end of Hell's
[1696.919] Canyon by lewison Idaho um and the clear
[1702.039] water comes right there it merges with
[1704.72] the clear water and then together those
[1706.919] uh flow to the West and merge with the
[1709.44] Columbia the Columbia
[1712.72] River so we're going to look at this
[1715.679] area right in here because once the
[1720.64] water becomes
[1722.039] channelized it becomes
[1724.159] erosive and we can see
[1726.799] here what is called Massacre rocks um in
[1731.0] this huge deposit of large Boulders here
[1734.64] and for scale you can see a human figure
[1736.799] out here the water flowed from right to
[1739.159] left this is a distributo channel so
[1742.84] this was undoubtedly cut before the
[1746.2] canyon floor was cut down to this level
[1748.88] you would have had the water sheeting in
[1751.76] a sheet flood over the surface of the of
[1754.399] the Snake River plane it would have then
[1758.159] concentrated in a maybe a pre-existing
[1761.039] Swale or preexisting Channel Once it
[1764.399] does that then it becomes erosive but
[1766.36] it'll also create distributor
[1768.6] patterns like this and that's what this
[1770.0] is called this is a distributary so this
[1772.279] is where water was flowing over it then
[1775.6] branched out to create a separate flow
[1778.2] but then as the flood ate this floor
[1781.48] down of the main Valley the main trunk
[1783.519] Valley at some point the water level
[1786.12] dropped below this saddle here and it
[1789.88] then became isolated and
[1792.12] dry and became a fossil feature which
[1795.279] it's very clear in a Google Earth image
[1797.6] say where you're looking directly
[1799.0] overhead and you can follow those yes
[1801.279] patterns of the of the flow that are
[1803.12] outside the main Channel yeah in fact
[1805.36] you can see it in this map right here
[1807.6] here is the distributary channel right
[1809.76] here and we also see cataract formation
[1812.64] here which is the water flowing over the
[1815.2] surface plucking Rock and you see
[1818.399] actually a streamlined form right there
[1820.919] and we see a pointed kind of streamlined
[1822.96] form right here and the the rocks that
[1825.96] we saw
[1829.399] um here forming this train of rocks is
[1833.919] on this uh on this
[1836.48] bar which is right where this arrow is
[1838.76] pointing so those rocks are right here
[1840.84] so you can see actually that the water
[1843.679] came down and through this channel uh
[1847.72] very highly erosive probably moving at
[1850.039] 50 m an hour something like that it was
[1853.44] also flowing over the top here and
[1856.039] that's what created these cataract that
[1858.399] you see here um so you can see there's a
[1861.2] channel right here that was a distributo
[1863.76] where it flowed off but initially what
[1867.12] you've got a picture is that this water
[1868.76] is flowing over this landscape then the
[1871.639] water becomes focused into the channels
[1874.279] and then it becomes extremely erosive
[1876.2] and rapidly then can erode the floor of
[1879.12] the channel down and that's that's what
[1880.96] happened right here that's when this
[1883.12] distributo uh became
[1885.799] isolated and again this is a state Park
[1888.32] that people can go visit and it's right
[1890.24] off the interstate there Interstate
[1892.799] 86 and uh you know they they get an up
[1895.72] close view of what what this flood's
[1898.24] power really was right through this area
[1899.88] of the Snake River a really awesome road
[1901.919] trip which we've done now is to
[1904.48] basically start in the Basin of lake
[1906.88] bonnaville and follow the pathway of the
[1910.2] flood um we should do it again we should
[1913.84] do it again absolutely of course when
[1915.679] you get to the southern end of uh hell's
[1917.919] Canyon you've got to stop there and
[1920.08] basically take a boat through the canyon
[1922.0] there's no Highway jum on the but you
[1924.32] can pick up the highway again at the
[1926.039] Northern end of uh HS Canyon just below
[1930.279] Leon and Clarkston there
[1934.679] right and this is the kind of things
[1936.76] you'll see that really is a testament to
[1939.2] the unbelievable power of this flood
[1943.08] these were two Boulders ENT trained
[1945.0] within the flowing water they
[1947.279] undoubtedly transported that far or they
[1949.36] would have quickly uh broken apart into
[1951.96] smaller materials but nonetheless they
[1953.72] were carried in the water and dropped
[1956.6] right here um so you can really get a
[1959.76] sense that that you know a river or you
[1962.919] know a flood that could transport uh
[1965.279] Boulders of that size had to be pretty
[1968.12] power powerful power serious power
[1974.279] yeah and this is looking down into the
[1976.799] modern day snake River Canyon it's I
[1980.24] don't think anybody really knows what
[1981.919] the pre flood depth of the canyon was
[1984.519] but it had to been considerably
[1986.2] shallower than than the modern day and
[1988.44] I'm guessing that there probably was a
[1991.24] shallow River Channel flowing across the
[1993.159] Snake River plane that ultimately became
[1995.519] exploited by the the B Bonville flood
[1998.48] waters sure uh but this Canyon right
[2001.0] here is about 400 ft deep from the rim
[2003.519] of the cliff down to the to the river
[2006.44] surface and that's just below shonne
[2010.48] Falls this one is I don't remember if
[2013.36] this is just below shonne I think this
[2015.519] is actually above pry I'm pretty sure
[2017.919] the Falls is right on that side okay
[2019.559] well then yeah you're probably
[2022.36] right so shonne Falls is on the Snake
[2025.399] River about four miles Northeast of the
[2027.519] city of Twin Fall Falls near the
[2029.559] midpoint of a chaotically eroded 14m
[2032.799] section of the Snake River Canyon shonne
[2035.2] Falls was an important landmark in the
[2037.12] geological exploration of the west but
[2040.36] evidence that the Falls are relic of a
[2042.12] great place to seen flood has been
[2044.24] recognized only
[2046.0] recently as now understood shonne Falls
[2048.679] and its Associated erosional features
[2050.639] were formed at a time of catastrophic
[2053.0] outflow from Lake Bonville about 15,000
[2056.359] years ago and again that's Mal Day
[2059.879] writing again uh after his uh seminal
[2063.399] paper of 1968 this is 1987 19 years
[2066.919] later
[2068.48] and this is a photograph of shonne
[2071.599] Falls what happens is the Waters of the
[2074.24] flood come through they will pluck rocks
[2077.079] and as the water flows over the rim
[2080.28] it'll continue to pluck rocks and erode
[2083.079] material and so what it does is it
[2084.839] erodes creates a cataract and then as
[2087.72] the water flows over it eats the
[2089.96] Cataract
[2091.76] Upstream uh and we'll continue to do so
[2094.399] until the water the force of the water
[2097.24] declines to the level which can can no
[2099.839] longer uh Quarry the rocks or the flood
[2103.28] ceases alog together so that's what we
[2105.76] have here we have the Relic or the
[2107.52] remnant of a cataract feature which is
[2109.76] usually a horseshoe shape which has to
[2112.68] do with uh the hydrological
[2115.599] characteristics of water flow which we
[2117.28] can talk about in another
[2119.88] video so as it says here is the shown
[2122.2] falses at the junction of two channels
[2124.119] of the Bondville flood one along the
[2126.56] narrow Snake River Canyon in the other
[2128.599] on the Upland a few miles north where
[2131.68] the channels joined flood erosion
[2133.48] produced a chaotically eroded landscape
[2135.839] of cataracts Spillway alcoves and
[2138.68] scablands and the original Canyon was
[2141.4] greatly enlarged now this is Mal's 1987
[2145.44] paper where he's assuming that that the
[2148.52] scale of the canyon was uh dramatically
[2151.48] enlarg by the flood the main cataracts
[2154.48] began 2.5 Mi above shonne Falls where
[2157.52] the the canyon is 230 ft deep these
[2160.599] cataracts called The twinfalls Plunge
[2162.68] 157 ft from Basalt to massive outcrops
[2166.4] of cicc volcanic rocks in the lower
[2168.52] story of the canyon the snake then drops
[2171.359] another 212 ft to the threshold of
[2174.079] pillar falls 1.5 miles Downstream pillar
[2177.64] falls although only 20 ft high is
[2179.48] surrounded by scabland
[2181.56] Craigs Crags that reach 175
[2186.24] ft and here we can see in this
[2189.28] topographic relief
[2191.52] map we see shonne Falls is right here
[2194.68] and this
[2196.24] chaotically uh this chaotic landscape
[2198.92] that he's talking about is all through
[2200.52] here and we can see um right here is Box
[2204.079] Canyon Al Cove so this was where an
[2206.359] Upland or Overland water flow uh
[2209.599] re-entered the Snake River Canyon
[2211.68] leaving a cataract here we've got
[2214.24] another one up here the devil's Corral
[2216.88] as it's called
[2218.119] shonne Falls is right here um down here
[2221.68] we have blue Lakes Al Cove right here
[2223.56] which again is indication of another
[2225.2] Upland flow returning to the main
[2227.88] Channel and in the process eating out
[2231.28] this Al Cove or cataract feature right
[2236.28] here so that does that does show that
[2238.76] Canyon if we were here it show show them
[2240.72] Falls you had the Falls that way and
[2242.16] then look in the other direction was
[2243.48] down that can that was that was that
[2245.92] photograph that direction the picture
[2248.04] right there just below the falls
[2251.16] right we actually if you remember we
[2253.28] went swimming in Dirk slake Dirk slake y
[2256.76] um surprisingly
[2259.24] cold again another Park excellent
[2261.72] weekend road trip yes people get out and
[2264.319] see this stuff so if you live in this
[2265.64] area and you U seen this video yeah we
[2268.96] want to encourage you to get on out and
[2271.64] you may have seen some of this already
[2274.4] um but maybe this will give you a little
[2276.359] bit more in- depth understanding of what
[2278.16] you're looking at here's a uh a closer
[2281.0] up more detailed map of the Falls area
[2285.0] here's shonne Falls is right in here and
[2288.56] this is what they're talking about this
[2290.079] chaotic scab land type landscape and you
[2293.079] see there's a lot of these little water
[2294.96] bodies here they occupy scour holes that
[2297.68] were created by the turbulence within
[2299.92] the water as it flowed over here you see
[2302.119] a distributo channel right here almost
[2305.0] this at one point was probably an island
[2307.0] within the flood you can really see here
[2309.8] the devil's Corral is uh formed by the
[2313.48] Upland flow coming this way and again
[2316.359] there's a a body of water here that
[2318.119] would have been as the water uh focuses
[2320.56] through here it would become very Swift
[2322.16] and very turbulent and that rapidly can
[2324.76] eat into the
[2327.119] Bedrock Box Canyon over here again that
[2330.0] was a re-entrance from from an Overland
[2332.44] flow Echo Lake you can see right here
[2335.119] here's a channel that was cut by a flow
[2337.04] coming in from the south side of the
[2338.64] present day Canyon you see this
[2340.96] elongated Lake right there Echo Lake
[2344.119] which again is a occupying a an
[2347.16] erosional trough that was created by the
[2349.76] turbular
[2351.92] waters and here's Twin Falls at low
[2354.52] water you can actually go online and
[2356.88] there are some nice pictures on there of
[2358.96] Twin
[2359.92] Falls at high water when basically the
[2363.48] Falls is is over most of this area right
[2366.359] here during the peak of the Bondville
[2368.8] flood of course this whole this whole uh
[2372.24] channel here was was brim full actually
[2374.92] more than brim full and you can see from
[2377.839] this picture you can kind of begin to
[2379.24] see the Horseshoe shape here which is so
[2381.64] common um and that's basically just
[2384.359] because of the fact that when you have a
[2385.839] water flow the water in the middle of
[2387.839] the flow is moving faster than it is on
[2390.119] the the margins and So the faster water
[2392.839] flow eats and erods the center of the
[2395.839] channel faster than the sides the flanks
[2399.079] and therefore ends up creating this
[2401.4] horseshoe shaped U hor shaped
[2405.4] yes and this is the view into Snake
[2407.8] River Canyon near Twin Falls the canyon
[2410.76] as it exists today is largely a product
[2412.76] of the bonaval cataclysm which here
[2415.64] filled the canyon and completely over
[2417.72] topped the brim now in the latter stages
[2420.24] of the flood the water would have
[2422.0] drained off the Uplands and would have
[2424.24] been confined to the channel itself
[2429.2] this is near the uh is it the prime
[2431.88] Bridge that's what I was going to say
[2433.599] yes yeah so there's a pull off here
[2436.0] there's a beautiful bridge that goes
[2438.359] across the canyon here and I think they
[2441.04] don't they don't steel Arch Bridge don't
[2443.079] they do bungee jumping and things off
[2444.8] that bridge
[2446.44] yeah there you go there we go the pr
[2449.8] Bridge so yeah this this last picture
[2452.8] was
[2454.68] taken uh near the side of the Prime
[2458.599] Bridge which you see right here yeah I
[2461.44] think that's that's you right there yeah
[2463.92] that's me right there undoubtedly well I
[2466.92] was just before I dove from here down
[2469.56] into the into the
[2472.16] river yeah beautiful spot
[2476.84] [Music]
[2484.62] [Music]
[2487.4] wa for the man but don't help
[2497.92] [Music]
[2524.08] [Music]
[2541.0] d
[2553.52] so this
[2555.28] was uh taken from the air and you can
[2559.079] really see here a beautiful example of
[2561.48] scale invariance the Snake River flowing
[2564.64] within a giant much bigger Channel it
[2566.8] was not cut by the modern snake the
[2568.52] modern snake is confined to this inner
[2570.76] Channel now in a in a a modern flood the
[2574.119] Snake River may rise out of this Channel
[2576.76] and spread onto the flood plane here but
[2579.359] it did not create this larger channel
[2581.72] that was created by the Bonville flood
[2584.2] and here's the data the modern Snake
[2585.96] River annual an annual average
[2589.24] discharged
[2590.64] 56,800 cubic feet per second the highest
[2594.28] ever recorded flow of the Snake River
[2596.28] was 195,000 cubic feet per second the
[2600.079] estimated Peak discharge of the Bonville
[2601.96] flood again the the re revision of this
[2604.96] shows it may have been up to 41 million
[2607.16] in cubic feet per second but you can do
[2609.76] the math you'll see that um you know the
[2612.24] ancient flood was much much bigger and
[2615.48] left this large channel that now has
[2618.559] confined the Snake River to its floor
[2621.16] and the modern Snake River will never
[2624.28] rise up and over top this larger channel
[2628.2] uh short of an extraordinary exceptional
[2631.319] event such as occurred at the end of the
[2634.64] last ice age well I am trying to do some
[2636.44] quick Mathes that is that 2,000 times
[2639.4] about 2,000 bigger than the highest ever
[2641.48] recorded Peak flow yeah rough and and
[2643.88] the snake is not a is not a small River
[2646.359] no it's not you know but in comparison
[2648.16] to that channel which it's it's not a
[2651.16] mile wide there but it's over a half
[2652.76] mile isn't it yeah yeah that was one
[2656.16] substantial flow it was a very
[2658.359] substantial
[2661.92] flow and
[2663.839] then in the the basal Bedrock that forms
[2667.2] the floor of the Snake River plane is is
[2669.2] quite
[2670.0] porous so a lot of groundwater moves
[2672.52] through there and where the flood has
[2675.24] cut sliced its way through the basalt
[2677.599] now a lot of that groundwater emerges
[2679.76] from the surface in the form of these
[2682.52] Springs some of them very impressive
[2685.839] Springs and here's the two of us out in
[2689.8] a giant boulder bar called the swan
[2691.72] Falls Boulder bar and this is a a a area
[2696.119] where you might say the flood opened up
[2699.04] from a constricted area to a wider Basin
[2702.359] so when it does the material that's
[2703.92] being carried and swept along in the
[2705.76] flood gets deposited and you can see
[2708.44] here that is a pretty impressive um mass
[2712.48] of flood deposited material right there
[2715.28] and it really again a testimony to the
[2718.4] unbelievable power of this flood as it
[2721.599] swept over Southern
[2724.24] Idaho and I believe there is a cataract
[2726.76] not far Upstream from that so this is
[2728.96] probably a lot of the debris that was
[2730.92] yes flushed out of that cataract flushed
[2732.76] out of that cataract
[2736.52] right yeah so this kind of gives you the
[2738.839] scale of some of these Boulders that are
[2741.119] being swept along within the within the
[2743.2] flood and of course since they've been
[2744.88] deposited virtually nothing has moved
[2747.319] them they're pretty much where they got
[2750.0] where they were dropped and you can see
[2752.2] here the walls of the canyon are
[2753.72] probably 300 ft High something like that
[2756.64] so so you know prior to the flood you
[2758.599] would not have been standing here you
[2760.119] would have been standing up closer to
[2762.2] this Rim
[2765.44] somewhere just another shot and this is
[2768.0] the kind of thing that you see um all
[2771.119] all along the pathway of the flood these
[2773.559] this particular Swan Falls Boulder bar
[2776.64] if I recall was about 3 miles long I'm
[2779.599] not sure of the thickness I've never
[2781.079] seen studies showing the thickness of it
[2782.64] I'm going to guess it's got to be at
[2783.839] least 7al hundred ft thick but you can
[2786.64] picture pict 3 m long of this kind of
[2790.4] stuff really does uh demonstrate the The
[2794.48] Unbelievable power of a flood like this
[2797.24] and you can notice the little human
[2798.839] figure for scale right
[2803.2] there and you'll see this kind of stuff
[2805.92] just uh massive mounds of flood
[2808.0] deposited debris all within the wake of
[2810.52] the
[2811.319] flood these are the kinds of things that
[2813.48] you look at to try to decipher uh
[2817.48] the whole Hy hydrologic
[2820.76] regime Down River from Pine Bridge note
[2823.96] the large amount of flood debris that
[2826.16] has been washed up against the face of
[2828.2] the cliff opposite this is not Talis in
[2830.96] the usual sense you'll notice that the
[2832.599] cliffs are vertical they have not
[2834.64] receded in order to contribute to the
[2837.0] formation of this this is this is
[2839.16] material that was in the rushing flood
[2841.92] waters that was essentially washed up
[2844.4] against this wall in the latter stages
[2846.599] of the flood and you see this type of
[2848.92] thing all throughout the Missoula flood
[2851.079] region as well definitely and is not
[2853.4] Talis in the normal sense of the word
[2855.04] it's not a gravity deposit in the same
[2857.44] way as Talis falling off of the cliff
[2860.4] and accumulating like that if you could
[2863.119] sweep this away with a giant broom you
[2865.16] would find that this Cliff faces almost
[2867.319] sheer vertical
[2872.319] down and more subtle features but still
[2875.559] nonetheless um you know attributed to
[2878.24] the giant flows through here and you'll
[2881.0] just see this stuff all over as you're
[2882.599] following the route and now when you see
[2884.88] you'll know exactly what this the the
[2887.52] origin of of it was and so here is the
[2891.04] Boulder bar we were just looking at here
[2894.599] with these massive Boulders on its
[2897.44] surface that was this feature all the
[2900.0] way through here and then there's more
[2902.76] you see there's another bar up here in
[2906.04] this Bend
[2907.76] and that's normal the way you see these
[2910.2] features um because when water flow goes
[2913.72] around a band what it's attempting to do
[2916.68] is it's trying to all the molecules on
[2919.839] the outside of all the water molecules
[2922.28] on the outside of the flow are trying to
[2924.559] keep up with the the average speed the
[2928.079] molecules on the inside of the flow are
[2929.96] trying to slow down to keep up with the
[2931.839] average speed so as it goes around the
[2934.92] bend this just like in a horse race if
[2938.68] you're going around the bend the horse
[2941.0] on the outside is going to have to be
[2942.559] running actually faster to keep up with
[2945.16] the horse that's hugging the inside of
[2947.319] the B right so what happens is is on the
[2950.92] outside the water is moving faster it
[2953.04] becomes erosive on the inside it's
[2955.24] moving slower so it becomes depositional
[2958.2] and that's what we see right here you'll
[2959.599] see this you can see this even on you
[2961.48] know small Creeks you know in your own
[2963.44] backyard you will see the outside Bend
[2966.2] is going to be steeper and then the
[2967.839] inside Bend is going to build what's
[2969.48] called a point bar and in this case the
[2971.839] point bar is composed of these gigantic
[2975.359] Boulders and I just want to point out
[2977.44] again you know this is accessible you
[2979.359] can go the road down into the canyon to
[2981.96] to visit the dam site and there's roads
[2984.359] back in there where where we were
[2986.119] visiting people fishing back there so
[2988.119] it's accessible people go yeah I me
[2991.0] stuff out not too many generations ago
[2993.96] all these features were not accessible
[2995.839] like they are today it would have been
[2997.44] much much more difficult to study um so
[3001.88] yeah we're kind of in a privileged
[3003.079] position now and I would like to
[3005.0] encourage people to actually begin to
[3008.04] learn this this language of the
[3010.319] landscape and realize that the evidence
[3012.72] with these catastrophic floods is all
[3015.0] around and other catastrophic events you
[3018.24] know
[3022.16] um and this is near Leon and Idaho um
[3027.599] Lewiston is on the left clarkon
[3030.359] Washington is on the right and here's a
[3032.599] gigantic Point bar that has a gravel pit
[3035.799] in it and this is a very interesting
[3039.839] outcrop right here um we visited this
[3042.839] multiple times because here is where the
[3046.44] great Bonville flood met the Missoula
[3051.0] flood
[3052.559] and the arrow points to a gravel pit
[3055.319] that's exposing this internal
[3057.24] architecture of this point bar that you
[3060.0] see here it's called Tam bar because uh
[3064.079] just beyond this null right here tamon
[3066.96] Creek comes and flows into the Snake
[3071.44] River so here we see on the
[3074.16] topographical map the um let's see I
[3077.68] think we could go yes so the gravel pit
[3080.2] of interest is right here and this is
[3082.319] tamon bar and here comes Tam Creek so
[3086.28] this again this was a bar that was
[3088.04] deposited notice on the inside of the
[3090.68] band and then as you come around the
[3092.96] band goes this way and you have another
[3094.68] bar built down here that the town of a
[3097.599] soan is is constructed on this bar right
[3100.64] here um so anyways the bonnaville floods
[3106.079] came North from off the Snake River
[3109.24] plane and ultimately out of Utah came
[3111.16] North this way Hell's Canyon Hell's
[3113.64] Canyon right Hell's Canyon right down
[3115.64] here float up this way and then up here
[3119.48] the CL the clear water river flows in
[3122.0] from the East they merge and then the
[3124.92] Bondville flood would have flow off to
[3126.72] the west where it met up with the
[3129.4] Columbia River in Southeastern
[3131.4] Washington but what's interesting here
[3134.28] is and I know many of the people
[3135.839] watching this are going to seen videos
[3137.64] and have heard of the Missoula flood and
[3139.559] the channel
[3140.76] scablands which was a flood generally
[3144.52] within the conventional interpretations
[3146.559] it was water that originated from a lake
[3148.48] in Western Montana we're arguing that
[3152.04] much of the water came out of uh British
[3154.599] Columbia Canada but irregardless
[3157.28] regardless of that the water came South
[3160.96] and actually was back flooding up the
[3163.839] Snake River now if you got let's say a
[3167.4] gradient this way water is moving like
[3169.599] this it's going to be moving at a
[3171.52] velocity that's dependent upon the
[3174.16] gradient the steeper the gradient the
[3176.0] faster the velocity right now what
[3179.44] happened with the Missoula flood is you
[3180.96] have Waters coming from the north that
[3183.92] almost came in at right angles to the
[3186.48] Snake River Channel which was there at
[3188.88] that point more or less East West M when
[3191.839] that water hit the channel that's coming
[3193.88] across Northern Eastern Washington hits
[3196.92] that channel some of it flowed down but
[3199.599] some of it there was so much water that
[3201.4] some of it flowed Upstream flowed it
[3204.2] back flooded up well picture now this
[3207.4] water that's back flooding up is moving
[3209.72] up gradient it's moving up slope so
[3212.0] what's happening is it's slowing down MH
[3214.68] right this whole route of over 70 miles
[3216.96] or so it's slowing down right right
[3220.079] there south of Leon uh and clarkon is
[3223.88] where the water the back flood of the
[3226.64] Missoula uh water came to a stop
[3230.72] reversed current direction and flowed
[3232.64] back out so there is an outcrop that was
[3236.119] visible
[3236.96] back when we first visited this which
[3238.76] was in was it '98 98 '98 and we've been
[3243.28] back I think three times since then as
[3247.04] they're coring uh the gravels away it
[3250.359] exposes this internal
[3252.839] architecture but what we did in order to
[3255.4] get a a good overview shot is we went
[3258.0] across the river up onto these um these
[3261.4] Cliffs and took a shot across where you
[3264.48] can see Tam bar
[3267.0] right
[3267.88] here Here Comes The Tam Creek out here
[3271.92] the Snake River is invisible but it's
[3274.119] just it's down in the bottom of this
[3275.799] Valley right here and here is an outcrop
[3278.799] right here and we're going to zoom in
[3280.799] we're going to see that outcrop closer
[3282.599] because that exposes where the
[3285.72] bonnaville very coarse deposits because
[3288.52] it's moving down slope is coming up
[3291.24] through Hell's Canyon and then it meets
[3294.319] the Missoula back flood sediments that's
[3296.4] coming this way it's coming south so the
[3298.68] these two floods met right here now the
[3301.04] question is were they happening at the
[3303.44] same time or were they separated by
[3306.64] centuries or Millennia I don't think
[3309.0] that's been resolved yet
[3312.28] um the arrow points to the outcrop and
[3315.079] here we're going to see a closer outcrop
[3316.799] and you can see that in this uh Tam bar
[3319.64] there are very two very distinct types
[3321.839] of sediment here is the coarse bouldery
[3325.2] gravel deposits of the baville flood and
[3328.64] here are fine back flood silts from the
[3332.119] Missoula flood and then the whole thing
[3334.599] is capped by this six feet of five or
[3337.88] six feet of lust which we'll have a
[3340.68] probably just do a whole video on that
[3342.28] at some point which is a very
[3345.119] interesting uh subject of GE two very
[3348.4] distinct deposit there yes and here you
[3351.88] can see um how distinct they are and
[3354.96] this is all baville stuff coming down
[3357.64] below and you can see how much coarser
[3359.039] is and what's interesting here is it
[3360.839] appears that the very final stages of
[3362.68] the Bondville
[3363.96] flood were some of the maximum
[3366.64] discharges based upon the the size of
[3369.96] the sediment that's in here now and then
[3372.76] you can see these are basically like
[3374.72] muds you know very fine
[3377.16] silty up here the water is moving left
[3379.839] to right down here the mo water is
[3382.079] moving right to left and I don't know if
[3384.079] it shows up too well in here in the next
[3385.96] slide you'll be able to see the foret
[3388.28] bedding which is the Tilted bedding
[3390.64] which tilts down in the direction of
[3393.64] current flow
[3396.52] right yeah it shows up quite clearly you
[3399.0] can see these magnificent uh bedding uh
[3402.64] structures within the bonab Bel which
[3404.96] shows water uh sediment charged water
[3409.16] coming in this way deposit and then
[3411.319] shearing off the top of the previous
[3413.92] deposit and putting down more deposits
[3416.68] on top and so you can see these layers
[3419.28] in here this is our friend the late Mark
[3424.16] lamanto who was about 65 maybe it's all
[3428.559] acting as scalan there yeah yeah so you
[3431.599] can see right up here in the upper left
[3433.48] corner you can see some of the more buff
[3435.52] colored uh Missoula back flood
[3440.559] silts yeah this where you can really
[3442.76] begin to see the the four set bedding
[3445.72] very clearly in this and this again is
[3447.799] what we would call a paleocurrent
[3449.88] indicator because it tilts down in the
[3453.64] direction of the current flow so this
[3455.799] current flow is going like this and it's
[3458.2] basically sweeping uh gravel charged
[3461.52] sediment charged currents over the top
[3464.24] of these previous deposits and laying
[3466.76] down layer upon
[3471.72] layer and one final picture showing um
[3475.52] an exposure of the um the Missoula flood
[3480.24] silts and the final slide we will look
[3483.52] Atek along Tam Creek right and here you
[3487.64] can see um this is in a place where you
[3490.28] can actually see where the currents were
[3493.0] reversing direction through here where
[3496.359] the where
[3498.44] the where the limit of the back
[3501.92] flood was and the the water washed up
[3505.72] basically came to a slow stop and then
[3508.4] revers Direction and we see all of the
[3511.079] some very fine Ripple laminations in
[3513.28] here that show us this area where the
[3516.52] the Missoula flood back wash basically
[3521.079] stopped reverse Direction and flowed
[3523.359] back out and and we're actually missing
[3526.119] our scale indicator here so this is yes
[3529.039] this is probably like 5 in in I think
[3532.92] that's about yeah six six or 8 in I
[3536.24] remember these being you know maybe just
[3538.2] 3
[3539.0] in yeah yeah exactly amazingly fine yeah
[3543.119] is that's just Frozen in time this is
[3545.559] very fine structure here and getting
[3548.28] into interpreting this and reading it is
[3550.0] a whole uh you know a whole uh
[3553.52] discipline in itself which would be
[3556.48] beyond what we're talking about today so
[3558.24] I just this was to introduce you to the
[3560.319] idea of the Bonville flood and to show
[3562.64] you that the Bonville flood and the
[3564.28] Missoula flood actually did meet at this
[3566.48] point and looking back at this
[3569.76] particular slide right
[3572.52] here what's interesting about that is
[3576.799] bear in mind that down here the Bonville
[3579.64] flood is going to be a higher energy
[3582.24] depositional environment this is going
[3584.28] to be a lower energy depositional
[3586.72] environment high energy depositional
[3589.4] environments erode lower depositional
[3592.68] environments deposit and if it's
[3595.48] generally a very slow moving water what
[3598.039] it'll do it will
[3600.64] basically bury everything that's there
[3603.24] previously right right instead of
[3605.24] washing it away it just buries it when
[3607.76] you look at this outcrop here you don't
[3610.319] really see much evidence of there being
[3612.64] a Hiatus between the deposition of these
[3615.28] layers and these layers had there been
[3618.64] let's say a thousand years or 2,000
[3620.839] years that would have been soil formed
[3623.16] on the top of the Bonville sure
[3625.079] sediments and vegetation undoubtedly
[3628.2] trees there should be remnants of that
[3630.72] somewhere in here we should be able to
[3632.0] detect stumps we should be able to
[3633.799] detect a layer of
[3635.68] vegetation at this point this outcrop
[3638.079] needs to be studied in Greater detail to
[3640.799] determine whether or not that's there
[3642.96] but superficially what we see here
[3645.039] doesn't really suggest that there was
[3647.64] any uh Hiatus between the deposition of
[3650.599] these two distinct layers the final
[3653.039] thing I'd call attention to is this
[3654.68] interesting layer of vertically oriented
[3657.72] up here called lus this was
[3660.88] material that uh settled out of the
[3664.319] atmosphere after the final Flood now
[3668.28] what that seems to indicate and again
[3670.16] this is probably 5T 45 ft thick up here
[3673.92] that's a lot of material in the
[3675.839] atmosphere that that settled out a lot
[3679.119] of material yeah so blank blanketing
[3681.96] multiple States blanketing multiple
[3684.0] States so 6 feet thick yes so that's
[3686.28] another factor that needs to be
[3688.2] considered when trying to understand um
[3691.92] this whole series of events but one of
[3695.16] the things that I would like to suggest
[3696.799] here is that the Bonville flood was not
[3699.4] an isolated event but was part of a much
[3702.2] larger Continuum of catastrophic
[3704.48] phenomena that terminated the last ice
[3706.559] age and I think that this is where we're
[3708.799] going to be going in the direction of a
[3711.16] future thinking about environmental
[3713.24] change and geological change is most of
[3716.16] these things have been studied in
[3718.48] isolation and I think the mainstream
[3720.92] view now is that well you had the
[3722.48] Bonville flood and you had the Mula
[3724.48] flood and they weren't really connected
[3727.52] they would just happen to be uh more or
[3730.52] less synchronous in time in other with
[3732.68] in other words within a few thousand
[3734.16] years of each other but in the one hand
[3737.24] in the case of a of like uh the Missoula
[3740.48] flood we have a giant proglacial Lake
[3743.52] held in by an ice dam and case of the
[3746.24] Bonville flood we have a giant Lake on
[3749.72] an inter Montaine Basin not held in by
[3752.2] glaciers but held in by a a soft
[3756.359] sedimentary rock Dam with Missoula flood
[3760.279] the ideas that the ice dam gave way
[3762.76] allowed the lake to drain in the case of
[3765.2] the Bonville flood it was this
[3767.52] sedimentary rock Dam that failed
[3769.48] allowing the lake to drain and both of
[3772.68] those floods ended up being channeled
[3775.319] into the modern Columbia River flowed
[3778.079] west uh and in ultimately into the
[3780.4] Pacific Ocean near the town of atoria
[3783.799] Washington and there's now a fan there
[3786.359] called the atoria fan and off the coast
[3789.68] there is a large submarine canyon that
[3792.52] was produced by the flood waters so I
[3796.16] think that more studies need to be done
[3798.52] in correlating these two particular
[3801.16] events and ask the question were they
[3803.72] two independent events or or were they
[3806.48] somehow both Regional manifestations of
[3809.52] something larger something larger
[3811.319] something larger yeah and and were were
[3814.079] all these sediments carried only by the
[3817.279] water that left Lake Bonville or was
[3820.839] there more water being added in along
[3823.96] the the Idaho plane yes the Snake River
[3826.359] plane uh that AED those flows Lost River
[3829.559] Canon yes that we need to maybe include
[3832.319] at some point seems to suggest the
[3834.24] possibility that there were other
[3835.76] contributing flows into right yeah and
[3839.4] how many other smaller features like
[3841.799] that I mean Lost River Canyon was only I
[3843.799] think carrying at its peak 3 million
[3845.52] cubic feet per second if memory surged
[3847.359] me right something in that range so but
[3850.599] but still a very significant flow where
[3853.039] there's now basically just
[3855.52] Aid almost desert light right right Mars
[3858.92] looking
[3861.16] exactly so this is to introduce the
[3864.279] viewer to the Bonville flood and to
[3866.96] encourage people to get out and see this
[3869.24] for themselves and um that's about it
[3873.079] for this particular
[3876.039] podcast all right thanks for joining us
[3878.559] we'll be back with Randall and more
[3880.599] geology and more stories of the floods
[3884.0] of the Great Northwest and
[3890.599] Beyond thank you Mark for your fine
[3894.119] service yes right
[3896.44] we will never forget you

Title: Ancient Building Secrets
[0.24] I could show you some cool stuff about
[2.44] building I what here my vision is that I
[5.4] would like to take a piece of land and
[8.36] utilize the ancient principles which you
[12.36] know starts with things like simple but
[14.759] really cool like putting a pole in the
[16.52] ground and using that pole to determine
[19.119] the
[19.92] directions and all the alignments and
[22.4] you don't just build at random you
[24.279] Orient it towards the sky like they
[26.4] always did that's a universal principle
[29.0] we find over and over every continent
[31.039] hold on how do you do that with a pole
[32.719] then and what are you orienting it to so
[35.239] first thing you do is you put a pole in
[36.68] the ground and then you would draw a
[39.96] circle around it now in the old days
[42.44] they would use a knotted rope or a chain
[45.64] with links and you could determine the
[47.52] length of the Chain by the number of
[48.96] links and typically a lot of the chains
[51.76] that came from Europe the links were
[53.68] carefully manufactured to be 792 de
[58.199] which is interesting because then you
[61.239] get certain numbers like
[64.92] 7,920 in and that gives you some
[69.479] interesting geometric correlations but
[71.64] anyways like what well correlations like
[74.56] one of the ancient units of measurement
[76.2] is a furong and the only place that I
[78.28] know of that a furong is still used
[79.88] today is in horse racing it's 1/8 of a
[83.24] mile 660 ft well if you translate that
[86.4] into inches it's 7,920 in now
[89.4] interesting ly if you took the Earth you
[93.439] know the Earth is not perfectly
[95.56] spherical it's rotating so its mass
[98.88] moves towards the equator it's called an
[100.6] oblate spheroid the diameter of the
[103.159] earth varies by 26 miles the equator is
[107.0] 26 mil longer than the polar diameter oh
[111.719]  I have no idea yeah hey if it
[113.88] wasn't for that man we'd be screwed we
[115.96] Earth would be wobbling all over the
[117.36]  place you can think of it this
[119.0] way if you traveled from from the
[120.119] equator to the North Pole you've gone
[122.039] downhill by 13 mies interesting yeah so
[125.52] that oblateness it acts like a f
[127.24] flywheel that stabilizes the Earth yeah
[130.039] but that number shows up in a bunch of
[131.599] other interesting places as well wow
[135.239] fascinating stuff isn't it isn't it
[136.959] though yeah

Title: Climate Clues from the Younger Dryas
[0.04] here we got mythology mhm and here we
[2.48] have scientific evidence that Earth was
[6.359] blasted around
[8.48] 12,900 Years Ago by a multi-impact event
[11.92] people we've been around modern humans
[13.519] have been around for probably a couple
[15.879] 100,000 years the event that happened
[18.279] it's called the younger dras younger
[20.32] drus was an extreme climate event that
[23.439] was documented in Europe it's named
[25.88] after a flower called dras octopetala
[28.88] dras Patel is a polar wildflower that
[32.719] loves the cold when these bists and
[36.68] whoever was studying the plant they saw
[39.44] that it was growing in Europe during the
[41.28] Ice Age when Europe was 10° colder than
[44.52] now and then it disappeared for about
[47.0] 1300 14500 years and then it suddenly
[50.079] came back again so from that they
[52.48] concluded well you've got this cold
[55.32] loving flower that was there then it was
[58.039] suddenly gone and then it reappeared so
[60.519] you had this interval where it warmed up
[64.08] and the flower didn't like the warm
[67.119] weather and then he came back again so
[68.92] that means the cold weather came back
[70.64] those kinds of things have been
[71.84] documented explorers up there seeing
[73.759] that kind of stuff now fast forward to
[76.08] the younger dras the lower younger Dyas
[78.28] boundary which is dated just a little
[80.28] bit younger than 12,900 years idium has
[83.079] been found Platinum has been found Nano
[85.72] diamonds have been found which are
[87.32] microscopic diamonds and the only other
[90.6] place that diamonds just like that have
[93.32] been found the KT boundary from 66
[96.6] million years ago wow but we still have
[99.56] large factions of the scientific
[101.439] community that doesn't want to go there
[104.2] doesn't want to admit that there could
[105.64] have been a global catastrophe 12 or
[107.719] 13,000 years ago

Title: Fossil Fuels Launched Us
[0.08] the whole fossil fuel-driven
[1.76] civilization that we've created in the
[3.52] last century, century and a half.
[5.52] Without that, we're not getting out into
[7.2] space. Life is not getting off the
[9.44] planet. But once we get off the planet
[11.599] now, we've got options. We've got
[14.16] prospects for things that it's out there
[16.32] in space where solar energy is actually
[18.4] going to be a viable energy source. Not
[20.72] down here on the surface of the planet
[22.48] where where it's, you know, dayight
[24.0] cycle, where it's rain, where it's
[25.76] clouds, where it's the sun ain't
[27.599] shining, if the wind ain't blowing,
[29.199] right? But but out there in space, solar
[31.76] energy really does become a viable
[34.399] energy source. Again, without the fossil
[36.559] fuel-based civilization, we would not
[38.64] have gotten to where we're at

Title: Solving Earth's Problems Through Space Expansion
[0.24] So why not? What's the alternative? Back
[3.36] in the 70s when I was advocating space
[6.24] colonization to people, the objection I
[8.24] heard over and over and over again, the
[11.599] point of just exhaustion was that, well,
[14.559] we shouldn't be going into space when
[16.16] we've got so many problems to solve here
[18.08] on Earth. Well, I think what it comes
[20.72] down to is the solution to the problems
[23.6] we've got here on Earth is the expansion
[26.72] into space. Okay? because nothing has
[30.32] happened since
[32.12] 1976 when I first started promoting the
[35.36] the idea of space colonization to to
[37.76] friends and acquaintances and so on.
[39.76] Where are we at? Well, we've still got
[41.76] problems, right? And now the problems
[43.44] are in some ways even more intractable.
[45.52] Certainly, as we've advanced
[48.039] industrially, the advanced Western
[50.079] nations have been able to use our
[52.559] prosperity and our knowledge to begin to
[55.12] clean up the environment. We have a lot
[56.96] of problems here on Earth. Well, it
[58.64] turns out I think that the solution to
[60.719] many of those problems will
[62.92] automatically by default be activated
[65.92] once we have moved into

Title: A Biographical Look Into The Life of Randall Carlson | STC #42
[0.08] I had some I have great memories of you
[2.72] know and our nearest neighbors were
[4.16] farmers. We had property on a lake. So
[7.919] early on I can remember it being seven
[10.4] years old. There was a tree uh there was
[13.36] woods next next to our property. Um and
[16.64] a tree had fallen o out over the lake
[19.359] and I have memories of being seven years
[21.439] old sitting out on that tree over the
[23.92] lake with my cane pole my cane pole
[27.199] fishing pole catching fish. my brother,
[30.48] older brother Freddy, up building a fire
[34.239] and cleaning the fish. And we had a
[36.88] cookout, fish cookouts in the backyard.
[39.12] My older brother was what, 10, 9, 10,
[41.36] and he's there cleaning fish. He's got
[43.28] the fire going. Um, so I had that kind
[46.96] of a memory.
[71.68] nature just does it on its own. There's
[73.52] something about the the beauty of nature
[76.4] that just speaks to a part of our soul.
[79.28] Um, and you know, I I would love to ask
[81.92] you, I mean, you've dedicated
[85.119] your life to the study of natural
[89.479] phenomena. Like I I would love to learn
[91.92] more about where your I would call it an
[94.4] obsession in the most complimentary way.
[97.439] I think that the greats are obsessed,
[100.32] you know? I mean, I would love to hear
[102.479] from you where your obsession came from.
[105.119] Did you grow up running around in
[107.119] creeks, turning over rocks, or was this
[109.28] something that kind of hit you at some
[111.36] point in your life? No, 100%. I mean I
[114.0] grew up primarily in rural Minnesota
[117.28] with a few years sojourn living just
[119.68] outside of a small town Louisiana. So I
[122.64] had kind of a cultural contrast there
[124.88] and also sort of an ecological contrast
[127.119] because rural Minnesota upper upper
[129.84] Midwest in the Mississippi Valley is
[131.84] going to be different from you know
[134.08] outside Louisiana where you're right on
[135.84] the edge of the bayou you know and then
[138.239] farms. I mean, so I spent as much time
[141.36] on neighboring farms as I did on our own
[144.0] place. Now, my dad was not a farmer. He
[146.319] was a carpenter. So, I grew up around
[149.36] having a dad that built things with his
[151.92] hands, became familiar with tools, you
[155.12] know, who always had a project going in
[156.879] the garage. One of his hobbies was
[158.8] building and racing canoes. So, I grew
[161.519] up around canoes. We because we lived on
[163.84] a lake, we had canoes. So very early on
[167.04] um I was out in a in a canoe paddling
[169.92] and and having lived by a lake I learned
[172.239] to swim by the time I was you know I was
[174.239] pretty good swimmer by the time I was
[175.519] eight definitely by nine I was a pretty
[177.92] decent swimmer. Um then uh yeah, I mean
[182.159] that that was the life, you know, and
[183.519] then up on the farm uh you know, I
[185.92] played up there. My best friend was the
[188.239] same age as me and he was the youngest
[190.239] of he was the youngest boy in a farm
[193.519] family with 10 kids and he was the
[195.519] youngest boy and he and I were the same
[197.12] age and we became friends I think from
[199.44] like the age of three and four pretty
[201.92] much grew up together. So,
[204.56] uh, once I got I hit 13, I started
[207.04] working on the farm and my main job the
[210.64] like the first for three summers I did
[213.36] this. Um, first summer was after seventh
[216.959] grade. So, I think I was 13 then. And
[219.519] what they had acres of alalfa and the
[223.76] old farmer, he would be out there with
[225.44] his tractor and he would mow down the
[227.44] the alalfa when it was ripe and then he
[229.68] would come in with the with the rake and
[231.76] put it in the in the uh nice rows and
[234.799] then it would let it dry out for a
[236.4] couple of days. Then he would come in
[237.76] with the uh the combine or the balor and
[241.68] you know would have this big arm and it
[243.28] would scoop up the the the the rows of
[246.239] drying out alalfa. this big arm and then
[249.519] out the back of it would come the
[251.439] bundled bales, you know, and
[254.599] so you go out there and that's where I
[257.519] learned how to work hard out there in
[259.84] the sun hauling in three, four, 500 hay
[263.44] bales in a day sometimes stacking them
[266.24] into hay mount and like at the beginning
[268.16] of the the season, you know, you're
[270.479] down, it's almost empty because most of
[272.56] it's being used for animal feed. We'd
[275.12] come in there at the start of the season
[277.36] uh for the first crop and there wouldn't
[279.199] be much in there. And by the time you
[281.36] know you get like three crops in, you
[284.16] got the hay bales are stacked right up
[285.84] to the to the roof ridge all the way up
[288.4] and then you know that you spent that
[290.32] summer you hauled in those hay bales and
[292.72] and then in the fall it was shocking
[294.96] sugar cane. So we'd go out and there
[297.36] would be uh it was country roads. So, I
[301.04] mean, like my my buddy, I think he would
[303.52] be like 15, 16. I don't even know if he
[305.759] had a license, but we would go we would
[308.16] have a tra a tractor pulled by a trailer
[311.36] and we would go out there to the fields
[313.68] and the farmer would uh they would
[317.759] bundle these
[319.6] uh I don't know what I don't remember
[321.039] what they called them, staves maybe, of
[322.8] of the sugar cane. And then we would
[325.199] take them and stack them up in a certain
[327.199] way so that he could come in with his
[329.039] boom, pick them up and put them in the
[330.56] truck. So that was fall. And then there
[333.039] was bringing in the cows, slopping the
[335.4] hogs. Uh I would go there in my high
[339.039] school years. I would go there after
[341.72] school in my school clothes. And then my
[345.36] brothers would go too and we would put
[346.96] on our uh overalls and go out there and
[350.16] work. And then our dad would come pick
[351.759] us up at sundown and then we'd go home.
[354.16] So I mean that was that was my growing
[356.88] up life. So two and a half years though
[358.479] in
[359.56] Louisiana living like I said near the
[361.759] bayou. So I had the experience of you
[363.6] know going out in the in the um what did
[365.68] they call them? The johnboats you know
[367.199] where you're polling yourself through
[368.96] the bayou. I did that you know for a
[371.12] couple of years living in just outside
[372.8] of Pineville, Louisiana. So I had a and
[376.16] then there was lots of books. I just
[378.72] once I discovered reading at eight years
[381.039] old, I was hooked on and I just I read
[384.319] the classics, I read adventure stories,
[386.4] I read history, I just I got obsessed
[389.84] with reading. And so that was a big part
[392.56] of my growing up. So I had this great
[394.4] combination in my mind between as I look
[396.72] back between just outdoors doing stuff
[399.44] and then having this rich intellectual
[401.52] life.
[402.84] Um and I also dabble. I I love to paint.
[406.56] I paint did my first oil painting when I
[408.8] was eight and it was uh I was at my
[411.759] grandmother's house and she would
[413.44] encourage me and stuff like that. So she
[415.199] had everything there I needed and I
[417.039] painted my first ever oil painting scene
[419.68] was a volcan a volcano erupting and all
[423.68] the lava coming down and burying a
[427.24] brontosaurus. That that that was the
[430.16] subject matter of my You had something
[432.8] you had something against dinosaurs,
[434.479] huh? No. No. I love dinosaurs. But but
[438.4] so I look back on that and I think that
[440.16] was like a harbinger of things to come.
[443.68] Yeah. Isn't that Isn't that amazing?
[445.84] Yeah. So what so what was college like
[449.199] for you? I mean did you go to school for
[451.44] natural sciences or anything like that
[453.8] later? Later I did later. I mean look I
[458.72] Okay. So about the time so I spent one
[462.479] year in Baton Rouge when I was 16. same
[465.28] age as you getting in trouble. That year
[467.039] in Baton Rouge, I got in lots of trouble
[470.479] and got kicked out of school and just
[473.36] roamed around, you know, with a buddy of
[475.52] mine. Uh even even like when my mother
[478.72] thought I was at school, I wasn't. I was
[480.72] out on the streets or whatever, roaming
[482.639] around doing stuff um that I shouldn't
[485.919] have been doing, getting in trouble.
[488.0] Part of it was uh you know, moving from
[490.24] Minnesota to to Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
[494.24] That summer, my grandmother died and I
[497.36] was really close to my grandmother and I
[499.36] kind of I I pushed it all down. I I you
[503.199] know, I just suppressed it. I I you
[506.319] know, I ju I just didn't deal with it at
[508.16] the time. Yeah. Uh it would be like
[510.24] almost like losing your mom when you're
[512.08] 16 years old and you just you put it
[514.24] out. You know, you got all the teenage
[516.32] stuff going on and you just And so I did
[519.2] that. I blanked it out, but it wasn't
[521.599] gone. And I realized that first day of
[524.64] school I get surrounded by I'll say
[527.04] jocks. I guess they were jocks. I don't
[529.04] know. And and they're, you know, I I
[531.04] don't know why they singled me out, but
[532.56] they immediately singled me out to let
[534.72] me know they didn't like guys like me.
[536.399] And I wasn't I don't at that point I
[539.44] don't think I looked a whole lot
[540.64] different than anybody else. But but um
[544.0] it was just it went down for hill from
[545.76] there. And then the the second day, my
[548.08] uh home room school teacher sends me to
[551.04] the office uh because apparently my hair
[553.6] was too long, but my hair wasn't much
[555.6] longer than yours. And I get down to the
[557.76] office and they tell me, "Okay, here's
[560.08] our rules. Can't be above two fingers
[562.0] above your eyebrow, can't touch the top
[563.76] of your ears, and can't hang over the
[565.279] collar in the back." Okay, fine. Yeah.
[568.72] And it just I don't know. I just didn't
[570.32] like being regimented like that. I
[572.24] really resented being told, you know,
[575.6] what really and it just went downhill.
[578.36] Um I I I walked into one of my my
[581.279] English class, my English teacher one
[583.68] time, she goes, well, I can remember I
[586.48] can hear her still. She goes, "Why don't
[588.959] you get off your Yankee High horse?" And
[592.399] I thought, I didn't know I was on a high
[594.48] horse, but I didn't know I had a Yankee
[597.36] high horse, but she told me to get off
[600.399] my Yankee high horse. Um, that's
[604.24] awesome. So, it didn't go well that year
[606.24] in Baton Rouge. I got in a lot of
[607.92] trouble. My two younger brothers got in
[610.6] trouble, you know. Yeah, we all three
[613.68] went wild. And it was our dad was in
[615.76] Minnesota, our mother was in
[617.72] Louisiana. So she had a a job at WBRZ,
[622.16] which was one of the major rel uh uh
[624.8] television stations in Louisiana. So the
[627.92] summer of ' 67, we went down to visit
[630.24] her from Minnesota from rural, you know,
[632.399] living in Minnesota. We went down to
[634.0] visit her. She had this job. Her job at
[636.64] WBRZ was like liaison. every time there
[641.04] would be like entertainment or movies or
[644.56] actors or musicians acts that would come
[647.92] to Baton Rouge, it was her job to to to
[651.12] get the accommodations, the limousines,
[653.44] set up the parties and all of that. So,
[656.88] we go down there and I find myself like
[659.76] my dad and I are at at odds with each
[662.24] other, you know, cuz I'm 16. I'm getting
[664.48] rebellious and you know, he's wanting me
[666.88] to walk this. We were just at odds with
[669.519] each other. And uh I get down there and
[672.079] the first thing I know is I'm going
[673.839] there and I'm partying with the Who. And
[676.72] at the time, who else was it? Herman's
[678.56] Hermits, who are like the top pop boy
[681.12] band in the US at the time. And I
[683.839] thought, hey, this is really cool. This
[685.92] is way cooler than living with my dad up
[688.24] in
[689.079] Minnesota. And uh so we stayed there for
[692.32] that year. But it just it it didn't
[695.519] work. It just didn't work. it every the
[699.2] whole yeah the school that I went to
[702.079] they they had uh they had been the uh
[705.44] like three or four years earlier they
[707.279] had won the state doubleA football
[709.32] championship which is great right I yeah
[712.48] I like I totally value sports but that
[715.68] was the whole it was totally focused on
[718.72] that so the football team had all new
[722.04] uniforms new practice dummies new
[724.8] equipment
[726.48] the like the second day probably that I
[728.639] was at this high school, Broadmore High
[730.8] School, I went into the library, and I
[733.76] thought just like in my previous high
[735.68] school, the year before, Cooper High
[737.76] School up in New Hope, Minnesota, had an
[740.16] awesome library with just all kinds of
[743.279] great books. And I spent most of my free
[745.839] time in the library. So, I go into the
[748.24] library in this school in high school in
[750.72] Baton Rouge. I'm in my junior year. And
[752.56] it was so nothing and so depressing. I
[756.519] never I went in there that one time and
[758.959] I never went back in there again. Uh it
[761.76] was pathetic. I mean my grade school in
[764.16] Minnesota had more books than my high
[766.8] this high school in Louisiana. Anyway,
[769.36] the whole point it went downhill. Uh and
[772.399] finally, uh by the time school was out,
[775.279] my younger brother had gotten in so much
[777.12] trouble that he had gone to the court
[779.6] and the judge had told him either, you
[781.92] know, you go to whatever, go away to
[783.92] reform school or wherever they were
[785.6] going to send him for six months or you
[787.76] go back to live with your dad. So we
[790.399] ended up summer of ' 68, we all headed
[792.399] back to live with our dad. This is uh
[795.04] Rowan. No, Rocky. Oh, okay.
[800.56] Yeah. Yeah, Rowan. You've met Rowan.
[802.399] Rowan, well, Rowan was the youngest of
[804.959] the three brother, the three Rs,
[808.16] and we were the product of my my dad and
[810.24] my mom. I got an older halfb
[811.76] brotherther. Okay. And and and a two
[814.56] younger half brothers because my dad
[817.16] remarried. So, by the time we get back
[819.6] in ' 68, it's a different life because
[821.519] my dad's, you know, he's remarried.
[823.36] They've got a kid now. And yeah, it was
[825.6] just different. And of course, I'm now
[827.88] 17 and uh pretty much, you know, we
[831.76] lived in the same house, but pretty much
[834.8] I was mostly on my own. Well, what
[837.6] happened was I got back that summer and
[840.92] I was just, you know, after this year, a
[843.68] couple of things. I processed my
[845.68] grandmother's death this whole year and
[848.32] and it was like I was in a way so
[850.56] relieved to be back to Minnesota.
[853.76] Although what had happened in the
[855.24] meantime is that just like in the week
[858.32] just prior go back one summer to 1967
[861.839] summer of love out in San Francisco all
[863.839] of this stuff is going on you know
[865.92] culturally the Vietnam War is
[867.76] accelerating I'm it's starting to dawn
[870.0] on me that hey pretty soon I'm going to
[871.76] be having to sign up for the draft all
[874.639] of this because I knew older boys and
[876.88] boys my own age like my good friend at
[880.24] the farm who was my best friend his
[882.079] older brother had had got drafted. So,
[884.079] he was he was heading out. See, so
[886.399] that's what's going on in '
[888.279] 67. So, uh you know, I uh went back to
[892.24] Minnesota and and I just was kind of
[894.24] like processing this whole past year.
[896.959] And I was so tense and sort of in a way
[899.44] stressed out in a in a way. Um and just
[903.44] it was like I that summer 68 of going
[906.079] back to Minnesota and getting back to
[908.079] some of my old haunts, uh I sort of was
[910.959] relaxed or something. I was comfortable.
[914.0] Uh I wasn't in this strange Baton Rouge
[916.88] environment where I felt like an
[918.68] outcast. Right? So this is summer of
[922.6] 68 and at this time I I'm very aware of
[926.399] what's going on culturally with the with
[929.279] the psychedelic revolution and all of
[932.12] that and I'm still on the periphery of
[935.76] that. Now, my best friend in Baton Rouge
[939.44] turned out that summer he had moved from
[941.8] California and he got kicked out of
[944.48] school, sent home on the same day by the
[946.399] same home room teacher as I did. So, we
[949.36] bonded, we became best friends while we
[951.199] were there. Well, he had been exposed to
[952.959] the whole counterculture phenomena
[955.36] living out in Los Angeles, I believe, is
[957.759] where it was. So, he was always telling
[959.519] me about that. So, I was sort of up to
[962.16] speed, you know, knew that all this was
[963.839] going on. Of course, now I'm listening
[965.04] to the music, you know, Sergeant
[967.199] Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, The
[969.199] Doors, Jimmyi Hendris, Mothers of
[971.44] Invention, the list goes on, all that
[973.759] amazing music. Becoming corrupt,
[975.36] corrupted. Yes. Yes. I'm listening to,
[979.6] you know, Jimmyi Hendris, are you
[981.56] experienced? Uh, of course, I, you know,
[984.079] I'd been listening to Bob Dylan, you
[985.759] know, for number of years. Anyways, you
[988.0] know, the music at that time was an
[990.8] integral part of the whole political
[992.68] consciousness much much more so than
[994.88] now. Other than now it's used to to
[997.92] promote the woke culture, but back then
[1000.32] it was, you know, resistance to the war
[1004.399] and and the the whole
[1007.399] oppressive thing that was happening with
[1009.44] the police state and all of that at that
[1011.839] time when it was really really becoming
[1014.079] a major factor in our society. So
[1016.519] anyways, fall of 68, I went and I saw
[1019.92] the movie um 2001, a space odyssey at a
[1023.64] cynama, the big round screen, right?
[1027.76] Yeah. And I came out of there thinking,
[1030.0] "Wow, I think I'm ready to try some
[1032.24] psychedelics."
[1035.12] So, a couple of weeks later, I was able
[1037.36] to meet this guy and he was um he was
[1041.12] connected with the Grateful Dead and
[1043.64] Stanley. And so, uh I did my first ever
[1048.0] and it completely I I mean I shifted
[1051.24] from, you know, I was in that interim
[1053.44] zone. I'd been basically kind of a, you
[1055.679] know, typical teenager getting in
[1057.679] trouble, focusing, prioritizing the
[1060.16] things that a lot of teenagers would do,
[1061.679] hanging out with buddies, you know, one
[1063.76] uping each other, you know, chasing
[1066.0] trying to get a date with a girl and all
[1068.08] of this. I was in that interim period
[1070.48] where I was back home and I I was I look
[1072.559] back in that three or four months there,
[1074.0] it was a very reflective time. Yeah.
[1076.799] Yeah. And then I made the decision and I
[1079.2] went for it and first trip it completely
[1082.559] altered my whole perception of reality
[1084.32] and I became convinced that there was a
[1087.039] much deeper dimension to reality. So I
[1090.4] went from there to within a few months
[1092.84] like I the first book I read after my
[1097.6] first trip on acid was called LSD and
[1100.559] the search for God.
[1103.12] That you can look it up online. It's
[1104.64] still out there. I should reread it.
[1106.0] That was the first book I read because
[1108.64] it it opened me up. And after about a
[1112.559] year, it got to the point where during
[1115.28] this first year roughly, I discovered in
[1119.12] the spring, I went on a camping trip.
[1121.36] And that's when I discovered
[1123.6] psychedelics and nature are the optimum
[1127.36] way to do it. Yeah. After that, I didn't
[1130.48] ever want to do it any other way. 100%.
[1133.52] Yeah.
[1134.559] All all it takes is one bad trip in the
[1137.919] city for you to learn your lesson.
[1142.88] Well, and and there was a long time that
[1145.44] first year I couldn't even imagine. I
[1147.44] like how people have bad trips. Well,
[1149.919] then what happened was there weren't
[1151.52] enough bad trips. Nixon became president
[1154.16] and uh the rumor was that all of a
[1156.08] sudden like in about late summer of ' 69
[1159.2] all this bad drug started showing up on
[1162.24] the streets and uh like where's this
[1165.52] stuff coming from? Because there was
[1166.88] there was a subculture prior to that
[1168.72] that was very much about the the whole
[1171.919] consciousness. This it was like a
[1173.64] religious kind of a movement almost, you
[1176.4] know. Yeah. And so people who tried to
[1179.36] push off hard drugs or or bad drugs or
[1182.08] anything like that, they were you were
[1184.4] not you're not welcome here. You're out
[1186.24] of here. We're not we're we're now of
[1188.64] course by the 70s it had degenerated. Um
[1191.919] but in those early days from ' 67 68
[1194.64] even to 69 it was very much about the
[1197.52] quest the spiritual quest. So it got to
[1200.48] the point where I was not comfortable
[1203.64] doing stuff if I didn't know its source
[1206.16] and origin anymore. Uh but I was ready
[1208.88] to kind of move on by that time. By by
[1211.6] uh late 69 I, you know, was now
[1215.16] exploring all kinds of spiritual
[1218.28] alternatives. I had been reawakened to
[1221.28] the reality of of spirituality as a
[1224.559] result of this. And
[1226.28] um so I started going to the University
[1230.24] of Minnesota library. They had an
[1233.88] extremely wellstocked library on
[1237.679] spiritual philosophy of all kinds and
[1240.0] religion. And I spent many many hours in
[1243.36] that library reading uh books about
[1247.2] Eastern philosophy, about Zen Buddhism,
[1249.76] about Tantra, about you know reading
[1253.12] translations of the Mahabarata, of the
[1255.76] Vadas, the Rigveda, the Piranhas, you
[1259.12] know, the list went on. And while there
[1261.52] I got connected with a Sanskrit
[1264.0] professor at the University of
[1265.76] Minnesota. Uh who was also a disciple of
[1268.799] a Himalayan swami. Wow. And so he was
[1273.28] just starting a meditation class in the
[1276.96] attic of his house on the campus of the
[1280.159] University of Minnesota. So I signed up
[1282.799] for that first class uh which would have
[1287.039] been
[1288.2] uh the summer which would have been the
[1291.039] summer of
[1292.039] 71 19 summer of 1971. And what preceded
[1296.32] that was
[1298.44] um I went to Washington in May of of 71
[1304.48] and I participated in the largest
[1308.039] uh uh protest in American history at
[1312.4] that time which was also the largest
[1314.64] mass arrest in American history. And for
[1318.0] a week I was involved in this
[1320.919] incredible event of where it actually
[1324.4] looked like we were like this close to
[1327.76] civil war is what it really looked like.
[1330.64] And that that had a pretty profound
[1332.96] impression on me. Now this is I've I've
[1335.76] not I've not been doing psychedelics.
[1338.32] I've not yet really embarked on a on a
[1341.36] proactive spiritual quest yet. I'm sort
[1343.76] of in this intermediate zone. And I
[1346.159] heard that Vietnam Veterans Against the
[1348.159] War were organizing this resistance
[1351.0] movement. So I decided I'm going to
[1353.84] participate in that. Myself, some of my
[1356.159] friends, my two younger brothers, we all
[1358.0] went, we got a one of the guys had an
[1360.08] old pickup truck and we built a camper
[1362.4] on the back of it and we set off from
[1365.039] Minneapolis to Washington DC to protest
[1368.48] the war. And uh about midway through
[1371.36] Pennsylvania, he threw a rod in his
[1373.2] truck and
[1376.48] Last I remember it was by the side of
[1378.32] the road. So eight pe there were eight
[1380.64] of us on that trip and we all get out
[1383.6] and spread out along the roadway
[1385.88] and put out our thumbs. Yeah. And you
[1389.6] know what? We all got picked up within
[1391.36] no
[1392.2] am no uh real passage of time at all.
[1396.08] probably within a minutes to a half an
[1397.76] hour or so because there were people
[1399.12] actually going to uh Washington to to
[1402.559] participate and they we're there on the
[1404.32] side of the road with our backpacks.
[1405.76] They knew where we were going. So we got
[1408.08] rides in and for the next week, man, it
[1410.32] was some wild and crazy stuff back when
[1413.44] hitchhiking was uh kosher, you know. Oh
[1416.48] yeah. You know, I look I think back and
[1419.44] it was almost like there was like this
[1421.2] electrical current lines of electrical
[1423.679] current around the country and you had
[1426.159] thousands upon thousands of young people
[1429.28] hitchhiking.
[1430.88] I mean, yeah, you would go you wouldn't
[1433.919] go out and drive and not pass a
[1435.28] hitchhiker. It was just standard
[1437.52] operating procedure. Wow. So that kind
[1440.88] of got curtailed with a couple of one I
[1443.52] think was somebody picked up a
[1444.72] hitchhiker and they got murdered. And
[1447.28] then there was another case where
[1449.52] somebody picked up a hitchhiker and
[1451.039] murdered a hitchhiker. And there was
[1452.24] like two of these events like 72 or 73
[1455.52] that just killed hitchhiking. And then
[1457.919] states started outlawing it and all of
[1460.08] that. But yeah, from about 66 67 up
[1463.679] until 72 73, man, there were millions of
[1466.48] people out on the roads hitchhiking. And
[1469.12] I'm not exaggerating. I mean, it sure
[1470.96] would have had to been millions
[1472.84] because you Yeah, I hitchhiked thousands
[1476.32] of miles around the country during that
[1478.64] period. And it was that's quite an
[1480.0] adventure in itself. Yeah. You know, I
[1482.64] hitchhiked. So then I hitchhiked to
[1485.279] Washington. I spent a month there the
[1488.24] whole first week. By the end of the
[1490.24] week, the the the thing was over. They
[1492.24] they arrested over 50,000 somewhere
[1495.36] between 50 and 60,000 people got
[1497.44] arrested that week. And they completely
[1499.76] filled every jail in Washington DC. And
[1502.159] then they that wasn't even half the
[1503.84] people or less. So they they was uh one
[1507.52] of the baseball stadiums and they
[1509.36] wrapped it in barbwire and they put like
[1511.279] 20,000 people in there. Um [ __ ] Yeah.
[1516.32] And I I don't mean to get off on all
[1518.08] these stories about No, this is
[1519.679] fantastic. This is what I I want to hear
[1522.32] the the origin story of Randall Carlson,
[1525.039] you know. Oh, okay. Well, so I mean
[1527.36] there's a lot of details I'm going to
[1528.88] jump over that probably Here's a
[1531.12] question. Here's a question. So, as you
[1533.039] reflect on
[1534.96] um those I'm assuming late nights in the
[1539.44] University of Minnesota library Mhm.
[1543.84] what what was what kind of sentiment do
[1546.88] you experience when you think about that
[1550.559] early stage of of your spiritual
[1554.48] intellectual curiosity? I would imagine
[1556.96] those first few books really had a huge
[1559.52] impact on you. Are there any that kind
[1561.6] of stood out to you in during that
[1564.12] particular dipping your toe in the water
[1566.799] stage? Yeah. Well, absolutely there
[1569.76] were. Uh the summer of 70 I hitchhike I
[1574.799] I Well, yeah. I started out with a buddy
[1576.64] of mine. He had a uh I remember a blue
[1579.52] and white 1958 Chevy. And that Chevy
[1583.2] stands out in my mind particularly
[1585.76] because I remember
[1588.159] uh in 1969 me and my buddy were out and
[1591.12] we actually picked up two girls on the
[1594.24] uh Lake Street. Lake Street was the if
[1597.36] you ever saw the movie uh uh American
[1600.88] Graffiti. Did you ever see that movie?
[1602.799] Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So there was
[1604.96] a like a 10b block stripe in Minneapolis
[1608.559] called Lake Street because it went by
[1610.72] some of the there were lakes in in
[1612.52] Minneapolis and that was the American
[1614.799] graffiti where the guys were driving up
[1616.88] and down with their with their souped up
[1619.52] cars and showing off and you had the
[1621.6] driveins. I mean it was
[1623.4] very stereotypical really almost like it
[1626.4] could have been right of a scene out of
[1628.08] American graffiti. Yeah. Yeah. Very
[1630.4] alive. Yeah. Oh it was very alive. Yeah.
[1632.799] So, my first ever encounter
[1636.24] uh with a girl was in the backseat of my
[1639.279] buddy's uh blue and white 58 Chev. We
[1642.96] met down on uh Lake Street, which
[1646.559] interestingly that strip of Lake Street
[1649.12] where I was hanging out for and it was
[1651.76] part of my stomping ground for the five
[1653.44] years I was living in Minneapolis
[1656.08] uh is the exact stretch of block that
[1659.0] got got obliterated in the George Floyd
[1664.0] uh protests. that that strip of Lake
[1666.72] Street. Although I my understanding is
[1670.24] Lake Street that that
[1672.36] culture that c car culture and cruising
[1675.2] culture was was long gone by the time it
[1678.32] got to George Floyd. But that's what it
[1680.88] was back in those days. So anyways, we
[1682.72] had that same two years later, we're
[1684.32] still in that same blue and white Chevy
[1686.399] and we're going to we hear where it's
[1687.84] it's really happening out in Boulder,
[1689.76] Colorado. So we decide we're going to
[1692.24] get drive out to Boulder, Colorado. We
[1694.48] leave with we have everything in our
[1696.6] backpacks and we get to the Minnesota
[1699.6] South Dakota state line and guess what
[1701.52] happens? I don't know what what the deal
[1703.039] is but his car threw a rod, right? Well,
[1707.039] you know, if you throw a rod, I mean,
[1708.48] that's pretty much your engine is shot.
[1712.32] So, we got out. I said, "Well, what do
[1714.24] you want to do?" And he said, "Well,
[1715.84] let's just keep going." So, we got out
[1718.2] and walked down the road. the car. We
[1721.52] had our back everything we owned or
[1723.12] everything we had was in our backpack.
[1724.559] So, we walked down the road hitchhiking
[1727.039] and uh that was the last I saw of the
[1729.679] blue and white 58 Chevy sitting by the
[1731.84] side of the highway. So, we we we uh we
[1736.32] come into Denver. And how old are you
[1738.559] right now in this? I'm 19. Okay. One
[1741.44] year I I would have if I hadn't been I
[1744.399] would have graduated I was supposed I
[1746.159] was class of 69,
[1748.399] right? So, this is 70. So, one year
[1750.559] later, I'm now 19. Me and my buddy Greg
[1753.2] are we're both 19. We're the same age,
[1755.44] basically. So, we went up and we spent
[1758.32] four or five days up in the Black Hills
[1761.2] of South Dakota. And I don't know if
[1762.96] you've ever been there, but it's uh it's
[1765.52] a magical place. It really is. It's a
[1768.159] It's a special place, the Black Hills.
[1770.24] It's unique. So, that was
[1773.559] um that was inspiring to spend that time
[1776.799] there. We had a camp next to this
[1778.799] spring. We were up in the middle of
[1780.08] there was nobody else around. It was
[1781.36] just copious spring and it was the best
[1783.6] water I had ever drunk was just I
[1785.76] remember getting up in the morning and
[1786.96] just that cold water coming up in your
[1789.44] face and the energy I look back now and
[1792.08] I realize yeah well with spring there
[1793.6] and all that we we we found a place
[1795.84] where there was some very unique energy.
[1798.559] So I think we were there four days.
[1800.96] Somebody brought us in and dropped us
[1802.559] off and then we had to leave but we had
[1804.559] no way out except to walk. And then we
[1807.039] realized we were like 25 miles in like
[1810.88] so we had to walk out and uh that was
[1814.24] where that was tiring to walk out of
[1816.159] there. Um but anyways, hitchhike on. We
[1819.2] get into
[1820.44] Denver and well now how um I don't know
[1824.96] how uh into um you know uh PG I want to
[1830.48] go here but we get picked up by two
[1833.279] ladies that were uh just getting off
[1835.96] work and uh we're hitchhiking and uh we
[1839.12] get picked up by these two ladies that
[1840.559] are just getting off work and their work
[1843.039] was is that they were exotic dancers at
[1845.36] some club in Denver. So,
[1847.799] uh, they, uh, they put us up for three
[1850.799] days. Uh, but at the end of three days,
[1854.559] I'm I'm like walking outside there and
[1856.799] I'm looking to the to the west and I see
[1859.6] the Rocky Mountain front and those
[1861.919] mountains were calling to me and I said,
[1864.12] "Greg, this is great, but we got to go,
[1866.48] man. We're we're headed for the
[1867.76] mountains. We're, you know, so we left
[1871.2] and we go hitchhiking. It's late in the
[1873.039] afternoon and we're hitchhiking up to
[1875.279] Boulder and uh this big van pulls over
[1879.36] and it's all painted up and uh it's got
[1882.559] the name of the van. It was a panel
[1885.2] truck. So panel truck pulls over and
[1887.2] it's got the name of the panel truck on
[1888.72] it,
[1890.2] Rebirtha. M so we got we got a ride from
[1893.36] Rebirtha and it was this former like he
[1896.72] was some kind of a a white collar guy
[1899.44] made a bunch of money and then got
[1902.24] turned on and so it was him and his wife
[1904.08] and maybe two kids and they've been on
[1905.84] the road now for months just driving
[1908.88] around going to places. So they picked
[1910.559] up me and Greg and bring us up and just
[1914.08] just as we're coming you know the sun is
[1915.84] setting over the mountains. This was the
[1917.6] first time I'd seen real mountains in my
[1919.679] life. And I'm just like, "Oh man, I'm
[1922.08] blown away by this." So, we get there,
[1925.679] we get in town, and there's a whole I
[1927.919] mean, it was like the crossroads of the
[1929.76] universe. There was people coming from
[1931.76] coming and going from all directions
[1933.279] with backpacks. Young people, hundreds,
[1935.6] hundreds and hundreds of them with
[1937.279] backpacks. Um, we get out of the truck,
[1941.679] Rebirtha lets us out, and I see this guy
[1944.32] across the street is looking, uh,
[1947.039] long-haired guy, and me and Greg get out
[1949.279] and we're standing on the sidewalk, you
[1950.96] know, obviously new
[1953.32] newcomers. He comes driving across the
[1956.279] road, just get to, he says, just get
[1959.12] here. I said, 'Yep. And he goes, well,
[1960.88] welcome to Boulder, brother. And he puts
[1962.64] a big fat one in my shirt pocket. So, I
[1966.24] thought we're going to like
[1968.039] this. We ended up going up about 30
[1971.039] miles outside of
[1973.799] uh Boulder. I heard there was an
[1976.24] encampment up between Netherland and
[1978.559] Ward. So, we made our way up there and
[1981.6] we climbed up to a mountaintop and we
[1984.159] built us a leanto and uh up in that
[1988.32] leanto for about the next six weeks, I
[1990.88] guess, seven weeks up in that leanto.
[1993.12] And I had books with me. I had uh the
[1995.679] Taq Ching. I had the discourses of Mayor
[1999.36] Baba. So I've reading these books about
[2002.64] every third day we'd we'd go hike down
[2006.08] the mountain to the highway and
[2007.36] hitchhike down into Boulder, see what
[2010.159] was going on. Um maybe to get some
[2012.399] supplies or whatever.
[2014.519] Um so that was that was what we were
[2017.84] doing there for about six, seven weeks
[2019.519] up on the mountain and I'm studying, you
[2021.36] know, I don't know if you've ever heard
[2022.32] of Mayor Baba. Um, check him out. Um,
[2025.919] he's he was a spiritual master uh and
[2029.6] and reading the e-ching uh study and
[2032.559] other other stuff too. I had a I had as
[2034.72] many books in my knapsack as I did
[2037.76] basically survival supplies. Um, so then
[2042.48] Greg wanted to go to Texas and I didn't
[2044.799] want to go to Texas. We split up and he
[2046.799] left and I uh I ended up hooking up with
[2050.48] this guy who was camping up by the
[2052.159] Maroon Bells. So I spent another couple
[2054.639] of weeks up there camping by this
[2056.96] beautiful rushing stream next up by if
[2059.2] you know the Maroon Bells in Colorado. U
[2062.56] God, you have a bunch of places for you
[2063.919] to check out as an outdoorsman. Yeah.
[2066.159] Yeah. Then uh I caught a ride back to
[2068.8] him to Minneapolis and then my best
[2071.919] friend from high school, Pete, I look
[2075.04] him up. He said, "Oh man, you got to
[2076.399] come to Boulder." So, I mean, literally
[2077.919] like two days later, he and I left and
[2079.839] went back to Boulder. Spent the rest of
[2082.399] the summer into the fall there. And then
[2084.0] we ended up uh going up by uh Mount
[2087.24] Audabon and building an encampment up
[2089.839] there, right on the just below the
[2092.079] Continental Divide and stayed up there
[2094.48] until the season turned and we finally
[2096.879] hightailed it out of there when a
[2098.64] snowstorm was coming in like,
[2101.52] you know, so there was some interesting
[2103.52] time. So then that's at the end of 70. I
[2106.079] come back. Uh I don't remember much
[2108.48] about that winter, but then the spring
[2110.16] came and that's when we went to
[2112.52] Washington. Went through all of that. I
[2115.04] hitchhiked up and down the east coast
[2116.96] just I went to, you know, Boston, New
[2118.88] York. I'd never seen any of those
[2120.48] places. Of course, by this time I was
[2122.32] running out of money, so there was
[2123.839] nothing for me to do really except scr
[2126.48] for food. So if I says, "Screw it." And
[2128.96] I hitchhiked back whatever it was, 1200
[2131.599] miles to Minnesota. And I just had these
[2134.079] memories of, you know, getting dropped
[2135.44] off and I'm standing out in the middle
[2136.8] of absolutely nowhere. Um maybe I don't
[2140.48] know really where I was standing by to
[2144.24] some side of some highway. No cars have
[2147.2] come by for two hours and I'm just out
[2149.28] there reflecting on things, you know.
[2152.24] Yeah. So get back to Minneapolis
[2154.96] eventually. And it was right after that
[2158.0] that I was going down to the library and
[2162.079] I saw this notice that this Dr. Arya was
[2165.839] offering classes in meditation and
[2168.88] Eastern philosophy and things. So I
[2171.04] immediately signed up uh and both my
[2174.4] younger brothers came with me and my
[2176.079] best friend Pete from high school and we
[2178.32] all went uh and started enrolling and
[2181.839] learning meditation and Hindu rituals
[2185.119] and all of this in this professor's
[2187.119] attic and he was a professor of
[2188.48] Sanskrit. So through him we connected
[2191.92] with Swami. Let me show you a picture
[2194.32] here. Okay.
[2207.2] Is is this the professor? No, this is
[2210.0] the swami. He was raised he was raised
[2212.88] in a cave in the Himalayas 18,000 ft
[2216.24] above sea level. Wow. Yeah. And then he
[2219.52] came to America. There's a long story
[2221.28] there, but so I became a student of his
[2226.48] and it was a retreat that we had the
[2230.24] following summer in northern Minnesota
[2232.16] where myself and my two brothers got
[2235.28] sort of drafted to build these two
[2237.52] Buckminister Fuller geodisic domes up in
[2240.0] the north woods of Minnesota. Yeah. Was
[2242.64] this Rowan building these with you? Yes.
[2245.52] And Rocky? Yeah, both of them. Yeah.
[2248.48] Yeah. So, we were up there and I think
[2250.079] I've shown you pictures. You've seen
[2251.52] some pictures. I think maybe I believe
[2254.24] I've seen photos of the geodessic domes.
[2256.88] Maybe not the ones that you built, but
[2259.119] Oh.
[2260.119] Um, but I remember Rowan telling me
[2262.72] about this. Yeah. Well, yeah. So this
[2266.2] was so this was so this we built these
[2269.839] two geodiesic domes and one of them
[2272.72] ended up being in uh in a major uh
[2277.04] publication called
[2279.16] shelter and because of that shelter
[2283.72] uh inclusion which came out in
[2288.44] 73. Now at this time Rowan has actually
[2291.76] gone off
[2293.16] uh and lived in the ashram with the
[2296.24] swami. Wow. I did not do that. Um in in
[2301.16] Minnesota actually in Chicago. Well,
[2303.359] first he went to India with him and then
[2305.76] was in the ashram there and then they
[2307.2] came back and he was in the ashram in
[2309.04] Chicago. Rowan went to uh India. Yes, he
[2312.48] did. Wow. Yeah. With with the guy I just
[2314.96] showed you the picture of. Yeah. Yeah.
[2316.96] and was studying directly there with him
[2319.76] in just outside of Rishies. He had an
[2322.96] ashram there. Um, and this guy, I mean,
[2325.599] he comes from a long lineage of really,
[2328.72] I mean, he was the real thing. Now,
[2332.24] yeah, there's been controversy like
[2334.4] there always is. There's always these
[2336.16] controversies.
[2337.56] Um, but I know what my own experience
[2341.64] was studying and learning from this man
[2344.88] and it was genuine and it was definitely
[2349.2] genuine. Um, so
[2353.88] 73 comes around. I 73 was a great pretty
[2358.48] a pretty good year for me. I had um come
[2361.52] back and my dad had bought eight acres
[2365.92] or nine acres of land in the woods up in
[2368.48] northern Minnesota on a lake.
[2372.0] And there was only there was an old a
[2374.32] garage. Only thing was on the property.
[2376.88] And so we went in there and we converted
[2379.2] that garage into a split level house.
[2381.68] Added on to it, built it out, turned it
[2384.32] over over a period of I don't know three
[2386.16] or four months. Uh, and I remember we
[2388.8] going up there when the raw land was
[2390.56] still raw and you know, hand digging and
[2393.2] putting in a pump, uh, uh, you know, so
[2395.839] we had water. Um, we had canoes of
[2399.04] course. So then we had canoes out on the
[2401.04] lake there. And, uh, so we lived up
[2403.599] there in that woods for from the summer
[2407.04] of
[2409.079] 1971 to the summer of
[2411.88] 1972. And uh every week I would
[2416.76] hitchhike oh 160 170 mi down to
[2420.88] Minneapolis on Thursdays to attend
[2424.24] meditation class.
[2427.119] Uh and then Friday I would hitchhike
[2430.24] back up or maybe sometimes I'd stay over
[2432.48] till Saturday. Um and then I would
[2435.28] hitchhike back up to where we our
[2437.8] property and you know we lived in until
[2440.32] we had the house built. We lived in a
[2442.0] tent. So that that class was was really
[2445.68] important to you. Yes, it was. What what
[2448.64] um why why was it so important that you
[2451.68] were willing to travel so far and go to
[2454.48] such great lengths to be there? Well,
[2456.88] because I realized that, you know, I was
[2459.92] it was God, where do I even start? Um I
[2463.68] still believe that you know there are
[2465.68] higher states of consciousness available
[2467.76] to humans to we humans and you know that
[2472.16] was I became convinced of that through
[2474.0] psychedelics and then it was confirmed
[2476.16] to me through
[2477.48] these these experiences of learning how
[2480.48] to meditate and use doing these
[2482.96] practices. I was I was experiencing
[2486.76] firsthand the effects and the benefits
[2489.2] of doing these practices. Absolutely no
[2491.92] doubt. And uh I liked where it was
[2496.16] going. I believed in it. I mean it it
[2498.319] was to me like finding the essence of
[2500.64] things. Uh discovering your own deep
[2503.839] well of
[2505.24] spirituality. That was very much what it
[2507.359] was about. And so I went down and then
[2511.839] uh we had that retreat that was probably
[2514.56] in August of
[2517.96] 72. Yes. of 72 where we built the two
[2521.52] domes and that was a transformative week
[2524.48] for me up there. I was initiated in some
[2528.56] respect I'm convinced of that by the
[2531.359] swami and I had some very powerful
[2534.72] particularly one day the la the day
[2536.319] before the last day I had this very
[2539.48] powerful experience uh overwhelming
[2542.96] mind-blowing it's still today
[2546.0] uh I've never forgotten that experience
[2548.72] and and what it revealed to me about the
[2551.96] nature of maybe the human soul a human
[2555.76] conscious consciousness with the larger
[2557.48] substrate of the intelligent soul of
[2560.76] nature. That's how I'd want to put it.
[2563.68] Um, I saw and experienced directly
[2567.88] the unity, the unity of creation, the
[2571.76] unity of nature, that nature was
[2574.72] conscious, that it was intelligent, and
[2577.359] that on a higher level, my own
[2580.0] consciousness was part of this greater
[2582.16] ocean of consciousness. And that's what
[2585.72] really that was the insight that I came
[2588.48] away with from that week. And we get
[2590.96] back to the land and we were back there
[2594.72] the first day we get back and my dad
[2597.839] said um cuz you know he's got a new
[2600.4] family now. He's remarried and I have a
[2603.68] little halfb brotherther who's not
[2604.8] little anymore. But anyways, my dad
[2607.599] said,
[2609.0] um, you know, he basically said, "Yeah,
[2612.319] you guys need to go out on your own
[2614.0] now." So, uh, I had gotten
[2618.28] I, you know, the hitchhiking was so
[2620.64] easy, I had no motive to get a driver's
[2622.64] license. But now that I'm living up
[2625.119] there on this land, I want, you know, I
[2627.52] decided I' I've had enough hitchhiking.
[2629.76] I'm ready to start driving. Because
[2632.56] sometimes some of those hitchi I mean I
[2634.319] hitchi all winter so there were days
[2636.24] when I was standing out there freezing
[2638.4] your ass off freezing my ass off in
[2641.119] Minnesota. Yeah. No [ __ ] I mean really.
[2644.64] So I kind of gave me my gave like I was
[2648.24] I was kind of over hitchhiking by then.
[2650.16] I wanted So I got my eventually I got my
[2652.24] own wheels but I picked up I'd gotten a
[2654.0] driver's license. I hadn't gotten a
[2655.76] vehicle yet, but my dad brings us down
[2658.56] south of town and drops us off on the
[2660.24] highway. And we went off hitchhiking to
[2662.96] Minneapolis. And Rowan, it was right
[2664.88] after that, he went off with the swami
[2666.88] to India. Rocky, I forget where he went.
[2670.64] I think he went out to the west coast
[2672.16] and I went to Minneapolis and through
[2674.64] I'd made several connections because
[2677.2] I've been part of this growing when when
[2679.2] we when this class started there was
[2681.44] like six or eight of us in this
[2684.4] professor's attic. A year later there's
[2687.68] classes like 120 150 people are showing
[2690.96] up. I mean, it was that rapid.
[2694.319] And uh so I'd gotten to know a lot of
[2697.119] people and uh it turned out that uh one
[2700.8] of the guys had a construction company.
[2703.2] It was called Karma Construction
[2706.4] and uh he need needed help. And so I'd
[2709.359] had some experience now at this point.
[2711.359] And so I went to work for him. I had a
[2713.319] job and then I had a a place to live
[2716.319] because a group of the people from this
[2718.4] meditation group had rented a big old
[2720.96] house in South Minneapolis which was
[2723.04] just south of Lake Street uh down in
[2726.16] what's called the arts district. There
[2728.0] was a school of art down there and so
[2729.599] you had a lot of artsy people living in
[2732.72] that area and it was and and then not
[2734.72] far from there you had some of the
[2736.04] lakes. Minneapolis has a lot of parks
[2738.56] and lakes that were really nice. So they
[2740.4] had rented this big old house and uh the
[2743.599] top floor, the third floor was
[2745.28] completely vacant. So I moved in and
[2747.04] took over that top third floor and lived
[2749.28] there for about the next 15 months
[2752.319] working for Karma Construction. This
[2754.079] brings us up. Now this is a
[2756.839] uh 72. So I'm still living there se
[2760.079] summer of 73 and uh started working with
[2763.839] my dad and my buddy Pete and I had a uh
[2768.079] work together. He had a van and he and I
[2770.0] were going around doing home repair and
[2771.839] house painting. We were kind of
[2773.88] entrepreneurial entrepreneurs. When I
[2776.319] wasn't doing that, I I was working with
[2778.0] my dad. Uh and
[2781.079] uh well then uh summer of 73, my dad,
[2785.599] you know, had been a canoe racer and my
[2788.64] buddy Pete and I, we'd been out
[2790.0] canoeing. Um there's a big lake called
[2792.24] Lake Com uh uh Como, not Lake Como.
[2796.92] Um, [ __ ] doesn't matter. Big lake where
[2799.68] we used to take the canoe out and we of
[2801.599] course we were always, you know, out
[2802.96] canoeing and trying to pick up girls and
[2805.52] give girls riding our in the canoe.
[2809.28] But we decided we were going to enter
[2811.68] some canoe races. So we did go in a
[2814.56] couple of canoe races that summer, long
[2816.4] distance marathon canoe races. And so we
[2819.44] spent a lot of that summer up. We we'd
[2822.8] work and then at the end of the day work
[2824.96] day we'd take off and we'd drive up to
[2826.8] the Rum River, the Mississippi River,
[2828.64] the Crowing River where we would train.
[2831.599] And so I spent a big part of that summer
[2834.64] training for canoe races up on rivers.
[2837.839] Loved that that whole period of my and I
[2840.88] was in super excellent shape. One of the
[2843.92] uh one of the canoe races we went in was
[2846.079] 30 it's like 36 miles and it's uh you
[2849.52] know you it's it's not just canoeing
[2852.0] because there are places you have to get
[2853.28] out and port it you have to throw the
[2855.599] canoe on your shoulder and then you run
[2857.119] for a half a mile and you go back in. So
[2860.88] it was you know it was grueling but I
[2862.96] you know I'd been doing these breathing
[2864.56] exercises. I'd been doing yoga. I've
[2867.2] been when we lived in the the the up in
[2869.52] the woods in northern Minnesota, me and
[2871.359] my brothers marked out an eight mile
[2873.28] trail through the woods that we used to
[2875.359] go run on and we would run that whole
[2877.839] eight mile trail. So, I was in really
[2880.0] good shape. Um, never turned into a
[2883.599] champion.
[2885.2] But then, um, things shifted and I'll
[2888.56] bring us up to date in two minutes, I
[2890.96] think, which is
[2892.28] that 73 we're getting into fall. uh we
[2897.04] go into a recession um because remember
[2900.0] this I don't know if you remember but
[2901.28] the um the oil embargo caused you
[2905.119] couldn't get gas for a couple of months
[2907.119] you would go and you would there would
[2908.4] be like two block long line at gas
[2911.68] stations to try to get gas no gas no gas
[2916.16] and the US went into an oil uh recession
[2919.2] and I'll tell you a lot of the foreign
[2920.64] policy decisions that have been going on
[2923.119] in the last few decades really were born
[2925.44] out of that that episode of of no gas
[2929.76] and then having to pay. You know, when I
[2932.48] first started driving or when I'd go out
[2934.24] with my buddies and we'd be driving, you
[2936.24] know, gas was 30 to 35 cents a gallon
[2939.76] and then sometimes they would have gas
[2941.359] wars and you'd get it for 25 cents a
[2943.599] gallon. Yeah. So, so you know, I could
[2946.079] be with three or four buddies. we'd all
[2947.76] just pull our change or a buck or two
[2949.52] and we'd fill up the tank and we'd be
[2951.2] gone all day cruising around doing stuff
[2953.76] we probably shouldn't have been doing.
[2955.52] But um so then winter comes on and I get
[2961.2] managed to get a job and it was a
[2963.68] roofing job and I can remember being up
[2967.119] on that roof and I had had a guy who was
[2969.76] going to help me but he bailed out on me
[2972.24] like the second or third day. So, I'm up
[2974.4] there on that roof by myself and it gets
[2977.28] really cold and I remember being up
[2978.96] there and it's snowing and I'm freezing
[2980.88] my butt off going trying to nail these
[2983.44] shingles and stuff and I finally get
[2986.24] that done and it's December and I get
[2991.119] paid. I had no job and some of the
[2994.559] people in the house had moved out. Some
[2996.4] other people moved in and I didn't
[2998.0] particularly like those people and I'm
[3001.2] what am I going to do? And then I get
[3002.559] contacted by my two grandparents, my
[3005.68] mother's parents in Pineville,
[3008.2] Louisiana, where where I had been
[3010.319] living, uh, you know, when I was still
[3012.559] in fourth, fifth, and sixth grade. Um,
[3015.44] and so they they had work they needed
[3017.599] done on their house, and they said, "Why
[3018.96] don't you come down for Christmas?" They
[3021.119] knew I was kind of just foot loose and,
[3024.16] you know, didn't even know where I was
[3026.559] going to stay. Um, yeah, you know, come
[3029.44] on down. We got work we need on our
[3031.28] house and then have Christmas with us.
[3034.079] So, I I did. Now, here's where the story
[3036.96] is kind of weird. I had a I had a camper
[3039.28] van that I had bought, really nice
[3040.88] camper van with the fold up top where
[3043.2] you could stand up. I had a I had a
[3045.359] stove in there. Um I mean, it was
[3047.839] outfitted. I had uh uh what do you call
[3050.4] it? Um carpet uh shag carpet. Yeah, it
[3056.319] was I had shag carpet in there. fit.
[3059.92] Yeah. So, it was little uh little disco
[3062.559] ball perhaps coming down from the
[3064.319] ceiling. Yeah, there may be that would
[3067.839] have fit actually.
[3071.88] Um so, me and my my buddy that was one
[3076.96] of the guys that had been living at the
[3078.4] house. Uh good man. He had some
[3081.04] relatives in Lake Charles,
[3083.0] Louisiana. Rowan is in Chicago. So, we
[3086.559] he's going to he going to catch a ride
[3088.559] with us and we're going to drop him off
[3089.92] in Lake Charles, Louisiana. And while we
[3092.319] I picked up Rowan in Chicago. The three
[3094.4] of us are headed out. It's a snowstorm.
[3097.599] I've left actually at 2 a.m. in the
[3099.52] middle of a snowstorm. I said, "I've had
[3101.119] enough. I had all my possessions. I
[3103.599] loaded them into the van. We take off."
[3106.96] Bob Casey was my buddy's name at that
[3109.76] time. And and so we go, me and Bob, we
[3112.64] go to Chicago, pick up Rowan. We get
[3114.72] south of Chicago and we're just south of
[3116.48] Kankake, Illinois. And guess what
[3118.24] happens? Blew a rod. Blew a rod. Yes.
[3123.2] That's exactly what happened.
[3125.119] Unbelievable. I know. I know. Like, so
[3129.28] that was it. I mean, completely like I
[3131.119] think it tore a hole in the crank case.
[3133.44] Uh, it was a mess. Um, so we went and I
[3137.44] think I got a few bucks from a gas
[3139.92] station and I had a little bit of money
[3142.319] on me and I it was still snowing and I
[3144.88] walked up to a used car lot and went in
[3147.68] there and basically plunked down 150
[3150.96] cash and bought an old maroon Plymouth
[3152.96] station wagon.
[3155.2] There you go. No title, anything, you
[3156.96] know. I just gave him cash. He gave me
[3158.4] the keys. I went down drove down to
[3161.359] where the the van is sitting by the side
[3163.119] of the highway. We loaded everything in.
[3165.52] You know, I we dropped the key to the
[3167.359] van off at the gas station and took off
[3169.92] in the in the station wagon. Uh one of
[3173.119] the best vehicles I ever owned, as a
[3174.64] matter of fact. Um and headed to uh
[3178.48] dropped Bob off in Lake Charles and
[3180.319] headed over to Pineville and had
[3182.319] Christmas with my grandparents. Then
[3184.559] Rowan took off. I guess he went back to
[3186.48] Chicago and I stayed on for about a
[3188.4] month doing uh getting everything fixed
[3191.28] up that they needed. And then uh like
[3193.599] what the what am I going to do now? It's
[3195.119] like still January, right? I didn't want
[3197.92] to go back to Minnesota. So I get a call
[3200.0] from my mom who happens to live in
[3201.839] Atlanta.
[3203.68] She says, "Well, why don't you come on
[3205.119] up here and visit?" And at that time,
[3208.16] you know, I'd been to Atlanta one time
[3210.44] before when and back in those days it
[3213.2] was called Hotlanta.
[3215.2] And my older brother had been like a
[3217.2] very popular musician performer at one
[3220.96] of the swanky clubs in town. And uh I
[3225.359] didn't have anything else to do. So I
[3226.48] thought, well, I'm going to go and uh
[3228.64] ride out the rest of the winter and then
[3230.64] in spring I'll head back to Minnesota.
[3233.2] So I go over to Atlanta and she's got a
[3235.599] nice apartment with an amp spec
[3238.0] two-bedroom apartment and one of the
[3239.68] bedrooms is not used. So I I move in
[3241.839] there. second or third day I go get a
[3244.4] job at a roofing company and uh first
[3247.44] day they sent me out I I went in there
[3249.599] and told them I was a shingler and I
[3251.2] knew how to nail shingles. Well, they
[3253.359] didn't have any shingle jobs time so
[3254.88] they put me on the hot tar roofing crew.
[3257.359] And I don't if you have ever worked on a
[3259.28] hot tar roof sounds like a pain in the
[3261.92] ass. It's brutal. Brutal work. Really
[3264.96] brutal. You got this big
[3266.92] big can big bucket, you know, I don't
[3269.839] know what it holds, like 100 150 gallons
[3272.4] of melted liquid tar and you got to put
[3275.599] that into these five gallon buckets and
[3277.68] you're spreading it around and and then
[3280.16] yeah, you got to bring up gravel and it
[3282.96] was an entirely black crew and I'm this
[3286.559] skinny white long-haired kid on the all
[3289.68] black crew. These are older guys, 30s
[3291.76] and 40s and they were they were rough.
[3295.119] I I don't. And so those first couple of
[3297.92] days, oh yeah, I got they gave me a hard
[3301.68] time for sure. I got a hard time. I
[3304.559] said, I'm going to show these guys
[3306.0] because, you know, I was still I was in
[3307.359] I mean, I was really in good athletic
[3308.96] shape. Yeah. So I was able to step up to
[3312.079] the plate and I'm move I'm hauling them
[3314.64] five gallon buckets around and by the
[3316.559] end of the week, you know, we're getting
[3318.8] to be good buddies. Well, then they get
[3320.8] a
[3322.119] um so then what he did they they still
[3324.88] didn't have any shingle jobs in. So he
[3326.64] put me as an assistant to a roof repair
[3328.76] mechanic. So this was on commercial
[3331.04] roofs where it's the builtup roof
[3333.28] systems were which was exactly the kind
[3335.359] of roofing we were doing for that
[3337.44] previous week. So he made me as his
[3339.76] assistant for the next couple of months.
[3341.28] We would go around the building, all
[3343.28] these commercial buildings in downtown
[3344.96] Atlanta, and I learned how to repair
[3347.839] leaks in these commercial buildings. And
[3350.96] you know, I would be sometimes working
[3352.559] on a harness five, six, seven, eight
[3354.799] stories up. Uh, you know, other times it
[3358.079] was interesting work. And of course that
[3361.0] Atlanta that existed then which I got to
[3364.64] know pretty pretty intimately in a way
[3366.64] being on all of these roofs up and down
[3368.4] Peach Tree Street which was the main
[3370.48] route through Atlanta. Still is. Right.
[3373.52] Yeah. None of that's there anymore. It's
[3375.52] all completely gone. If I go into
[3377.119] Atlanta now, I don't recognize anything
[3379.599] hardly. I stay out of Atlanta for the
[3381.68] most part. But then uh I didn't get
[3384.4] along with the foreman. He was an
[3386.0] [ __ ]
[3387.68] So I one day said screw you and I quit
[3390.64] and I went back and I thought I still
[3393.76] had you know a couple of months to go
[3395.839] till spring and there was a they were
[3398.96] building a condominium near where my
[3400.799] mom's apartments were. So I just went
[3402.64] over there one morning and said hey you
[3405.359] need any help and they hired me on the
[3406.88] spot. So I was going to work there until
[3409.28] like maybe late April May then head
[3412.48] back. And then my grandfather, my mom's
[3415.76] dad got sick back in Pineville,
[3418.68] Louisiana. And it there was he might not
[3421.839] make it, right? So my mom in a hurry
[3426.079] packed up everything and left for
[3428.4] Pineville, Louisiana, and left me with
[3430.96] her apartment fully all furnished, paid
[3434.559] up for a while. Um, so I ended up
[3438.48] staying there. I got suddenly I was in
[3440.88] possession of this luxury
[3444.04] apartment. I don't remember it was three
[3446.24] months, four months, six months, I don't
[3447.76] remember, but it was paid up in advance.
[3450.48] Yeah. So I ended up staying there and
[3453.839] you know I started meeting people and
[3455.44] making friends and then I got a
[3456.799] girlfriend. Then I met this started
[3459.359] taking this class from this from this
[3461.72] Sufi that was coming to town. Right.
[3465.119] Yeah. You've told me about this. Yeah.
[3467.119] Yeah. So that led me into this whole
[3468.96] community. Uh through that group, I got
[3471.44] the first job building a house ever. Um
[3475.68] out on the banks of the Chattahuchi
[3477.559] River. This is now probably
[3480.28] 75 going into 76. So somehow I never got
[3484.559] out I never made it out of here.
[3488.319] just just I mean I made I got into a
[3490.88] whole new circle, you know, and uh I
[3494.4] started after so this building this
[3497.2] house launched my career as a
[3500.079] contractor. Yeah. Yeah. You and you and
[3502.799] Rowan. Did Rowan work on that house with
[3504.48] you? No, he didn't. It was our other
[3505.68] brother Rocky. So it was me and Rocky
[3507.76] built that house. Um, but there was a
[3510.48] gravel road between the house was
[3512.4] between a gravel road and the
[3513.52] Chattahuchi River and up the at the end
[3516.319] of the road was uh this guy. He was a
[3519.44] one of the Coca-Cola heirs and he'd come
[3521.599] into a bunch of money. So, he bought
[3524.4] this property right on the river and he
[3526.319] just was going crazy wanting to build
[3528.0] stuff and every day he's driving by
[3530.0] seeing me and
[3531.559] Rocky out there working. So towards the
[3535.119] end of it, he pulls in and said, "Come
[3537.76] on, I got all kind of work I want you
[3539.359] guys to come look at." So we went up
[3541.68] there. Um, and that, yeah, that took us
[3544.559] right through the summer into the fall
[3546.319] and we built all kinds of stuff for this
[3549.04] guy. Um, and that was where I had my
[3551.44] first exposure to a honest to gosh
[3553.599] professional dowser, you know, water
[3556.48] witching, dowsing. Yeah. Building a pole
[3559.76] barn for that guy. Um, and I've told
[3562.079] that story. I think I've told it to you,
[3563.839] haven't I? The Yeah. Yeah, you have.
[3566.0] Yeah. You said it was pretty incredible.
[3567.839] Yeah, it was. It was. So, I'm still
[3570.48] here, you know. A few years went by, you
[3572.24] know, and this was the Hey, you know,
[3574.0] look, I fell away. I'll I'm going to
[3575.839] confess. I fell away from my spiritual
[3578.88] disciplined spiritual path that I had
[3581.599] been walking. I got into the life of
[3585.799] Hotlanta. It was the disco era. Now, the
[3589.68] war is over.
[3592.44] Um just my lifestyle changed. It comes
[3596.0] and goes in waves, you know. It just It
[3599.2] does. So then, uh I lived I
[3603.24] I moved in with Rocky. We rented a house
[3606.24] in a suburb of of of Atlanta for less
[3610.319] than a year. And then Rocky was ready to
[3613.359] move on. And I didn't have anybody I
[3615.2] wanted to move in and be roommates with
[3617.44] to support the house. So, I went and to
[3619.68] uh I'd had a girlfriend and she had
[3621.92] lived in some of these old postWorld War
[3623.92] II two two-story town homes. So, so I
[3627.599] went in there one day and you things
[3630.0] were so much easier in those days, you
[3631.68] know. I just walked in and talked to the
[3634.16] lady at the desk and gave her a down
[3636.799] payment, got some keys and went up and I
[3638.799] lived there for five years. And as soon
[3641.359] as it as soon as we they found out that
[3643.52] I had some construction experience, I
[3645.92] ended up paying most of my rent for that
[3648.88] five years by doing um you know
[3651.2] maintenance. Whenever a wind would come
[3653.2] through and shingles would blow off a
[3654.64] roof, I would be the guy up there. Yeah.
[3656.96] You know, if somebody couldn't get their
[3658.96] stove lit, I would be the guy who would
[3660.64] go in there and light it. Um you know,
[3663.119] whatever it was. Uh there was always
[3665.119] these little things that needed because
[3666.64] now at this point this is the you know
[3668.64] mid to late 70s so these things are
[3670.72] getting to be 30 years old. So so yeah
[3673.68] so I lived there and I was living there
[3675.359] when I uh I got a job. There was a
[3678.4] little vegetarian restaurant
[3681.04] uh a mile or two up the road that I
[3683.68] frequented regularly. Then they found
[3685.68] out that I would you know had
[3687.28] construction skills. So one day the the
[3689.44] leader of the sect that ran this, they
[3692.559] had a guru and everything and this the
[3694.319] leader of the sect, he came to me when I
[3696.319] was in there one day and he said, "We we
[3699.119] want to increase our our our stock and
[3702.16] we want to build a we want we want to
[3703.92] start selling shoes, but we don't have
[3706.48] space." So, I ended up coming in there
[3709.359] and going up into the old unfinished
[3711.839] attic and knocking the roof out and
[3713.44] building a whole partial second story up
[3715.52] there and building this elaborate wood
[3717.839] sculpted staircase going up to it. That
[3720.48] became a shoe shoe store for them. Wow.
[3723.599] And uh as part of my payment, I would
[3726.0] get some cash, but I also got all the
[3728.799] food I could eat. And I ended up with a
[3730.96] lot of pairs of shoes. Um, I had a lot
[3734.559] of Birkenstocks if you remember those.
[3737.52] They're still around. Yeah. Are they
[3739.2] still around? Yeah, I had a bunch of
[3740.799] those, man. Um, uh, and while I was
[3744.92] there doing this remodeling and I put in
[3747.52] a a really cool juice bar. I designed,
[3750.48] this is one of my first real design
[3752.0] jobs. Um, and I, so I put in this juice
[3754.799] bar in there and this elaborate stairway
[3756.88] with a vated ceiling going up to this
[3758.92] mezzanine where all the shoes were. and
[3761.599] I put skylights up there. I had
[3764.16] pentagonal skylights that I custom
[3766.48] built. It was really cool. While I was
[3768.96] working there, uh it turns out that
[3771.2] Julie was working in the kitchen. Ah,
[3775.04] there you go. So, that was uh my first
[3779.119] time ever seeing Julie was she was I
[3782.0] went back in the kitchen for something
[3784.0] and she's back there washing
[3785.88] dishes. And then I remember asking, hey,
[3788.4] who's that who's that girl washing the
[3790.599] dishes? Oh,
[3792.28] that's I don't even know which Julie
[3794.64] Schultz I think she went by that that
[3797.4] time. Anyways, it was not immediate, but
[3800.72] it was sort of a she was already at that
[3803.039] point kind of in a relationship, but
[3805.039] that was relationship was winding down.
[3808.559] There's a whole story there I won't get
[3810.16] into, but so anyways, we had lunch
[3812.96] together one day. I can even remember
[3814.48] what we were eating. It was a uh a
[3817.359] curried um dish uh what was it with mung
[3821.92] beans and rice. I can still remember
[3824.0] having lunch together. I can remember
[3825.359] what we were eating. Yeah. And uh so we
[3828.64] kind of hit it off, but I wasn't ready
[3831.2] to settle down. So nothing really
[3833.76] serious happened until about three years
[3836.039] later. Um, and then I'd had like three
[3840.24] years where I was able to, you know, I
[3842.24] was like dating around and I kept coming
[3845.44] back thinking and of course two things.
[3848.24] Julie had started uh apprenticing as an
[3852.52] electrician and she was also studying
[3854.96] Middle Eastern dance and I had been
[3858.4] studying uh Middle Eastern percussion.
[3861.359] Now, at this point, when remember I said
[3864.079] that first year that I got here, I
[3865.92] started studying with a dervish. Well,
[3868.319] that's I got my first drum lessons and
[3870.319] my first actual drum from the same guy,
[3872.96] Adnan was his name. And uh I got my
[3876.0] first drum my first lessons in Middle
[3878.799] Eastern percussion from him. And so I
[3881.599] had now this is now that was in
[3885.4] 74. So this is like 78 or 79. So I've
[3889.839] had four years five years and I've been
[3892.52] pretty pretty devoted, you know, to to
[3895.599] learning it and I I was getting pretty
[3897.28] good by then. Um, so anyways, I'm
[3899.52] studying Middle Eastern percussion.
[3900.799] She's studying Middle Eastern dance and
[3903.119] she's got this dance teacher uh that she
[3906.799] was studying from. And so it was through
[3908.4] that connection it brought You've seen
[3910.0] the picture of the with the dancing
[3911.68] girls and stuff, right? No, I don't
[3914.4] think so. No, you haven't seen that.
[3916.4] This is a photo of you. a photo of me
[3918.88] with a couple of other musicians and Oh,
[3921.119] yeah. You've got a a big drum in front
[3922.96] of you, I think. No, headband on. Uh, I
[3927.28] did have a headband on and I had a drum
[3929.28] slung around my shoulder. Yeah, that's
[3930.72] right. I had Yeah, I Yeah. Yeah. Well,
[3933.119] Julie's in that picture. Yeah, you look
[3934.799] like a WWE wrestler. Oh, I never thought
[3938.319] of
[3939.24] that. Okay, so uh anyways. Yeah. So, you
[3943.359] know, it's weird. you know, you see all
[3945.119] of these strands of your life going like
[3947.039] this and then there are certain points
[3948.48] where they really things converge
[3951.039] together and and I go, okay, so there
[3953.28] was a whole long road for me to get to,
[3956.48] you know, let's say building that that
[3959.2] those geodic domes in 1972 that I'm now
[3962.72] remodeling this restaurant in 78 or
[3965.359] whenever it was. We we think it was 78.
[3967.839] So, you know, things so things just
[3972.48] connections between things. Anyways, so
[3976.16] we uh I would go out and I would there
[3980.319] was some guys and some of the ladies too
[3982.24] learning the the Middle Eastern
[3984.319] percussion, the rhythms and stuff. And
[3986.079] so we would go out there because the
[3988.48] when they would have classes typically
[3990.96] they would play they would have an album
[3993.039] of of recorded music, eastern music, uh
[3996.319] I mean uh Middle Eastern music. Mhm.
[3998.96] Well, so we come out there and be three
[4000.64] or four of us that were getting
[4001.92] percussion skills so we could play live
[4005.2] for the girls to practice their moves
[4007.44] and stuff. So then I got a job somehow
[4012.559] again I they they would have this arts
[4015.119] festival in Atlanta every year called
[4017.52] the Piedmont Park Arts Festival. It was
[4019.44] a big deal and I somehow I don't
[4023.039] remember how I got connected with this
[4024.48] guy. He was a psychologist, but he was
[4027.599] would do all of this stuff, creative
[4030.079] stuff, and put on shows and events and
[4032.319] things like that. And he was involved in
[4035.76] this arts festival, and he said, "Hey,"
[4038.16] he knew by this time, uh, this is like
[4041.599] 78 now, maybe 79, probably 79. And he
[4045.839] knew that I was into some percussion. He
[4048.4] also knew that I, uh, that I had these
[4051.68] building skills, right? because this is
[4053.44] what I've been doing the whole time I've
[4054.96] been living down there. And he says, "We
[4056.64] we want to build an entrance that's
[4058.48] really unique for uh the arts festival."
[4062.72] So they would they would cordon off a
[4064.4] part of the park and they would, you
[4066.799] know, separate and and all the the
[4068.64] vendors and the artists and everything
[4070.4] in there and they'd have a stage set up,
[4072.88] but you had to you had to go through. It
[4075.28] wasn't just wide open, a big park,
[4078.799] probably a couple hundred acres. So they
[4080.799] would maybe take 30 and 40 acres, cordon
[4083.039] it off. So he wanted an entrance and he
[4085.92] said, "Could you come up with with
[4087.48] something interesting?" And I Okay. So
[4091.119] what I did was I designed a 40 foot tall
[4095.28] Gothic arch. Wow. Uh, and how I built it
[4099.679] was I made four beams that were arched
[4105.6] like this that could be they were they
[4107.799] were made on the ground. So, what I did
[4111.04] was I first I laid out the arch on the
[4114.159] ground and I drove like 2x4 stakes into
[4118.239] that arch on the ground. Then I took one
[4121.679] by lumber and I curved the back of it so
[4124.96] you could bend it. Then I would wrap
[4128.239] that into this these
[4130.279] 2x4s and then I would I had a a a paint
[4134.319] roller with this high performance glue
[4137.359] and then I would paint roller on then I
[4139.52] would put another one on, screw them
[4142.319] together, another one and I eventually
[4144.08] built up these beams that are like I
[4146.08] don't know 14 16 in that are 40t long
[4150.4] four of them. Yeah. Then I got
[4153.04] scaffolding and set up the scaffolding
[4155.359] so it was high enough. And then we got
[4157.759] comealongs and and pulleys and stuff.
[4161.12] Anchored the bottom of them and then
[4163.839] raised them up. Raised up. First we
[4166.4] raised up two and then I bolted the tops
[4168.4] together. I had plates probably plywood
[4170.88] plates already cut
[4172.52] out. Raised up the other and bolted
[4174.88] everything together at the top. So now
[4176.56] you got these four big formed in in a
[4180.0] Gothic arch. So I used a pentagram to
[4182.319] lay them out on the ground. Then they
[4185.92] other people came in and they hung all
[4187.6] these streamers and things from those
[4189.92] arches and that was the entry into the
[4192.88] into the uh the arts fair. So while I'm
[4197.36] doing this, I had my I brought my drum
[4200.4] with me. So, I would finish work for the
[4202.96] day and I would sit there on a rock or a
[4206.56] stump or a bench or something or on the
[4208.76] ground and as the sun is kind of going
[4211.679] down, it's starting to get into dusk a
[4213.36] little bit or late, you know, that low
[4214.96] angle sunlight to, you know, and I would
[4217.84] play. So, one day I'm playing and I'm
[4220.64] doing some fairly well-known Middle
[4222.56] Eastern rhythm. And then I think I'm
[4225.199] hearing an echo like what? Then I stop
[4228.4] and I listen and I hear
[4230.679] another another doombeck somewhere like
[4233.6] from the other side of the park playing
[4236.239] the same rhythm I was just playing. So I
[4239.679] do another you know
[4242.28] response. I play a different
[4245.08] rhythm whoever it was on the other drum.
[4247.6] And at this point I didn't know of
[4249.199] hardly anybody around who played the
[4252.239] same type of drum. Uh hardly anybody. He
[4255.04] was not anybody from my wife's
[4257.84] connections with the belly dancer. So,
[4259.6] it's just out of the clear blue. So, I
[4261.679] go, "Okay." So, I get up and I start
[4263.28] walking in the direction and I would
[4265.12] play. Then I would get a response. I
[4267.679] would walk closer, play. After about 10
[4270.96] minutes, you know, here comes this big
[4273.04] old guy with a doom just like mine and
[4276.159] we're playing.
[4278.199] So we got together and it turned out
[4280.96] that one of the guys that I had working
[4282.96] with me on this project was an immigrant
[4285.84] from Hamburgg Germany who was had been a
[4288.239] bluegrass violin player o over in
[4290.88] Germany. They played bluegrass. So we
[4293.52] came up with the idea he said because a
[4296.32] lot of the Middle Eastern music they
[4297.76] will play violins. So he said well yeah
[4300.64] I can learn some of these. So the three
[4303.28] of us started a band and I had a guy who
[4306.56] I'd been who had been my drum student
[4308.4] for about a year or two. He came in. So
[4310.96] the four of us started this band and
[4313.52] then it kind of went from there. So the
[4315.44] by the one year later we are now invited
[4319.28] to play to perform at the same arts
[4322.96] festival. Wow. Yeah. Perfect. Full
[4325.36] circle. Full circle. So, we're up on
[4328.08] stage doing our thing and we had the
[4329.76] dancing girls with us and then after
[4332.08] it's over,
[4334.04] uh, we're leaving and then this fella
[4336.719] comes up to us and his name was Allan
[4339.679] and he had been, he was a virtuoso
[4342.96] violin player
[4345.04] and he had just been in a quite
[4348.12] well-known southern rock band called the
[4350.719] Dixie
[4352.199] Drags who actually last summer I think
[4355.04] they had a reunion like the reunion in
[4357.12] like 25 or 30 years or something. So,
[4360.48] they had just broken up and he was in
[4364.32] between gigs and he happened to show up
[4366.56] and was in the audience. He heard the
[4369.36] violin we had and he thought, "Hey, man.
[4371.679] I" So, he came up and said, "K, can I
[4374.32] jam with you guys?" Well, yeah. Cuz we
[4378.32] knew who he was. because we both knew
[4380.4] the drags, you know, they weren't at the
[4382.4] level of the Almond Brothers or Leonard
[4384.6] Skannard, but in terms of musical uh
[4389.36] talent, they were right at the top. I
[4391.92] mean, these guys, every one of them were
[4394.04] virtuosos. So, he joined and he had this
[4397.28] custom, I think it was a six string
[4400.04] violin. And if we get the chance to play
[4404.08] the video of one of our performances,
[4407.04] you'll you'll get to hear him. So we
[4409.679] worked out this whole repertoire uh you
[4412.96] know it became a fusion of uh Middle
[4416.64] Eastern classical trans music, rock and
[4420.92] jazz and we were a hot act in Atlanta
[4424.0] for a couple of years but then as things
[4426.679] happened. But anyways to make a long
[4429.04] story short I'm still here. Um but I've
[4433.36] been I wanna I want to ask Yeah. I want
[4436.56] to ask about um when you started
[4440.32] teaching kids, but I would like to take
[4443.6] a bathroom break real quick. That's a
[4445.92] good idea. I could use But then but then
[4447.76] I'd like to talk about that chapter of
[4449.6] your life when you started teaching. Um
[4453.76] I'm gonna go I'm going to go use the
[4454.96] restroom real quick. Okay.

Title: Let Kids Climb Trees
[0.32] yes that's exactly it because if we're
[3.159] raising kids that can't climb trees and
[5.92] have to in their play and we're talking
[8.32] you know five and six seven year olds I
[11.0] mean what really I still can't believe
[13.719] it when I think about it but that was
[15.839] kind of where I realized that wait a
[19.119] second I don't know if this is the human
[21.68] species or if this is America but if
[24.84] it's America hey this is we're going
[27.439] downhill here if we're raising kids
[30.199] can't climb trees we got to rip that
[32.16] bubble wrap down I mean this is kind of
[34.04] to me now like a metaphor for what we
[35.96] need to do we need to rip that bubble
[38.64] wrap off the trees and say kids I'm
[41.44] those trees and yeah you might fall off
[43.48] and break an arm you might I was 2 years
[46.719] old and climbing to the top of kitchen
[48.719] cabinets and fell off and broke my arm I
[50.84] mean this happens to kids it's part of
[52.68] growing up and you don't want it to
[54.239] happen but to me the broken arm was a
[57.32] small price to pay growing up an
[59.239] independent person

[2.28] now that are long gone they were things
[4.279] that happened Once Upon a Time 10,000
[6.799] 12,000 years ago whatever right we're
[9.16] looking at these events and seeing the
[11.559] end result of this process but not
[14.28] seeing the process itself I did the
[16.44] psychedelics before I got into a
[18.4] rigorous program of meditation I didn't
[20.96] stay with it but I did stay with it for
[22.92] enough years that and it was pretty
[25.08] intense pretty in depth and it was
[26.96] certainly enough to see that yes
[28.88] something was obvious going on I
[31.24] couldn't have talked about what it was
[32.719] scientifically at all the analogy I used
[35.879] was that if you're looking into a piece
[38.399] of glass and you've got light on your
[41.2] side and it's dark on the other side
[43.239] you're going to just see the reflection
[44.64] of you you're not going to see what's on
[47.039] the other side because it's dark if you
[49.079] turn down the lights on the side you're
[51.16] on while you're turning the lights up on
[52.96] the other side all of a sudden you see
[55.12] there's this whole other world on the
[57.719] other side and now I'm kind of almost
[59.719] thinking thinking it's like would this
[61.239] be appropriate metaphor is that if
[63.199] you're turning down the light on this
[64.92] side and making this dark is that almost
[66.72] like damping down the activity of the
[69.24] default mode network is that what
[71.2] happens

Title: The Asteroid That Ended the Age of Dinosaurs
[0.04] if you've got 6 mile diameter asteroid
[3.32] with a closing velocity of 20 m/s what
[7.399] size crater is that going to create 150
[10.599] Mi roughly in diameter so they
[12.799] speculated said somewhere there must be
[15.36] 150 mile crater if if we're right all
[18.08] the Skeptics would were saying well
[20.4] until you can show us the crater we're
[22.24] not buying into this because that's too
[24.439] too drastically different in our old
[26.279] models of gradual Extinction right at
[29.24] the same time
[30.599] petroleum Mexico is Drilling in the
[33.6] northern Yucatan Peninsula and they had
[35.84] drilled down about through a half a
[37.239] kilometer of limestone sediment and at
[39.28] the bottom of that drill CP they hit
[41.079] something hard they brought up samples
[43.44] of it it was this green vitrified really
[46.32] dense glass-like material their first
[49.32] assumption was a volcanic well word of
[51.84] this eventually got to some American
[54.239] scientists that were trying to figure
[56.28] out what happened at the KT boundary
[59.039] they went down there they got more
[60.44] samples and they started doing
[62.199] subsurface surveys and they could see
[65.159] that there was a giant circular
[67.24] structure buried under a half a mile of
[69.28] limestone and this green vitrified stuff
[71.96] was the the rock that had melted in the
[75.28] super heated temperatures that were
[78.04] created by this impact then they they've
[80.159] gone on I mean they for example have
[81.799] found the the remnants of gigantic
[84.04] tsunamis in Louisiana and Texas that
[86.36] were washed North it was a long process
[89.159] but this this occurred in like the early
[91.28] '90s three teams separately proposed
[94.36] that the extinction of the the dinosaurs
[96.439] at the KT boundary was triggered by an
[99.6] impact
