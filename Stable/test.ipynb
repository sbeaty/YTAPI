      "{\"transcript\":\"attention altcoin fans we have breaking news the Elliot wave oscillator has just printed a green bar for the first time in 4 years what does this mean for you and your favorite all coins we are going to get to it but it's very very exciting news we're going to be covering that as well as what's happening right now in the stochastic RSI we have some similar price action to what we've had back 4 years ago in 2020 finally coming above this level and getting into this Zone that we're in right now at the bottom of our screen the RSI we're trying to print a bar into this Red Zone what does that mean for Bitcoin do we think we're going to get rejected from this level and what does it mean for you and your favorite altcoin that and more coming up it's time to buckle up do you want more altcoin coverage I'm doing an exclusive bonus trade alert video for free on our email list with cardano Ada the comments were flooded with begging for cardano Ada wait till you see what I'm about to show you completely free on our email list go to crypto crew university.com if you're not on our email list sign up there you do not want to miss what I'm about to show you now let's jump into it we're on the total market cap excluding bit Bitcoin so what you see in price action is all of the altcoins combined into one and what you see in the middle of your screen the Elliot wave oscillator just printing this little green bar changing a trend in all of alt coins we're going to get to that but let's start with right here the stochastic RSI finally getting its head right above this level of 85 on your monthly chart okay so we on the monthly chart here and what happened was we had a stochastic RSI cross up back here when we were just breaking out of our bull flag right similarly to what we did before we were in this bull flag back here in 2018 into 20 early 2019 and as soon as we had that stochastic RSI break up that's what broke us out of that bare flag from there it was a Journey right to the top right and you can see from this point from March 2019 it took us all the way until July of 2020 to finally break Above This 85 level in the monthly stochastic RSI and we actually held some support after a quick breakdown what we're seeing right now is very similar action because what we did prior was we broke up here above this 85 area and then we printed at our first green bar what did we do this cycle we finally had that cross up and really really used our muscle to get above this 85 level and as soon as we got above there boom printed our first green bar things are getting very excited in the altcoin market so let's cover the bottom of my screen the RSI right what you want to know about the RSI is that it measures overbought and oversold it's on a range from zero up to 100 back in the Glory Days of 2017 we reached a monthly RSI of 100 which is ridiculous meaning alt coins were as far overextended and as far overbought as you can possibly humanly get right and then we had this next pivot High which told us that we had bearish Divergence right we had a higher high in price and and we had a lower high in the RSI meaning bearish Divergence was underway which told us that a trend reversal was underway and boy did we ever tilt your phone to the side and subscribe it was a beautiful cup formation down here at the bottom with pivot lows around 44 in our most recent structure we had pivot lows around 42 but when you look at it we had our next pivot high in the glob days of April of 21 back up here when we were almost at our all-time high and again once again showing incredibly strong bearish Divergence up near the top meaning this was our pivot high this was a lower high while the altcoin market made a high and a higher high our indicator made a high and a lower high same thing our Market cyle top was defined by bearish Divergence in both cases and then we had a sub subsequent downfall right what we're falling into right now is we're trying to get into this Zone this is a critical Zone with Market structure coming from October of 16 and Market structure coming from June 21 we also have a pivot right here in November of 20 and the top of this channel is dating to our pullback of October 17 and our resistance of November 21 so you have this channel from our bottom our Channel holding resist resistance at 70 and the top of our Channel holding also resistance currently at 82 so if you go from 70 to 82 on a monthly chart with all the altcoins you see this beautiful Zone here that we are currently trying to peek our head into literally at the moment trying to peek our head into here why is this a big deal because structurally this is significant we have a pivot low here and here holding resistance right you can see that once we break this support Zone it becomes resistance it's resistance right now until we actually get above there and confirm it as support but let's get to the star of the show here you can see you know structurally how we're looking right we had this bull flag we had this breakout it still took us a lot of time to recover from that bull flag breakout and this is when the parabolic Run happened after we recovered and at the start of our green channel right one thing that's interesting is we just printed this green bar in the Elliot wave oscillator last time we printed a green bar we stayed green for almost 700 days the time before that the cycle before that we actually stayed green for about 700 days as well so do we have the next 700 days of green with altcoins and what does that mean for you in your favorite altcoin let's get to what's happening this ewo you can go on your indicators and type it in and grab it from there and in terms of what we have here our inputs and our style are right here so you can set it up but this is the Elliot wave oscillator now what does the Elliot wave oscillator do it tells you big momentum shifts it tells you big Trend changes okay if you look at it we've got green color and we've got red color and it's on a histogram similar to if you've seen the macd the macd is on this histogram here which prints these bars right where the green prints up and the red print down the higher up the more bullish the further down the longer the red the more bearish that's it in a nutshell but the Elliot wave oscillator is telling us that we have a trend change in altcoins if you look at it we just printed this little old bar right here okay now keep keep in mind this has not closed yet right we're still in the middle of the month this is a monthly chart so at the end of the month we will have confirmed this trend change but I wanted to give it to you hot off the press because last time we had this trend change was literally right here when we were at this candle back here in August of 2020 and from then it was just a complete explosion right if you look at the August candles we were still battling this Market structure after coming out of a bull flag and this is when the parabolic Run started to happen with altcoins this is when altcoins started going crazy and we're just in that scenario now right if you look at it Bitcoin is really flirting hard with an alltime high in altcoins the whole altcoin Market is still roughly 30% off of highs all right that's significant and here's why this green bar if it prints at the end end of the month is going to spell a big momentum shift now when you look at the histogram we have the range down here at our angriest point in then the market was about -50 and we went up to this range at about positive 143 okay so this was the most bullishness that we saw in terms of the histogram printing but you can see what happens is we start printing a high and then we start printing a higher high and then another higher high and then another high higher high and then you can see that as we start printing these green bars the momentum picks up and picks up and picks up it's like a rocket ship into outer space the same thing happened on the next cycle small bar small bigger bigger bigger bigger bigger bigger up until the absolute parabolic top so what we see happening is good news in the stochastic RSI good news in the RSI coming into this area and phenomenal news with the this green bar printing in the Elliot wave oscillator so let's get to this 700 day scenario right we just showed you in the histogram we printed 700 days of green not only in our most recent cycle the prior cycle but the one prior to that was also 700 days here's what I'll caution you right yes it's 700 days here yes it's 700 days here cold hard facts right if you're new to our Channel we just talk about cold hard facts which is why you just subscribed and if you're interested in all coins we just released an exclusive altcoin bonus video with cardano Ada people were flooding the comments with it so we made this video you can go to crypto crew university.com it's free put in your name put in your email and get an email to you right now literally right now so go to crypto crew university.com and scoop that up so what we have is this green bar here represented of 700 days 700 days in both cycles that we see right in front of our eyes just cold heart facts however I will caution you inside of the 700 days of green we may look at it as a good thing however the market topped here and then we moved into a bull flag here and we still remained green right we changed to red when we got out of the bull flag and we had this period of recovery same thing recently right bull flag here we broke out of it here we turned into red and it took us sideways here you can see that we're still red as the Market's really moving sideways right so sideways action here still red sideways action here still Red Bull flag is green bull flag is green where you really want to look at is the top of the market which was really defined by bearish Divergence mainly in the RSI right that's where you took a big warning side we got up to 100 here and then we had a lower high bearish Divergence higher high in price lower high in indicator same thing happened at our most recent Market cycle so that's what you want to look at in the altcoin market we may have a very strategic clue come in which most people will avoid but it'll be right in front of her eyes and I will be covering it here so make sure you subscribe so I can keep you up to date if we start to see some bearish Divergence form inside of our green green histogram is still a major red flag but one clue could be the stochastic RSI if we dig into our stochastic RSI our momentum our blue line is on top still bullish right we are in the midst right now of potentially having a cross down right this is early days of a potential cross we're in the middle of a month but not to worry we got up into this area previously where we had right here finally above the 85 level we did have a cross down and we held structure at this 85 band here this upper band which is defined right here we held some support there right we broke down the blue line was on bottom momentarily we regained our momentum right this is our momentum Happening Here we regained our momentum and we had a flourish to the upside and that momentum to the upside was the huge parabolic run right no if ANS or butts about it it came after a little flush out here keep in mind the Market's hot right Bitcoin is at one of the hottest levels it's ever been historically in every single Bull Run we have pullbacks of 20% 30% 40% 50% and sometimes even 16 1% inside of a bull run right if that happens remain levelheaded old coins will still be just fine as long as we hold some support at this 85 level have a little flush out of our momentum and then that next wave is the absolute parabolic Insanity that will insue in this cycle as well you've got to be ready for it right we have a huge trigger warning sign with the Elliott wave oscillator we're moving into key territory here in the RSI you can see it here moving into this Red Zone with the RSI which is currently major major resistance and at the same time we have early warning signs of our potential cross altcoin Market is right on schedule according to all of the facts that are right here and there's going to be a large amount of money to be made once we see this part of the cycle and it's all going to play out right before our eyes so go get your trade alert that's absolutely free at crypto crew university.com and I'll see you right back here in the next
