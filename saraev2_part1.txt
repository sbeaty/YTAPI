Title: The Instagram → Facebook Custom Audience Scraper (5x ROI)
[0] hey everybody got an awesome system I'm [1] going to be putting together for you in [3] just a second this is going to be a [5] custom audience Builder using Instagram [7] data and the Facebook API if you guys [10] have wanted to improve your return on ad [12] spend or find ways to more finely tune [15] audience members to show your ads to [17] this is the system for you stay tuned [18] and let's get into it okay so I want to [20] be abundantly clear I haven't actually [21] built the system yet I'm going to be [22] building it alongside you that's the [24] whole point of the video so I have a [25] rough idea of what I think this is going [27] to look like um but I'm going to leave [29] in all the tours and any minor bugs that [31] I encounter along the way and the reason [33] why I do this is so you guys can see [34] what an actual development process looks [36] like not just a sanitized pretty picture [38] of the final product like I think a lot [39] of people are doing on YouTube but the [41] actual nuts and bolts of what my thought [43] processes are at every step that you [44] know get me to the end result otherwise [46] it's like I'm just showing you a picture [48] of the Empire State Building and then [50] saying build it right the picture is [52] nice and it does give you some [53] information but doesn't really give you [55] um the actual stepbystep on how to do [57] something like this yourself so any who [59] we got the comment right here um you [62] know as covered some people scrape their [64] competitors's Instagram followers to [65] later use them in a custom audience for [67] Facebook ads so what I'm thinking we're [68] going to have to do obviously is we're [69] going to have to find a way to scrape [71] competitor Instagram followers so I'm [73] going to talk about that in a second um [75] and then I don't know if we'll be [76] necessarily able to connect this with [77] Facebook if we can then I'll do the [79] connection and we'll actually do this [80] via API if not I'm just going to export [81] like a CSV um and just have it all [84] nicely formatted and stuff like that uh [86] but yeah it's a it's a pretty [87] interesting ask in all honesty I don't [88] have as much experience in the pay ad [90] space last time I did paid ads for any [92] meaningful volume was probably like at [94] least three or four years ago um [96] basically my very first stop is I'm just [98] going to look into the custom audience [101] variables like what do you actually need [103] in order to upload a custom audience so [105] I've opened up the tab that gets me to [107] this information here I just went on ads [109] manager. [110] facebook.com adsmanager [112] audiences and then from there you know [114] there's this create a custom audience [115] button that I clicked on and then I [116] clicked on customer list and from here [119] you can see that you know they ask me [120] for a bunch of identifiers they [122] basically say in order to have this be [125] sufficient for a custom audience you [127] need to include at least one column that [129] has this email or phone number or [132] Advertiser ID or Facebook user ID or [135] page user ID or their first name or [137] their last name presumably and I don't [140] know this for sure but presumably the [141] more Fields here you provide the higher [143] the likelihood is that this is going to [144] find the actual person on top of that [147] you can include some more identifiers [148] you can include your city the state or [150] Province the country uh ZIP postal code [152] date of birth year of birth gender and [154] age when that's all really cool and then [156] last but not least you can also add um [159] you know customer value to get a value [161] based look like which I'm not really I'm [162] not really sure what that means then [163] there's some data processing options so [165] really the very first thing before I [167] even like you know put together the flow [168] and I usually create a flow in Whimsical [170] here I'm going to be walking you guys [171] through how I do that in a second the [173] very first thing I do is I always at the [174] very beginning I start with like what [175] data am I actually getting from this [178] data source or I guess in this case what [180] data do I need in order to like [181] accomplish my goal so um that that's [183] sort of number one so I'm going to go [185] back here and I'm actually going to [186] download it looks like they have a file [187] template so I'm going to download this [188] file template and then I'm just going to [190] go sheets. [193] new and then I'm just going to import [196] this file template just so I could see [198] what this looks like in an [202] actual uh you know [205] spreadsheet so let's see here so we have [209] three email columns [211] interesting and it looks like the reason [213] why we have three is because you can add [214] multiple email columns actually it looks [215] like you can add as many of these as you [217] want and then they'll try and match the [219] data points that's pretty cool I didn't [220] know that um m a d I don't know what [224] that is some sort of advertising ID I [226] imagine let me see what the specific [228] term was called mobile Advertiser ID [231] okay uh FN stands for first name um [234] Ellen stands for last name obviously zip [236] code city [238] state uh do do y That's a year gender [244] age uid and value I don't know yeah I [246] don't really know what the value is [247] there but any I'm pretty confident that [249] we can get at least some of this [250] information and we're not going to have [251] all of the information for everybody [253] what I'm thinking is you know since [254] we're going to be scraping Instagram ke [256] you don't just have to scrape Instagram [257] maybe I'll throw on a couple other [258] platforms there as well who knows but [261] because we're going to be scraping [261] Instagram like we we're going to [263] probably like I don't know maybe like [265] half the time get the first name right [268] um a lot of L of the time we're going to [270] be able to get the location as well so [271] we might be able to say City for sure [274] probably be able to say country I don't [276] know if we'll necessarily be able to do [278] um date of birth date of birth year [280] we'll probably be able to do a couple of [281] these other things so yeah I'm GNA I'm [284] going to run through this and we'll see [286] how this goes but I'm pretty confident [288] that this is going to be fine um I think [290] I think we can probably get the vast [291] majority of what we need just going to [294] flip over my phone because I keep on [295] getting calls and it's kind of [296] distracting um okay let's run through [298] this and let's actually first of all we [300] need to recreate the spreadsheet so I'm [302] just going to go [303] to actually I have to go to another [305] email address here uh right [309] there I'm just going to paste these [311] headers [312] in and that should be sufficient we're [315] just going to call this like custom [316] audience and now what I'm going to do is [318] I'm going to um just really quickly map [321] out what I think my flow is going to [322] look like so I think what we're going to [324] do is we're going to scrape [327] Instagram scrape their competitors [328] Instagram far so scrape Instagram [330] followers using appify probably and I'll [333] show you that in a second from there I'm [335] thinking we're going to need [337] to enrich [340] data if [342] necessary and I'm thinking for this we [344] could probably like pump the data into [347] perplexity or do a Google search on the [349] contact or look for their Facebook page [352] I'm not sure about this but we'll see um [355] after that we will add to Google sheet [358] database then after we've added this to [360] this Google sheet database here custom [363] audience so let me just call this custom [364] audience [365] database uh we [367] will you know either and I don't know [370] this for sure but we're either going [373] to add to [375] Facebook custom audiences via API I need [378] to look into this or we'll just export [381] CSV so if the API is possible then we'll [384] go down here and then if not we'll just [386] expert the CSV for user to upload that [389] should be pretty simple pretty [390] straightforward so as you guys can see I [392] mean this is like three or four steps [393] not going to be super complicated system [395] but um you'd be surprised at how simple [397] some systems that generate outsized [399] Revenue amounts are if the system ends [400] up working and you know it's like good [402] for uh you know at movie- Mark you know [406] this is something that might be able to [407] improve the accuracy and the the the the [410] conversion rate and the RASS on their [411] campaigns like 15 times who the hell [413] knows so yeah that's sort of my mindset [415] with this let's actually get into how [417] we're going to do all of these steps the [419] first is scrape Instagram followers um [420] as I mentioned I'm probably going to use [421] appify if you guys aren't familiar with [423] appify basically what what it is is it's [425] a giant marketplace where people spend [427] all the time and energy to make a [428] scraper for mostly social media purposes [431] and then they actually just charge you a [433] little bit to use it so it's this big [435] Open Marketplace it's blowing up right [437] now everybody on planet Earth is using [438] this um and it's probably what we're [441] going to use here as you see Instagram [443] scraper Google Maps extractor Facebook [444] post scraper Tik Tok extractor you can [447] get basically anything you want I'm just [448] going to type an Instagram here [450] here and I'm just going to see all of [452] the options I have and if you think [454] about it I'm kind of looking for like [456] I'm kind of looking for a couple things [459] like what I'm looking to do is I'm [460] looking to scrape the followers [463] logically of a page the reason why we [466] need to do that is because we need the [467] ability to scrape the competitor's [469] followers and then you know we may be [473] able to further scrape an individual [475] page sort of one at a time or maybe [477] we'll do it in some some sort of batch [478] upload way so that's that's sort of my [480] logic here um I see an Instagram profile [482] scraper I'm just going to hold command [484] and click on this to open the tab [486] Instagram post scraper I don't really [487] care about that this one just seems [488] General so I'm going to click on that [489] this is $1 per thousand this is probably [492] what I [495] want okay uh okay great so I'm I'm just [498] going to try this one out this one looks [499] the best to me and I'm just going to [501] close the eight million other tabs that [503] I just [504] opened and I'm just going to give this a [505] try um what I need to do first is I need [507] to grab my Instagram cookies so I'll [508] show you guys how to do that a second [509] but I actually have an Instagram page so [511] I'm just going to open this up and [512] hopefully none of my memes are [513] extraordinarily [516] offensive [520]  well then [523] uh just give that a quick little click [527] uh actually this is a this is a great [528] example why don't we give why don't we [531] give this guy uh try so I'm just going [534] to copy and paste that um and then I'm [537] going to paste it into username here so [539] do you ever just as send the [541] list type that we're looking for is the [543] followers I just want to I want to get [544] some of his [545] followers and then the count per page [548] experimental I don't really know what [549] this [550] is experimental if you want to speed up [552] the process default is 12 I'm going to [554] keep that as 12 page donation token no [555] idea what that [557] means um and then Instagram cookies I [559] have to provide all right so in order to [561] grab the Instagram cookies what you need [562] is you need this plugin called cookie [563] editor so I already have cookie editor [566] I'm just going to go over here then what [568] I'm going to do is I'm going to export [570] all of this as Json and then it looks [574] like we just need to click on the [576] extension export the Instagram paste the [578] copied contents here so I'm just going [580] to try pasting the contents here I think [584] this should work we'll see um proxy [586] configuration this one's a residential [589] proxy uh looks like it's recommended I'm [592] going to try [594] H okay I'm going to try this residential [596] proxy we we'll give it a try so I'm then [598] I'm going to click save and start we're [599] just going to see what sort of data that [601] we get from this okay so we're running [603] this now um usually the way that these [606] actors work is they're actually spinning [608] up like a thing in the cloud [610] somewhere looks like there are no items [612] in the data set which tells me it's [614] probably some issue with the [617] cookies yeah so it was an issue with the [619] cookies so I need to go back and I need [621] to change how I provided the cookies [622] restored default input there we go [625] session ID value your session ID domain [628] Instagram okay so I guess I just need to [630] get the value then [632] right so value should be [636] this just going to paste in your session [638] ID right [640] here we are going to try this one final [644] time oh did I not feed in any input hold [649] on uh no we did this guy figu iio cool [654] it's probably the guy that made the [655] scraper or [656] something yeah I think so [660] okay we're going to check the log and if [662] this doesn't work then odds are there is [664] another Instagram scraper I could [670] use cool cool so cookies loaded so it [672] was just an issue with the uh the [675] formatting okay so it looks like it did [677] a little bit of scraping already and now [679] it's um doing some sleeping which is [682] cool and pretty soon hopefully we will [684] have this [686] populated awesome awesome awesome we are [688] actually already populating this look at [690] this go wow very cool very cool oh this [693] is [694] incredible okay we don't get a lot of [697] information never mind we [701] do Facebook ID V2 well I'm kind of [704] interested is that the same as [709] this how many letter how many numbers is [712] this one two three four five six seven8 [715] nine 10 so it's 10 numbers go back here [719] to our scraper this is more than 10 yeah [723] unfortunately uh is this 10 one two [727] three 4 5 6 7 8 n this one's 10 hm who [731] knows this might actually be the [732] information that we need the ID if it is [735] then we could just use the ID and that's [736] basically going to be like an auto match [737] all the time incredible but okay great [740] so um we've scraped Instagram followers [742] now you know fixed the cookie [745] what I'm going to do is I'm going to go [747] do you ever just ascended I'm [748] just going to use that as the example [749] moving forward well actually we can just [750] use the data from the figu guy actually [753] it's sub uh sufficient for us we're [755] going to go to runs and then I'm going [756] to go to this one and then I'm going to [758] go storage I'm going to copy the default [760] data set ID and I'm just going to go [761] into make now and I'm going to create a [763] new scenario to deal with this actually [766] pump the data in and and handle [768] it so I'm going to call this [771] Instagram followers [773] scraper then arrow and then I'll say [776] Facebook custom audience [779] so now we are going to go to appify what [783] I want is I want the get data set [785] items and then I'm just going to select [787] my account here and then paste in the [789] data set ID that I just copied from the [791] previous section the value of this is [793] now I have a direct route to just grab [796] the data from abii and stick it into [798] make which is valuable limit I'm just [800] going to go [801] 10 now I'm going to run this module only [804] and voila now we have the same [806] information that we had previously it's [807] just now we have it in make which is [808] fantastic [810] now I'm not really sure what PK pkor ID [813] or ID is if we can get the Facebook IDs [816] well this is going to just this is going [818] to be like one of the most effective [819] scrapers ever because we're going to [820] have all the information that we need [823] really [825] um and I'm just kind of I'm really [827] curious whether or not this is the [829] Facebook app user [832] ID if this is um this is going to look [836] pretty good [840] associate with your Facebook application [842] Facebook application can you grab [844] Facebook app user IDs [854] Instagram app user IDs from in I'm going [856] to ask gp4 I'm not expecting it's going [858] to know unless it's super [862] confident [867] h h [869] could listen could be still you don't [872] know you honestly don't know let me just [875] check this out really [884] quickly this might just be [887] meta okay anyway um I'm thinking this [890] may actually be what we need if it is [891] that'll be [893] incredible uh because now we're going to [895] have the first name we're going to have [896] the last name for a lot of these people [897] and we're going to have the Facebook app [898] user ID which is obviously an [900] extraordinarily specific um [903] identifier so I might try this we're [905] definitely going to dump all this data [906] into a Google sheet now um but before we [908] do why don't we just like run this [909] through a quick verification to see [911] whether or not the full name actually [913] exists like it's a it's it's a real [917] person so names like this look real [919] right so I'm just going to grab the data [921] set items here and I'm just going to go [923] open AI create a [925] completion what I'm going to do next is [927] I'm going to add a system prompt first [930] so model GPT 40 actually you know what [933] this is going to be such a high volume [934] application I should probably use [936] smaller model like GPT 40 mini idea [939] being that because I'm going to be [940] running this quite a few times in quick [942] succession I want to decrease my token [943] count as much as possible I want to [944] decrease my costs you know we you could [947] potentially scrape hundreds of thousands [948] of Instagram followers right my system [950] prompt will be you are a helpful [951] intelligent assistant let's just say [953] writing [955] assistant and then my user prompt is [957] where I'm going to give it instructions [958] and B basically tell it what I want it [960] to do so this is where the task goes so [962] I usually separate things into system [963] prompt first then the user which I now [966] call a task [967] prompt and then after that if I need to [969] give it examples I give it examples um [972] in in a third user prompt uh which I [974] call the example and the assistant is [976] the um example answer so I'm going to [980] say we are reviewing a list of Instagram [983] profiles to [985] determine whether or not the users [992] your task is to determine whether or not [995] a provided [997] input is a [1000] name is a real [1004] name since users on Instagram can set [1008] their names to whatever they [1016] want just to filter out names [1019] that are clearly [1021] fake fake fictional let's just say fake [1025] or [1027] fictional [1029] rules [1032] um let's [1034] say [1037] output your response in Json using this [1040] format I will [1045] say let's go first [1047] name last [1052] name Let's Go full name as well just in [1057] case um if a name if a profile doesn't [1064] include a name leave [1071] all per leave all Jason Fields empty [1079] uh hold on a second we should probably [1081] have a verdict so we go verdict first [1084] verdict will be true or [1086] false first [1088] name will be first name or empty last [1092] name last name or empty then full name [1095] will be full name or [1097] empty okay so this looks fine to me um [1100] I'm just going [1102] to run it now on some actual data so I'm [1105] going to go user and then I'm just going [1106] to feed it and I'm going to use Jason to [1108] send as well receive data cuz I like [1109] treating models as um API end points I'm [1113] going to feed in [1115] the full [1118] name and then the full name then I'm [1122] also going to be feeding in the [1126] biography um I don't know where this [1129] biography is though didn't we have a [1130] biography a moment ago I thought we did [1132] back can ampify let's go back here let's [1135] go to our output let's go show all [1138] Fields bio graphy H weird no we don't [1140] actually have access to the [1141] biography that's unfortunate um so I'm [1144] actually just going to leave that [1148] out and I just screwed up by saying full [1151] name [1152] there Instagram name let's do that and [1155] then for um the Json I'll just click [1157] show advance settings response format [1159] Json object parse Json response here we [1161] go now I just want to run this on a [1163] sample let's just do [1165] 10 let's just run this and see what the [1167] looks like 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 [1172] beautiful now that it's done that last [1173] one I'm just going to run through it I'm [1174] just going to see it's very important [1176] for me to see um whether or not this is [1178] correct so verdict false they left all [1181] three empty [1185] awesome Henry Barrera this one should be [1187] true true Henry Barrera Henry Barrera [1191] nice this has nothing so it's going to [1194] be [1196] nothing this has k [1199] yeah so it's going to say [1203] false this is M ma B le la which I don't [1208] actually know I guess this is just going [1210] to bundle it inside of the last name [1211] that's [1213] fine derish Kumar which should be [1215] sufficient for us as [1218] well Zim Rafi should be sufficient wow [1222] this is actually looking pretty good out [1223] of 10 I think we've gotten what four now [1225] this will be false I take it [1229] yeah this one will be definitely false [1232] and then this one will [1234] be [1235] catel this one will be false as well [1237] cool so we got about half of them which [1238] is what I was expecting so let's say [1241] filter and extract [1243] names okay great so now what I'm going [1246] to do after we filtered and extracted [1247] the name we have to check to see if the [1250] name exists in our database [1252] so really the only columns that matter [1255] for us are FN and Ln for now do we get [1257] the location from m [1262] H would be kind of sweet if we [1267] did got a Nikki in the chat would be [1270] kind of sweet if we did I wonder do we [1272] get more data from another um one like [1276] if we if we bundle a bunch of these [1277] together and then call [1279] another scraper are we going to [1282] get the [1284] location be incredible if we did [1288] humans in New York full name we do get [1290] the biography which could help but no we [1293] we really don't so there's no actual [1295] like if you think about it there's no [1295] value in US um doing another step here [1298] we could probably get most of the steps [1301] um just by doing this Okay cool so we're [1302] going to filter and extract a bunch of [1303] names next what I'm going to do is I'm [1305] going to go to my database which is [1306] literally just going to be a big list of [1307] first and last names to be honest it's [1308] not going to be that great especially [1309] the person's name is um appearing [1311] multiple times uh and then I'm going to [1314] search [1315] rows and this is necessary because we [1317] need to check to see whether or not this [1319] entry exists inside of our [1321] database then I'm going to go to nickol [1323] left [1325] click. I'm going to select this [1327] puppy hello puppy it's ready to be [1330] selected thank you call this custom [1332] audience [1333] database and then the sheet name will [1335] just be sheet [1337] one what I'm looking to do is I'm [1339] looking to check to see whether or not [1342] there's a first name equal to first name [1345] and a last name equal to last name [1349] basically I'm looking to see whether or [1350] not this person exists in the [1352] database um if they do exist in the [1355] database then fantastic if they don't [1358] exist in the database then not [1361] fantastic and I'm thinking I'm just [1363] realizing here that we may [1367] [Music] [1368] need we could actually add one [1370] additional layer yeah we should we [1372] should actually we should get their [1374] gender as well this would [1377] help we should say we should have it to [1379] try and assume whether or not somebody [1381] is uh male or female essentially like [1384] we'll try it's not going to be 100% but [1386] this is a third data point so now we're [1388] going to have the the first name the [1389] last name and we're also going to have [1391] um you know their their supposed gender [1395] and I don't believe there's anything [1396] else that we can do [1397] here H we might we actually you know [1399] what we might even be able to feed in [1400] the freaking profile picture now that [1401] I'm thinking about it that'd be [1403] incredible yeah look look how easy it is [1405] to determine whether somebody's a man or [1406] a woman sorry uh I'm G to get roasted [1409] for that aren't I uh anyway let's go [1413] down [1414] here [1415] incredible wow that's sweet [1418] man okay okay so kind of refactoring my [1421] whole approach here um [1424] still kind of what actually what we [1426] should do [1429] um I'm just trying to think about the [1431] best way to do [1436] this you know this is is an okay [1439] database but there are way too many [1440] fields here email phone maid whatever [1443] all we really want is we want the first [1444] name and the last [1447] name then we want the [1450] gender and [1456] then um I think I'm going to include one [1458] of these codes as [1462] well I think I'm going to include one of [1464] these codes as well I [1467] believe so if we go back to ads meta [1471] there was a mobile Advertiser [1473] ID there's also the Facebook app user [1479] ID is it always going to be 10 digits [1488] always let me just see this really [1490] quickly [1500] yeah first [1501] name okay last [1506] names gender [1509] mrf okay yeah gender mrf that's how [1512] we're going to do [1513] this so uh we need first name last name [1516] gender mrf and then why don't we also do [1518] our little code [1521] um we'll just [1524] do appu ID [1529] appu ID [1532] okay I just wanted to make sure that [1534] whatever I chose here was was reasonable [1536] and I'm just going to touch this up and [1537] make this look a little [1539] prettier because I don't think Facebook [1541] is going to [1542] care and then I'm going to go enter okay [1545] so now we have everything that we need [1547] to actually dump leads into this [1550] so kind of what I should do here is I [1554] should search to see where the first [1555] name or last name exists [1558] and one more we should check to see [1559] whether or not the [1561] um sorry let me just refresh [1565] this I'm GNA have to because I just [1567] added a bunch of new [1570] Fields Oh weird so actually doesn't look [1573] like it has been refreshed yet let me [1576] start at the very top work my way [1579] down Uh custom audience database here [1583] just going to refresh this [1586] puppy it's going to get the filters and [1589] then what I want to check to see is [1591] whether or not this field first name is [1593] equal to first name and this field last [1594] name is equal to last name and whether [1596] app U ID is equal to app U ID which I'm [1600] just going to grab from PK ID I [1604] guess I'm going to return one and then [1607] from here uh all I need to do is just [1610] sorry go to add a row then if the total [1613] number of bundles here is zero AKA if [1616] this did not find anything [1621] then I'll continue and I'm actually [1622] going to add a row to my [1624] database so obviously I have to go [1626] through the whole rigma roll of finding [1628] the um database again I think that like [1630] the Google Sheets module is kind of [1632] stuck in make to be honest because I [1633] find in practice it actually takes me [1634] just as much time to set the module up [1637] initially and just click through and [1638] wait all these buttons as it does to [1639] actually do the logic so um now we can [1642] go through and what I'm looking for is [1644] first name last [1646] name um app U ID which I think was just [1649] ID and then the gender I'm going to get [1651] it to Output as well [1653] so we'll go gender [1658] here and then over [1669] here um let's [1676] go M or [1681] f for [1686] Jen attempt to determine whether or [1690] not the name seems male or female if [1694] male enter M if F enter [1703] F okay I'm going to try this again um [1707] you do sometimes run into issues when [1708] you do prompts like this where this does [1710] not want to give you an output because [1713] it's I don't know I'm scared for [1715] political correctness reasons or [1716] whatever like if somebody's name is [1717] Henry Barrera like odds are they are [1719] probably um [1722] male okay cool yeah that looks like it [1725] is actually doing [1726] it um doesn't look like I'm putting this [1728] in my Google sheet though why oh right [1730] right because I said gender here but [1731] it's actually gen now so let's just go [1734] back let's delete everything um let's [1736] just delete all these actually so [1738] just in case there's some special [1740] formatting there I'm not paying [1741] attention to this gets sorted as [1745] well oh oh and uh I screwed up here [1748] because this actually should not be [1750] progressing unless the verdict is [1754] true [1758] right there we [1760] go all right let's run this puppy one [1762] more time [1765] delete and then we'll go back here I say [1768] puppy a [1769] lot it's because I'm actually just a [1771] giant puppy at [1772] heart it should be outputting the Gen [1775] man why is it not outp putting the [1780] Gen oh no it is up putting the Gen so [1783] what's going on here why don't we have [1786] Jen oh jeez I'm using the freaking [1788] search row Jesus I'm all over the place [1790] today okay this is what we want my [1793] bad and I'm again going to delete these [1796] records [1799] and now I'm going to run this hopefully [1801] one final [1806] time okay great looks like out of 10 or [1810] so we got four I'm anticipating it's [1812] going to be about [1813] 50% I am kind of skeptical as to whether [1815] or not that app ID is actually something [1817] for us I don't know for sure but okay we [1821] now have a way to scrape profiles with [1823] reasonable Precision which is nice so [1825] from here I'm just going to run this on [1826] all the data why because it would be fun [1829] and I'm just kind of curious let's say [1830] out of 100 records with an offset of 10 [1833] because I want to get the new ones how [1835] many of these actually make it to the [1836] end while this is running and dumping in [1839] leads why don't we do a little bit of [1841] math and let's just determine whether or [1843] not um yeah let's determine whether or [1846] not we can do this Facebook ad stuff [1847] programmatically so Facebook ads API can [1850] we just go custom audiences Facebook [1852] custom audiences here we go create a oh [1854] jeez create a custom audience beautiful [1856] add emails add users o [1859] oh that's beautiful okay um all right so [1862] I think I figured this [1865] out looks like I have a bunch of [1867] Facebook accounts [1869] wonderful let's go [1874] here we'll try for left [1877] click name will be example audience for [1884] now what happens if I create example [1886] audience [1889] please agree to the custom terms at this [1891] link okay so now I need to go and I need [1893] to agree to these custom audience terms [1897] accept Okay let's give this a try [1900] again well thank you very much um let's [1903] go down to audiences and [1906] [Music] [1907] then uh let me see here I guess I could [1910] probably do add users to a custom [1911] audience I I take it that this is what I [1913] would want to [1915] do okay left click account left click [1919] this is looking a lot easier than I [1920] thought honestly example audience data [1923] email phone [1925] gender it' just be M or F right all [1928] screw it let's give this a try we'll go [1933] here we'll go here yeah a to z only [1937] special characters in utfa yeah I don't [1938] know if that that weird special [1941] character is actually going to work [1942] unfortunately first name initial no [1944] that's fine mobile Advertiser Ed country [1948] imagine if we just [1949] like set them all to the USA I wonder if [1951] that would [1952] help okay page scope D ready page ready [1955] all right this should be sufficient um [1957] cool yeah honestly that's that looks [1960] like it to be real the system is pretty [1962] straightforward I think all I'm going to [1965] do now is just add one of these say m so [1969] Nicholas and then I'll say [1972] saraf value not found in options [1976] why we go back to the [1980] gender why not if I go male and then I [1982] click map it's lowercase M go female [1985] it's a lower case app so is it just that [1987] it's a lower case I might need to do [1988] lower case let's feed in this and let's [1990] just go [1992] lower then I'm going to go M Nicholas [1996] surf ah yes that was the issue doesn't [1999] look like there were any invalid entry [2000] samples now if I go back to oh geez I [2004] don't actually [2005] know which one this was let's go to my [2008] left click add [2010] account let's load up the custom [2012] audiences let's see what we [2013] got right over [2019] here nice oh and it actually found me [2022] didn't find Nicholas or I found Nick [2024] incredible so it actually match that to [2026] the right person which is nuts okay [2028] great so now that we have this why don't [2030] we um just add a bunch of people to my [2031] own custom audience so I could terrorize [2033] them be like hello you were in a YouTube [2035] video that I made uh [2038] yeah we don't actually even need this [2039] database to be completely honest but I'm [2041] going to include this here just for [2044] relevance search if [2048] exists up add to [2052] DB create custom [2055] audience add user to custom [2058] audience so we're not actually going to [2060] want to create the custom audience every [2062] time [2065] obviously but we could do so at the [2067] beginning of the search which I'm going [2068] to show you guys in a second now that we [2070] have all this [2072] um I'm just going to go back here and [2074] just delete 90% of these let's just run [2077] this on some actual data see what [2079] happens okay lead number one added lead [2082] number two [2083] added lead number three added four not [2088] seeing any invalid entry examples which [2089] is [2092] nice just going to refresh us to see how [2095] big this audience is and how many of [2097] these have actually [2102] connected um well I don't really know if [2106] this is just not showing me the usage [2108] correctly or something oh I just [2110] keep on adding ni don't I is that what I [2113] keep on [2115] doing oh no I Look to be adding the [2117] right people or right right information [2118] anyway cool um why don't I go back [2124] here and then maybe I have to refresh [2126] this one more time [2130] we're going to click example audience [2132] again it is getting bigger for [2134] sure we added 15 [2137] rows oh I get it sorry this name here is [2140] the person that is using that is doing [2142] this the actual audience itself right [2145] right right the actual audience itself [2147] has the data but it's sort of behind the [2148] scenes I understand now you can't see [2151] the people added to set audience okay so [2154] I'm going to wait until we finish all a [2156] 100 or so of these [2158] so after we finish 100 I'm going to [2160] double check and see how many of them [2162] were actually successfully added to the [2163] custom audience that I created and I'm [2165] just looking to see whether or not [2166] there's a difference in the numbers the [2168] reason why is because I'm just curious [2169] whether or not that number has any [2171] validity for us right just want to see [2174] this says 27 yeah I know it says 27 [2176] whereas this one says 36 so we're [2178] actually getting much better numbers [2179] than I thought I think it's actually [2180] like finding the Facebook of ID of the [2182] person um what looks like 70% of the [2185] time so I was thinking it would find it [2187] like less than that realistically well [2190] actually no didn't I say [2191] 70% oh yeah I said 70% of 50% so 35% um [2196] in total but 70% of the uh names [2198] provided off three data points honestly [2200] pretty damn good I'm proud of my [2202] estimation abilities so uh yeah we're [2204] just pushing this through now we got a [2206] couple more that we need to wait for [2208] beautiful it looks like 55 made it [2211] through a couple of these were not new [2214] couple of these were the same as before [2216] I'm curious how this record went so I'm [2217] kind of yeah let's take a peek at this [2219] this is uh run number 34 was [2226] it maybe it was [2229] 35 you know what I'm just going to check [2231] the I can't actually check the output [2234] bundles that's annoying I really want to [2237] see which one this was so [2241] uh why don't I just open up a bunch of [2243] these and just check to see whether or [2245] not I can find so Jeffrey [2248] was oh okay actually it was a little bit [2250] before so I'm going to grab this [2253] one this looks like it was added [2255] correctly no issues that's fine all [2258] right so out of um 45 let's see how big [2260] the actual Facebook ad audience got [2262] let's see how many of these were like [2263] basically legit they were [2266] found go back to my example audience go [2269] history yeah looks like it added all 45 [2272] honestly I'm not seeing a major issue [2273] here maybe this just had a little bit of [2274] time that it needed to catch up so [2277] that's pretty good yeah I think this is [2280] solid um I wonder if I could look and [2283] find specific customers now I can't you [2286] know it's obvious that they hide the [2288] customer the custom audience from you [2290] because they just don't want you to like [2291] screw around with private and [2293] confidential information and that's okay [2296] awesome so now that I have this flow and [2297] it actually automatically does what I [2298] want um let's just zoom out a little bit [2300] and let's uh let's sort of like think [2302] through this problem in a little bit [2304] more detail there are two of these [2306] modules right there's create a custom [2307] audience and then there's add user to [2308] custom audience so if you think about it [2310] like we kind of want an automated [2311] mechanism that allows us to do this if [2314] we wanted to do this there are a few [2316] different routes that you could take you [2318] could for instance create trigger this [2321] scraper to start running and only when [2323] you trigger the scraper to start running [2324] do you create a custom audience and then [2327] that custom audience is the same custom [2328] audience that all subsequent modules use [2331] basically um so we are going to add [2334] users to that custom audience and no [2335] others so we could do that where you [2337] know every new profile for [2339] instance has its own custom audience [2342] let's just go watch actor [2344] runs then let's create a custom audience [2347] so basically after the actor is done [2349] running then custom audience will be [2352] made the custom audience we're going to [2354] make is going to be [2357] called [2360] um the [2362] input something to do with the input [2364] anyway [2369] um let me think about this we need to [2371] get the person that we are scraping [2375] right uh how are we going to get the [2377] person that we are scraping is the [2379] question because I'm looking here at the [2381] data that we get from the actor runs and [2382] it doesn't look like it includes the [2384] input right yeah it doesn't so we need [2387] to find a way to get the value that we [2390] provided as an input to [2392] this this username run actually maybe we [2395] do get that um why don't we just give [2398] this a try I'm just going to go back [2399] here you know I don't want to make any [2401] assumptions here why don't we just [2405] do one [2407] page let's go do you ever just [2411] Ascend and then save then what I'm going [2415] to do is I'll go over here watch actor [2417] runs what you need to do is you need to [2418] create a web hook that [2420] watches Instagram follower scraper [2425] completed the actor I'm going to want is [2426] the Instagram follower [2429] scraper I think it's this one [2432] figu then I'm going to okay this and [2435] what I just want to do is I just want to [2436] run this and then I just want to run [2438] this too so basically I just want to [2439] scrape one single page um the reason why [2442] is I just want to see if I can get the [2444] input data this is going to finish in a [2445] second when it does it's going to be [2446] green like this we're going to get the [2449] values [2451] here no I'm definitely not getting the [2454] the [2455] information I wonder if I could like [2458] get the input from somewhere else I need [2460] the input like we're going to need a [2463] way H we're going to need a way to get [2467] that [2468] information can I use the key value the [2471] the default request Q [2474] ID if I just download the output bundles [2476] is this information anywhere [2480] figu uh okay what happens if I query the [2483] request Q ID [2490] instead this like I'm just looking to [2492] see whether this data is is anywhere [2494] data set was not found that's [2496] annoying [2498] [Music] [2500] um now hold on there is a value oh there [2503] is something called input here okay so [2505] I'm going to go back and then I'm going [2507] to feed it this [2508] in data set was not found H well [2512] this makes me think that we can access [2514] this somehow we just have to find a way [2516] to access this so how do we access this [2519] um is there an API call that we can make [2522] to [2526] appify [2528] H I think so I think that's what we're [2530] going to have to do I don't see any [2531] other way I mean watch actor runs watch [2534] task runs [2536] um yeah I think we're going to have to [2538] do some appify API stuff so appify [2542] API that is a [2545] very very big icon [2547] and what we want is we want web hooks [2551] sorry uh we want uh what was it key [2555] value wrong one also wrong one this is [2559] what we want okay so get an object that [2561] contains all the details about a [2562] specific key Value Store beautiful so [2565] key-- stores store ID so I'm going to [2569] copy this I'm going to go back to make [2573] make my own HTTP call make a request [2576] then what I'm going to do is I'm just [2578] going to feed this in and the store ID [2580] that I'm going to be looking to [2581] reference is going to be this [2584] one then I'm just going to go and I'm [2586] going to get all of the API details api. [2589] ay.com it's just a get request so the [2593] authorization needs an [2595] API authorization Bearer scheme this is [2598] really annoying um API docs to be honest [2600] I thought this would be way [2603] better so authorization Bearer probably [2608] the way that um authorization works [2610] is most of the time you have [2612] authorization then you write the term [2613] bear and then you feed the API key in [2615] after so we're going to try this I'm [2617] going to go to my appify instance [2619] console just jump over to one of the API [2621] keys that I've set up I am going to add [2623] a new token we'll just call this my API [2627] key for data store [2629] stuff need a little bit better of a [2631] naming scheme I'm going to copy this one [2634] go back here and then just paste in the [2637] eror I'm just going to see what happens [2639] when I call this it's [2642] 200 [2643] okay well looks like we got some data [2645] about it we didn't get the freaking [2647] input though that's what I care [2651] about if I okay hold on is this actually [2654] the right thing I'm just going to remove [2655] this and see if I can make the call no [2657] it's an authorized I'm pretty sure this [2658] is like [2660] the the right scheme question is I'm not [2663] getting the data that I wanted from the [2664] API I thought that I would get [2667] um the store right so maybe it's the key [2671] collection in the store that I need [2673] maybe it's the the record that I need [2676] get the store update the store delete [2678] the store get list of [2680] keys get a value stored in a key Value [2683] Store under a specific [2685] key so that is what I want yeah this is [2688] the thing that I want what is the key [2690] going to be I think it's just going to [2691] be called input to be honest so let me [2693] go back [2695] here paste this in [2697] this is going to be the store ID and [2700] then the record key is going to be input [2703] Capital all right let's give this puppy [2708] run nice username okay perfect perfect [2711] so now we have everything that we [2713] need so very first thing we need to do [2716] is we need to watch the actor runs then [2720] we need to make a [2721] request get input account or get [2727] follower uh Jesus get get account name I [2731] think right after we get the account [2733] name we're going to create a custom [2734] audience we're just going to call the [2736] custom [2737] audience the account name it's going to [2739] be called [2741] username and then I'll just say scraped [2743] from [2747] appify using usernames followers just [2751] for [2751] convenience we're then going to feed [2753] this into get data set items fantastic [2757] get data set items is going to extract [2761] the data set [2762] ID [2764] from default data set ID which is from [2767] the actor run that just finished I'm [2769] going to set the limit to 10,000 with no [2772] offset we're then going to filter and [2774] extract the names using [2777] AI if the name exists in a database we [2781] are not going to continue but if it is [2784] new then we are going to continue and [2787] then at the end of it we will add the [2788] user to a custom audience what audience [2791] the custom audience that we created in [2792] the previous flow here which we will get [2795] using the custom audience [2796] ID here we will put in the gender [2799] information the first name and the last [2801] name [2802] information and then that is the flow [2805] from start to finish with all of that [2808] said let's see how this works and [2811] 10 let us go back to our appify flow and [2816] and scrape do you ever just [2818] Ascend let's do 10 [2820] pages um let's do eight pages we'll do [2823] 12 per page so 96 is total then save and [2827] start this is going to take me a little [2829] bit longer because you know obviously we [2831] have to wait until it's done um but I [2834] think that this end to end test is worth [2835] it just for us to figure out whether or [2837] not this puppy this puppy whether or not [2839] this thing actually works you ever just [2842] like get in the habit of saying the same [2843] word over and over and over again and [2845] then just becomes like a crutch that you [2846] lean on that's basically me okay so we [2849] got a bunch of the data now [2851] perfect beautiful beautiful Murdoch is [2856] everywhere you'll see here that we do [2858] get a username and a full name column [2860] and I'm only feeding in one I [2862] believe so that's something to consider [2864] I should probably feed in both not just [2865] the username right right obviously I'm [2867] going to have a higher um throughput [2869] that way anyway it's still working which [2871] is [2873] cool I'm going to go back to my little [2876] database here [2879] actually we need to update this column [2880] we don't need this and then we [2882] also also instead of this column what I [2885] want is I want the user that I did the [2886] scraping [2887] from anyway I'm just going to wait for [2889] this to [2891] finish actually I'm not going to wait [2892] for this to finish that'd be useless I'm [2895] going to stop this I'm going to go back [2896] over here and then first thing I'm going [2899] to do is I'm just going to say um [2902] account username no account scraped from [2907] going to delete all these go back here [2910] what I'm going to [2911] do is instead of app uid it is now [2914] account scrape from I'm going to go back [2915] here and I'm going to grab do you ever [2917] just Ascend [2918] here [2923] nice um and [2926] then there's one check that I have to do [2929] I think it's in the sorry it's in the [2930] Google sheet because I run a search [2932] that's actually using the app ID so [2935] count scraped from [2937] should [2938] equal actually no we're just not going [2940] to have any account script from we are [2942] going to have is we are going to have [2942] the [2944] gender uh just in case okay great that [2948] is good now [2950] wonderful okay okay okay let's run this [2953] one more time let's go back to [2956] appify run this one more [2958] time and while that is running let's go [2961] to our sheet and let's just delete 99 of [2964] the 99% of these records I'm just going [2965] to leave the Henry one in there [2967] here uh we're going to say figu iio just [2971] because I I don't want to have to update [2973] the formatting if you don't have a [2974] record here when make puts in the first [2977] request it's going to um just copy like [2979] the weird green stuff here uh but still [2982] should be [2982] fine cool cool cool cool and that way we [2985] have basically everything we need we [2986] have an ongoing record of every account [2988] that we've scraped as well as the [2990] account that it was scraped from which [2991] is valuable um and then we also have the [2994] data put directly into the Facebook [2996] custom audience too I've connected the [2998] Facebook custom audience obviously um in [3001] order to do this on your end you're [3002] going to have to do like the connection [3003] itself connection is not super difficult [3005] you just need to sign into your Facebook [3006] account um if you are working with a [3008] client you may not necessarily have [3010] access to this but this is okay um if [3012] you can't do this you could also do my [3013] other approach which would be just going [3016] through this sheet and then grabbing all [3018] of the people for a specific username [3020] once you have all the people for a [3021] specific username just um you know [3023] export that sub selection into a sheet [3025] and then you're good to go [3028] okay we now see that that is running [3030] beautiful this looks great that's [3031] basically exactly what I [3034] wanted and these three data points look [3036] more than [3038] sufficient cool so I'm just going to [3040] leave that running but um yeah that is [3041] the Facebook custom audience scraper in [3043] a nutshell uh basically what we are [3045] doing is we are adding fuel to the fire [3047] of an otherwise reasonably successful [3048] approach which is building custom [3049] audiences we are sourcing data from [3051] Instagram and through sourcing data from [3053] Instagram we're getting first names last [3055] names and then like kind of expected [3058] genders of the people those three data [3060] data points are then fed into Facebook [3061] Facebook finds the profile of the person [3063] that we are referring to just because it [3065] has access to so goddamn much data that [3067] it can and then uh you know we basically [3070] give this to whoever the ads manager is [3072] and then the ads manager can use this to [3073] create lookalike audiences where they [3075] target people that just have the same [3076] qualities or they Market to this [3078] specific group of people so in that way [3080] you can show ads to hyperfine tuned [3082] groups and then showing ads to these [3084] hyperfine tuned groups you can obviously [3086] make your campaigns work a lot better [3087] for you hope you guys appreciate the [3088] video had a lot of fun putting that [3089] together if you have any questions about [3091] this feel free to let me know you can [3092] find the blueprint down below and if you [3094] have any other user requests uh sorry [3096] fan requests that you guys would like me [3097] to put together then please let me know [3099] if it's a good system it's one that I [3100] haven't built before I'll absolutely [3101] build it live I really enjoy doing these [3103] and they're very straightforward content [3104] production methods for me as well please [3107] like subscribe do all that fun stuff [3108] I'll catch you on the next video cheers

Title: The Search Intent Email Scraping System (+15% Reply Rates)
[0] hey everybody got a hell of an email [1] scraping system I'll be building [2] alongside you today we're going to take [4] the same approach that most people use [5] to get emails and then we're going to [7] pour gasoline on it with something that [9] I call search intent if you guys want to [10] see me put together a system that can [12] routinely deliver reply rates of 15% or [14] more on your cold email campaign then [16] this is a video for you stay tuned let's [17] get into it all right I'm going to show [18] you guys me building this system out in [20] a second but just before I do you should [21] know that I haven't actually built this [23] yet my whole idea in doing these sorts [25] of videos is to build things live in [27] front of you and to Showcase a raw [29] development proc process so you guys can [31] see what actual automations look like [33] when you're putting them together I [35] think a lot of people on YouTube will [36] just show you the finished product and [38] the finished product can be really sexy [39] but I'd prefer to give you guys a [41] realistic take on how this sort of thing [43] works I'd prefer to narrate my thoughts [45] at every step um and realistically like [48] you know if I were an engineer trying to [49] learn how to design a car or a building [51] and you just showed me a picture of said [53] car or building and said okay great now [55] you know everything you need to rebuild [56] it right odds are you wouldn't really [58] have any idea where to start so so the [60] purpose of these videos is to give you [61] that place to start so with that out of [63] the way let's actually get into um you [65] know some of the scoping that I've done [67] for the system essentially the way that [69] this is going to work and I'm going to [70] be calling this a search intent campaign [72] maybe somebody has already coined this [74] um this is blowing up right now in the [75] cold email space but essentially the way [77] that this search intent campaign is [79] going to work is we're going to scrape [81] people looking to hire for a role okay [83] and that's really sort of what all this [85] relies on we're going to scrape people [87] looking to hire for a role then when we [91] find that job post we're going to email [92] them with an offer that solves the needs [95] that they're hiring for but does it [97] without having them hire us and we're [100] going to do it cheaper better and faster [103] than the thing that they're hiring for [105] so for instance you could do this for [106] basically anything we're going to do [107] this for sales but let's say somebody's [108] hiring a business development [109] representative and the whole idea behind [111] hiring a business development [112] representative is to develop the [114] business right it's to reach out to [115] people and make connections and you know [118] uh increase their lead volume and stuff [120] like that well what if we could solve [121] that exact same problem just without [123] actually putting a human being inside of [125] their business what if we could build [126] let's say cold email systems to get the [129] same outcome and then we offer it for [131] maybe half or maybe a third of the price [132] that they would have had to pay had they [134] actually hired a real person this is [135] sort of the the whole Crux of how this [137] system works you can apply this to [138] anything you can apply this to people [140] looking for op operations fractional [142] automations um you know accounting [145] bookkeeping some SAS product thing like [147] anything under the sun you can take the [149] same approach to do really well with and [151] this is just absolutely obliterating it [153] in cold emo right now so I'm gonna pour [155] some gasoline on the fire typically you [158] know the systems or the the cold emo [159] campaigns that sell the best are ones [160] that sell some level of growth because [163] selling revenue is just inherently [165] attractive B2B um because then people [168] that are buying this Revenue they just [169] get to do this little cost calculation [171] they're like how much money am I [172] spending how much money am I getting I [173] might spend $2,000 a month on the system [175] if I get $10,000 a month on the system [177] fantastic this is great I'm I'm happy to [179] keep spending this forever this doesn't [181] really apply for stuff like like savings [184] because you can only ever save 100% of [185] your income whereas you can make like a [187] million times your income theoretically [188] this doesn't really apply for like admin [190] as much bookkeeping and stuff like that [192] so we're going to pour gasoline on the [193] firework we're going to look [194] specifically for people that are looking [196] to hire for a sales role so Business [198] Development Representatives outside [200] sales people that sort of stuff and [201] we're going to come up with these [202] keywords later okay so in terms of how [203] this is actually going to look or how I [205] think it is going to look we're going to [206] start by scraping um job listings that's [208] number one from the job listings we're [210] going to see if we can get some decision [212] maker contact info so first name last [214] name email address that sort of stuff [216] we're then going to Google or try to uh [219] look up first name last name and company [221] name and maybe news or something to get [223] some decision maker info then we're [225] going to take this info we're actually [226] going to try and personalize it this is [227] going to make our emails a lot more [228] powerful and then finally we're going to [230] add it to instantly or smartly let's [231] break down every single one of these [232] steps and um let me just kind of run you [235] through what I'm thinking and then we're [236] actually going to go and we're going to [237] look for solutions for this and then if [238] it works we'll stick with it if not we [240] pivot and move on so to scrape job [242] listings um basically if you think about [244] it there's a variety of uh websites out [247] there like LinkedIn jobs for [249] instance that just compile giant lists [252] of people that are looking for specific [254] um needs so maybe maybe sales executive [258] is probably a better term so you know [262] this is a company New Directions LTD [264] that literally has a need and they are [267] advertising this need they're [268] advertising their their intent to have [270] this need fulfilled this is money just [273] on the table waiting for you to reach [274] out and grab it so LinkedIn jobs is One [277] Source you could use indeed as well [279] that's another source um if I type sales [282] executive and I just Ty find the jobs [285] same thing here B2B outside sales exact [287] this is perfect this is exactly what we [288] like because um outside sales means that [290] they need to come up with their own [291] leads and this is a great way to do so [294] you know 100,000 115,000 whatever [296] imagine if you could offer twice the [298] results of one of these sales Executives [301] for 60 or 70k a year instead or if you [303] could solve one important very very [306] integral part of this which is a lead [307] generation for $20,000 a year or [310] something right so anyway we're going to [312] we're going to start by looking on [313] platforms like this to see if we can get [315] this data and the way that I'm thinking [317] of doing this is I'm thinking of using [319] appify in case you haven't heard me talk [321] about this before and this is [322] essentially just a Marketplace for [324] scrapers there are people that develop [325] scrapers they put them online and they [327] charge you small amounts of money for it [329] so if I type LinkedIn job [332] scraper there variety of people that [333] have already come up with job scraper [336] for [337] LinkedIn and I don't know which one [339] we're going to choose I've experimented [340] with a couple of [341] these um we can also do Indeed job [344] scraper be job scraper maybe I'll just [346] type in indeed yeah indeed [349] scraper um and that might work as well U [351] basically in order for the rest of this [353] flow to function as simply as I'm as I'm [355] putting it here um basically what I need [356] is I I need some way to get the website [358] right that's kind of like the big [360] problem here um so I need to I need to [362] see if I can get the [365] website if I can get the website should [367] be pretty easy why well in order to get [371] the decisionmaker contact info all I [372] have to do is I have to use a service [374] like an email finder service where I can [376] pump in a name and then a company URL [379] and then get get the email so one's [381] called any mail finder this is [382] personally what I've been [383] using and I don't know if I have any [385] credits um but uh yeah I'm probably not [388] on this account but essentially what [390] I've done here is I just typed in left [391] click which is my own website okay and [394] then I typed in my first and last name [397] and then it found me it said I'm the CEO [398] of left click and here's my email so [400] feel free to send me all the fishing [401] attempts and spam you want um so what we [404] can do is kind of logically is if we [405] feed in a company name and I don't know [409] what this company name would be but I'm [410] just you know left click as the example [411] and we [413] search uh and you know we're signed up [415] to the service I'm just logged in on [417] another one so I'm going to do that [418] after I I finish all this loging [420] um then then we get a result like this [421] and from here you know we have we have a [423] company with a need then we have the [425] first name last name and email address [427] of the person who is probably in charge [430] of creating the listing or at least in [432] charge of making that listing happen the [435] benefit here is you know we get to speak [437] directly to the person that has this [439] need we get to um Pitch them and then [443] the cool part about the internet is as [446] opposed to just sending a really General [448] annoying email it's just like hey how's [450] it going I saw that you have a job post [452] up for blank what we're going to do is [454] we're actually to see if we can research [455] the decision maker I'm thinking of using [457] a service called perplexity for now if [459] you guys have heard of it it's basically [460] just um it's kind of like Google but it [462] returns uh more natural language than [464] Google I'm going to see if I could just [466] pump in something like Nick Sarai if [468] left click into Google then find a bunch [470] of information about myself then use [473] this to write a personalized email you [475] know I'm not going to say hello Peter I [477] noticed you have a job I'm going to say [479] hey Peter uh dude I was just on your [482] blog the other day and I was reading all [485] about your path um into or path from [490] medicine to Media I thought it was crazy [493] how you were in Popular Mechanics I used [495] to read that as a kid I know this is [497] super out of left field but I saw that [499] you're hiring for insert position name [501] here and I just thought I'd give you a [504] little heads up like if I compare the [505] two emails the first one being the robot [507] the robotic example and the second one [509] being the much more conversational [510] example which one do you think is more [512] likely to be opened which one do you [513] think is more likely to be responded to [515] obviously the second one because it [516] implies that we've done our research on [518] this person right who cares if it wasn't [520] written by a human we're gonna have ai [521] do all this but you know the [523] intended effect is that um it'll seem [526] extraordinarily personalized the [527] person's going to kind of stop and be [528] like wow this person really did their [529] research can be much more likely to open [531] it and that's how we're going to get [532] like the 10 15 20% reply rates and from [534] there we're going to add to instantly or [535] smart lead so this is how I'm thinking [538] it's going to work um the big kind of [540] question mark here is just the website [541] so I'm going to see how we can get the [542] website assuming we get the website [544] everything else here seems pretty [544] straightforward I probably whip this [546]  up together in like 20 minutes so [549] let's do this thing first thing I'm [550] going to do is I'm going to head over to [551] appify and I'm just going to look for [555] I'm going to open up a bunch of scrapers [556] some for [557] LinkedIn [559] jobs and then some for indeed as well [562] and I'm just going to see if I get the [565] domain name [567] website sorry I'm just command effing [572] website looks like we extract what the [575] user has chosen to share on the website [577] okay did we get the website here company [580] website that's what we care about that's [581] really what we care about so okay we [582] have an Indeed job scraper which gets [584] company website which is sweet if we get [587] this fantastic does this one get the [590] website as [591] well I'm not seeing anything does this [593] say anything about website oh here's [595] actually the fields that we get [597] application company name company URL [599] contract type [600] description not seeing a website so [605] okay [608] website company website okay looks like [610] we get this beautiful [614] website company website here okay that [617] looks pretty [619] solid [622] website no web okay this one's under [624] maintenance okay this one's under [625] maintenance cool so the one I like the [626] most so far is this one pay per result [628] just cuz it's really cheap it's a dollar [630] per thousand [631] results I do want to make sure we do get [634] a website though if we get the website [635] fantastic if we don't get the website [636] it's going to be a little bit tougher [637] but I'm going to try this one first [639] LinkedIn jobs so we're going to go over [641] here and let me just look at the [642] interface dollar per thousand results uh [645] linkton job search URLs okay yeah fair [647] enough so we need to go to [649] LinkedIn um with an incognito window [652] search with the quow filters once you're [653] done copy the full URL from the address [654] bar and paste here so I'm just going to [656] copy this now I haven't used this before [659] so [661] uh hold on that's definitely not the [663] thing that I want I want to copy the [664] link [668] address and then I want to type in sales [672] H that's weird I really can't use this [674] at [677] [Music] [679] all okay hold on one [682] sec okay anyway uh I think [687] the can I do this one more time here yes [690] I can [693] H not entirely sure how to do this uh [699] let me try here I imagine it probably [701] has to do with a [702] cookie okay so I'm just going to go [705] sales and then we're going to do I don't [707] know let's just do United States screw [709] it and then it says current job 8 I'm [712] just going to close [714] this go ID [716] keywords then origin job search p page [719] button refresh to I'm just going to [721] delete all this this to me is prob this [722] L looks like the actual URL Okay cool so [725] I don't know if this is going to work [726] but screw it we'll pump it in anyway um [728] I'm just screwing around with the [730] URL uh to to get something that's kind [732] of like this does look kind of like this [734] so okay I'm I'm going to do that and [735] then I'll say number of jobs needed 100 [737] uh yeah uh maybe we'll do 50 for now [740] screw it then I'll click save and start [743] and while this is running what I'm going [744] to do is I'm going to go into make and [747] I'm just going to set up my Watcher um [750] and then I'm going to see if I can get [751] the data from the scrape so going to go [753] to create a new scenario and then I'm [755] going to go over here and I'll type in [757] appify now in order for this to work you [759] do need to do your connection to apify [761] so you're going to need to go add you're [762] going to have to go to this URL right [764] over here grab an API key paste it in I [767] already have an API key and I've already [768] done my connection so I don't have to [769] worry about it then what we want to do [772] is you see where it says data set ID if [774] I go back to my run um we're going to [776] grab information from this hold on we [779] have an error you can't use this actor [780] for scraping less than 100 records [782] because it's not efficient all right [783] well kind of wish you guys had told me [785] about this before okay we'll do 150 [787] screw [788] it anyway um after this what you do is [791] you go to see where it says storage [793] every time there's a new run on applify [794] you get a data set ID so we just copy [797] this data set ID and then all we do is [799] we go back to our make scenario and we [800] just paste the data set ID in here and [803] basically what this get data set items [804] is going to do is this is just going to [805] get the data out of appify into into [807] make for us or rather we can just query [809] the data in make which is great um and [812] then we can get you know however many [813] records uh that that come out so I'm [816] just going to save this and why don't I [817] call this search intent scraping [820] system and then why don't I add a bunch [823] of [824] money emojis because that's sort of the [828] vibe and the energy [829] here uh and then if I go back to Output [832] you'll see this is already starting to [833] fill up which is quite nice I'm liking [835] this this is fast it's fast it's [837] easy um um and we're actually getting [841] the the real website probably like half [843] the time which is insane so we get [844] everything we need so I'm going to go [846] back over here and I'm actually just [846] going to run this now because I know [848] that this already has some data in it [849] it's sort of like a queue it gets filled [850] up pretty quick okay sweet so we have a [854] bunch of bundles in here one two three [856] four five whoa all the way up to 19 [858] fantastic this is already already [860] looking extraordinarily fruitful the [862] thing that I'm interested in is this [864] company website now unfortunately it [866] looks like some of these are recruiters [868] so I don't think this is going to work [869] if recharge recruiters so I'm not going [871] to [872] try we're looking like some of these [875] websites the ones that don't have [876] websites probably just say careers. [878] LinkedIn that's an actual company for [880] sure but it's pretty freaking [883] big uh same thing careers. [886] LinkedIn Lamborghini Newport [890] Beach that would probably [892] work it's probably H Eddie had no it's [895] way too [896] big fedd search yeah that probably work [899] Celtics okay so I mean some of these are [901] really Celtics these are really really [903] big so I don't actually know if I could [905] just run a search and say United States [907] and have this work to be [909] honest uh maybe it will who knows I mean [912] you know granted let me run this one [913] more time let's see how many results we [916] get okay we got 63 and it's still [919] running so you know what why don't we [921] try filtering this data down [924] first what I'm going to do [927] is I want to filter this into an array [931] and I I want the resulting array to only [933] include jobs with websites that I like [937] websites that aren't really really big [939] um you know smaller sort I mean I just [942] typed in sales right so I'm sort of [943] shooting myself in the foot here but but [944] smaller sorts of positions and then from [947] there you know I think I can I can kind [949] of uh I can kind of work with it and [951] I'll see so I'm just going to run a test [953] here I'm just going to pull out an array [954] aggregator what the aggregator is going [956] to do is you see how this outputs a [957] bunch of different bundles well every [959] time you up put an more than one bundle [960] in make you're basically forcing every [962] subsequent module in the scenario to run [964] that many times so this would cause my [966] scenario around 63 times what you can do [969] is you can aggregate this sort of squash [972] it turn it into an [973] array and then once it's an array you no [975] longer have to deal with that and [977] between the um thing that does the [979] multiple bundle output and then the [980] aggregator you can actually just [982] filter so what I want [985] is I want the URL not to contain [990] um LinkedIn [993] and was it just [996] LinkedIn was it just LinkedIn might have [998] just been LinkedIn yeah careers. [1000] linkedin.com so I I don't want it to [1001] contain this at all that's about [1004] it and then let me see are there any [1006] other fields that I can use that I could [1008] use to track the size of this [1014] business [1017] H company employees count probably so [1020] let's do company employees count and [1021] then let's go uh less than let's just do [1027] like I don't know 150 sounds [1033] reasonable and I'm just going to say job [1035] okay for now and we'll do some [1037] additional filtering afterwards but okay [1039] I'm going to run this and let's see the [1041] end [1042] result looks like 49 out of my 60 [1045] whatever jobs um were okay which is [1047] fantastic [1049] wow very very [1050] cool and it looks like oh you know the [1053] other thing that we need is this needs [1054] to have a website I I don't know for [1056] sure if all of these have websites I'm [1057] just going to go a company website [1058] exists as well let's do that let's test [1062] this Okay cool so two of those actually [1063] didn't have websites so if I had run [1065] this I would have ran into an issue [1066] later that's good to know so now we have [1069] our data set items pushed into an [1071] aggregator and we've determine that [1073] basically out of 60 whatever that we put [1075] in we get I don't know 47 or so the [1077] issue is a lot of these are still really [1079] big right like I don't really think I'm [1081] going to be cold emailing LG for [1083] instance so there are a few things that [1085] I can do to probably make this smaller [1086] one I could change my search term to [1087] something that is more in line with like [1089] a sales a smaller sales role so maybe [1092] instead of sales it's like sales [1094] executive or Business Development [1096] representative or whatnot um I think [1098] chat GPT might be down right now let me [1100] just double check okay no it doesn't [1102] look like it's down [1104] fantastic nice looks like they just did [1106] some update or something cool um [1109] list of [1111] sales jobs especially ones that are [1114] focused on lead [1117] genen let's see what we got here sales [1119] development representative that looks [1120] pretty big yeah this to me looks like [1123] the biggest one for [1125] sure account Executives could be another [1127] one as well if a company's hiring for [1128] account exec well no if a company's [1130] hiring for account execs they probably [1131] have substantial numbers of lead lead [1133] generation specialist so on and so forth [1136] that's fine let's try sales development [1138] representative let's pump that in um and [1139] I think the results I'm going to get are [1141] probably going to be a little bit [1143] more uh [1145] realistic sales I think it' be 20 [1150] development 20 representative this um [1153] percentage sign 20 I believe is a space [1156] not entirely [1161] sure yeah okay cool thanks Chad [1164] GPT so I'm just going to rerun this and [1167] I'm not going to like wait wait until [1169] this finishes because I want to you know [1170] still move ahead with the development I [1172] don't want to have to wait the good news [1173] is it assigns a new default data set ID [1176] every single time that the Run happens [1177] so we still have access to our data we [1178] can still sort of run our math on it the [1181] next thing I want to do is I'm I want to [1182] add a chat GPT filter really quickly and [1185] I want to do this at the very beginning [1186] the reason why is I just want to ensure [1188] that the jobs that are coming in um are [1190] jobs that are uh you know within the [1194] specifications and the confines that I'm [1196] looking for so for instance if if I go [1199] here like sales director that's a little [1201] too big for [1202] me [1204] um head of global sales a little too big [1207] for me senior sales director a little [1209] too big for me so obviously setting a [1211] job title of sales development [1213] representative is going to fix a lot of [1215] this but I still want there to be like [1216] some sort of AI filter we'll do a really [1218] fast AI filter that just checks the [1220] title of the job to make sure this is [1221] the sort of job that we're okay with so [1223] I'm just going to rename this and I'll [1224] say filter job title maybe we'll also do [1230] um a little bit of the description so [1232] let me just say filter job okay great so [1234] from the model uh I'm just going to pick [1235] something fast gp4 mini it's really fast [1238] and it's going to be pretty cheap as [1239] well then messages the way that I do my [1241] prompting is I start with a system [1243] prompt and I say somethingone like you [1244] are a helpful intelligent filtering [1247] assistant say job filtering assistant [1249] and then I'll always add a user prompt [1251] first where I give it the instructions [1253] um we are filtering for small to [1257] midsized sales development [1259] executive roles let's say we are a [1262] recruitment company filtering for okay [1266] your task is to take as input a job [1269] title and the first few words of its [1274] description and determine whether or not [1277] it is relevant to [1280] us [1284] rules allow jobs that are [1292] for lead generation sales [1296] development generation and sales [1298] development roles disallow large direct [1303] um let's [1306] say large directorial [1308] positions head of positions [1313] Etc return your answer in Json using [1317] this format [1319] we'll say um [1322] verdict then we'll [1324] go true or [1326] false okay great now I'm going to go [1329] user and what I'm going to [1331] do so I'm going to have job title and [1334] I'll go job [1336] description I'm going to feed this in in [1338] Json in order to get the AI to return me [1341] Json I just need to click advanced [1343] settings and then go down here to Json [1344] object parse Json [1346] response now if you're smart you'll real [1348] realize that this wasn't going to work [1350] cuz I have an aggregator in between the [1351] um thing that up puts multiple bundles [1353] and then the job filter so I'm actually [1354] just going to delete this I just did [1355] that really quickly to determine whether [1357] or not this is okay and then just for [1359] testing purposes I'm only going to [1360] Output five of these and I just want to [1362] see what sort of filters um you know how [1364] effective this filter is [1366] essentially so uh hold on a second job [1370] okay is there really nothing that's okay [1372] here am I being silly H let me quickly [1377] double check [1379] sorry I just need to add the job title [1382] so job poster title for job poster [1391] description is there only one [1393] description oh description text is what [1394] we want I'm just going to slice this so [1397] this only includes uh the first I don't [1401] know like 200 [1403] characters so let's do that so we'll go [1405] from zero to 200 [1409] and then I'm also just going to [1410] replace everything inside of this that [1413] has a double [1415] quote with an empty string I'm just [1419] going to do that in case there are some [1420] Json issues and I also just don't want [1422] there to be any Json issues even though [1424] I'm technically communicating with an AM [1426] model I'm pretty strict about that these [1428] days um and then why don't we just do [1430] like I don't know let's do 20 instead if [1432] there really going to be that many [1434] issues okay function replace finished [1437] with an error so it looks like there was [1438] some problem with the way that I wrote [1439] this uh let me just double check my [1442] math let's see what we got here [1446] replace [1448] slice 0 to 200 and I'm [1453] replacing this with [1457] this not sure what the issue is let me [1460] just remove the replace [1463] First Slice this with that [1466] okay run this puppy one more time [1470] function sliced finished with error [1471] invalid array [1473] oh [1477] um how do we do this [1480] um geez I'm already forgetting my my [1482] string function substring isn't yet [1484] substring my bad don't use slice use [1488] substring that's probably why replace [1490] wasn't working as well okay great so [1493] let's just check the results disallow [1495] it's going to be disallow not we don't [1497] want not Rel and we want true or false [1499] so I should have said true or false you [1501] can already see why it's important to [1503] test iteratively like [1510] this let's see true or false just these [1513] two let's rerun [1517] this and you see it's actually [1519] outputting this very quickly which I [1522] like so false good that's the format [1525] that I want false good that's the format [1526] that I want false good that's the format [1528] that I want want false go that's format [1529] that I want false okay so they're all [1531] false um was this okay would I have done [1535] the same thing project manager oh okay [1537] yeah probably all right sweet so um I [1540] think this is probably reasonable what [1541] I'm going to do is I'm just going to [1542] jump all the way back up to our LinkedIn [1544] job scraper and then I'm going to go to [1545] storage and then feed in the new default [1547] data set ID I'm just going to see how [1548] many of these now are actually okay [1552] given the [1554] parameters um with a new job search that [1556] I've provided so this one is also false [1560] this one is true so we got one out of [1563] six so [1566] far looks like most of these are being [1568] disallowed now why is [1571] that job tit there's no job title really [1575] H maybe that's an [1577] issue maybe I'm just not supplying a job [1580] title or [1582] something let me see what are my [1584] messages here yeah I'm not supplying a [1586] job title this probably is mucking up my [1588] result [1589] here um might have just not mapped the [1591] thing properly job poster [1595] title I'm just going to type in title oh [1598] yeah it's literally just called [1600] title so I must have been using the [1602] wrong [1603] field Let's test this again and let's [1606] see how many of these now are [1610] okay one out of six 2 out of six 3 out [1615] of six 4 out of six [1619] five out of six six out of six Okay cool [1622] so it looks like all the jobs that are [1623] coming in are now just exact matching [1626] sales development representative or [1628] something similar sales and Business [1630] Development this is good this is pretty [1632] much what we want um okay sweet so now [1634] that I'm done with all that silly [1635] filtering stuff we should be able to [1637] move on to the next step so now if you [1639] think about it what we need to do is we [1640] need to um enrich these companies we [1642] need to see essentially if we can get a [1644] decision maker at that business so what [1647] I'm going to do is I'm going to search [1648] by domain then I'm going to go over here [1650] to company [1654] website which was somewhere around here [1657] the category that I'm looking for is I'm [1659] looking for the CEO owner president or [1661] founder then the email verification [1663] filter I'm just going to use all found [1665] emails just so I could run this test [1666] we're just going to see out of six how [1668] many can we actually get decision makers [1671] for uh just doing some reou there and [1673] I'm just going to run this [1676] again cool so awesome looks like we are [1679] now searching for the decision Maker's [1680] email does seem to be taking its sweet [1682] ass time not going to lie I don't like [1684] how long this is requiring [1688] me let's see how things go yeah it's [1691] taking way too long so I'm now I'm [1693] thinking we're probably going have to [1694] split the system into two parts first [1695] part's going to have to send the request [1697] the second part's going to have to [1697] receive the request um I think the [1699] decision maker thing just takes a lot [1701] longer than most of the other searches [1702] so I'm just preemptively now thinking [1704] okay I'm going to open up my scenario [1706] picker and I'm just going to make like a [1708] scenario 2 um retrieve enrichment [1715] results and search for [1721] DM operation one says we actually [1725] received the email of the co-founder and [1727] CEO nice operation 2 says we also did oh [1732] sorry my bad this is the oh no this is [1734] Operation 2 huh looks like they have [1736] multiple job posts [1738] hm I don't like [1740] this you know if you think about it what [1742] are we just going to run the same search [1743] every single [1744] time so yeah we need a way now to store [1748] these and then only check yeah look we [1751] got another one from [1753] tremendous uh I mean honestly this [1755] actually looks pretty sweet like we've [1757] gotten yeah we've gotten most of these [1759] emails [1761] crazy crazy crazy but anyway I don't [1764] like how three of them were for this one [1765] guy Nicholas are tremendous as handsome [1766] as Nicholas probably is so now I'm [1768] thinking um I need a way to store these [1770] in some sheet and then check to see [1772] whether or not the person exists the [1775] company exists in the sheet if the [1776] company does exist in the sheet then I [1778] don't go and do the verification because [1780] that would just waste me a bunch of [1781] credits that I don't really need right [1783] so what I should probably do is I'm [1785] going to get the data set items I'm [1788] going to check to see if the job's okay [1789] if the job is okay I'm then going to [1790] search my sheet my [1792] database if it is not in my database [1795] I'll add it to the database and then [1796] I'll run the rest of this if it is in my [1798] database will stop right there that [1799] sounds pretty good to me so what do we [1801] need to do well we need to make a [1802] database so let's go to sheets. gooogle [1804] and I'm just going to over here to um an [1807] email address that I know is [1808] automatically connected to this create a [1811] new one we'll call this search intent [1814] scraper database I'm then going [1818] to um go back to my make scenario of [1821] which there are many then I'll click add [1822] and then I'll go Google Sheets not [1825] Google+ that is dead we'll go Google [1828] Sheets then I'm going to do two things [1831] first I'm going to search the [1833] rows looks like I'm going to have to [1835] move where the filter is unfortunately [1837] then after we're also going to um add a [1842] row so the way that the search Rose [1845] filter is going to work is I'm going to [1847] pump [1848] in the spreadsheet ID for now um you [1853] know what else I have to do I I actually [1854] have to like add a bunch of headers to [1855] the spreadsheet check it out I mean it's [1856] totally empty right now [1858] so what I should probably do is I should [1859] just dump all the data in so all of this [1861] quick little hack to do so is you just [1863] grab all of [1865] these and then you feed it into chat GPT [1868] and you say make a c make a list of CSV [1872] headers based on the key names in this [1877] Json and it's going to give me a big [1882] list just going to say comma separate [1886] them um the value here is I'm just going [1888] to paste this now [1890] into here I'm just going to remove these [1893] and then I'm going to go to data and [1894] then split text to colums awesome so now [1897] I have all the headers which is cool and [1899] because I am a sled for enter I'm going [1900] to make this enter and then I'm going to [1903] do green I like green we're in a green [1906] mood today uh great and now we have our [1908] database basically so let's go over here [1912] and then I'm going to search rows of [1915] sheet one table does contain headers [1920] and then I don't know let's just return [1922] one and let's just test this out and I [1925] just want to see this connect right [1926] requested entity was not found why this [1929] not the spreadsheet ID that I'm [1930] using oh yeah it's not actually I'm just [1934] doing this because it's a little bit [1935] faster for [1936] me now it's going to grab the sheet [1938] names so I can go sheet one then I'm [1941] going to run this and we receive only [1943] the [1945] header which is fine uh and then what we [1948] want is we want to filter we want to see [1950] whether company name is equal to company [1952] name if it is then we can we can just [1956] not run this [1957] puppy so if the company name does not [1961] exist then the number of bundles [1964] returned by this is going to be [1968] zero and then and only then are we going [1971] to proceed makes sense right we are [1973] grabbing all of the elements in this [1976] sheet all of the Row in our database [1978] that have a company name equal to that [1980] company name and then we're only [1982] proceeding if the if that operation [1985] returned nothing so assuming that it [1987] does return nothing our next step is [1989] going to be to add this um information [1993] into the sheet so I'm just going to type [1995] in search intent scraping database I'll [1998] go sheet [2001] one and then we're going to just dump [2005] all of the data that's coming in so ID [2007] track and ID ref ID link title company [2009] name blah blah blah blah blah blah [2014] blah um just dump in as much of this as [2016] humanely possible company address is [2019] just going to be street street address [2022] locality New York postal code and then [2024] the Us website it's going to be this [2025] slogan employees account there might be [2027] one issue here and that's one of these [2028] is an [2029] array uh benefits I think benefits is [2033] going to kind of be so I'm just going to [2034] join benefits with this and of space um [2038] and then is there anything else salary [2040] info yeah salary info I don't know what [2041] salary info is going to look like but [2042] I'm just going to join this the common [2045] of space as [2046] well fine it looks [2049] good um and then after assuming the job [2055] is okay no sorry we should actually do [2057] this the very beginning so just going to [2059] remake my filter now company [2062] website careers [2065] LinkedIn does not contain [2068] just going to do the same thing company [2072] website and Company employees count is [2075] less [2077] than 150 and then company what was that [2080] other filter I did company employees [2082] count company oh company website exists [2085] right there we go okay and now we can [2088] delete this filter because now this is [2090] meaningless and now we have like an [2092] operation optimized flow I [2094] think so only if it's new are we're [2096] going to continue then after we receive [2099] the email we should also update this in [2100] our database since since we are now [2101] using a database so I'm going to update [2103] a row go back over [2106] here and then I'm just going to go [2109] through the rig roll of selecting the [2110] spreadsheet again I got to say this part [2113] right here where I actually just wait [2114] for it to find the um element that is [2117] the most time intensive part of this [2118] entire process the row number here is [2120] what's going to allow us to do the [2121] update and then the only thing that [2123] we're going to want to update like we're [2124] actually going to have to update some [2125] new Fields aren't we yeah we're going to [2127] have to do some new Fields if you think [2129] about it why because um we need to store [2132] stuff so I'm actually going to add some [2134] additional fields to the right one two [2138] three let's [2140] do [2142] four five let's do um do we get the full [2147] name from any email finder when we run [2149] this sorry run this left click. [2153] a let's run this on my own data and just [2156] see [2158] they should really cach their results [2159] there's no need to like redo the whole [2161] search if they've um already had it done [2163] through their website so I think we both [2167] know I'm just curious if we get the [2169] first name and the last name if we get [2170] the first name and the last name we [2171] should create a column called first name [2173] and then another column called last name [2174] and then an email if we get just the [2176] first name or something then it's not as [2180] relevant okay result was person full [2184] name yeah so it's going to be the full [2186] name so we why don't we go [2188] person full name and [2191] then [2195] email and then job [2198] title and then LinkedIn URL I don't know [2202] like I might as well LinkedIn URL if we [2204] find it and then if you think about it [2205] the last thing we need to do is we need [2206] to store the personalization variable [2208] that we're going to be creating um [2210] that'd be useful as [2211] well yeah okay sweet so now that we have [2214] all of these fields I'm just going to go [2217] back to our Google Sheets update a row [2219] and I'm just going to refresh all the [2221] the things [2222] here and I'm just going to add all this [2224] information so full name if the found if [2226] the full name is found we'll stick it [2228] here email stick it here job title stick [2231] it here LinkedIn URL stick it here nice [2234] looks good we're only going to [2236] proceed if email [2240] exists beautiful we now have a [2243] self-regulating system that should not [2245] get the same person twice to test this [2249] out why don't we add five and run [2253] this uh looks like none of these were [2255] within our specs which is annoying so [2257] why don't we do [2260] 10 cool now it's going through the whole [2262] process it's enriching it's updating the [2264] row if I go back here you'll see that [2267] the first one is that website tremendous [2268] the one that um you know came up a bunch [2271] of times so it's good that this is now [2273] in our database I don't like how this is [2274] on multiple lines I'm just going to drag [2276] this and make this a little bit smaller [2278] a little bit [2279] sexier beautiful um very good very good [2284] and then looks like we had an error here [2286] why do we have an error missing value of [2288] required parameter row number oh is [2289] there an issue with the row [2292] number [2294] H I'm getting a row [2296] number from oh from search rows my bad [2299] my bad what I should have done is I [2300] should have got it from this one here at [2301] a row [2304] yeah so this is unfortunate because this [2307] screwed up we're going to have to do [2308] this again I just want to double check [2311] and make sure this can run through one [2312] whole lead without an issue so we are [2315] going to have to do the enrichment again [2316] we're going to have to waste another [2317] five credits we're going have to waste [2318] some [2319] tokens but it it worked as we see here [2322] we now have this um database system that [2325] is going through the updating and then [2327] it's populating this when it finds it [2329] very cool very cool okay so logically we [2332] don't actually have to do the update [2333] immediately what we could do instead is [2335] we could Now search for AI stuff and and [2337] then do the personalization and then add [2339] it and that way we just add them all at [2340] the same time we don't necessarily have [2341] to waste like two Ops notice how this is [2343] taking a long time um I don't like how [2346] long this is taking with any mail finder [2348] what you can do is you can send a call [2349] back URL which [2351] um makes the request evaluate instantly [2355] and then you can split your scenario in [2357] two parts and then receive the call back [2359] request in another scenario that way the [2361] primary scenario doesn't really have to [2362] waste all that time unfortunately you [2364] can't do this through um the built-in [2366] make modules what you have to do is you [2368] have to make an API call first so we're [2370] going to use this later but um I just [2372] wanted to to run you guys through I [2373] wanted to keep it simple right now cool [2375] so now that we get everything why don't [2376] we muck around with um perplexity a [2380] little I think I'm just going to try to [2381] create a chat completion first to be [2383] honest just going to give that a go and [2385] then [2387] also [2389] uh we only want man we should really be [2391] able to copy filters in Mech we can but [2394] we only want things that exist right [2399] and we want it to be here so I'm just [2402] going to delete this [2403] filer Okay cool so now I'm kind of [2406] curious about perplexity if you guys [2407] have used [2409] perplexity you know you should be able [2411] to get some pretty cool results when you [2412] build a system out like this what I'm [2413] going to do is um I'm just going to grab [2416] some my sample data I guess I got to [2417] make a connection to I don't even know [2419] how to do that we'll see um I'm going to [2420] grab some my sample data person full [2422] name job title and then the [2426] company and then I'm just going to do a [2428] couple of searches so Nicholas Braum [2431] bomb move this tab over here to make it [2433] easier for me co-founder and [2436] CEO and then why don't we do the job or [2439] the um company name which is [2443] tremendous if I search this up you see [2445] that I get a bunch of information about [2448] Nick bomb which is fantastic very very [2450] cool now why don't we take the same [2452] search query and pump it into perplexity [2457] instead and now say Nicholas bomb [2459] co-founder and Co [2462] tremendous if I run this [2466] search you'll see that we didn't just [2468] get a little write up we got everything [2471] about this guy literally everything [2473] about this guy so what I want is I want [2476] I want a way to get this information [2478] through API call if I can do this then I [2481] can customize the hell out of all of my [2483] Outreach CU basically what I do is I [2485] just feed this in [2488] you know to an API call to to gp4 and I [2492] say you know write me something super [2494] customized about uh you know that that's [2497] sort of like example and I can get all [2500] that data here right autonomy minable [2503] meetings hey man you know love what [2505] we'll love what you guys are [2506] doing are tremendous or you know love [2510] the love the no meeting Vibe love the no [2512] meeting culture I do the same thing in [2514] my own business blah blah blah that's [2516] going to be received a lot better than [2517] um just saying hey how's it going I want [2519] to sell you something so in order to do [2521] that we need a perplexity connection so [2523] I'm going to go uh sign up to perplexity [2528] here let's do [2533] this let's just jump over to my email [2538] address I'm going to grab this link go [2541] back to this other tab I'm jumping [2543] around a lot just because um I have a [2545] couple of different windows [2549] $5 month in API credits let me just see [2551] if I could use the perplexity API for [2553] free if I can use it for free then I'll [2556] just use it if I can't then I [2561] won't [2564] H perplexity bug eh [2568] fascinating interesting okay well I'm [2571] just going to try signing up for free [2573] and then if this doesn't work I will [2575] sign up for um [2579] paid okay cool let's Skip and then there [2581] has to be a way to get the API key so I [2583] usually just go here nice [2586] API set up connect a credit card St [2588] using the API awesome I don't mind doing [2589] that okay great I'm now just going to [2591] buy $3 worth of credits boy do these AI [2594] model things take forever okay so please [2596] add credits to generate on so $3 [2601] pending that's annoying would you just [2603] add the credits please I would like to [2605] utilize your API to do terrible things [2607] to [2608] people nice generate API key got an API [2612] key now and I will go back to my flow [2614] pump that in uh let me just remember [2617] what email this was because if I don't I [2619] lose [2621] track and looks like there's a bunch of [2623] these different models um which one do I [2625] want small or large I don't know let's [2628] try with small I'm just going to type in [2630] the same thing that I typed in to get [2632] this search uh sorry was it this one [2637] I I just wanted to get back to this one [2639] so Nicholas bomb co-founder and Co [2640] tremendous I'm just going to go back [2642] here feed this in rooll will be user uh [2648] I think that this is probably fine we're [2650] just going to run this and see if we can [2651] get similar levels of [2658] data Nick bomb not Nicholas bomb is the [2660] co-founder [2662] cool nice there a fair amount of data [2665] very very cool very cool cool cool cool [2668] so now we'll do research um [2673] DM I wonder if I you know what I wonder [2676] if I typed [2677] in weird [2679] quirks and then I ran this would there [2682] be a list of weird [2685] quirks H let's [2690] see yeah no no I'm not going to do that [2692] I just kind of muck up the model confuse [2694] it okay um we're going to research the [2696] decision maker and what I'm going to do [2698] now is I'm going to feed the output of [2699] This research [2700] module and I'm going to make that the [2702] input of a [2703] gp4 Icebreaker [2706] generator we're going to be [2708] generate personalization let's do [2711] personalization set Icebreaker um I have [2713] a variety of like templates available [2715] for this purpose actually so I'm just [2716] going to jump in and just copy it as [2717] opposed to like rewrite it here uh just [2718] for the purposes of brevity I don't want [2720] this to be longer video than it probably [2722] already is so uh Apollo probably I I [2727] breaker generator which one did I use [2729] recently [2731] H yeah I definitely do not want to be [2733] generating all of these completely on my [2735] own every time so I'm just going to copy [2736] this now and then just paste in the [2739] Icebreaker generator and I'm just going [2741] to call this personalization as opposed [2743] to [2746] Icebreaker and then I'm going [2749] to use GPT 40 for this coil you're [2753] intelligent helpful writing assistant [2757] write an icebreaker a oneline customized [2758] introduction for cold email campaign use [2760] the provided [2761] data from a Google search as context [2765] guidelines your tone of voice should be [2767] casual bar conversation very Spartan no [2769] fancy language look for plausible but [2770] vague connections wherever possible [2772] respond in Jason only um and the [2774] icebreak with figured i' reach out Okay [2776] cool so now we have a bunch of data what [2777] I'm going to do is I'm just GNA just [2779] going to dump this puppy in as [2782] is uh content I think yeah looks like it [2789] and then I'm I'm going to write these [2790] examples myself but I'm going [2793] to I might use a couple of these [2795] actually examples that I've written but [2796] anyway I just want to see I just want to [2798] see what it does on real data first so I [2800] put it as adjacent object [2805] um respond in Json only use this [2810] format personal [2815] personalization and the personalization [2817] with figure out Reach [2820] Out actually let's use the term ice [2823] Icebreaker as cool as personalization is [2826] I don't think it's as clear to the am [2827] model as Icebreaker [2829] so I'm using this because I saw this [2832] somewhere on one of the Kima platforms [2833] they change the variable from um [2835] Icebreaker to personalization and I [2836] don't know why um you know these AI [2838] models they understand things in when [2841] they're phrased specific ways better [2842] than others so I'm just going to call [2844] this an icebreaker and I'll keep calling [2845] this [2853] and then let me just feed in a list of [2856] example ice breakers in the body of the [2858] initial prompt as opposed to what I was [2860] doing [2865] previously what's the best this one [2867] right here [2871] no uh and this is really where [2873] copyrighting comes [2875] in hey Jamie [2885] love that you guys care about [2894] uh [2895] also believe strongly small team sizes [2912] deeply respect the mission also believe [2913] strongly in small team sizes and [2915] minimizing [2918] meetings what you talked talk about on [2922] your pod small team sizes and minimizing [2924] meetings cool so if it's like a podcast [2928] then should be fine um and then we're [2931] using new line new line here because we [2933] don't want to Output any like we want to [2935] Output formatting I guess is what I'm [2936] trying to [2938] say uh that looks good to me let's now [2941] just run it through on some actual data [2942] and let's see what sorts of examples we [2944] get um okay for the for the thing why [2947] don't we just do like um [2951] context let me just replace [2956] any new [2958] line with an space instead just in case [2964] we'll also cut down the token size and [2966] after this Icebreaker is generated why [2968] don't we actually just also add the [2971] Icebreaker I think it'll be called [2973] result. Icebreaker we'll actually add [2975] this to the personalization variable [2977] here and I'm actually just going to jump [2978] into the sheet and change this from [2979] personalization to [2983] Icebreaker now that all that's good oh [2986] you know what there's one more thing we [2987] should do we shouldn't um we shouldn't [2989] do this if [2992] the we should actually have a filter [2994] realistically where we pass it through [2996] an Amon take is this sufficient context [2997] to provide an icebreaker but I'm not [2999] going to do that right now I'm just [3000] going to say is [3001] message length [3004] uh is length of choices [3008] message greater than [3011] 150 I [3016] think why because what if I type in some [3020] person that doesn't exist let's go to [3024] perplexity and let's say instead of [3026] Nicholas bomb let's [3029] say Nick APPA appan [3032] nelli CEO of hardat Trix I just made all [3036] this [3037] up cool um how long is [3043] this uh let's just go word counter and [3045] we just paste this [3046] in 434 characters so if this is shorter [3051] than 500 [3053] characters Let's uh not proceed okay [3056] okay that seems [3058] reasonable so if it's found it'll be [3060] greater than 500 characters [3063] basically [3064] okay we should have something reasonable [3067] enough now to [3068] do the training and I'm just going to do [3071] like 20 [3072] instead actually let's do 10 with an [3074] offset of 10 that way we just process [3076] the next 10 in the [3078] list um we should now have something [3080] sufficient for me to go through and then [3082] generate my better training examples [3084] using the prompt um what I'm doing is [3086] I'm just kind of iterating through and [3087] I'm going to see what the output of the [3089] the first one is see what the output of [3090] the second one is make a couple of [3091] changes and then from there we actually [3093] have the system basically up and running [3094] ready to go all we need to do is just [3095] add the lead to instantly or smartly or [3097] whatever our cold email platform is keep [3099] in mind you don't have to you could not [3101] do that if you if you didn't want to you [3102] could just totally keep this as a Google [3104] sheet or whatever but uh yeah in our [3106] case that's what we're going to be [3108] doing okay so uh looks like out of 10 we [3113] only got three and then out of three [3117] two of them were new and then out of two [3119] we found both of the emails we did get [3122] data but it does look like as a result [3125] we did not get substantial or sufficient [3128] data in order to [3131] proceed with our run now why was that [3135] length of choices is not greater than [3136] 500 [3137] really that seems kind of weird to [3141] me isn't it let's double check so I'm [3144] just going to copy this [3146] then I'm going to paste this into my [3147] word count [3149] tool it does seem bigger than 500 maybe [3153] I'm not [3155] understanding how this is done what is [3158] the length of choices [3162] message choices message content that's [3165] probably why yeah okay okay okay I got [3169] it uh well can we run this again I don't [3174] think so no we can't so why don't we [3175] just do like [3178] 30 why don't we do offset 20 just to [3181] guarantee we have enough results we [3182] don't have to wait [3185] forever just going to go back here and [3188] we'll see that we didn't proceed with [3189] the flow for these just because it was [3191] broken [3192] right so that's unfortunate we could [3195] have actually sourced this data but [3197] that's fine I'm just going to go back to [3200] uh my flow here it's generating the [3202] Icebreaker now it's adding the [3204] information to the sheet so I'm going to [3205] go back here [3207] you can see here that the person full [3208] name's Eric but the icebreakers say hey [3210] Nick huge respect for transforming [3212] tremendous from a small gift card gig to [3213] a global player if forget to reach out [3215] right the reason why that's happening is [3216] because I actually hardcoded the uh I [3218] hardcoded the content so that's my bad [3221] okay so the content will actually [3225] be from any mail finder um this person's [3229] name this person's job [3231] title and then we need the company name [3233] as well [3236] so company name so Nicholas s [3240] CEO at company name that should be that [3243] should be substantial and then I'm just [3245] going to go through my sheet again I'm [3246] just going to remove a bunch of these [3247] because I I want to see this work on [3249] data that I've generated I don't want to [3252] waste it [3254] all let's just go 15 that way we're [3257] going to run on some of the old [3259] data [3261] okay oh while I'm at it I guess I could [3265] have fixed the Icebreaker but hey [3267] whatever okay so we've added the first [3269] row um freed looks good we're now doing [3272] the research looks like we made it we're [3275] now generating the [3278] Icebreaker and now we are generating the [3280] text very interesting my cousin's a [3282] clinician they always talk about the EHR [3284] grind figure I reach out so this is a [3286] lie right well I don't know like this [3288] thisal like leader cousin is actually [3289] clinician pretty damn low right so uh [3292] you know you shouldn't be lying to [3294] people on the internet as the first [3297] Contact that you fre can make with them [3298] like that would be stupid so ideally you [3300] wouldn't want to hallucinate um this is [3301] probably happening because I said look [3302] for plausible but vague connections [3304] wherever possible um and like I actually [3306] had examples and I've since removed the [3308] examples so you know it's not perfect [3312] the reason why it uh did The Annoying [3314] Thing with the figure I reach out is [3316] just because of this I'm just going to [3316] get rid of that and then why don't we [3319] just give it like a quick example so we [3322] can actually give it an example with [3323] this um the the the Ares or whatever I'm [3326] going to go [3327] through uh citation sorry I'm going to [3330] go through [3331] choices message [3334] content then I'm going to copy all of [3337] this and I'm actually going to add a new [3340] user message and then an assistant [3342] message as well what I'm going to do is [3344] I'm going to grab this little thing I'm [3345] going to drag this [3346] up above and I'll also drag this [3350] assistant message up above the user and [3353] now what I'm going to do is I'm going to [3354] feed it in some data [3357] I'm going to [3358] say [3363] context um it's going to be [3365] this I don't like all the new lines [3371] here yeah okay I'm just going to remove [3373] all this remove all this remove all [3377] this remove all [3379] this remove all this remove all [3383] this remove all this and and remove all [3387] this and then I might do some of this [3390]  go make this go away as well [3393] and then [3394] cool this does look pretty long but [3396] that's okay so this is the context [3397] variable now and then the output of this [3399] now is going to be Icebreaker and then [3402] what was the actual output of this [3405] run it's this right here right so let's [3407] use this as a beginning [3412] example and then instead of giving it a [3414] fake thing let me actually should read [3416] through their mission and let's see if [3418] we got anything cool co-founder Co freed [3420] yeah yeah Healthcare professionals key [3422] points [3425] um witnessing his wife a clinician [3427] struggle wow that's really [3429] interesting my girlfriend's going into [3432] uh she's going to become a clinician [3434] pretty [3435] quick and she complains all the time [3437] about administrative [3442] tasks okay so thereby reducing burnout [3444] improving the quality of care the [3445] company SE significant growth reaching [3447] 10 million in AR in its first year and [3448] serving over 10,000 [3450] clinicians um I'd like to [3452] see information about this [3458] person so love the mission [3466] behind also resonate deeply [3470] with the Frameworks you talk about on [3474] your blog there you go [3477] this is all you need you just need [3478] something that lightly references things [3480] that they would know that you may or may [3484] not so this is good um and then from [3487] there we are actually going to feed in [3488] the real data and we're going to ideally [3490] produce an example that's pretty similar [3491] that then we're going to update our [3492] Google sheet awesome from there we're [3494] going to go into instantly I'm just [3496] going to add a lead to a [3498] campaign um actually have to go and I [3500] have to create a connection I don't know [3501] why I don't have it on this account oh I [3503] guess I was using my other one awesome [3505] awesome let's go to campaigns here and [3508] let's [3509] see what was my most recent campaign [3512] like just kind of curious I don't even [3514] really remember what the hell I was [3515] sending let go to my uni [3518] box uh it was a podcast [3522] campaign oh oh yeah yeah [3527] wonderful wow very [3530] cool cool cool cool uh anyway I just ran [3532] a podcast campaign to try and get myself [3534] out on um various platforms and it looks [3537] like it worked reasonably well I didn't [3538] even check so let's just do test [3543] campaign and then what I want to do now [3545] is I want to get my API key so I'm going [3547] to go back here to [3548] settings Integrations API copy API key [3553] I'm going to go back to make and I'll [3558] say paste that in we're not going to add [3561] a lead to my [3563] campaign it's going to be test campaign [3565] lead email [3567] is going to be this email right here [3570] first name we're going to split the full [3573] name based off of a space and we are [3576] going to get the first result last name [3579] we're going to do the same thing for the [3581] second result the company name we are [3583] going to have [3586] through [3589] company right over here then [3592] personalization my customized [3595] message it's going to be this output [3597] right [3597] here phone uh website yeah we can [3600] definitely grab the website as you [3602] notice I'm using the same module as the [3605] source for all of my data related to [3607] this the reason why is I just want to [3609] make sure that uh you know later on if I [3611] do any sort of changes it's um it's easy [3614] and maintainable okay great so we should [3617] have basically everything we need now we [3619] now even added the lead to the campaign [3621] I'm just going to go back here and uh [3623] I'm going to delete all of this [3626] and then what I want to do is I just [3627] want to run [3629] this on like all of the data however [3631] much there is [3634] basically and I'm going to use some Ops [3636] on this for sure but I just want to I [3638] just want to see like real time this [3640] working on more than one record at a [3641] time I want to actually do an end to end [3643] test you need to do an endtoend test [3645] anytime you are putting a system like [3646] this together just because of all the [3647] moving parts and it also illustrates [3649] some edge cases that you might not have [3650] really considered so this for instance [3652] is might maybe is where I realize hm you [3654] know timeouts are going to be a concern [3656] takes me like 5 Seconds that lead [3658] instantly takes me 10 seconds here you [3660] know that's 15 seconds or a quarter of a [3661] minute so I can only do four per minute [3663] if I do 40 minute timeouts I can only do [3666] 160 before my scenario times out right [3668] you can kind of you can kind of do the [3669] math on this stuff um while this is [3673] operating why don't I go over to [3676] instantly then go to that test campaign [3678] that I just [3681] created and then why don't I just create [3683] a quick little sequence and then what [3685] I'm going to start start with is this [3687] personalization and I'm just going to [3688] say I know this is out of left field so [3693] you were [3694] hiring for a sales Dev [3698] rep I work with uh let's just do [3702] workflow Loop now let's do left [3707] click I work with left click or maybe I [3710] should [3711] say h obviously this is going to depend [3714] on the specifics of your audience [3715] specifics of your offer so don't take [3717] this all and feel free to copy and paste [3719] this as a starting point but like modify [3720] this over time um but anyway we'll have [3723] we'll have good personalization I know [3725] this is out a left field saw you hiring [3726] for sales sales [3729] um saw you were hiring for sales [3737] Dev I work with left [3741] click we add around 15,000 [3745] [Music] [3747] we add $1 [3752] 15,375 in [3754] mrr on [3756] average using personalized cold email [3760] it's the same approach I'm using to send [3762] this to you [3766] actually using hyper personalized cold [3771] email our cost is around 1/8 or maybe I [3775] should say my cost [3779] cost it's around [3783] 1/8 on your [3786] LinkedIn jobs post our cost is around [3788] 1/8 the position you list in your [3790] LinkedIn job post and I'm confident I [3792] could do I could deliver [3796] significantly better results as [3798] well oh what happened here [3812] last month I [3814] delivered last month I booked oh do I [3816] have any case studies in last month no [3819] but I'm just going to pretend that I did [3820] so last month I booked uh [3823] 27 [3827] meetings for a very similar [3832] company 27 sales meetings for a very [3838] similar company and I am so sure this [3842] would work for you I'm happy to [3848] guarantee the same [3850] result or you don't pay a [3855] scent would there be [3858] interest if [3860] so I can get [3864] on so let let me know I can chat with [3868] you as early as this afternoon or [3874] tomorrow before 2 p p.m. your time I [3877] don't know when their time [3879] is just show [3886] back number or a Google meet or a [3891] booking link [3893] cool PS [3897] it's the exact PS my my system is the [3901] exact same approach I'm using to send [3903] this to you actually thanks for the time [3906] Nick cool I'll just go like first [3919] name been [3922] using this approach to email you right [3925] now [3928] I'm actually using this I'm even using [3929] this Birch to email you right now cool [3932] let's um save this for now do we have [3935] any [3937] leads I don't like this this doesn't [3939] look very good big fan of tremendous and [3941] I'm curious how did you make the gump [3942] from gift cards to Global payouts yeah [3945] that don't look very good man let's see [3947] what other leads we [3950] have uh impressive how you turn rage [3952] hats in a 50k month gig by 16 seems like [3954] near reach was inevitable my transer [3956] physical products digital experience [3957] right with all things te Innovation yeah [3959] we clearly need to change the um the [3961] quality of these ice breakers a little [3963] bit I'm not the sort of person that [3964] would just leave it here um this would [3966] not work super well especially with [3968] those damn exclamation points man so I'm [3971] going to add some [3973] rules no exclamation [3978] points don't be overly [3982] excited uh what was the biggest most [3992] RIS let's just what was my [4003] example oh I see why [4027] okay that will probably be a little bit [4029] better it's not going to be [4031] perfect impressive big fan admire I like [4034] big fan actually big Fan's [4039] fine no questions no exclamation points [4042] no questions don't be overly excited [4046] and now that I said love twice I think [4047] it'll probably just stick with love [4050] we're going to decrease the temperature [4051] a little bit um I find that this makes [4052] it a little less super unnecessarily [4057] excited [4059] and what don't we do one more [4065] thing we need a way to determine whether [4068] or not a lead has been sent into [4069] instantly before so I should actually [4072] unlink this put this after [4076] add a new column all the way on the [4078] right and then say added to campaign [4082] question [4084] mark and then what I'll do is I'm [4086] actually going to add um a line here in [4089] added to campaign and then I will just [4091] say assuming that instantly was correct [4094] then [4097] true um that way I know that this has [4100] now been added to my instantly campaign [4101] and I'm not going off of leads that that [4104] haven't [4106] and in order for me to add this to [4109] instantly I need to just make [4110] sure that this has yet to [4116] actually technically what we should be [4118] doing actually is we should do two calls [4120] we should do one at the [4122] beginning this is annoying right because [4124] now we're spending double the OBS but [4127] technically we should go added to [4130] campaign and then only after it's added [4132] to instantly should we go true so I'm [4135] just going to going to do this for [4136] completeness sake and because um I'm [4138] happy spending the extra op to make this [4140] easy on me and to know that the system [4143] basically is just always going to work [4145] um [4146] if added to Campaign which I'm going to [4149] pull here [4151] right um what is it a [4155] AF if [4157] AF [4160] here is [4162] equal is not equal to true only if it's [4166] not equal to [4170] True are we going to [4173] continue not in campaign is equal TR so [4176] not equal to True whereas if it's true [4179] then we won't okay cool uh let me just [4182] make some names add to DB I'll [4186] say update added to campaign [4190] column that looks pretty good and then [4194] yeah I think that should be good let's [4195] um let's just delete the rest of this [4197] for [4200] now and [4202] then actually why don't we just delete [4204] these rows [4206] entirely cool let's go back to our [4209] system and just do the same thing [4212] again I have a feeling that this is the [4214] money shot and yeah the system is um [4216] just going to [4217] be just about done I'll just show you [4220] one more thing that you can [4221] do make this even cleaner [4228] nice that API call was much faster it's [4230] probably because it was already [4232] uploaded nice so this is like the [4234] perfect Icebreaker by the way impressed [4236] by how X happened this reminds me of Y [4238] very very cool very [4240] cool um just because I don't like the [4243] formatting I'm just going to jump in [4245] here and I have a feeling this is [4247] probably good now I'm just going to [4248] adjust [4250] this uh like so and now we have added to [4254] campaign true why was this not added to [4256] campaign this very first one seems kind [4258] of [4259] [Music] [4261] weird we started with five we only found [4266] four okay I see we didn't add that one [4269] because we couldn't find the email but [4271] it seems odd that we couldn't find the [4272] email because we found the email so many [4274] other times which makes me think that [4275] this is like non deterministic like [4277] sometimes you don't actually find the [4279] email Okay cool so anyway we um we [4282] obviously have some pretty nice we [4284] actually have some pretty pretty good uh [4287] we have some pretty good case studies [4288] here if I go over to sorry we have some [4290] pretty good campaigns here if I go back [4291] to instantly [4293] now if I refresh this let's see our [4296] leads [4300] nice if I go to the sequences here and [4304] then I [4305] preview right right sorry this first [4307] lead here was the old one so let's just [4308] get rid of that [4310] one I go here now and I preview [4315] I don't like this so I'm just going to [4317] change my [4320] campaign so it's like [4329] this and this looks pretty reasonable [4332] yeah I think this is the killer line I'm [4333] even using this approach to email you [4334] right [4335] now cool cool cool um I'm going to leave [4338] it at that um if you wanted to solve the [4342] time issue okay and you definitely [4344] should should consider solving the time [4346] issue right now the scenario is going to [4348] take quite a while to finish if you want [4350] to solve the time issue what you need to [4352] do is instead of this any mail finder [4354] search for decisionmakers email you got [4356] to make an API call instead okay so [4360] search for DM [4362] email it said that you got to make an [4364] API call and what I mean by make an API [4366] call I'm just going to add this to the [4367] very end of this to show you [4369] guys is we need to go to the nemil [4372] finder API we need to call the exact [4377] endpoint uh search for an email I think [4380] this one here or decision [4385] maker finding all emails at a company I [4388] don't want all emails at a company I [4389] want the decision [4391] maker I [4393] don't remember exactly how to do [4396] this oh decision maker here we go okay [4400] so search for a decision maker um email [4402] based on company and category so what we [4404] need to do [4406] is I'm just going to click try it out no [4407] I'm going to cancel this uh I'm going to [4409] copy oh that's really annoying oh okay [4411] no I can copy okay cool I can copy it so [4414] I'm going to copy this string here then [4415] I'm going to go back to our scenario and [4417] I'm just going to paste this in this is [4419] calls the exact same endpoint then I'm [4422] just going to do the same call and the [4424] way that this call needs to happen it [4426] looks like is we need to feed in um this [4429] needs to be a post request so [4431] post so I'm going to go to get post [4435] and then we have to feed in a domain [4438] with a decision maker [4441] category so decision maker [4445] category we're going to go down to [4448] body and then I'm going to feed in sorry [4451] let me let me try it [4456] out yeah looks like we can actually [4458] change the text here um I'm just going [4460] to paste this in company name will be [4464] the same company name that I was using [4465] for this sorry it's not going to be [4467] company name it's going to be domain my [4469] bad so we'll go domain will be this [4472] decision maker category and I just need [4474] to check to see excuse me um I need to [4476] check to see what these decision Mak [4478] maker categories [4479] are so what are these categories [4482] man [4484] um just going type [4489] category is that really it they don't [4491] even give you the freaking category [4493] that's really stupid oh that's so dumb [4497] oh that's so [4498] stupid well we do need to find out this [4501] category regardless the fact that they [4505] don't doesn't really matter to [4508] me oh you know what I know how we can do [4510] this let's go back to our API call sorry [4512] let's go back to this and let's just see [4514] this [4515] category okay I'm going [4519] to [4521] uh just try this CEO oh owner president [4527] and founder we're going to try this [4528] we're actually just going to try [4529] hardcoding this we're going to see how [4530] this [4532] goes I'm going to save this run this [4534] module only and I'm going to go left [4536] click. let's see if this is correct oh [4539] nice it even tells us okay valid [4541] decisionmaker category except values or [4542] CEO cool so that's what I want I [4545] want [4546] CEO now we're going to run this test on [4549] left click. [4550] a just validate that the API call works [4553] first [4555] and I think it does taking its sweet ass [4557] time nice I got the info and then now [4560] all we need to do is we just need to [4562] change um one parameter here we need to [4564] change the [4566] header and the header needs to go I [4568] think X web hook URL and what I'm going [4572] to do is I'm just going to [4574] send the result of this request over to [4578] a service that I designate so this is [4579] one that I have right over here so I'm [4581] going to this is just a web hook service [4583] that essentially allows you to create [4584] sorry uh create a web hook and then send [4587] things to that web hook and then just [4588] see it in your browser as supposed to [4590] have to go through the whole rig roll of [4591] make there are variety of these services [4593] this one is just called um web hook. [4595] site so all I'm going to do is I'm just [4597] going to copy my web hook address and go [4599] back over here I'm going to paste this [4601] in and I want you guys to see what the [4602] difference is between the API call [4604] before and then [4606] after before took a fair amount of time [4609] right after it was basically instant and [4611] then now it returns a result called Web [4613] hook URL if I go to my web hook you see [4616] we actually just received something we [4617] received the same data that we were [4619] getting before so basically what this [4621] means is instead of you having to wait 5 [4623] seconds for the result what you can do [4624] is you can just send it to n Mail finder [4626] cue it and then cach it and then send it [4628] to another thing when it's done um in [4630] this way you don't have to wait God [4632] knows how long for it to finish you can [4634] proceed with the rest of your flow you [4635] can bulk process and basically operate [4637] in a lot more than you could before so [4639] in order to make this work what You' [4641] basically have to do is you'd have to [4642] split this up into two parts you would [4644] have to make the end of this this API [4646] call and then you'd have to have a web [4649] hook on this [4654] side that watches for [4656] this so I'd go example any mail finder [4660] web hook call [4662] back then we have to copy this address [4665] the clipboard and then going have to go [4668] right [4670] here and then this would have to be the [4672] call back URL make sense [4675] now in addition what you can do with [4677] anyil founder is you can actually send [4679] other fields alongside the fields that [4680] you want so um this is going to send the [4683] input and the email address right you [4685] can actually send other fields to the [4688] Callback so that you can like keep data [4690] within your system so in our case what [4692] we're going to need to do if you think [4693] about it is we're going to we're going [4694] to need to keep uh some of the data in [4696] our system specifically we're going to [4697] have to keep the row number of the thing [4699] that we're updating so I'm going to grab [4701] the row number basically to see if [4704] there's any other data I'm going to need [4705] I don't think so I'm going to add the [4707] row number I'm feed in this I'm going to [4712] click on that and now I'm going to go [4714] into my other make scenario I'm going to [4716] run this as a test going to run this [4719] I'll go left click and then I'll go [4722] to we instantly received a result on our [4726] first scenario on our second scenario [4727] we're just waiting and you see the input [4730] we got the row number what this means [4732] now is we can effectively get rid of [4735] this although keep in mind when I get [4736] rid of this the scenario is going to [4737] break so why don't I first um just make [4742] this let me see I'm going to copy this [4746] can I delete this and then paste this [4747] again yes I can so I'm going to export [4750] this blueprint first just as like the [4751] single [4752] system and [4756] then send to any email finder scrape and [4760] send to n email finder um and then what [4763] I'm going to do is I'm just going to [4763] unlink these [4766] feed in our new search for DM email [4772] module and then I just have to go [4774] through basically and I just have to [4775] replace the results from this in order [4778] for this to work I actually need to run [4779] it unfortunately on real data again so [4782] I'm going to do that one more time and [4785] then um I'm going to disconnect this and [4788] basically what I need to do is I just [4789] need to attach all of this to my web [4791] hook over here and then I need to remap [4794] all this Fields [4798] right oh and there's one more thing I [4800] have to do I have to um actually I guess [4802] I could put in the full name the job [4804] title and the company name as well we [4806] should get that in the web hook anything [4807] else that I need I don't think [4810] so going to feed that in no I think I [4813] think we'll be okay okay so awesome we [4815] just fed that in I'm just going to go in [4816] here and replace this with full name job [4819] title oh yeah the company name we [4821] we need to pass in the company name too [4824] so I'll [4825] go company name and it'll be uh whatever [4830] the company name is [4833] here awesome um and now over here we're [4836] going to have access to a company name [4837] variable so I can actually just go [4841] one. Um input. company name like [4847] this and then let me just check to see [4850] these so if the result email exists uh [4853] then we can continue so we'll go if [4855] email exists [4856] wonderful and then [4860] if length greater than 500 we'll go here [4863] why is that so long generate the r [4866] breaker then we'll add to the database [4867] what we need is we need the row number [4869] which we'll grab from [4870] here still seeing an error here let me [4873] just see why oh right so we need to map [4875] all the data uh so full name email job [4881] title LinkedIn URL Icebreaker will be [4885] this result it'll be result. Icebreaker [4887] if you think about [4889] it and then not in campaign we'll check [4893] to see if [4897] uh oh yeah I guess we need to check if [4899] it's not in campaign too uh oh one more [4901] thing we have to [4902] send let's do campaign [4906] status and then we're going to go all [4908] the way down here just pump in [4910] af there we [4912] go let me just check to see if syntax [4915] right did I put a comma there yes I did [4917] which means now we'll be able to go one [4919] input campaign status so this not equal [4922] to True good then we send the instantly [4925] request the lead email is going to be [4928] this email person full name is going to [4931] be uh this right here just going to copy [4935] this and then paste this in here company [4938] name is going to be didn't we just get [4941] the company name a second ago uh yeah we [4943] did so I just copy that from [4946] here feed that in there this is going to [4950] be three result [4952] Icebreaker then the website uh is just [4955] going to be this domain so we are going [4957] to have to switch that up and then added [4959] to campaign column it's going to be easy [4961] we're just going to go grab the row [4962] number and then all the way down here [4963] it's going to say true cool so I [4966] understand that that was kind of [4966] annoying to do this level of level of [4968] administrative work essentially at the [4970] very end um but if you wanted the system [4971] to be scalable like I do then you [4973] basically need this [4975] cool so let's actually run this one [4977] final [4978] time um before we oh actually there's [4981] one more thing I'm going to do why don't [4982] I actually hook this up to a watch actor [4984] runs module instead of a get jobs module [4986] this way this is going to be a dynamic [4989] I'm just going to move data set ID and [4990] I'll add default data set ID here [4993] instead that way um we can create a web [4996] hook LinkedIn job scraper [4999] completed and then I'm just going to go [5001] over [5002] here then select link [5005] job scraper I think it's paper result [5007] right which one was [5011] this H job scraper PPR uh Curious coder [5016] I think so what's Curious [5020] coder I think it's this one we're going [5023] to cross our [5024] fingers all right cool so now what's [5027] going to happen is I'm going to go over [5029] here and I'm going to run 100 [5032] jobs save and start I'm I'm going to go [5035] to my database and then why don't I keep [5037] in the tremendous one just so we could [5039] see how this works on data that is mixed [5041] and blended it has some entries that we [5044] know and then some entries that we [5046] don't and then [5049] uh over here sorry wrong one over here [5054] I'm going [5056] to zoom out a little [5059] bit well actually let me run this once [5067] yeah let me just run this once um and [5069] this is going to run like once per call [5073] right so I can't have this run on all [5074] the data with a single um run example in [5077] make like this but we are going to get [5078] to see it transmit like one result which [5081] is nice and I think that'll be all that [5083] we need for proof that this puppy does [5084] actually [5086] work okay so I am seeing that there are [5089] a bunch of failures uh H I wonder [5092] why I think this might just be like [5094] running out of its proxy or something I [5098] I don't know but this is something on [5100] the scraper end not on my end so all my [5102] logic is fine looks like this just is [5104] probably doing requests a little bit too [5105] fast which is why it keeps on getting 42 [5108] KN um you know we're going to pump [5111] through 100 jobs so I don't know how [5112] many of these 100 jobs we're actually [5113] going to finish but we'll see U for the [5116] purposes of time I'm just going to skip [5117] until the job scraper is done running [5119] and then I'll show you guys the run as [5121] it populates make okay data is coming in [5123] and as you can see see this is much much [5125] faster than before on the back end we [5128] just received one request and we pumped [5130] through it from start to finish if I [5132] wanted to do more then I just click run [5134] and then I just basically cycle through [5136] all of the data in the sheet if we go to [5138] our spreadsheet you can see that we've [5140] now added basically everything we need [5143] well I mean we've only added one result [5144] right because these other three I would [5145] have needed to run this another three [5147] times um but essentially you know as [5148] long as you as long as you turn this on [5151] so that it's on and it processes all of [5153] the old data it's just going to create [5155] um a scenario for each and yeah we have [5158] the person full name email job title [5160] whatever and then most importantly we [5161] have a really cool um email Icebreaker [5164] and then if we go over to instantly [5165] you'll see that we also have all of [5167] their information um inside of this [5169] called email platform if we had started [5171] this campaign then these would have [5172] automatically been queued up and they [5173] would have been sending cool so I know [5175] this is quite the long video but I had a [5177] lot of fun putting this together and I'm [5178] glad that we managed to make the [5179] perplexity API work for us we also [5180] managed to make the Emil finder API work [5182] for us and I think you guys got to see [5184] what an actual development process looks [5186] like when you don't know for sure how [5188] all of these things are going to connect [5189] together you just sort of have a rough [5190] idea I find in practice that rough idea [5193] that is your single highest Roi skill as [5195] somebody that's an automation developer [5197] or an automation engineer as long as you [5199] can zoom out a little bit and say well [5202] if we can do this then we should be able [5203] to do this and then if we can do that we [5205] should be able to do that you're you're [5207] basically golden the actual [5208] implementation of it a lot of the time [5210] is less of a question of knowing how to [5212] interact with every piece of technology [5214] or API and more just do I know where I [5216] can find this information because I will [5218] use this information but only when I [5220] actually need it if you guys have [5222] questions or comments on this feel free [5224] to leave them down below I also take [5225] most of my requests now from my audience [5227] so I'd really appreciate it if you had a [5229] system idea that you wanted me to do uh [5232] then also leave it below and if it's a [5233] good one that I haven't done for I'll [5234] absolutely add it to my queue thanks so [5237] much for the time looking forward to the [5238] next one cheers

Title: 7 No BS Ways to Become More Productive in 2025 (+$129K/mo)
[0] hey my name is Nick SAR I made [2] $129,000 last month as a solo preneur [4] and in doing so I had to learn a thing [6] or two about how to be productive [7] without tearing my hair out I think that [9] the vast majority of videos on this [10] topic are trash I think that in general [12] there are a lot of productivity gurus [13] that don't really know what they're [15] talking about or that haven't actually [16] converted that productivity to some sort [17] of real world metric like money but I uh [20] am going to be contributing to this [21] dumpster fire today because I have a [23] couple of productivity strategies that I [25] don't think you've ever heard of before [26] and I wanted to put them in front of you [27] so if you guys want to learn how to be [30] productive to the point where you can [30] make about six figures monthly then this [32] is the video for you stay tuned let's [34] get into it so my problem with the vast [35] majority of productivity content on the [36] internet um sort of falls into one of [38] two bins it's that it's either super [40] superficial and it's just so vague and [43] general and obvious that everybody knows [45] it anyway the problem in productivity [46] isn't knowing it's actually doing [48] stuff with it or it's way too specific [51] so it solves a very specific problem for [53] one person or maybe some specific [54] subtype of people maybe night owls or or [57] something um and as such it's not [58] generalizable to the majority of viewers [60] the productivity techniques that I [62] personally use do not fall into either [64] of these two bins I me as I mentioned [65] previously they're new you most likely [66] haven't heard of most of them just [68] before I share those with you I just [70] wanted to cover um sort of my hot take [71] here my hot take is that there is no [73] such thing as an average level of [75] productivity on planet Earth essentially [78] uh the people that are productive in [79] life tend to be extraordinarily [80] productive and then everyone else is [82] just not very productive at all I firmly [84] believe that the small percentage of [86] people that are actually productive at [87]  are responsible for most the output [89] in the world world so this means big [91] companies uh major advancements large [93] social movements the vast majority of [95] content on the internet and so on and so [97] forth so you know I'm going to share [99] these seven nobs productivity tips and [100] models that actually work with you in a [102] second I've used them with over a [103] thousand community members to date I [105] actually bake this into uh my automation [108] uh agency program maker school where I [110] get people to show up I get people to [112] commit I get people to employ a lot of [113] the techniques that I talk about um but [116] you know if you disagree with me if you [117] think these are superficial or they they [118] solve a super specific problem or maybe [120] they just aren't really actionable then [121] please let me know I want to hear about [123] it because you know iron sharpens iron [125] but anyway I'm just going to give you [126] guys what's worked for me and we'll sort [128] of take it from there so the very first [131] thing I want to talk about just in [132] general is environment design and this [135] is by far the most important [137] productivity technique on this whole [139] list I believe very strongly in [141] environment design and it's at the core [143] of essentially everything else that I do [146] what is environment design what do I [147] mean by this and how can you actually [149] use it in your life well the way that I [151] see things is that humans as amazing as [153] we are we have television and porno and [156] Cheetos we are animals okay we often [159] forget this thanks to the wonders of [161] civilization but in reality just like [163] animals we respond to very simple [165] environmental constraints and in general [167] I want you to think about it like this [168] the things that are easy to do in your [170] life tend to get done more often and the [173] things that are hard to do in your life [175] tend to get done way less often not [178] exactly rocket science but you know we [180] think about this in the context of [181] animals very few people think about it [183] in the context of their own life so I [186] have an example for you over here and [187] I'm just going to use this new tablet [189] that I bought because I kind of want to [189] show it off and let's say you have a cat [193] okay we're going to call this cat [198] whiskers I don't actually know how to [199] draw [201] cats okay how's that for cat pretty cute [203] huh and there there's sort of two [206] possible universes here okay there's [209] Universe a and then there's Universe B [211] and in Universe a when you leave when [214] you feed whiskers the cat okay you you [218] in your little bowl or cup or whatever [220] you put in 100 gram of little Kibbles [224] and that's it and that's like the daily [226] recommended amount that you should be [227] feeding whiskers uh the veterinarian [230] gave it to you or whatever and you give [231] him 100 grams of Kibbles okay in [233] Universe B you give whiskers 500 grams [237] of Kibbles [240] so you know the cup overfloweth there's [243] Kibbles freaking everywhere and whiskers [245] is just the happiest cat on planet Earth [247] or maybe not necessarily actually [248] because I don't know if cats really like [250] kibble as much as they like wet food and [251] stuff but conversation for another day [253] you'll have to talk to my mom about it [255] okay uh given these two universes [257] Universe a and universe B in which [261] Universe do you think uh whiskers will [263] way [264] more probably Universe B right so that [268] therein illustrates my point it it is [269] easier for whiskers to eat food [271] therefore if you just zoom out and take [273] like a really macro approach and look at [275] it as like Universe a with 100 gr of [277] food a day versus Universe B with 500 [279] grams of food a day whiskers will weigh [281] more in Universe B we've essentially [283] illustrated The Power of our environment [284] to control um you know like the the the [287] course of the life of an [289] animal now your cat might not want to [292] gain weight you know maybe there's some [294] cool sexy cat walk competition thing I [297] don't know what I'm talking about [298] there's some cool sexy cat down at the [300] beach and they really want to show off [301] they might not want to gain that weight [303] but since the food is in front of them [304] and it's easy to consume you know [305] whiskers is eventually going to do it um [307] human beings are exactly the same as [309] that I call this friction quite often [313] and essentially anything in your life [314] that has friction in it you're going to [316] do less often than a thing in your life [318] that does does not have friction so [320] there variety of things that I can give [321] you guys as examples of ways that I've [322] eliminated this in my own life and I've [324] sort of designed my environment to be [325] easy for me but I just want I just want [328] to think about it like more generally [330] um you know we just talked about [331] whiskers and we just talked about food [332] right well the goal of this is not to be [334] a a dietary sort of thing but um what's [337] a great uh way to do some environment [339] design um you know what if there were [341] another two universes and now instead of [342] whiskers we're talking about [345] you you have a very big head [349] sorry you're very sad um and in these [352] two [354] universes A and [356] B in Universe a um you you go to IKEA or [360] whatever your local um store is and then [363] you buy plates and the plates are I [365] don't know 12 cm in diameter okay and [369] then in Universe B you buy plates that [372] are 7 cm in [375] diameter in which Universe do you think [377] you're going to you're going to eat more [378] or or weigh more probably in Universe a [381] simply because your plates are bigger so [382] on average you're going to just put a [383] tiny bit of extra food on the plate [385] right uh you can think about environment [387] design in a million ways you can think [390] about it in terms of food okay um [393] portion sizes are a good thing the food [394] that you have available to you in your [396] house if you have a giant bag of Cheetos [398] in your kitchen and you have to look at [399] it every day I freaking love Cheetos you [401] have to look at it every day when you [403] try and do anything in in those two [406] universes Universe A or B with Cheetos [408] or without Cheetos in which one do you [409] think you're going to eat more Cheetos [410] obviously the one with freaking Cheetos [411] on your kitchen counter right so just [414] remove the Cheetos and you will [415] literally by Nature eat fewer Cheetos so [418] food is a good example example of this [420] what's another good example this gym you [423] know if you want to just like talk about [424] General productivity stuff not even [425] money uh if you live in a place that has [428] a gym that is close the gym is [429] comfortable it's fun it's enjoyable it [431] always has a space available the bench [433] press is always available for usage or I [437] don't know there's just tons of hot [438] people at your gym or something you're [439] going to go to the gym more often in [441] that Universe than you will in the [443] alternative Universe where you have to [445] uh Drive 45 minutes through a freaking [447] Tundra to get to the same the same EXT [449] exercise facility right um so you know [452] food gym let's think about this a little [455] bit more pragmatically now in terms of [456] money um let's say [461] sales let's say you there are a couple [463] of different universes here in Universe [465] one you're selling to a very tough [467] audience okay and this tough audience [470] might you know make more money or [471] something like that I don't know maybe [472] they have more disposable income there's [473] a higher customer lifetime value um but [476] you know it's a tough audience right [478] they're typically quite skeptical they [479] mean and and so on and so forth and then [481] in Universe B there's uh you know an [483] audience that maybe pays a little bit [485] less money but they're super nice and [486] it's very enjoyable to jump on the phone [487] with them there's a lot of jovial [489] bantering and joking back and forth in [491] which Universe do you think you're going [492] to want to do more sales probably [493] Universe B right I'm not making any um [496] assumptions as to which universe will [498] pay you more money in this case but I am [499] making an assumption as to which type of [501] sales has more friction for you this is [503] usually the difference between inbound [504] and outbound sales by the way I bring [506] this example up in my own life because [507] prior to this I was doing a ton of like [509] part of my YouTube career I was doing a [511] ton of um outbound sales and in outbound [513] sales people tended to be just a little [514] bit more skeptical conversations were [516] just a little bit more hard and so I [518] just didn't want to do it as much now [519] that I'm doing inbound people come to me [521] people are asking me hey Nick I saw in [522] this video that you talked about X Y and [524] Z hey I love that you're doing this [525] stuff right conversations are great I [527] really enjoy it I do sales calls all the [529] freaking [530] time uh what are some other examples um [533] h i mean there are variety of them let's [535] actually cover some for my own life now [536] I'm just to be uh you know conscious of [539] time and so on and so forth so when I [542] started thinking about environment [543] design and I've already I've always [545] known a little bit about environment [546] design um for contacts I took behavioral [548] Neuroscience in University and so a big [550] chunk of my behavioral Neuroscience [552] degree was working in Labs with rats and [554] little things called Skinner boxes where [556] essentially you can have the rat press a [558] little lever to get some sort of reward [560] right in this way we are consciously [561] designing their environment but you know [563] I kind of thought back to that when I [564] was thinking you know I want to make a [565] little bit more money how can I design [567] my environment in such a way that you [568] know I will find the thing that makes me [570] the money and gives me the juice where I [571] can just press the lever all day well [572] here are a couple of quick ones so you [575] know super quick and easy lifestyle hack [577] I noticed that I would spend a lot of [579] time rolling around in bed in the [580] mornings neglecting to get up I would do [582] nothing of value here I'd literally just [583] stare at the ceiling hug my pillow uh [586] you know cuddle my giant anime wayu [588] plushy don't take me seriously please [591] but the point of making is this lost me [592] a ton of time every morning this cost me [595] at least 30 to 45 minutes a day so [598] instead of mindlessly rolling around I [601] thought to myself hm if I were a rat in [603] a cage how would I like design my [605] environment to decrease the amount of [607] time that I spend let's say in a [608] specific corner or something right how [611] would I do it what would I do well what [613] what I would do is I'd put a treat in [614] the other corner right and so what I did [616] is I I essentially did the equivalent I [617] put my computer which is infinitely more [619] engaging than staring at my ceiling or [620] cuddling my pillow just on the side of [622] my bed preloaded with a task that I [624] could start working on for tomorrow and [627] instantly literally just having the [628] computer on my bed instead of me just [630] rolling around and staring at the [631] ceiling and being like oh man I feel so [633] good right now I would roll over pick up [636] my laptop and then as I you know scratch [639] the crust off my eyes I would actually [640] have something valuable or productive uh [642] in front of me so this doesn't do a lot [645] for me because you know I'm not super [646] productive in the mornings but I do get [648] to work for an extra 30 to 45 minutes [649] every day as a result what's another [651] quick hack I found that again with the [653] rolling around um I put a giant bright [657] light that's 12,000 K next to my bed I [659] spent $200 on this thing and essentially [661] the second that I wake up I just turn [662] this on the second that that is on like [665] there's no way that I'm ever going back [667] to bed right there's no way I'm ever [668] going to clutch that pillow because this [669] thing is blasting my freaking retinas [671] like the sun that can't be healthy for [673] me actually um anyway when I wake up I [675] turn it on and just like an animal [677] respond to their environment I now wake [678] up much faster I get going quicker if [681] you could look at some like statistical [683] if you could look at some big graph of [684] my activity over time and this is like [686] my my time activity right this is I a [689] without the thing and this is Universe B [692] with the light basically the [694] distribution [695] of my time has basically shifted forward [700] you know about an hour or so which is [701] basically what I wanted um what are some [704] other things I made my workspace [705] substantially more comfortable I [706] designed my workspace so that it'd be [708] really enjoyable to sit down and work I [710] got a really comfy chair that cost me [711] like $500 freaking dollars I got uh you [714] know lights that make everything bright [716] and enjoyable I got a really nice [718] computer [720] I spent like several percentage points [722] of my net worth uh you know a year and a [724] half ago two years ago on a computer [726] that was just a ludicrous amount of [728] money why because I went to the Apple [731] Store and I pressed a few buttons and I [732] was just like so Overjoyed at how [735] quickly all of the windows loaded this [737] tiny little decrease in friction just [739] makes me enjoy working on my computer [741] more so I tend to like an animal in a [744] Skinner box or a cage or something just [746] spend more time on my computer a lot of [748] you guys area thinking Nick that sounds [750] silly these are all just like tiny [751] little stupid hacks how does this [753] actually work um that is how this works [755] by doing a bunch of these 5 10 15 20 of [758] these by by leaving out your vitamins in [760] the morning in a place where you could [761] see them to jog your brain to go and [762] grab those vitamins or uh I don't know [765] by leaving out your workout equipment on [766] your on your chair in the morning so [768] that you don't actually have to go [769] through all the friction of putting it [770] all together you'll go to the gym more [772] but by implementing all these tiny [773] little hacks you will absolutely do the [776] things that you want more often because [778] those things are easier [780] and concomly like if you think about it [782] on the inverse you can also design your [784] environment to do the things you don't [785] want to do and make those things harder [787] so if you remove the bag of Cheetos from [789] your environment if you just don't buy [791] certain types of foods that maybe you [793] you you know are bad for you but you [794] can't stop um going to at 8:30 p.m. at [797] night if you remove Instagram from your [800] phone so you're not constantly Doom [802] scrolling on it all freaking day it [804] sounds small right but if you just make [806] one of these little hacks over the [807] course of your lifetime which we're [809] talking is in you know hopefully several [811] years here no but hopefully a very long [813] time um these small little 1% changes [816] add up and at the end of it you know if [818] every single one of these changes makes [820] you 1% better and let's say you do uh I [824] don't know one tiny change every day for [826] a year then that's [828] 1.01 raised to the [831] 365 which my math ain't so [834] good but it is a lot it's 37 times [838] better at the end of the [841] year so I think you guys kind of get [843] where I'm coming from um but just zoom [845] out a little bit and look at the [846] environment as a contributor to behavior [849] I love my willpower and I think I have [851] quite strong willpower All Things [853] Considered but I know at the end of the [854] day that I am just an animal and so if I [856] make a bunch of shitty habits very easy [858] for me to do I am just much more likely [860] to do them the second that I started [861] consciously designing my environment my [863] income shot up my life enjoyment shot up [866] my personal relationships got a lot [867] better basically everything in my life [869] life improved um and I highly recommend [870] you guys give this a try as [872] well okay great the second thing I want [875] to talk about is social shame or [877] pre-commitment a lot of you are thinking [879] social shame use social shame to make [881] yourself more productive absolutely my [884] logic here is that humans are terrified [886] of Shame okay you know we involve we [889] evolved in an environment where [891] basically we had these small group sizes [893] and people that were ostracized or or [896] shamed out of their environment they [897] tended to die and so we are [899] evolutionarily motivated to be as afraid [902] of Shame as humanly possible when [904] somebody's watching us then we tend to [907] act a lot better because we're afraid of [908] said shame so a quick and easy way just [910] to make yourself by Nature substantially [912] more productive is just to give yourself [914] an audience make it so that people watch [916] you announce your goal publicly put [918] money on the line get fear of shame to [922] be part of the equation here to help you [924] get things that you want to get done I [926] know shame has negative connotations but [928] if you leverage shame right you can [929] achieve incredible things and I'll talk [931] a little bit about you know ways that [932] I've done so in a second but first I'll [934] give you three examples and this is Al [937] this also plays into what I was talking [938] about before with um you know [940] environment design so let's say you want [941] to go to the gym more right if you just [943] tell your friend to meet you at the gym [944] at 7: a.m. you are substantially more [947] likely to go to the gym that next day at [948] 7: a.m. why because in addition to the [951] gym having all these positive health [952] benefits for you and in addition to it [954] now being more enjoyable because your [955] friend's there you don't want to let [957] your friend down You Bic basically added [959] social shame to the equation if I think [962] about this like a math equation which I [964] like thinking about things as sometimes [965] so let's just create a quick little [968] productivity [973] equation okay the way that I like to see [975] things and I really need to figure out [976] how to write on this I don't like how [978] that keeps popping up is um basically [981] like if you think about productivity as [982] your output let's just say o okay so how [984] much you get done basically is a [986] direct byproduct of how how much stuff [989] you gain as a result so like how I don't [993] know how big your muscles get when you [994] go to the gym or something the perceived [995] value basically let's call this V [998] actually the value of doing the thing [1000] divided by the pain of doing the thing [1004] so um value might be how big your [1006] muscles get pain might be how annoying [1008] and how how much pain how painful it is [1010] to go to the gym and lift the weight to [1011] get you the muscle okay plus the [1015] perceived shame if you don't hold up [1017] your end of the bargain so basically if [1020] you want to increase your output you [1021] increase the value of the thing that [1023] you're doing and you'll inherently be [1024] motivated to do it you decrease the pain [1027] associated with the thing you're doing [1029] you I don't know make the gym easier for [1031] you or something you lift fewer weights [1032] I mean it'll probably get you to the gym [1033] more um or you jack up the amount of [1036] shame that you feel if you don't [1037] actually get the done basically [1039] like the stakes and so I give you guys [1041] the simple equation just to just to [1043] illustrate how I model this sort of [1045] stuff in my mind I think about a lot of [1046] these things just with like two or three [1048] term equ and I'm like okay well if I [1049] want to be more productive I need to [1051] make the thing more attractive to me I [1053] need to make it suck less I need to add [1055] some shame so uh this sort of approach [1057] here the one I just covered this is used [1059] by personal trainers all over the world [1061] right hey I'll see you at the gym at 3 [1062] p.m. tomorrow hey we have three [1063] appointments per week now it's not just [1065] a promise you're making to yourself it's [1066] a promise you're making to some random [1068] person who usually has nice abs that you [1071] don't want to [1072] disappoint so that's a small example [1074] I'll give you guys a medium-term example [1076] this is one that I personally show and [1077] talk about in my community of time and [1079] it's the uh money back uh shame thing so [1083] let's again pretend that there are these [1084] two universes okay in Universe a okay [1088] you get some client in Universe [1091] a you have no [1097] guarantee and the universe B you have [1099] some [1101] guarantee what might a guarantee be here [1104] I don't know 10 clients or your money [1105] back or something you're selling lead [1107] gen Services you're saying I will get [1108] you 10 clients or you don't pay um in [1111] which Universe do you think you're going [1112] to work harder in which one do you think [1113] you're going to be more productive is it [1114] going to be the one where you sold the [1117] thing to the customer and you have no [1118] guarantee for that product or service or [1119] do you think it's going to be the one [1120] where you sold the thing to the customer [1121] and you have a guarantee on your product [1123] or service where you told them if I [1124] don't do this then you are going to get [1126] all of your money back obviously this [1129] one okay obviously this one because now [1132] you have some incentive alignment but [1134] also there's there's a ton of Shame [1136] involved in not fulfilling your end of a [1137] promise guarantee or [1139] uh you know deal so this is used by [1142] agencies and coaches all over the world [1144] I teach people this sort of stuff [1146] because guarantees you know they they do [1148] two things one they massively improve [1150] your top of funnel conversion right [1151] because people are like five times more [1153] likely to want to give you a dollar if [1155] you tell them you will guarantee them [1156] that dollar back if they don't get the [1157] thing that they paid for uh and two if [1160] you guarantee somebody something you are [1161] actually much more likely to do a good [1163] job yourself so it's literally just a [1164] win-win for everybody I mean sure maybe [1166] not a win-win in terms of how many hours [1167] you're going to be burning the Midnight [1169] Oil but this is what you want to do [1170] right you want to grow your business [1172] probably if you're watching this video [1174] you want to scale you want to make money [1175] um that's what you do you make yourself [1177] a promise that you have to keep and then [1178] you share that promise with the rest of [1180] the [1180] world okay I'll also give you a large [1183] example here you know let's say you are [1185] Elon Musk one of the richest men in the [1186] world this is going to date my video a [1188] little bit and I was hesitant to include [1189] this in here but um you know Elon Musk [1191] during the 2024 election said he was [1194] going to back Donald Trump on live TV he [1196] shared this with literally every human [1197] being basically on planet Earth he [1199] shared it on Twitter he shared it on on [1200] a traditional news media platforms he [1202] said Donald Trump is the way to go I'm [1203] backing Donald Trump 100% Donald Trump [1205] needs to win okay now Elon Musk also if [1209] you think about it like he had an [1211] ability to improve the likelihood that [1214] Donald Trump would win he owned social [1215] media networks freaking billionaire [1218] he ran like Raffles and giveaways and [1219] stuff if there were two universes one [1221] where Elon Musk wanted Donald Trump to [1223] win but didn't promise the world that it [1225] would happen and then another where [1227] Donald Trump sorry where Elon mus wanted [1229] Donald Trump to win and then promis the [1230] world that it happen in which Universe [1232] do you think Donald Trump would be more [1233] likely to win obviously the second one [1235] right obviously the one where Elon Musk [1237] makes all these promises and sort of [1239] like uh puts all of his eggs in one [1241] basket so to speak so I say this not to [1244] make this political um I just couldn't [1245] think of another example that I think [1247] was more relevant uh on like a large [1249] billion dollar scale but I want you to [1251] know that billionaires do this sort of [1252] pre-commitment stuff all the time they [1254] basically Force themselves to get [1256] done through shame um and you know a lot [1258] of politicians and stuff like that do [1260] this as well so that's productivity [1262] technique number two essentially just um [1264] adding substantially more social shame [1265] and pre-commitment into your life I do [1267] this stuff all the time um I did this [1268] stuff uh personally when I was doing [1271] maker school I told people I was going [1272] to put a community together when I [1274] didn't tell people that I was going to [1276] put a community together I just kept on [1278] procrastinating and pushing it back and [1279] pushing it back so finally I was like [1280] all right I'm going to I'm going to do [1281] this I need to do this I know I don't [1282] want to do this but let me just start [1284] telling people I'm going to do this so I [1285] started saying in my videos I'm GNA do [1287] this and now all of a sudden it's not [1288] just a promise I made to myself being [1290] like yeah I should probably put this [1291] thing together now it's a promise I'm [1292] making everybody else which ultimately [1294] amounted me putting together quite a [1295] stellar Community but you say so [1298] myself okay number three is a concept I [1300] talked about I think uh seven or eight [1302] videos ago and it's the idea of distance [1304] versus displacement this is a big [1306] mindset shift this is one that I use all [1308] the time now I'm just going to scroll [1310] down here and show you guys let's say we [1312] have a spot here there's a spot here [1317] that's B okay [1320] distance let's do some different [1323] colors [1325] distance is [1328] this it is the [1330] total good God it's the total amount [1333] traveled to get from A to B let's say [1337] you were this blue line and you were [1338] just walking around you kind of saw B in [1340] the Horizon you started walking towards [1341] B and you're like all right sweet that [1343] looks awesome then eventually you know [1344] you took a couple of wrong turns but [1345] eventually you got to [1346] B that's dist [1350] displacement is just the straight line [1353] path from A to B now distance and [1358] displacement are two fundamentally [1359] different [1360] things I like to think about this in [1362] terms of productivity as distance is the [1364] amount of work that you put in okay [1367] displacement is the output if we flatten [1370] this blue line this blue line here would [1372] be like this long okay because we went [1375] up and then we went down and then we [1376] went up again we we we basically had a [1378] bunch of wasted motion wasted movement [1381] um that did not get us in as straight [1384] align straight align path as possible to [1386] our goal which was B whereas with [1389] displacement it was just the distance [1390] from from A to B so if distance is the [1392] work you put in and displacement is the [1393] output the reason why this is such a [1395] valuable mental model is because the [1397] only thing the world cares about is your [1399] ability to produce it's your ability to [1401] go from A to point B nobody cares about [1404] how long or circuitous your path was to [1406] get there nobody gives a your [1408] process doesn't matter they don't care [1410] about the steps that you put in they [1412] don't care about your experience or [1413] expertise or how many medals or Awards [1416] you have the only thing that you are [1417] ever judged on is your ability to move [1420] from point A to point B this is just a a [1422] a you know universal law so whereas most [1426] people will walk a long path to get to a [1428] fairly short result AA their distance is [1431] much greater than their displacement [1434] your goal really in being productive is [1436] just to maximize the displacement while [1439] minimizing the distance so for instance [1442] let's say that this here is just an [1445] example of uh I don't know point a is [1449] let's say [1450] 0 and then point B is 25k per month and [1455] you want to make 25k per month that's [1456] your [1458] goal so let's say the very first time [1460] you do it is blue well let's say you [1463] know for whatever reason your business [1464] shuts down and then you got to do it [1465] again well imagine the second time you [1468] do it it you're probably not going to [1469] make as many of these large detours [1471] right you're probably going to be a [1473] little more like [1476] this and then after you know the third [1478] or the fourth or the hell the 10th time [1480] you've done [1481] it you're probably going to be more like [1485] this right you're going to get really [1487] really close to that Shortline [1489] path when you get in the habit of [1492] walking in a straight line path as [1493] humanly possible from point A to point B [1494] or at least thinking about this at least [1496] factoring this in um you know real that [1498] output's the only thing that matters [1499] displacement is the only thing that [1500] matters you become substantially more [1502] productive basically by default like I I [1504] don't even think about this sort of [1506] thing consciously anymore it's just a [1507] constant like operating system or sop in [1510] my head so understanding distance versus [1512] displacement I consider crucial it's [1514] probably one of the the biggest hacks on [1515] this [1516] list the fourth thing I want to talk [1518] about is frontloading your Revenue [1521] drivers now uh you know really how I [1523] should have started this video is what [1525] do most you know what do you want out of [1527] productivity what exactly is your goal [1528] goal here I'm assuming it's money [1530] because you follow me and I make the [1531] vast majority of my videos about money [1533] but productivity really is meaningless [1534] unless you have some outcome that you're [1536] going productivity is meaningless unless [1538] you have a b to your a right some some [1541] goal of yours so if your goal is money [1543] and it's probably specific amount of [1544] money then money is what you should be [1546] optimizing for at every point of the day [1548] every step of the [1549] day the reason I bring this up is [1551] because there's this big Trend in [1553] entrepreneurial circles where people [1555] will add tasks of their day that might [1558] sound nice and they might be enjoyable [1561] or hell maybe even difficult but they [1563] don't actually get you closer to that [1564] goal they're essentially a bunch of [1565] wasted movement if we think back to our [1568] a and then our B points here what I mean [1571] by this is I mean stuff like uh cold [1575] showers I mean stuff like you know [1577] morning meditations I mean stuff like uh [1580] super specific things of being being [1582] present while you make your coffee in [1584] the morning or that sort of thing if you [1585] think about it like that is some [1588] additional wasted movement that doesn't [1591] necessarily get you closer to that end [1593] goal it's nice to have it probably makes [1594] your life a lot more well arounded [1596] probably decreases your blood pressure [1597] probably makes you more present and [1598] clear but it is not the shortest line [1601] path that makes you money if you wanted [1603] the shortest line path to making money [1605] you would very quickly identify a bunch [1607] of Revenue generating activities like [1609] you know in in my community sake uh in [1611] my community's case um lead generation [1615] and you just do lead generation all day [1616] and that would get you there [1617] substantially faster with a lot less [1618] waste movement so logically money is [1621] what you should optimize for in order to [1623] do this my recommendation and what I [1625] always do now is I just frontload my [1626] tasks that generate revenue and then I [1628] worry about all the rest of them [1630] afterwards um this sounds really simple [1632] but pretty much no one does this and you [1634] know when they start doing this because [1636] the second that they start doing this [1637] about a month later they start making a [1638] ton of money I see this in my community [1639] all the time there are people that are [1641] just banging their heads against the W [1642] they're they're never making any [1643] progress never making any movement then [1645] all of a sudden there's just some [1646] breakthrough and then they make $1,000 [1648] and then $5,000 $10,000 $20,000 $50,000 [1650] $100,000 and they just start scaling [1652] like crazy and just just blowing people [1654] out of the water and when you know I [1656] asked them hey what did you do that was [1657] different the answer is almost always [1659] invariably well I just started doing [1661] lead generation every day or I started [1662] doing insert Revenue driver every day [1665] the way that I do my own Revenue [1667] generating activities is I have a little [1669] spreadsheet set up and on that [1671] spreadsheet as of right now I have a [1672] couple of tasks the first task I have is [1675] I have my Community Management [1678] so let me just write [1680] Community [1681] Management this is me going to my [1685] communities which generate me you know [1686] about $100,000 a month right now and [1689] essentially just commenting engaging um [1692] making my community as warm and as happy [1694] a place assumably possible to be in [1696] adding templates creating blueprints [1698] recording videos that sort of stuff this [1700] is the first thing that I do every [1701] single morning why because this the [1703] thing that makes me the most money right [1704] this makes me a disproportionate stupid [1706] amount of money so obviously this thing [1707] that I'm gonna freaking do first I want [1709] to make more you know the second thing I [1711] might do is I will record a [1716] video why well because this is like my [1719] lead generation this is almost like you [1721] know client fulfillment can think about [1723] it as um you know an agency equivalent [1725] and then this content production for me [1727] is basically like prospecting right and [1729] so these are the two highest rwi things [1731] in my day do you know how long [1732] collectively these take these take maybe [1734] three hours a day total combined maybe [1737] less [1738] actually probably like two and a half [1740] realistically because Community [1740] Management takes me like an hour so if [1742] you think about it like I'm doing the [1744] highest Roi stuff the stuff that enables [1746] me to make $129,000 a month in less than [1749] three hours a day at the very beginning [1751] of my day I frontload all those Revenue [1752] drivers and then it doesn't matter what [1753] else I do with my day uh I basically am [1756] completely forgiven I could go you know [1758] sit on a lounge chair and watch hobos [1761] duke it out or something like that while [1763] throwing popcorn at him I I I I could do [1765] whatever the hell I wanted I there is no [1767] task [1768] here that's going to be higher Roi than [1770] these two and if these generate me 90% [1772] of my wealth right well not 90 what's [1775] the math on that 75% of my wealth or [1777] something [1778] collectively um then and and I can do it [1781] in three [1783] hours you know doing the other 25% or [1788] something like like like I don't even [1789] care about the other 25% I guess is what [1790] I'm trying to say so I know many people [1793] that work a lot longer and harder than I [1795] do they generate a small fraction of the [1797] income why cuz cuz they work for you [1799] know maybe 10 12 or 14 hours a day but [1801] only like one tenth of that time is [1804] actual like money time okay whereas I [1807] might work I don't know sevenish 8ish [1810] hours a day but then like half of my [1813] time is money time so if you kind of do [1816] the math on that you know they do one [1818] hour whereas I do uh I don't know like [1821] three or four hours and in that way I [1824] basically get to put four times the [1826] output and if you think about back to [1828] our distance versus displacement over [1830] here I basically get to go four times [1832] further displacement wise or I basically [1835] um get to travel the same distance in [1838] 1/4 the distance I get to travel the [1841] same distance in 1/4 distance I get to [1842] travel the same displacement in 1/4 of [1845] distance so yeah they might have nicer [1847] websites because they spend all that [1848] time touching them up and making them [1850] beautiful they might have a really clean [1852] sexy Instagram page with filters and [1854] everything's all super nice and maybe [1856] they sales maybe they're better sales [1857] people than maybe their sales pitch is [1858] better because they just spend hours [1860] trying to make it the tightest sales [1861] pitch humanly possible and that's a [1862] great activity by the way but they have [1863] less of what we both care about most [1866] which is the money in their bank account [1867] because they're not frontloading their [1868] revenue activities if you do this you [1870] can create more wealth in a couple of [1871] hours than most people do in weeks um I [1873] do this every day I do that exact stack [1875] that I said every day I found something [1877] that generates me money that's my [1878] Revenue driver I just keep on pressing [1880] the make me money button over and over [1882] and over again every single day um and [1884] then as a result I I get to do a lot [1885] more than most now I say I had to learn [1887] this the hard way cuz cuz I did I used [1888] to spend way way longer working my ass [1891] off every day I used to be in cold [1892] outbound sales outside sales essentially [1895] where I had to like knock on business [1897] doors I had to you know Prospect for [1900] myself generate my own list of leads um [1902] and I would be turned down basically on [1904] a daily basis people chut doors in my [1905] face sec to kick me out and so on and so [1906] forth in a day you I'd be lucky if I [1909] could get between 60 to 80 business [1910] owners and of those 60 to 80 you know [1913] I'd get a few meetings out of that I [1914] would spend 8 to 10 hours of my day [1917] prospecting [1918] to ultimately get like a couple of [1920] meetings um instead you know now if I if [1922] I if I know what I know now if I could [1924] tell my past self I might look for more [1926] scalable mechanism that enables me to do [1928] a lot of the same thing maybe travel the [1930] same displacement in like a tenth of the [1932] distance through let's say cold email or [1935] maybe I just stay at home maybe I don't [1936] even go into businesses right the point [1938] I'm making is you know I I wasn't [1940] necessarily [1941] front-loading the highest Roi activities [1943] at the time instead of me doing [1944] something more scalable like let's say a [1946] cold email campaign I was instead doing [1949] admin work I was printing business cards [1951] I was trying use social media strategies [1954] I was trying to do Google my business [1956] sales all of it was just a waste of time [1958] I could have done more wealth generation [1961] in like 30 minutes had I known then what [1963] I know now than I ultimately did in [1964] probably several weeks so many years and [1967] many gray hairs um are to thank for that [1971] okay the next thing I want to talk about [1973] is [1974] retrospectives so in order to be [1976] substantially productive it's actually [1978] more productive what you should do is [1979] you should do retrospectives but you [1981] should also do something called a count [1983] for lag and I'll talk about this in a [1984] second in reality your approach is never [1987] perfect in the distance versus [1989] displacement example right in the point [1990] A to point B thing like we're never [1992] going to be perfectly straight line [1994] we're always going to be doing some of [1997] this and that's fine and that's normal [1999] this is just skill acquisition humans [2001] are not perfect that's that's fine the [2003] only way to get better is by regularly [2005] reflecting on our Direction and our [2007] speed what I mean by that is let's say [2009] if we back this up um you know point a [2011] is here and then point B is here bear [2014] with my shitty writing here that's [2015] definitely an A and that's definitely a [2017] b like if you think about it if this is [2021] our path right in uh in in one [2025] hypothetical If instead of just waiting [2027] until the entire uh thing is done if [2030] instead we just asked oursel right over [2032] here hey are we heading the right [2034] direction the answer to that question [2035] would probably be no right we'd probably [2037] evaluate our current trajectory we [2039] evaluate how far we are from the goal [2040] and we' be like okay maybe we should [2041] probably go like this instead and so [2044] this little an analysis point this is I [2047] call it a retro or a [2048] retrospective so you know they make up a [2051] key part of my program in maker school [2052] they made many people many thousands of [2054] dollars um the issue is that most people [2056] will do retrospectives too often they [2057] will look at how far they're going and [2060] then they'll look at the goal that [2061] they're attempting to reach and they'll [2062] think I'm not going fast enough so [2064] then they'll stop what they're doing [2066] before they've actually gone far enough [2068] to be able to realistically tell so the [2071] main issue I would say is that most [2073] people don't understand that reality has [2077] some built-in lag and the point that I [2080] want us to take away from this is that a [2084] lot of us love analyzing and forming [2085] opinions about our progress but the [2087] second that we start doing that too [2089] quickly the second that we send 10 [2091] emails out and say nobody's getting back [2093] to me I should probably stop this second [2096] we we we send 50 applications were like [2098] man I've only gotten five interviews I [2100] haven't been able to close any of them [2102] the second that you start making these [2103] opinions about this this progress too [2105] quickly then any decision that you [2107] attempt to make won't necessarily be [2109] meaningful there'll be a ton of noise [2111] and and variance uh in the process so in [2115] order to make a retrospective valuable [2117] and in order to constantly be iterating [2119] in the right direction you do need to [2121] have gone a substantial distance like if [2124] you if we Zoom way in [2128] and if you're here and you want to go [2130] here and you go literally like this and [2134] then you try and determine whether or [2135] not you're headed in the right direction [2137] it's going to be really tough for you to [2138] tell better for you to go a little bit [2140] further so one you're closer to that end [2142] goal but two it's just a lot easier to [2144] evaluate okay like I've come pretty far [2146] but I've also come in the wrong [2148] direction right like imagine you just [2150] you're right over here how the hell do [2152] you know where you're going I might be [2153] going this way but I might also be going [2155] this way I can't really tell right I [2156] need to zoom in a little bit more or [2158] ideally what we need to do is we need to [2159] travel a little bit more and then zoom [2160] out so results always lag behind inputs [2164] on the internet in the real world [2165] because it just takes time for things to [2167] occur when you send an email people have [2168] to check their freaking email inbox [2170] right when you apply for a job the [2171] hiring manager has to see it when you [2173] create a piece of content you know on [2174] Google it takes time for it to be [2175] indexed I have a couple of examples for [2177] you from my own life but I'll share let [2179] me just share this one here this is [2180] probably the most damning of the all I [2182] used to run um a Blog well I still run a [2184] Blog called mix.com but I don't post [2187] anywhere nears consistently as I did [2188] before if we take this blog and just [2190] scroll all the way down to the bottom of [2191] this puppy you'll see that I was writing [2194] on all sorts of I was writing about [2197] pills and photography and how to win [2199] fights and how to get into porn and how [2201] to Market yourself blah blah blah so [2203] during this period of time I basically [2205] started publishing a blog post every [2207] single day and I kept this up for 30 [2210] days in a row my idea was I was going to [2212] become a famous blogger like um James [2214] CLE with atomic habits and that's what I [2217] wanted to do at the end of my 30 days [2218] though I looked back on my progress and [2220] I realized I only have 100 views [2222] it's been 30 blog posts and I have a [2225]  100 views this isn't working you [2227] know I've done every i' I put in two [2229] hours a day three hours a day every day [2231] grinding hustling I have yet to see [2233] anything from it I should probably stop [2235] this and and you know understandably I [2238] did so by looking at data and so I was [2240] like well I'm not just making a gut [2242] decision here I'm actually looking at [2243] the data I'm not making any money off [2244] this the data and analytics haven't [2246] caught up uh it looks like I'm getting [2248] maybe three views per blog post total [2251] waste of my time I'll do something else [2253] now one year later [2256] serendipitously a friend of mine sent me [2259] a link to my blog post that he had seen [2262] at the top of Google I was ranking [2264] number one for some blog post um I think [2268] it was about Anki which is like a flash [2269] card app that I had just written because [2271] I was looking for search term [2273] traffic literally I I was at the top I [2275] was getting hundreds I might have gotten [2276] over a thousand views a day during that [2278] particular period um whereas before I [2280] got 100 views in 30 days like we're [2282] talking 500 times or whatever whatever [2284] the math is I also because of this got a [2288] request to be in a magazine called [2289] Popular Mechanics um this magazine has [2292] been crucial to me getting first of all [2294] it was like the first major piece of [2295] social proof that I ever had in my life [2298] and second of all um this has been [2300] crucial to me getting tons of uh you [2303] know great job opportunities it's been [2305] crucial for unfortunately the does look [2307] like I have access to it but anyway the [2309] point that I'm making is was crucial for [2311] me like leveling up in business a ton [2313] this was a direct result of the 30 blog [2315] post that I had written in 30 days but [2317] there's no way that I would have known [2318] because I stopped too quick if I had [2320] been able to tell myself back then Hey [2323] listen results lag behind inputs I don't [2325] know how long it's going to lag but it's [2326] probably going to be at least a few [2327] months so before you try and make any [2329] determination whether or not this is [2330] working keep at it for maybe 90 days [2333] instead of 30 days or something hell [2335] maybe even 60 days who knows I would [2337] probably be well one I'd be much much [2340] better off than I am now but I would [2343] probably be one of the foremost writers [2344] on on planet Earth right now on the [2345] entire internet just if I had kept up [2348] that daily consistency that I was [2349] putting in back then just given the [2351] exponential nature of my growth and so [2352] on and so forth I think about the same [2354] thing with my own YouTube channel if I [2355] just kept up posting every day instead [2357] of stopping at the end of the 30 days or [2358] however long I I initially posted my [2360] growth was basically like this and then [2363] I said H I'm going to stop and then you [2365] know kind of went here and now that I'm [2367] posting consistently again you know it's [2368] it's going up but if I had just been [2371] able to internalize this idea of results [2373] lagging behind inputs and hey it's great [2375] that you're making datadriven decisions [2377] but give it a little bit of time first [2379] before you ultimately say whether or not [2380] to chop this uh my life would be a lot [2382] better and I think yours probably could [2384] be as well so do retrospectives just [2387] when you do the retrospectives account [2388] for lag in the process um if you do [2390] you'll thank yourself for [2392] it all right number six is don't [2394] delegate automating I think there have [2396] been a lot of productivity gurus out [2398] there that say stuff like you know [2400] delegate tasks that don't deliver an Roi [2402] for you and I think they have the right [2404] idea behind it so as a result most [2407] people believe that delegation is the [2409] core part of a business and you should [2411] you know delegate after you get to a few [2413] th000 per month because you don't want [2414] to be focused on like low leverage stuff [2416] that's fine the issue with that is when [2418] you delegate humans are expensive [2421] inconsistent fragile and they require [2424] constant upkeep and that constant upkeep [2426] usually comes in the form of management [2428] work and that management work can a lot [2430] of the time actually dwarf the time [2432] saved that you just got back from [2434] delegating for instance if you hire [2436] somebody that takes even I don't know [2439] one hour per month of some sort of [2442] management that's 12 hours per year [2445] right and maybe you hired them to do [2447] some sort of like low-level admin task [2449] that realistically uh might have taken [2452] you like 3 hours per month or something [2455] if you think about it that's 36 hour [2457] per year minus 12 hours per year you're [2461] only saving 24 hours per year you're [2464] saving substantially less time than you [2465] actually thought because you have [2466] management concerns right well now what [2468] if we take that 24 hours a year and we [2470] also add um like sick days and we add [2473] inconsistencies and issues with training [2476] and and so on and and you know maybe [2477] some legislation with severance pay and [2479] stuff like that well how many of those [2481] hours you're really saving after you've [2482] had to pay and shell out money for all [2484] of that I'd be surprised a lot of [2486] the time especially for the uh company's [2488] first two hours if you've saved anything [2489] at all I think a lot of the time the [2491] math comes out to basically be zero and [2493] that's one of the reasons why nowadays [2494] I'm I'm basically a you know I'm I'm all [2497] in on this solo preneurship idea where I [2499] contain full access autonomy control [2501] over my business I make all of the [2503] decisions of my business if I have to [2504] work with somebody for some tiny little [2506] thing I will send it to them and give [2507] them entire freedom on how to do the [2509] thing I don't want anything but the [2510] result um you know I basically treat [2513] people like I treat black boxes with an [2515] input and then and then an output and So [2517] speaking about inputs and outputs a much [2519] better approach than delegating work is [2521] automating work the reason why I'm [2523] capable of making $129,000 in a month [2526] while also really not working all that [2528] much you know there's some days where I [2530] do but kind of in the grand scheme of [2531] things compared to some of the the Time [2533] Investments I've seen from other people [2535] it's really really not that much in the [2536] grand scheme of things um is because I [2538] have dozens of these small little [2539] automations running constantly that are [2541] black boxes where I feed it some sort of [2543] input or it scrapes some sort of input [2546] and it just gives me some tiny little [2548] output because I've pieced together [2550] enough of these I am now capable of with [2554] an hour of my time doing the same work [2556] that otherwise would have taken me 10 or [2557] 15 hours I just get to multiply it all [2559] by automation so it's not really like a [2562] savetime sort of thing it's more a [2564] multiply time sort of thing and then you [2567] know this allows me to take care of all [2568] these small little daily drains that [2570] aren't super relevant um I've dealt with [2572] a vast majority of my finance [2574] that you know usually need to hire a [2575] bookkeeping people and and finance [2577] departments a lot of my client [2579] management I do myself but I do it in a [2581] very leveraged way so I don't need to [2582] hire account managers I don't need to [2583] hire fulfillment people because all my [2585] systems are hard leverage I don't need [2586] to hire sales people because my videos [2588] sell for me right basically all the [2589] small daily drains and running um [2591] successful business are now taken care [2593] of because I've been able to automate [2594] the hell out of that through leverage [2597] and then you know if they aren't taken [2598] care of I usually just ignore them I [2599] only really focus on the 1% that brings [2601] in 99% of the Rev this is sort of an uh [2603] an advanced version of the whole 8020 if [2606] you just take this to the logic iCal [2607] conclusion then that's like 99 to1 right [2609] that's basically how I do it so you know [2612] a script or a solid piece of software [2614] will never call in sick you also have [2615] full control over them if you just [2617] Implement automations once and scale you [2619] you can scale infinitely it just frees [2621] your brain to focus on higher level work [2623] also any time that you spend learning [2624] how to automate is time that is going to [2626] pay you dividends in the future because [2628] uh basically every business is looking [2630] to automate as many of their hirers as [2631] humanly possible so knowing how to do [2633] this now um will just make you more and [2635] more and more valuable in the future [2638] okay the last thing I want to talk about [2640] is I want to talk about a [2642] procrastination technique that I call [2643] procrastinate by working so essentially [2646] what we're doing is we're actually [2647] leveraging the idea of procrastination [2649] by procrastinating on task a with task b [2653] instead of scrolling through Tik Tok on [2655] your phone so I procrastinate all the [2658] time but I tend to do so in a lot more [2659] productive way than most I will [2660] procrastinate on one task with another [2662] task I know this is silly but you can [2664] channel the vast majority of the energy [2666] that goes into avoiding something by um [2669] putting it into something else instead [2670] and as a result you could still get [2672] things done while also just freeing up [2673] your brain from the monotony focusing [2675] the same task all day so I'll give you a [2677] couple of examples um you could [2678] procrastinate doing a big project let's [2680] say you are running an automation agency [2682] like me and you um I don't know you have [2684] some big client project that's coming up [2685] but it's just so involved and it's so [2687] poorly scoped and you're kind of like ah [2689] crap I really don't want to do this well [2691] what you could do instead of you know [2693] sit on your couch and just watch TV all [2696] day um um The Bachelor season 7 is you [2699] could clear your email inbox instead [2701] maybe you have 30 or 40 um emails that [2704] are just constantly sitting there [2706] staring and Hawking at you um this is [2708] definitely lower Roi than doing the [2709] project but it's still something you [2710] need to do and then I find that by the [2712] time that you're done with that task [2713] you're so tired and bored of doing that [2715] sort of that you're a lot more [2716] likely to want to jump into something [2717] more intellectually stimulating like a [2719] project instead um in my case I [2721] procrastinated creating a community by [2723] publishing more YouTube videos right [2725] still made me a lot of money it was [2726] bonus because they're both symbiotic as [2727] well so if I could just visualize what [2730] this might look like let's say you have [2732] three tasks your task a task B and then [2734] task C okay I'm just going to split [2737] these into three different Lanes here um [2739] task a is the thing that you really [2740] should be doing okay task B and C [2742] they're sort of like lower priority [2743] things you don't necessarily need to be [2744] doing so if this is I don't know 3 [2749] pm and maybe this is I don't know 900 [2752] p.m. [2757] then in terms of the total allotment of [2759] your time you know you should be doing [2760] task a but you say you know what I have [2762] to do task b instead you know I'm just [2764] going to just going to bang at a bunch [2766] of task [2767] B then you know I don't know around 4:00 [2769] or 5: p.m. or something you're like ah [2772] crap I really still need to do task a [2774] but okay why don't I do a bunch of task [2775] C [2779] instead and then finally maybe between [2781] hours 6 to 9 or something you finally [2783] turn over to Tas and actually get work [2785] done [2787] and keep in mind this work is a lot more [2788] valuable than the other work but now if [2789] you can up the total area of all of this [2792] right you've actually gone quite quite a [2794] lot of distance you know although you [2795] haven't worked just on task a for the [2797] whole six-h hour period you still worked [2800] in General on tasks like a plus [2804] b plus C divided by the value of these [2808] three things basically for the same [2810] amount of time I guess is what I'm [2812] trying to say you've still been [2813] productive you just haven't been as [2815] leveraged and uh that's the last time [2817] I'm going to try and fill in a a box [2819] with a tiny little tablet like this so [2823] um as I mentioned previously the benefit [2825] to doing this is a lot of the time by [2826] the time you're done with task B and C [2828] you're just going to want to do a task [2829] like task a anyway and this is [2831] personally the way that I approach a lot [2832] of things in my life unfortunately I [2834] procrastinate a lot more often than most [2835] people probably think as a result of [2836] this um but in this way I'm still moving [2838] the needle forward I'm still getting [2840] something done I'm still ultimately like [2841] helping my business and you know despite [2844] me mentioning that I've eliminated all [2845] the daily drains I haven't elim all the [2847] data there's still a couple of them so [2849] um I could still work on stuff while [2851] procrastinating working on something [2852] else um and in that way be substantially [2854] more productive than if I just didn't do [2856] any of this right like in the [2858] alternative world you would have just [2860] procrastinated [2861] on all of it and then you wouldn't have [2863] done any time or energy on task B or C [2866] and if you look at your average [2867] productivity outut which is the function [2868] of a plus b plus C divided by the the [2871] the number of tasks then instead of it [2873] being like this kind of would have went [2875] all the way down here you might as well [2877] get moving and get things done um [2880] because getting things done you know is [2882] also an opportunity to learn and grow [2884] and improve your skills and some other [2885] unrelated things even if it's just [2886] writing an [2887] email so that is my Approach on [2890] procrastinating by working and those are [2892] the seven nobs ways that I skyrocketed [2894] my productivity um if you like this [2896] video If you like this Whimsical please [2898] subscribe to the channel um every [2899] subscriber helps a ton also feel free to [2901] suggest a topic for next time I sourced [2903] this post from my audience I believe [2905] this is a post this he made about a [2907] month and a half ago requesting me to [2908] talk about my productivity techniques if [2910] you guys have any questions about this [2911] just leave a comment down below as you [2912] guys know I'm very engaged with the [2914] audience on YouTube and I'm more than [2915] happy to answer one-offs and and you [2917] know concerns and stuff like that if you [2919] guys have any um add-ons to this if you [2921] guys have any suggestions for additional [2923] productivity techniques then let me know [2925] um just working my way down the list I [2927] would say this is probably um number one [2930] most [2931] important this is number two most [2933] important this is three number uh most [2936] important and the rest of these are sort [2937] of um swappable depending on your [2940] current state in life hope you guys [2942] appreciated the video have a lovely rest [2944] of the day and I'll catch you on the [2945] next one bye

Title: The 100% Automated Newsletter (ChatGPT + Make)
[0] hey everybody Nick here in this video [1] I'm going to build a completely [2] automated endtoend AI newsletter system [5] that sources posts completely [7] autonomously on Reddit then curates them [9] using AI filters then summarizes them [12] and then writes new content based on [14] that content before finally putting it [16] into a newsletter format pushing it out [18] through MailChimp although you could use [19] whatever the hell you want uh and then [21] you know getting it seen by real people [23] this was a viewer request had a lot of [24] fun putting it together so if you guys [26] have any other systems you want to watch [27] me build then by all means drop a [29] comment down below if it's a good one [31] that I haven't done yet I absolutely [32] will record a video just like this [34] appreciate the time let's get into the [35] system so I haven't actually built the [37] system out what I want to do is I want [39] to build this alongside you the reason [41] why is because I found a lot of content [42] on YouTube about automation is [44] unfortunately only really showing you [46] the finished product they never really [47] show you the steps that you need to take [48] to get there I always think of it sort [50] of like uh an engineer who's trying to [53] you know improve his engineering skills [55] looking at a picture of the Empire State [56] Building and being like awesome I think [57] I can build that right there's a lot [59] that you don't know during the discovery [62] process and my purpose in these videos [64] and also my channel more generally is [65] just to show you guys what that looks [66] like so we're going to do some build [68] alongs uh I'm going to try and figure [70] these things out as they come I may have [72] some stumbling blocks may have some [73] issues uh that's okay I want you guys to [75] see what a real actual building process [77] looks like and you know one of the [79] reasons I'm doing this just because I've [80] heard from a lot of my viewers that they [81] tend to like this sort of content so if [83] you don't maybe let me know um any who [86] I've spent around five minutes thinking [87] through this and here's how I believe [90] this system is going to work we're going [92] to start by getting posts from some [93] popular subreddits I've did some I've [95] done some thinking and I want to do my [96] newsletter on AI so I want this to be [98] just some general purpose artificial [100] intelligence newsletter um called Loop [103] once we have you know this newsletter [106] post Source from Reddit what we need to [108] do obviously is we need to scrape it [110] using a service so I have a couple [111] services in mind I'm going to run [113] through each of them in a moment then [114] we're going to filter posts based off [116] the subject and based off some other [117] metrics to ensure relevance when I say [119] other metrics I mean like you tend to [120] get a lot of info from Reddit like um up [122] votes down votes there's comments all [124] that stuff so we can actually use that [126] as a second order filtering mechanism to [128] tell us whether or not a comment is good [130] or whether or not a post makes sense or [132] whatever from there we're going to store [134] posts in a database which is really just [136] a Google sheet uh with a unique ID the [138] idea being the second that you start [140] having some sort of object permanence [141] the second you start like storing data [143] somewhere that you can retrieve it later [144] you open up your application to like [146] dozens if not hundreds of other cool [148] things that you can do and that's what [149] we're doing we're future proofing this [150] as well and then after that every week [153] or however long you run to run your [154] newsletter in my case it's going to be [155] every seven days we're going to grab a [157] certain number of posts then we're going [159] to use AI to summarize those posts and [161] then use that to write a standalone [162] newsletter um we're then going to add [165] the copy to a newsletter platform like [166] MailChimp I just picked MailChimp here [168] because it's the one that's the most [169] accessible from previous projects I know [171] that they have an API endpoint we could [173] call to populate a newsletter template [175] and not all um newsletter platforms do [177] and yeah this is sort of how I think [179] things are going to go go reality is [181] often deceptive and a lot of the time [184] you know if you remember from my other [185] videos where I've done something like [186] this some of these steps might have to [188] be swapped around we might have to do a [189] couple of other things that I'm not [191] necessarily anticipating but yeah this [193] is more or less how I think it'll work [194] let's dive in with the very first step [196] which is getting posts from a popular [197] subreddit so I'm going to un screen this [200] and what I'm going to do is I'm just [201] going to type in like Reddit Singularity [204] Reddit uh artificial intelligence [207] Reddit um open AI right I'm just really [211] quickly going to go top to bottom and [214] just see what these threads look like [216] realistically and this is important [218] because anytime that you're building any [219] sort of system you got to know the [221] ground truth data and you have to [223] understand what what what the quality is [224] and you have to like kind of you just [226] have to massage it a little bit before [227] you actually want to go through the rig [228] roll of like building out a system if [230] you make shitty assumptions with the [231] ground truth data then a lot of the time [234] you'll carry those shitty assumptions [235] the entire way through the rest of your [236] program or your flow so I'm just going [238] to really quickly read through this top [240] to bottom and I'm just going to see what [241] kind of data we're getting okay and I [242] got these three subreddits open this [244] looks pretty reasonable to me so I like [246] Singularity just cuz you know it's a [247] subreddit that I personally visit [249] reasonably often scrolling through it's [251] confirmed open as s is releasing for the [253] public today sick new footage of Optimus [255] walking Outdoors hell yeah chap chpt Pro [257] users get infinite Sor usage of 20 [259] second videos with 1080p hell yeah staff [263] claims AGI is achieved with [266] 01 cool so there's tons of posts here [268] I'm noticing the vast majority of these [269] are videos and or [272] photos additionally um they have links [275] that's kind of annoying because if you [276] think about it from my perspective like [278] the simplest way to do this would just [279] be to feed in the text of this uh Reddit [281] post into my newsletter generator so I'm [284] kind of now thinking all right there are [285] like a couple things we could [287] do uh okay this subr looks a little [289] better most of it's text there are a [290] couple things we could do we could [292] develop a system that like goes through [293] the images and also reads through the [294] images summarizes them that sort of [296] thing or we could just look for uh posts [300] that only really have text then we can [301] just summarize those that'll probably be [302] the [303] easiest once read through the open AI [307] one cool so more most the same um oh we [311] got an MKBHD video [313] interesting yeah so more of the same I'm [315] thinking what I'm going to do is I'm [316] just going to see how many of these [319] communities I could scrape if I can [320] funnel these into one data source that [322] would be ideal um because I don't think [323] I'm going to get enough data for like an [325] actual cool newsletter if I just Source [326] only from The Singularity or only from [328] the artificial intelligence subreddit so [330] my my mindset now is okay great I'm [332] going to try and see how many of these I [333] can feed into a scraper of some kind [335] then once I know um you know we're going [337] to run through and I'm probably just [338] going to try eliminating all of the [339] images and all the videos uh first [342] because I want to see if I can get by on [343] text post alone if I can then I know the [345] scrap is going to be a total walk in the [346] park it's going to not be a problem [347] already so in terms of how to actually [349] go about the scraping aspect what I [351] basically always do anytime I want to [353] build out an application that requires [354] data from other social media Source or [356] whatever is always go to this platform [357] first called appify appify basically [359] just lets you make apis out of anything [361] and they have this Marketplace rest [362] store component where other people [363] create scrapers and then make them live [365] for you they will charge you a small fee [367] for usage but this abstracts away all [369] the complexity and all the of [371] you having to actually like go out there [372] and build your own scraper which is [374] great for me because I just wanted to [375] whip this thing up in like an hour or so [377] and if I had to build my own Reddit [378] scraper God damn would that take me [380] forever so Google Maps extractor [382] Instagram scraper Tik Tok data extractor [384] you can see you can scrape whatever the [385] hell you want I'm just going to type in [387] Reddit and from here I see a cop I see [391] Reddit scraper light which I've [392] personally used before Reddit scraper [394] Reddit API scraper just opening these in [396] new [397] tabs and the idea is we want a scraper [400] that allows us to do a couple things one [403] we want it to be like reasonably [404] affordable we don't want to spend a lot [405] of money on this right um you know if [407] your newsletter operation cost you $10 a [409] month or something that's great you [411] have't completely automated AI [412] newsletter for 10 bucks a month Jesus [414] people 5 years ago probably be spending [416] hundreds of thousands of dollars on [417] something equivalent but we also wanted [419] to to to get us the data that we need [421] and what we need here is I'm thinking we [423] need the Reddit post text so I'm seeing [426] here it says scrape Reddit post with [428] title and text usern name number of [429] comments votes media elements that looks [432] good this one here looks like it's made [434] by the exact same guy TRX Gustavo rud [437] diger um it's just one is light so I I [440] guess you probably get less data the [442] other is [443] scraper so yeah 45 bucks a month screw [446] that [447] one this one seems to be reasonable as [450] well this one seems to be reasonable as [452] well why don't we just use the Reddit [453] scraper light um and I just I have to [455] see the interface on this thing so I'm [457] just going to go over here into my [459] actors I'll go to store and [461] then let me go to Reddit scrape Reddit [464] light um let me save these changes [467] here okay great and now we have what [470] looks like a bunch of fields that we can [471] edit um in order to scrape the specific [475] resource so scrape information about [476] post communities and users without [478] loging that's great that's what we want [479] start URLs if you already have the URL [481] Pages you want to scrape you can set [482] them here if you want to use search [483] field below remove all St eurs here I [485] imagine this is probably just some place [486] that I pump in the [490] community uh excuse me for that I pump [493] in the community and then [496] uh you know it's probably going to [497] scrape it and what's cool is it looks [499] like I can do multiple so that's [501] nice let's go back here add this let's [504] go back here and add one [508] more okay [510] and I don't know if these settings are [512] automatically on or if this is just [513] because I've used this before and like I [515] set these on not really sure definitely [520] search for posts comments yeah posts [522] only um we don't want to include NSFW [526] content we're going to do 100 are we [527] going to do 100 yeah all right screw [529] let's do 100 okay so I'm G to save this [530] I'm going to start and I'm just going to [532] give this thing a run and the idea here [534] is I just I'm going to see the data I'm [535] going to see the format before I like [536] get ahead of myself um once I verify the [539] form format is okay assuming that it is [541] then I'll jump into make and I'll see [543] how I can take the data from the scraper [545] and and stick it into [547] make.com so yeah [552] uh I'm seeing it's getting my data which [555] is cool it's probably going to take a [556] minute or two I'm not seeing any data [558] inside of here which is weird why [565] not maybe do I need to go [568] hot I remember there being some issue [570] with this sort of [571] thing not entirely sure what is or maybe [573] it's because it says skip users posts [575] that might have something to do with [578] it okay no it's adding some stuff to the [580] quebe yeah I think this scraper just had [582] some weird thing uh where you need to [585] select what type um Reddit can sort post [588] based off [589] hot uh new top or Rising so if you click [592] top if you click hot you know you sort [594] of have these URL endings and uh yeah I [596] just remember there was some issue where [598] when I didn't use that I didn't get the [600] post but when I do I I get them [602] obviously there's no real way to know [603] these quirks unless you actually go out [605] and handle it but uh yeah I'm getting a [609] lot of cool posts [613] here looks like most of these are recent [616] in the last week or so which is [618] nice some of these don't have thumbnails [622] and [623] stuff okay great so you know I'm I'm [625] getting enough data this is more than [626] enough data for me for to be able to run [628] a test now if you think about it [629] logically what I have to do next is I [630] have to set up a system that filters [632] these posts based on the subject matter [635] like I don't like let's look at this [637] post here um if you have a product to [639] promote this is where you can do it [640] outside of this post it will be removed [642] I don't really want that in my [643] newsletter right so I need a way to [644] filter that out I'm thinking I'm [646] probably going to use artificial [646] intelligence to do this because it's [647] flexible and smart but uh yeah so I [651] think what I'm going to need to do so [653] first of all I'm going to need to get [654] this data inside of make.com the way you [656] do so is you go over to storage and then [658] here it says data set ID just copy the [660] server and then inside of make type [663] appify what you want is you want get [665] data set [666] items paste in the data set that you [669] just copied into this data set ID column [673] let me select the right account and then [674] just leave the rest of this blank the [676] purpose of this is this just allows us [678] to connect to appify and bring the data [680] into a no code automation platform like [682] make which is allows you to do way more [684] cool with [685] it so yeah this looks pretty solid um [688] we're getting all the data here so [690] that's that post that I was referencing [692] with the product promotions and stuff [694] this is another one uh looks like we [697] have a body column which is really nice [699] I'm happy about the [702] body very happy about the body um [706] because uh yeah we you know we're [709] getting all the information we need but [710] we just want to make sure that we have [711] some way to filter it so kind of like [713] what I'm thinking [714] is okay how do we filter out this [717] information probably based off the title [720] of the post and the [722] body using AI so that we only extract [725] things that are relevant like this is [727] what I want a drop in replacement for [728] llama 3.1 70b approaches whatever this [732] is the sort of stuff I want meta [733] releases this that's that's a cool piece [735] of [736] news I want stuff [741] like I don't know autism and artificial [743] intelligence new discovery says blah [745] blah [745] blah chat GPT 40 better than Gemini [748] advanced [749] do you know what I mean so that's what I [752] want we need a way to filter the out [754] what I'm going to be doing is I'm going [755] to jump into GPT [757] here and then I'm going to go create a [759] completion or prompt and I'm actually [760] just going to write a prompt that does [762] all this filtering for [764] me now because this is a filter I'm just [766] going to use GPT 40 which is a much more [769] inexpensive model and let me run you [771] guys through what my prompt would [772] actually look like if I were to design [773] this for myself or for you know business [775] that I'm working with the first thing I [777] do is I'd add a system prompt that says [778] you are helpful intelligent assistant [781] that's the very first this is basically [782] just whatever the model identifies as [784] I'm saying hey GPT you're a helpful [786] intelligent writing assistant so be [787] helpful be intelligent and assist me [789] with writing and then afterwards we go [791] down to [792] user and this is sort of where we give [794] it instructions we tell what we wanted [796] to do so what do we want to do we [800] are [801] creating a newsletter with [805] exciting with new and exciting [807] developments in AI let's say that lists [810] new and exciting developments in II your [812] task is to filter a Reddit post based on [816] relevance if it's [820] relevant and [823] return either true or false [828] um [831] rules a post [834] is relevant if it's about news [842] developments exciting [846] progress or if it [850] yeah or if it' be considered newsworthy [854] let's just go with that a post is [857] irrelevant if it's [859] about something [862] personal or if it's a question or if [866] it's um [871] a community moderation or or or if it's [874] like uh Community moderation post like [877] this one or if [880] it's or if it just contains an image SL [885] link with no contacts let's do [887] that return your output in the following [892] using this Json format we'll go [896] relevance and then it'll just be true or [898] FAL false and we're just going to put [900] this um in Brackets here you don't have [903] to sorry we're going to put this in [904] quotes you don't have to I'm just going [905] to do this for the purposes of uh [907] communicating with this model kind of [908] like an a an API okay great um and now [911] in terms of the text content let's just [913] go post and then let's feed in the body [917] that looks pretty good to me we'll just [918] feed in the body well maybe we should do [921] the title [922] too you know maybe we'll go [926] title and then we'll feed in the title [928] and then we'll go body and then we'll go [930] body perfect awesome that looks pretty [932] good to me um how many did we scrape [934] here we scraped 91 so why don't we just [937] uh change the limit of this to [939] 10 and then let's just get it to really [943] quickly run a test on these 10 and just [945] see what it's [948] outputting oh my bad so we're getting [950] the output as Json but I actually want [953] this Json to be output um and then [954] parsed as well so in order to do that in [956] open AI what we need to do is go down to [958] show advance settings then scroll down [960] to the bottom to where it says response [961] format what you want to do is Select [963] Json then click parse Json response then [965] click okay we're going to save this and [967] then run [968] again and now what we should get is we [970] should get a result variable with the [972] relevance [973] perfect awesome so I'm just really [975] quickly going to jump through here just [976] see if any of these are true just want [978] to see you know out of 10 how many [980] realistically can I expect to be true I [983] don't know if any of them will be um [985] we'll go result okay corre this one [987] looks like it's true let's see what the [989] detail was the CEO who says cheaper a [991] could actually mean more jobs okay cool [993] that looks pretty solid I like it uh [996] let's go down to this one relevance [1000] false uh this one false this one false [1004] oh nice so we got two out of the five so [1006] far three out of the [1008] five that's [1010] great kind of losing my place here um [1014] yeah so three out of five so far sweet [1016] um honestly that's more than sufficient [1017] for me like if you think about it if we [1019] scrape um just based off the cost of [1021] this if the cost of this thing is4 thou [1024] $4 per 1,000 [1026] results we just scraped 10 and we got [1029] three so let's just even say that [1031] 20% of our records are okay how many [1035] records do we really want in our [1036] newsletter like I'm thinking what we're [1038] going to do is we're going to feed in [1040] like five or six of these and then our [1043] newsletter automation is going to like [1045] summarize these and then provide a link [1047] back to the re maybe it's even provide a [1049] link back to the resource I don't even [1050] really think that's necessary we're just [1052] going to like compile this as if we were [1053] the new source um so realistically how [1056] many do we really want in a newsletter I [1057] don't know like let's say six so in [1059] order to get [1061] six you know if if it's 20% uh of posts [1065] land then if we just multiply six by [1067] five then that's 30 so in order to get [1071] this done I think it's like 1.2 cents or [1074] something or 12 cents 12 cents per week [1077] that's a walk in the park [1079] yeah no problems there I'm not going to [1080] worry about the images or or anything [1082] like that I'm only going to select posts [1084] that don't have images um and that are [1087] just pure text posts that we can [1088] summarize based off of that that just [1090] seems to me the simpler way to do [1091] it let's call this automated [1095] newsletter uh automated AI newsletter [1098] system I'm just going to do one because [1099] I have a feeling we're going to need two [1101] uh scenarios here and then what I'm [1104] going to do now is I'm just going to [1105] dump all this into a Google sheet so I [1106] have this Reddit post database set up [1108] here I don't have any fields or anything [1110] what I want to do is I just want to take [1111] this download all the output [1114] bundles you see all these I'm just going [1117] to copy this then I'm going to paste [1120] this in a chat EBT and I'll say your [1123] task is to create a CSV of key names I'm [1127] going to paste these into a Google sheet [1129] as [1131] headings this is now going to take the [1133] data and it's going to just give me a [1135] bunch of headings that I can very [1136] quickly and easily [1137] use maybe quickly and easily was an [1140] overstatement yeah I don't know why I [1143] have to download a [1147] file come on man just I put it as [1151] text yeah there we [1154] go cool uh I'm just going to copy all [1156] this now go to my Google sheet and then [1158] paste this in and then I'll just go data [1160] um split text to columns perfect and now [1164] I have basically like all the data [1166] columns in here that I'd want I'm just [1167] going to change the style this a little [1169] bit and I'm a huge for enter so I'm [1171] going to use enter uh let's give this a [1173] quick little [1174] click beautiful looks clean um and let's [1177] just call this scraped posts now let's [1179] head back over to make.com and what we [1181] want to do now is we just want to go to [1183] Google Sheets at a [1187] row and then I'm going to want to go [1189] down here to Nick at left [1191] click. and then choose my spreadsheet ID [1193] it's going to be called Reddit post [1196] database then I'm going to have to [1198] select the sheet name which is just [1199] going to be scrape post it does contain [1201] headers and check out how simple and [1203] easy it is for me to map all of these [1207] now I still need to add the the filter [1210] which I'll do in a [1212] second but just look at that this is um [1215] substantially faster than you know when [1218] you make the fields in this um [1220] equivalent you know it's just [1222] substantially easier and faster also [1224] there's one thing I'm realizing like I'm [1225] going to want to use this as a database [1227] right but I'm going to want to keep [1228] track of which posts in this I've used [1230] for my newsletter because logically I'm [1232] going to need a way to list all of these [1234] and then select them right so what I'm [1236] going to do is I'm going to add one more [1236] column here and I'm just going to call [1237] it post status I'll head back over here [1240] and then over here I'm just going to [1241] type in new so new is just going to be [1243] you know after I scrape it this is where [1245] it [1246] goes awesome that looks pretty good [1248] let's add a filter uh actually there's [1250] one more thing we have to do before we [1251] do this if you think about it before we [1253] add a new record we have to check to see [1256] if the record already exists in the [1257] database if it does already exist in the [1259] database we shouldn't add it so one [1263] thing I noticed while I was reading [1264] through this data is that there's an ID [1265] field this ID field means that we can [1267] actually search through the sheet [1268] looking for an ID and if there's an ID [1271] that matches this ID then we don't have [1273] to add it so I'm actually going to drag [1274] a search rows module and just add it in [1277] front of this I'll type [1279] Reddit oh I'm using the wrong email one [1283] sec I'm going to type in Reddit over [1285] here [1288] get grab my Reddit post database sheet [1290] name is going to be scraped post and [1293] then what I'm going to do is you see [1294] where it says filter I'm just going to [1296] go and um check to see if the ID is [1299] equal to this ID here and if it is equal [1303] to this what I'm going to do [1308] is if it is equal to it total number of [1311] bundles will be greater than zero [1313] logically so if I want to check and see [1314] if something is new total number of [1316] bundles will be equal to zero [1319] what I'm doing is I'm searching for rows [1320] with the same ID so if there are uh [1324] Records with the same ID then it'll [1326] return more than one so if I just check [1328] to see if it's equal to zero it'll [1330] basically always work which is nice so [1332] that looks good to me over here I'm just [1334] going to add a filter for [1336] relevant and I'm going to say condition [1338] relevance equal to true so now we have [1340] two filters we have one for relevant and [1342] one for new um now that that's good to [1345] go I'm I'm basically just going to run [1346] this puppy on all the records and see [1347] what happens let's go 100 and then let's [1350] just [1352] run looks like most of these aren't [1354] relevant the ones that are are now [1355] passed in the Google sheet and they're [1356] all new oh it's kind of ugly also I'm [1360] adding this to the wrong column that's [1361] annoying okay let's uh let's fix this [1364] before it just gets [1365] unbelievable reset [1368] reset then I don't like how tall these [1370] are so I'm just going to click them back [1374] here hold on one sec just go right here [1379] also I think the reason why this is [1381] doing is something to do with wrapping [1382] so I just fix that okay cool and now [1385] we're actually scraping these which is [1387] pretty [1388] sweet this looks good to me um let's [1390] just double check to see if this data is [1392] everything that we want like one thing [1393] that you'll notice um when I'm building [1395] these systems what I'm thinking about is [1397] basically like I'm I'm testing it [1398] iteratively at every step I'm saying [1399] okay cool is this is the output of this [1401] module or this step what I'm expecting [1403] and so this is me actually just [1405] double-checking that it [1406] is so this looks good this actually [1410] looks kind of weird here's what's making [1411] news in AI I don't know if I like [1416] that this is actually basically my same [1419] yeah this is The Verge doing the same [1420] thing I'm trying to do here with my [1421] newsetter so actually we we shouldn't [1423] allow these in so I'm just going to bold [1425] this for now I'll keep track of that [1426] later this looks good that looks good [1429] that looks [1431] good what is this it's an advertisement [1439] hm this is my [1441] startup yeah so I don't want people [1444] advertising their own products [1451] here it seems kind of dumb I don't know [1453] if I want anything that dumb [1459] either okay anyway this actually looks [1461] pretty solid um there's only two records [1463] here I really don't like here's what's [1464] making news in AI so I have to go back [1466] to this and what I want to do is I just [1467] want to update prompt to uh what's the [1470] best way to think about this this is [1471] basically like um I guess this is a [1474] newsletter so I'm going to now Mark [1477] things as irrelevant if they are sort of [1479] newsletteryou [1499] or if it's a product [1502] advertisement especially if it's the [1504] founder talking about their own [1507] product or if it contains an image link [1509] with no contact good so I just updated [1511] my prompt um what I'm going to do now is [1513] I'm just going to delete these two [1514] records if you think about it I don't [1516] want these poisoning the well butth the [1518] rest of this looks pretty good to me so [1520] I think we should be able to move on now [1521] that I think about it you know we we [1523] could do some additional editing through [1525] the number of comments and stuff but I [1528] don't actually think that's relevant [1529] like odds are if something is in the hot [1532] stage yeah actually this one minute AI [1535] news is kind of so it's this [1536] rag thing let's let's remove that [1540] too um if something is in the [1543] hot [1545] stage then it's probably already kind of [1548] preved so I'm not actually going to do [1549] that that other level of [1551] filtering what I am going to do is it [1553] looks like there's one more field here [1555] there's data type here [1558] looks like um I kind of screwed up with [1560] my patters here post status is not the [1564] right column so let's just scroll down [1567] here image URLs oh yeah yeah uh let's [1571] just go image [1575] URLs yeah okay so there's actually some [1577] image URLs [1580] here and then uh Let's do let's make [1584] this [1585] one post status so sorry W is what w is [1590] video URL let's go video URLs image URLs [1593] and then post status here cool um so [1597] that's that uh we have basically [1598] everything that we need I believe in [1599] order to take this to the next level [1601] which is now like if you think about it [1604] let me just see is there anything else [1605] that I'm missing here no I'm pretty sure [1606] that's the whole system [1608] like yeah we uh we we now have [1610] everything that we need to scrape data [1612] and then publish it to this spreadsheet [1615] what we need now is we need a mechanism [1616] that will allow us to take the Post in [1618] the spreadsheet and then convert them [1620] into newsletter text we have the data [1622] source so it's really just this this [1625] other half here every week grab X post [1627] use to summarize them wrate to stand [1628] newsletter add copy to some newsletter [1630] platform like MailChimp so I'm just [1632] going to I'm surprised that I haven't [1634] actually had to change any of these [1636] steps um this is going to be scenario [1639] one [1642] basically how do I not make [1646] this this is going to be scenario one [1648] over [1652] here and then this is going to be [1655] scenario two and we're going to have to [1657] separate them because logically they [1658] both do different things right like [1660] scenario one is going to be getting the [1664] data and adding it to DB scenario two is [1669] going to [1670] be um curating content [1678] and passing it through [1681] Ai and posting to [1685] newsletter that's sort of like the [1686] two-step flow that we have so this is [1688] going to be called automated and [1689] newsletter system Source posts it's not [1692] entirely done it we still have one more [1693] thing we have to do um but I'll talk [1695] about that later and I'm just going to [1697] create a new scenario [1700] here this new scenario it's just going [1703] to be [1704] called automated and newsletter system [1708] summarize with AI [1712] and post [1714] to and create new CER now let's just do [1717] that that looks good to me um [1720] awesome this is popping up because I'm [1722] attempting to command s save this while [1724] also selecting the text up here so it [1726] just doesn't know if I'm trying to save [1728] the text or if I'm trying to save the [1729] whole flow um I just want the title to [1732] appear here so I'm just saving this so [1734] that I have both of these available so [1736] this is number one this is number two [1738] let's move into number two so now we [1739] just need some way to grab all this and [1742] you know I'm also going to want to store [1743] the outgoing newsletters somewhere else [1744] so why don't I go here and type [1746] generated [1748] posts um and then I'll worry about what [1750] that actually looks like later but okay [1753] let's go to my Google Sheets and then [1754] let's go search rows and basically what [1757] I want now if you think about it is I [1758] just want to grab all of the rows in my [1760] database with a a post status equal to [1763] new because if the post status is equal [1765] to new it's basically up for grabs right [1767] I can use this in my flow so I'm going [1769] to go here to spreadsheet ID and just [1772] select the uh the Reddit post [1776] database I find in practice the [1778] lengthiest part of this is actually just [1779] dealing with this uh Google Sheets [1782] module the search rows one because it [1783] just takes forever to remap everything [1785] then what I want is I want filter post [1787] status to be equal to new and for now [1791] I'm not going to set a limit alth I [1792] probably should [1793] eventually so we're just going to make [1795] this okay I'm going to right click run [1797] this module [1798] Lon and let's just see if we got all the [1800] day so we got this this is [1804] good nice this is [1806] good cool we got basically all the posts [1810] which is uh you know what we want I mean [1813] like you know logically we're not [1814] actually we we can't just have ai do 20 [1817] posts for news every week so [1819] realistically we probably want like six [1822] or [1823] seven I used to run a newsletter way [1825] back in the day it's called the cusp it [1827] was followed by um dhma sha the founder [1830] HubSpot and it used to look like [1833] this this is way back in the day with [1836] doly [1837] um so I actually think like ideally what [1840] we would do is we'd actually just use [1841] this we'd replicate some of this [1842] functionality welcome to the cusp [1844] cutting Ed and using implication explain [1845] in simple English this week's issue [1848] here's some quick little examples [1852] teasers and then we have some H2 and [1855] then we have the actual description here [1858] and then we just do the same thing over [1859] and over and over again yeah that looks [1861] to me pretty good so I'm actually going [1862] to use this as the basis of my GPT [1865] flow uh what we're going to do now is if [1867] you think about it we're going to use AI [1869] again so I'm going to go open AI create [1870] a completion actually I'm just going to [1872] copy the module from the previous flow [1874] because it has most of what I want I [1875] just need to change the [1877] prompt and then why don't I just rename [1880] everything while I'm at it so this is [1882] get Reddit posts this one will be filter [1887] posts [1888] this will be check if exists this one [1891] will be add new post cool down here it's [1895] going to be get Reddit [1899] posts this one's going to [1901] be I guess [1904] generate summary well is just the [1907] summary no let's [1908] generate headline [1910] and snippet let's call it that you guys [1913] will see why in a sec I'm going to jump [1915] back over inside of this [1918] it has most of the text that we want [1920] which is cool just say writing assistant [1923] I think I forgot that on the previous [1924] module [1926] call and we are still creating a [1929] newsletter um that lists new and [1931] exciting developments and that your task [1933] is [1937] to take as input a Reddit post [1942] title and body and rewrite it [1949] different [1953] words and rewrite it for our newsletter [1957] the rules are going to [1960] be um use a [1965] casual Spartan tone of [1969] voice use third person [1975] POV um you know most news letters they [1979] they write like really gratuitously with [1981] the new lines like they'll they'll keep [1983] the paragraphs really short and go like [1984] one to two sentences so we should [1985] probably add some information about that [1987] here [1988] um use new lines [1992] gratuitously and keep paragraphs to one [1995] two sentences [1998] Max anything [2000] else I think that's good return your [2002] output using this Json format let's [2005] go headline [2008] and then let's go [2014] snippet rewrite it for our newsletter [2017] use a casual SP ton of voice 30% PV [2019] using toly keep paragraphs to on [2020] sentence to Max let's do try four 4 to [2026] six sentences total that looks pretty [2029] good maybe 5 to 7 I don't know whatever [2033] we we we'll see how it goes okay and [2035] then next up I have to use this user [2036] prompt um [2038] I'm going to use headline and snippet [2040] right [2041] so actually let's make this simpler [2043] we'll go [2044] new new headline new snippet this would [2049] be old headline old snippet very cool [2053] now what I'm going to do for old [2054] headline is feed in title now what I'm [2055] going to do for old snippet is feed in [2057] uh body there we go and I'm just going [2061] to leave everything else is the same and [2062] I just want to test this out basically [2064] like a lot of the time you have to add a [2066] bunch of examples of like before and [2068] after um but what I'll usually do is [2070] I'll just have ai generate me a draft of [2072] that and then I'll go through and I'll [2073] do some editing and if I have to add an [2075] example I'll do it then I don't want to [2077] do it for all 20 or 30 or however many I [2079] got so I'm just going to do like let's [2080] just do one for now I'm going to run [2083] once let's generate our headline and [2085] snip it and see what see what we're [2087] looking [2088] at metad drops llama 3370 Bill metas [2092] launched their latest llama 3.37 bill [2094] which is a step up from llama 3.1 70b [2096] performance- wise almost catching up the [2097] 4 B J it's a smooth swap for anyone [2098] using the older model you can check it [2099] on hugging face it's worth peing at if [2101] you're into a advancements I don't like [2103] that you can check it out on hugging [2105] face so I need to add another Rule and [2108] that rule is don't [2110] include don't direct people to offsite [2114] resources don't direct people to offsite [2117] resources like [2119] that okay let's try this one more [2123] time that actually looked like basically [2125] perfect so I don't think I'm going to [2126] need to do any editing [2129] cool that looks pretty reasonable to me [2132] awesome um so now that we have this you [2134] kind of think of it from my perspective [2136] uh what we need to do now is we need to [2138] format this in such a way that um we're [2140] basically going from post to post and [2141] delivering summaries of each [2144] so there variety of different ways we [2146] could do this and make probably the [2149] simplest is to use a text [2151] aggregator what a text aggregator will [2154] do so I'm going to set the source module [2156] to get Reddit posts [2158] is it will allow us to map this into a [2161] format that I'm very comfortable with [2162] using which is called markdown where you [2164] could write headings and you could write [2165] like the subheadings so uh my heading [2168] let's try H3 first uh yeah let's try H3 [2172] The Heading would be this and then the [2174] snippet would be this right and then [2178] between the two I'd want a new line then [2180] after I'd also want another new line so [2182] basically what it happened is for all of [2184] the bundles in this sequence it'll do [2187] this and then just concatenate them all [2189] together which seems to me pretty pretty [2191] good so let's do six um and then let's [2195] go over here click [2196] okay we're going to get this yellow [2198] little bubble here because technically a [2200] Transformer should never be the last [2201] module in the route but I'm going to [2205] give this a go we're just going to see [2207] what this looks [2208] like it's currently processing all this [2211] right now for us [2214] wonderful realistically I shouldn't have [2216] done all six I should have done two cuz [2217] then I would have used fewer outputs [2223] but um this looks pretty good to [2226] me let's just um I'm going to copy all [2229] of this and then I'm going to go to [2230] markdown live preview which is just a [2233] tool which allows me to paste stuff [2235] in okay so this is basically what it's [2237] going to look [2240] like wow this is [2244] sweet yeah stuff like this is kind of [2246] annoying it's probably doing this cuz I [2248] tried to force it to do [2250] seven um new lines so I don't actually [2253] need seven new lines [2255] so sorry uh seven sentences I don't [2258] actually need seven sentences let's just [2260] a for like three to [2262] five three to five sentences total [2265] that'll be a little better but anyway um [2267] still this is like good format this is [2268] what I like so everything here is nice [2270] all we need to do now is we just need to [2272] put this in I mean basically just put [2274] this in a newsletter I'm just going to [2274] use a Google doc though um it's be the [2277] simplest for me and the thing about [2279] Google Docs is they only take as input [2282] oh you know there are a couple more [2283] things we have to do actually we [2284] obviously have to generate an [2285] introduction to generate conclusion um [2288] but but I just want to test this out in [2289] a Google doc um the thing is Google Docs [2291] requires um HTML format and I'm [2294] outputting this in markdown I could [2295] output this in HTML I could just ask GPT [2297] to do HTML but I find that when you ask [2299] AI to to Output things in HTML um [2302] sometimes the format is a little bit off [2304] or you know it's not like perfect for [2306] the Google Docs module [2308] when I do markdown there's a lot less [2309] room for ambiguity and then make [2311] actually has a built-in markdown to HTML [2313] converter that just always outputs the [2315] result in like very easy accessible [2318] Google doc functional format so I'm [2321] going to convert this to [2324] HTML let's aggregate headlines and [2327] Snippets sorry my rice is burning one [2329] sec [2337] okay rice is definitely a little charred [2340] but hey we like it crispy uh so we're [2343] going to aggate the headlines and [2344] snippet Mark 9 HTML okay I'm going to [2346] feed the this in as just an example [2349] newsletter content's going to be this [2351] HTML and let's just see what happens [2352] right because we know that this looks [2354] good just about how it's going to look [2356] in the Google Doc so I'm going to run [2357] this once a I should have only done [2360] two yeah [2362] whatever that's fine uh we're just going [2365] to aggregate all of them I guess [2369] and if you think about it logically what [2370] we're doing is we're going to use one AI [2372] model to do the um bodies and then we're [2376] going to do another a model to do the [2378] introductions and the conclusions I [2380] think that makes [2382] sense we should generate a title as [2386] well so this looks good to me um I don't [2389] like that there's no new lines but I [2390] guess it's just a formatting [2391] thing yeah you see how that's like kind [2393] of stuck together there's no space [2395] between them it's just a formatting [2396] thing [2400] this actually looks pretty [2403] good I'm going to go enter [2409] here yeah I like how casual and sparten [2412] the the [2415] languages I don't like stuff like this a [2417] bold claim that adds fuel to the AFI [2419] imagine the possibilities if he's right [2421] I think I can probably reduce the [2422] incidence of this [2424] by um changing the temperature [2427] going like [2430] 0.8 Spartan tone of voice 's a third [2432] person [2436] POV I'm just going to remove the try for [2438] three to five cents as [2439] total probably be better um but [2444] anyway cool looks pretty solid to me so [2446] now we just want some sort of [2448] introduction and then we just want some [2450] sort of conclusion the conclusion can [2452] probably be templated if I just look at [2454] how I did um this on my own newsletter [2457] welcome to so I'm going to say welcome [2459] to the loop well welcome to the welcome [2461] to loop I guess cutting atj news explain [2464] in simple English looks good and this [2465] week's issue one two three let's dive in [2468] what's the conclusion [2472] like you see how there are all these [2474] images [2475] here there's also a bunch of links we [2477] could like if you really wanted this to [2480] crush what you would do is you would [2482] take these images sorry you would take [2483] the headlines you'd feed them into a [2485] search engine model like perplexity [2487] perplexity would return you a list of [2489] citations you take those citations and [2491] then you would pass the snippet along [2494] with uh the citations through another [2498] GPT call and say hey your job is to add [2500] links so add links add these links to [2502] whatever this resource is wherever [2503] relevant it would then go through and it [2505] would it would add links then for images [2507] you could use like mid Journey you could [2508] have mid Journey generate images once [2511] every three Snippets or something just [2512] formatted and then it would actually do [2514] pretty well um I don't I don't think I'm [2516] going to do that for this just because [2517] if I do that this video is probably [2519] going to be like 3 hours long but I will [2521] give you all of the tools that you need [2523] in order to go there and do it like [2524] little stems and stuff like that just to [2526] make it pretty simple U maybe you could [2528] do the same thing with with videos on [2530] YouTube and whatnot anyway the thing [2532] that's important for us is the [2535] conclusion this is good I'm just going [2537] to copy this conclusion this is just [2538] going to be the same conclusion every [2539] time pretty solid so I'm just going to [2541] copy this this is like G to go here oh [2545] hold on [2547] that's a wrap maybe we'll go that's a [2549] wrap enjoy this consider sharing with [2551] somebody you [2553] know you can also follow [2556] me well this is going to be a pretty [2557] short format so you can [2559] also Subs uh follow [2563] me on Twitter if you [2566] prefer more straight to the point AI [2570] news like this see you next week- Nick [2573] cool and we need some intro right so [2575] that's what I'm going to do now let's [2577] take [2579] this let's use this to [2583] generate introduction and conclusion uh [2587] no conclusion [2589] sorry what was that other thing we need [2591] to [2592] generate a title right so we're going to [2596] go generate introduction and title we're [2598] actually going to use this to generate [2599] an and like AI generated a title so [2602] we're creating a new Z list new and [2603] exciting development and your test take [2604] as input [2608] the [2610] newsletter and write an introduction and [2614] a title rules casual Spar tone of voice [2616] third person [2618] PV [2621] um you know what I'm just going to [2623] remove most of these rules and then I'm [2625] just going to [2628] say use a casual Spartan tone of voice [2632] follow this [2634] template then I'm just going to go back [2636] here [2637] scroll all the way up to the top of my [2640] thing then I'll just uh go back here and [2643] then paste this in welcome to Loop [2646] Cutting Edge AI news explained in simple [2649] English cool this week's issue uh let's [2653] do one two [2656] three let's do this return your output [2659] using this Json [2661] format [2663] introduction and then title uh we should [2666] probably do title [2671] use these examples for titles why don't [2674] I just go back through my [2676] blog let get a couple of example [2679] titles that's a good [2683] one [2687] so I like this one kind of Click [2693] baity as you see the clickbait did not [2695] start on YouTube the clickbait [2697] has been happening for a long [2701] time uh let's do that okay cool [2707] awesome uh [2710] H right so what I need is I need [2713] newsletter then I just need to put in [2715] this [2718] text and [2720] then I'm just going [2723] to go over here and then you know where [2725] it says result you can actually access [2727] parameters before they're even generated [2729] by [2730] going result [2734] title and then what I want [2738] next is I want result uh introduction I [2742] believe right yeah [2744] introduction okay this should be good [2747] let's see how it goes paste the mark [2749] down here let's run this bad [2753] boy I'm pretty excited I hope this works [2758] it's going to be really cool man I love [2759] templating content like this because [2762] like even if even if hypothetically you [2764] wanted to use this for your own [2766] newsletter and it wasn't perfect even if [2768] it gotten 80% of the way there which [2770] these models are totally fine doing you [2772] just 5x The Leverage on whoever's time [2774] it is look at this oh that's clean [2778] man oops uh [2783] this that is clean okay metal launches [2786] llama 3.3 70 build to compete with the [2788] big players welcome to Loop Cutting Edge [2789] and explain in simple English in this [2791] week's issue 1 2 3 4 5 6 you know to be [2795] honest I don't really need all six of [2797] these [2797] here like like this you already know all [2802] the news from [2803] this okay so let's just [2805] do let's just tell it to pick the top [2808] three for the [2813] introduction let's do that [2818] pick the top [2820] three news [2823] headlines don't use more than top three [2826] the top three news headlines let's just [2828] do that because because otherwise I mean [2830] there's no point you're just reading the [2831] whole newsletter right [2833] here I mean some of these are a little [2835] longer like box [2839] CEO yeah some of these are a little too [2843] short Google's latest Quantum trip meet [2845] Willow how do I make this longer [2849] um what is the body of [2854] this oh it's an image you know what we [2857] have to remove the images here like just [2860] an image that doesn't that's not going [2862] to work for us the reason why this is so [2864] short is because it just says images and [2866] then it goes so actually we need to [2868] adjust our filter back [2871] here um or if it just contains a [2876] an image [2882] link let's just see what the exact text [2888] was or [2891] if the body merely contains an image [2895] link with no contacts there we go this [2897] is going to force all of the ones that [2900] say images to just get out so we're not [2902] actually going to have these [2904] anymore so when we do our [2908] newsletter [2910] um you know we're not we're not going to [2912] have to worry about these like one or [2914] two line things ideally all of the posts [2916] that are here are going to be [2918] substantially longer which is cool okay [2920] okay okay so we got six here gener [2922] introductions and title markdown Google [2923] Docs let's run this through and I want [2925] you guys to keep in mind that I'm using [2926] this Google doc here just as a just as [2927] an example um after this we're going to [2929] take the same flow and we're just going [2931] to connect it to MailChimp or clavia or [2933] whatever newsletter provider I I deem [2935] Worthy um I am the one who deems [2938] newsletter providers [2939] worthy okay we just ran it through we're [2941] creating the Google Doc I'm going to go [2943] down to web view link again paste it [2944] open [2945] it and then I'm going to go and just [2949] make the spacing a little sexier so I [2951] want to see kind of what this would [2953] actually look like we could even do some [2955] formatting here we could like have this [2957] be [2961] bolded maybe do something like that [2963] instead because I'm using a colon down [2965] here but anyway um um meta launches this [2968] a might be boosting jobs according NATO [2970] uses a to persuade solders [2973] wow this is pretty clean not going to [2978] lie and the that's a wrap looks good too [2982] so yeah um I'm just going to change the [2986] introduction template to include a dash [2988] instead of the colon just because I [2989] don't think it looks good in English to [2991] have two sentences one immediately after [2993] the other and both of them to have [2994] colons like this so I'm just going to [2996] use an M Dash and [2998] then if you think about it um what we [3000] need to do is we just need to update the [3002] Google sheet so that the post status is [3006] like published or something instead of [3007] new um so we just need a way to to [3010] update this way you do so is you go to [3011] Google Sheets go update a [3013] row and I need to put this inside of [3015] this aggregator and then I'm just going [3017] to choose Reddit post database Reddit [3020] post [3022] database sheet name is going to be [3024] generated no um oh you know we got to [3026] dump this to a Google sheet too forgot [3028] about that um we're going to add in the [3029] row number from the Reddit post that we [3032] got so it actually Returns the row [3033] number so we know that hey you know when [3034] I update the post I want to update row [3036] two and then what we want is we want [3038] post status to be [3042] published set post status to [3045] published maybe we should just say [3047] update post status it's probably a [3049] simpler oops [3051]  do not consume any more of my [3055] operations thank you very much [3059] looks pretty good um and [3061] then yeah we also need to do one more [3064] thing what I want to do here is I want [3066] to go and add another row so instead of [3069] me going here and clicking add a new row [3071] and having to like do the reconnection [3072] again I know that I have one modu that [3074] already adds a row so I'm just going to [3075] paste this [3076] in then I'm just going to remove this [3080] filter and I do that just by holding [3082] command C and then pressing command V [3085] and then what I want to do is is I want [3087] to add a row not to scraped posts but to [3089] generated posts [3091] here now I don't actually think I have [3093] the headings yet do [3095] I no so I have to add headings what [3098] headings am I going to [3100] add [3102] uh actually I guess I don't know yet [3104] because what I want to do is I just want [3105] to have a store in Google [3107] Sheets uh like a database that includes [3109] all of the campaign [3112] information so yeah technically I can't [3115] do this until I have Campa information [3117] right so let me just delete all of these [3120] um [3121] variables and then why don't we actually [3123] do the MailChimp [3125] stuff that'll be [3127] smart so let's head over to mtm.com [3131] first of [3133] all I know that there's some editable [3136] text area here thing so I just have to [3139] really quickly read through the API and [3140] just remind myself of this I've done [3142] something similar quite a while ago so [3144] it looks like in order to populate [3147] uh a Content area in MailChimp you need [3149] to include MC colon [3152] edit with the content that you [3155] provide [3157] so yeah this is interesting I've tried [3159] doing this before quite a while ago but [3161] I'm not entirely sure how so we're just [3162] going to jump in a [3165] MailChimp um see if I have this account [3168] that [3172] works which it does we'll go down to [3178] email templates I believe create [3182] template what we want to do next I think [3185] is code your [3187] own paste in code that's [3194] fine go Loop [3198] template okay great we have all of our [3200] code here nice uh what we want to do is [3204] we just want to replace [3206] hold on a [3208] sec you know where it say body you just [3210] want to replace everything inside of [3212] this with MC edit I [3215] believe then save it it's going to [3217] delete all this should anyway [3221] should just say MC edit [3223] nice and then just want to save and [3227] exit which looks good and now we want to [3230] head back into make and [3235] then yeah yeah then we go to MailChimp [3237] create a campaign let me actually add [3239] this [3241] before and [3243] [Music] [3250] then [3254] H uh yeah I did the connection with [3256] MailChimp but what would the title be I [3259] guess the title would just be title list [3261] audience ID would it just be Loop good [3266] subject line would just be [3268] title from name just be [3271] Nick at Loop uh from email address would [3274] be my email which I'm just going to use [3276] this one for it two name nothing folder [3279] ID okay so fill the body content by [3280] template ID by HTML format text and then [3282] feed in this HTML this [3285] output and then what you [3288] want is you want to go to MailChimp [3291] again do you see where it says perform a [3293] campaign action this is what you're [3296] going to want to [3298] update select the campaign ID then for [3301] Action click Send a [3303] campaign and now it's going to this is [3305] going to create the campaign in [3307] MailChimp it's going to populate the [3308] text with the HTML that we just output [3311] from the markdown to HTML module and [3314] then it's going to send the campaign um [3317] to everybody now I'm going to get into [3318] the configuration of how exactly the [3320] schedule this and stuff like that in a [3321] minute so I don't think you we actually [3323] have to send this as part of the test [3324] but um that that is more more or less [3326] the logic here through MailChimp you [3328] could probably do the same thing [3329] through clavio as well I I actually [3332] don't entirely know I know for sure like [3334] the thing about a lot of these um [3336] inbound or newsletter platforms is a lot [3338] of them don't provide you a way to [3340] create a campaign using an API or update [3342] the content of a campaign they actually [3344] want to lock you into like dragging and [3345] dropping stuff so I know Ma trip allows [3348] you to do this definitively [3350] realistically you could probably try [3351] this with all the other main ones like [3352] clavio active campaign and so on and so [3354] forth but yeah this is what we're going [3355] to use with that time smiling yellow [3357] monkey uh and then we're going to go add [3361] a new [3363] post and then what we want is campaign [3366] web type okay so I actually just need to [3368] I need to do this once we just need to [3371] see how this goes so I'm going to go run [3374] once we're actually going to connect all [3376] the pieces here and this is really like [3377] our our end to end test if you think [3379] about it I'm assuming that you know [3381] we're sending this once a week let's do [3382] like Monday or something Monday probably [3384] makes the most sense uh Monday like [3386] seven or eight I'll show you guys how to [3388] hook that up inside of appify [3390] stuff okay so yeah there's there's an [3393] issue here why oh because at let's just [3397] go Nick at [3398] Loop let's run this puppy [3401] again yeah melch told me what the error [3404] was which is that there was an at sign [3405] in the from field and apparently you're [3407] not allowed to do that so I just got rid [3408] of that and then um reran it so we just [3412] finished we're now generating the intro [3414] on the title markdown creating the camp [3416] cign me chimp and then performing The [3418] Campaign action we actually sent it [3421] beautiful uh let me just see an archive [3424] URL long archive URL I believe this is [3426] going to contain the actual body of it [3429] yeah very cool AI ADP to cyber security [3432] retail and sports evolve and AI [3433] benchmarks fall behind welcome to Loop [3434] cutting Ed J ands explain in simple [3436] English in this week's issue three hits [3438] let's dive in nice you see that this is [3442] different than previously the reason why [3445] is because we're using different content [3447] um so we marked the content in our sheet [3451] as published and so the first time it [3453] ran did the first six second time we ran [3454] did the second six now we only have a [3456] few posts left and so in this way you [3459] basically always have like new content [3460] your news that are pretty sick okay so [3462] what do we want to do though we want to [3465] I want all this data here um campaign ID [3467] recipients HTML all this stuff so I'm [3470] just G to do the same thing I did a [3471] moment ago where I copy and paste this [3473] in chat gbt could do this [3477] turn this into the same [3481] thing um sorry let's just say use camel [3485] case for all this stuff just because the [3488] other sheet was with camel case and I [3491] believe there's something to be said [3492] about the Aesthetics of this we're going [3494] to go to data split text to columns and [3496] then bold [3498] this then paste this in here and then [3501] again sled for enter we're going to go [3503] enter and then I'm going to go back here [3505] and and we just want to map all these [3507] fields in our Google Sheets [3509] module so let us refresh the [3512] headers and let's go top to bottom [3516] campaign web type create time archive [3518] URL long archive URL email send type [3522] archive recipients [3525] collection yeah know this is actually [3526] just going to be an option isn't [3531] it yeah that's kind of annoying sorry [3534] actually let's um [3541] oh you know what [3546] uh I don't like this collection stuff [3551] but like if we dump this in we're not [3554] going to get any actual data from this [3555] just going to say object object [3563] probably hm okay for now I'm just going [3566] to dump this [3571] in um for the links let's just [3574] join [3576] links with this plain text long string [3580] HTML archived HTML okay cool we'll [3583] delete that uh looks pretty good to me [3587] let's just go here and then what we want [3589] to do is we only want to send this once [3591] a week right so I'm going to go to [3592] Monday and we'll just go I don't know [3595] six a.m. we'll say every Monday at 6 [3598] a.m. we send this [3600] puppy and then if you think about the [3605] sheet we only have three new ones that [3608] are left so why don't I go back [3611] in h and then scrape a bunch more I [3614] guess like let's just do some more [3616] scraping so let's just go to to limits [3619] and then instead of 100 let's do [3622] 200 let's actually see how this works [3625] and then what I want to do is um I want [3627] to hook this up and make this like [3628] production ready right so there's a [3629] difference when you're testing a flow [3630] versus when it's actually like being [3632] pushed to production production just [3633] means like reality so when we tested [3636] this flow we use this get data set items [3638] module but what we really want is we [3639] want there to be a way to trigger after [3642] the apfi actor is completed and then to [3644] automatically get the right data set so [3646] that the data set is dynamic it it gets [3648] updated it's different to do this you [3650] click on the get data set items you add [3652] the watch actor runs before it and then [3654] you replace the default you replace a [3656] data set ID with this default data set [3658] ID figure and then I'm just going to set [3661] the limit to let's say [3663] 200 and then over here what we have to [3665] do is we actually have to add our own [3666] hook so I'm going to say finished Reddit [3669] scraper [3671] um I see there's another one called that [3673] so I'm just going to rename this just to [3675] be safe the actor I want is I want this [3677] Reddit [3679] scraper this one [3681] here now what this is going to do is [3683] it's going to run every time that we [3685] finish [3686] and to show you guys how this works I'm [3687] actually going to click run once and [3690] then we're going to watch this get [3692] populated with a bunch of new [3694] posts and then after this is popul with [3697] a bunch of new posts we're then going to [3698] go in and we're going to we're going to [3699] run the second scenario as if it were [3701] the beginning of a new week and we're [3702] ready to pump out a [3703] newsletter so I'm pretty excited in [3706] order to get this hooked up let's go [3707] back to appify we got these three [3710] communities which looks pretty good I'm [3711] just going to click save and [3713] start and now this is going to run and [3715] and we are just going to watch it run [3718] from start to finish and just do one [3720] final end to end test of our whole [3722] flow I consider endend tests like [3725] basically a a requirement um it's one [3727] thing to test iteratively and to do [3728] things one module at a time this enables [3731] me to build quickly with a lot of [3734] modules in my flow without necessarily [3736] breaking anything and having to wonder [3737] where the hell is the error like for [3738] instance if I just dropped 10 modules [3741] and just thought yeah this seems like [3743] it'll work and then there was an error [3744] in my flow like it'd be hard to identify [3747] exactly where the problem was was it [3748] that module 2 was mis formatting the [3750] data that module 6 had the wrong [3752] function call there's a lot that that [3754] goes on but if you test iteratively with [3756] like the first module and you make sure [3758] that works inputs and outputs oras you [3760] expect second module that works inputs [3762] and up put are as you expect third [3763] fourth fifth sixth so on and so forth [3766] and basically the second that ER occurs [3768] you know that every other module before [3769] that module worked so obviously the [3771] error is with this one and this allows [3773] you to do debugging substantially faster [3776] that said after you're done with that in [3777] order to like really make sure your flow [3779] works you still need to test it end to [3780] end and my rule is I always test it as [3783] close to a production environment ass [3785] humanely possible if I'm delivering a [3786] project to a client I will ask myself [3788] hey what is a client going to provide [3789] his input what sort of fuckups are they [3791] going to make when they filled the form [3793] wrong or something and I basically try [3794] and put myself in their shoes just to [3797] determine like what my my flow would [3798] actually look like start to finish so [3801] this is currently running on a ton of [3803] these looks like we have 70 results so [3805] far a lot of these look like images so [3808] most of these are going [3810] to yeah most of these are going to um [3813] you know be filtered out of my system [3815] which is [3816] fine I think we're going to end up with [3818] 200 so we still got quite a ways to go [3821] um let me think what are some other [3825] things we might be able to add to the [3827] system yeah there are a bunch of these [3828] mid Journey apis which are [3831] unofficial I don't know if mid Journey [3833] has an API yet yeah no they only have [3836] the uh The Unofficial [3838] ones but basically what you can do is [3840] you can hook up to something like this [3842] and then what this is doing behind the [3843] scenes is it's just calling um Mid [3845] journey through their interface and then [3847] ret return the results to you like an [3848] API call so what you could do is you [3850] could just um you know over [3854] here where we generate the introduction [3856] and title you could also generate three [3858] image prompts or something and then [3861] generate three images with this and then [3864] you could distribute them every third [3867] snippet or something um and then VOA I [3870] have a bunch of images I think I've [3871] mentioned the link stuff but if you go [3873] to perplexity here you could create a [3875] chat completion with perplexity and when [3877] you look up something with perplexity [3879] like let's let's take one of these [3880] Reddit thread posts for [3883] example I'm going to feed this [3886] in and then look this is going to return [3889] some citations one two three what you do [3893] then is you feed in your title here and [3897] then sorry you feed in your snippet and [3899] then you say hey with these three links [3901] this link that link and that link I want [3903] you to go into my snippet and then [3905] rewrite it and insert the link as [3908] markdown or you know a href equal link [3912] goes [3913] here and then you know now you have a [3915] snippet that's like Dynamic that has a [3916] bunch of links inside of it I mean there [3918] are many things that you can do in order [3919] to make this better and a little bit [3921] cleaner but um yeah I think you guys see [3924] that they're [3925] like basically once you have the core [3927] idea of a newsletter automation um you [3929] can take this any which way you want now [3932] keep in mind I've scraped almost 200 [3934] entries here and hasn't even cost me a [3935] dollar those 200 entries are probably [3938] equivalent to just based off the math at [3940] least 40 or maybe 50 um pieces of news [3942] those 40 or 50 pieces of news [3944] effectively and you know it's not great [3946] to post news from last month but [3948] effectively they allow you to like [3949] continue going for a whole month um so [3952] this whole scraping cost could be less [3954] than a dollar a month which to me is [3955] pretty crazy to think that you can get a [3957] fully automated newsletter for a dollar [3959] for the data probably like another 50 [3962] cents or so for the token usage in the [3963] operation usage you get this whole thing [3965] done for a $150 a week like you are Off [3968] to the Races you are laughing to the [3970] bank obviously you still have to pay [3971] money to MailChimp you have to pay money [3973] to whatever the provider is that you're [3974] going to be sending the emails with but [3977] yeah okay great so we just finished this [3979] we are now going into chat PT this flow [3982] is now filtering through um and add [3985] things that are relevant as you see the [3987] first few were not new which is why [3990] they've been filtered out we had four [3992] that existed but only one that actually [3993] made it to the end this is worth saying [3996] um if you guys also have a low rate [3999] limit if you guys are on a low tier then [4001] you might want to add like a sleep [4002] module before or after this flow the [4004] reason being um this is going to consume [4007] a lot of operations like if we go here [4009] and we go to usage you see I'm consuming [4011] 222 tokens and I'm basically doing it 1 [4014] 2 3 four five like about two or three [4016] times a second so that's like 600 tokens [4019] a second so 600 time 60 seconds about [4022] 36,000 tokens a minute which I believe [4024] sets you a little bit over um the [4026] default limit provided for tier ones so [4028] just keep that in mind um as you are [4030] doing you know these these token wise [4032] heavy [4033] operations okay so obviously this is [4034] working let's head back over to our [4036] Google sheet let's see what's going on [4038] we see some posts redit is joining the [4040] AI Market that's new scroll all the way [4041] to the right here we got a bunch of more [4043] new ones pretty sweet LM hallucinations [4046] world's second fastest supercomputer oo [4048] very clean I am still noticing that a [4051] lot of these have the images um text [4054] here so I'm not liking this now that I'm [4056] running this again I'm noticing that [4058] tons of them just say [4059] images so there are a couple other [4061] things I could do I could set a [4062] procedural filter where when it has [4065] images like this what I do is I um I [4067] just like I don't allow it through so [4070] relevant would not only include the AI [4072] relevant thing but it would also [4074] include um a call that says if this [4076] contains the text Capital IM m a g s [4080] with a colon immediately afterwards then [4083] don't allow in um and that seems pretty [4085] reasonable yeah that's probably what I'm [4087] going to do um you could also update the [4090] AI prompt to do that for you I mean you [4092] know kind of the way that I see it is [4093] like if you're going to be consuming [4094] this many tokens anyway that's like a [4096] pretty quick and easy hack I think in my [4098] case the images hack makes sense though [4100] so that's what I'm going to do after [4101] this is [4102] done okay we just finished with all of [4105] these so what I'm going to do is I'm [4107] just going to make sure that this [4111] body does not contain images with this [4115] line here with this colon I should say [4118] so this was only now going to proceed if [4120] this does not contain said colon and [4123] then awesome what we're going to do now [4125] is we're just going to write a whole [4126] newsletter let me just see am I sending [4128] this to myself am I going to get this [4130] yes I've already gotten one cool I'm [4132] going to run this now it's going to go [4134] through and it's going to select six and [4136] I want you guys just to pay attention to [4137] what's happening here we're updating [4140] each of these from new to published on [4141] the right hand side right so you're [4142] seeing this is basically now [4144] incorporating this into the flow it's [4146] pretty [4148] sexy we're not going to aggregate the [4150] headlines on the snippits write the [4152] intro in the title convert it to [4154] markdown create the campaign and then [4157] perform the campaign action uh it does [4159] look like there's an issue the Google [4161] sheet [4162] unfortunately and it's what I thought [4163] the collection um is Raising issue here [4166] which which blows but essentially [4168] anything that has like a nested [4169] collection here um is is not going to [4171] work [4172] so let's see uh recipients collection [4176] here [4179] H maybe we just [4182] want list ID [4186] instead so I'm just going to store this [4188] settings I'm just going to replace these [4190] with other variables settings collection [4194] is just going to be [4198] subject [4201] line then tracking collection is just [4204] going to [4205] be HTML [4210] clex and then delivery [4214] status collection I'm just putting these [4216] in my URL bar so that I can just [4218] remember them [4220] later [4221] um oh actually we don't need this we [4224] could just go [4228] enabled tracking collection was going to [4231] be HTML clicks settings [4234] collection uh was going to be what did [4236] we say subject line up here and [4239] recipients collection we're going to be [4241] list ID uh links array I think that [4243] should be okay I'm not entirely [4246] sure maybe we [4249] want [4252] H we just feed in the first one okay [4255] cool should be sufficient now I'm just [4257] going to go back to my Google sheet and [4259] just update this cuz I don't want this [4260] to break again obviously we can only run [4262] this a limited number of times right uh [4265] why don't we go through and run this one [4268] more [4269] time and what we want is we want to [4271] update this call this list ID want to [4272] call this subject line want to call this [4275] HTML clicks and then we want to call [4277] this ooh uh I don't remember what we [4281] call that probably should have [4283] written that [4284] down hm [4286] anyway we did get all of the Texs which [4288] is nice um there's this giant blue wall [4291] in front of us because anytime that you [4293] add something to a Google sheet um it [4296] will automatically inherit the style of [4298] the element above it so that's what [4300] that's for but we can fix that just by [4302] selecting all of the elements and then [4303] sticking it here okay great and now we [4306] have [4309] uh we have the plain text long string as [4312] well with the actual whole newslet [4315] letter just listed here which is [4317] cool and here as well and this is HTML [4321] the pl text long string is going to [4322] include some stuff like um Telephone [4324] unsub links and so on and so forth Just [4325] because that's what MailChimp does but [4327] uh it doesn't actually like exist in [4329] actuality and voila we now have our [4332] finished [4334] system with our [4337] newsletter had a lot of fun putting that [4339] one together um if you wanted to change [4341] the style or whatever you could do so by [4342] changing the HTML template but man is [4345] that sexy and is that completely [4349] autonomous last but not least before we [4351] finish let me just show you guys how to [4353] schedule this so that this runs whenever [4355] the hell you want so um there were two [4357] scenarios right there was scenario one [4359] which sourced the data and scenario two [4361] which actually did something with the [4362] data for scenario 2 just head over the [4363] schedule and make sure this is set for [4365] days of the week if you wanted to send [4367] this weekly and then like Monday uh [4370] Thursday whatever with a time down here [4372] and then just make sure to to clarify [4374] whether it's a A.M or p.m once this is [4376] done just turn this on a custom schedule [4378] click on then head back to the first one [4382] where it says watch actor runs you'll [4383] notice that this scheduler is um a [4386] little lightning symbol which stands for [4387] immediately basically this is awaiting a [4389] web hook so if you wanted this to work [4392] autonomously for you you'd have to go to [4393] schedule and then you'd have to create a [4395] new schedule in appify then go [4399] weekly and then just have this run [4401] whenever you want in my case uh Sunday [4404] at 12:00 a.m. UTC is is [4406] perfect and then uh go down here to add [4409] click actor and then just go to Reddit [4411] scraper or light the input is just going [4414] to be whatever those three or four [4416] however many subreddits you want were so [4419] we click save we then click save and [4420] enable and now we have a schedule where [4423] this is now triggered completely [4425] autonomously I'll say scrape Reddit [4429] weekly and basically what's going to [4431] happen is once a week that is going to [4433] trigger every time that that trigger [4435] that is going to trigger the um dump to [4438] Google sheet automation which was [4439] automation number one after that's done [4442] that's going to automatically update [4444] this big sheet of ours and you know you [4446] don't have to do this once a week you [4447] could do this like two or three times a [4448] week if you wanted to like Source tons [4449] of posts right but anyway after that's [4451] done um then this which will also occur [4454] once per week in our case Monday at 6: [4456] a.m. again you can do this as many times [4458] as you want we'll go through that sheet [4460] autonomously and will'll update all of [4462] the new posts to published as they are [4464] sourced and used in actual content and [4466] so in this way we have effectively [4468] created a closed loop automation which [4470] does all of this completely without any [4472] sort of human Intervention which is why [4474] an approach like this can be so goddamn [4476] powerful I really hope you guys like [4478] that video had a lot of fun putting the [4479] system together if you have any [4480] questions about how I did so feel free [4482] to leave them down below as a comment [4484] and as I mentioned at the beginning of [4485] this clip I take a lot of my requests [4486] from viewers now so um yeah I'm more [4488] than happy to build out a system as long [4490] as I haven't done it before and I'm just [4491] like doing the same thing over and over [4492] and over again uh aside from that do the [4495] fun YouTube stuff like subscribe get me [4497] to the top of the Alo if you haven't [4498] already subbed my watchtime um rate of [4501] non-subscribers to subscribers is going [4503] way up just because I'm getting more and [4505] more popular but if you find yourself in [4506] the unsubscribe Camp please do me a [4508] solid and subscribe and yeah I'll catch [4510] youall in the next video really [4511] appreciate the time

Title: The LinkedIn Parasite System (Social Media AI Growth Hack)
[0] hey everybody Nick here in this video [1] I'm going to build out an endtoend AI [3] parasite content system for LinkedIn [5] that uses make.com to Source posts from [8] high quality or very engaged people and [10] then repurposes them with AI into our [12] own tone of voice to help us publish on [14] our own LinkedIn and grow faster this is [16] a viewer request so if you guys have [18] your own systems that you want to see me [19] put together in front of you then drop [21] them down below and if it's one that I [22] haven't done before then I'll absolutely [24] build it for you without further Ado [25] let's get into the system so I want to [27] be abundantly clear I have actually yet [29] to build this system I haven't put any [30] of the moving pieces together I did like [32] a 30 second search before this just to [34] verify that I could get the data um that [36] you know I could put this together [37] logically but I didn't actually like do [40] any of the the the make.com automation [42] stuff or any of the actual running of [43] set scrapers um the reason why I do this [46] is because I've noticed that a lot of [47] people on YouTube they will just show [48] you the end result of the system as [50] opposed to what went into building it [52] you know it's almost like if you wanted [53] to become an engineer or an architect [55] and you just like look at a finished [56] building and somebody says okay great [58] now now you know what to do right you [60] have no idea so my goal with my channel [61] is just to show people what like an [63] actual automation developer automation [65] engineer mindset um is while you're [67] actually like going through and [68] developing it so this is the extent of [71] my work essentially um what I'm thinking [73] of doing is we're going to start by [74] scraping LinkedIn posts and I know that [76] there are variety of scrapers available [78] to do this because I've used a variety [80] of different scraping platforms on [81] LinkedIn and it's worked kind of 50-50 [82] it's worked pretty well next I'm [84] thinking you know we need to store the [86] posts somewhere I don't just want to [88] like take the posts and then you know do [90] the rewriting and then just like forget [92] about them it'd be really useful if you [93] think about it for for future purposes [95] to just always have this big database of [97] posts that we can refer to um and then [99] the cool benefit there is we can check [100] to see if a post is new as opposed to a [102] post being old so I'm thinking of [104] storing them in a database with the [105] unique ID when I say database here it [107] can be pretty intimidating to some [108] people but it's really just a Google [109] sheet so don't sweat it uh if it's new [112] I'm thinking we're going to use AI to [113] rewrite those posts in our own tone of [114] voice and then assuming that you know uh [117] We've we've done the rewriting and we're [118] happy with it we'll then post these on [120] our personal or company Pages however we [122] want with whatever Cadence that we want [124] so variety of ways that we can [125] accomplish all of these things I'm going [126] to walk you through my mindset if I were [128] to approach this project like for a [130] client uh or if I were to try and build [132] this up for myself this is exactly what [134] I would do and I'm just going to try and [135] like narrate myself building this so [137] everybody uh is on the same page [138] everybody understands what's going on [140] and if there are any like minor mistakes [141] that I make along the way any syntax [143] errors or whatever I'll just keep them [144] in the video so you guys can understand [146] how I tackle them and so on and so forth [149] okay so the first we need to do is we [150] need to scrape LinkedIn post now I've [151] actually I've signed up to a variety of [153] LinkedIn post scrapers in the past for [155] um other projects typically what I'll do [157] is I'll go over to appify if you guys [159] are unfamiliar with appify appify is [162] basically a big marketplace with a bunch [164] of scrapers that people have put [165] together for the purposes of scraping [167] these social media platforms and so [169] anytime I have a need for some social [171] media data or like some some website um [174] data I don't try and build my own [176] scraper from scratch anymore because [178] that takes absolutely [180] forever and it's super ripe with a [182] number of problems that I'm not going to [184] get into um just for the purposes of [186] brevity essentially appify is just this [188] Open Marketplace where you can build [190] something that has value and then you [191] can just charge people a little bit of [192] money to use it and they can either do [194] so on a per results basis or uh uh like [197] a monthly basis or like a server usage [200] basis or whatever but it ends up being [202] quite cheap on a per record basis um [203] personally so that's what I go with now [206] what we're going to do for this is I'm [207] just going to type in LinkedIn post up [209] here I've already made an account which [210] is why I have my little profile picture [212] here so if you haven't done that yet [213] just go through the rigor moral sign up [214] they'll give you $5 in free credit so [216] you can test out this flow and I see a [218] variety of different ones here I've used [220] this one in the past and I verified that [222] this worked uh so this is probably the [224] one that we're going to be going with [225] there's a LinkedIn post information [227] scraper LinkedIn post reaction scraper [229] post like scraper post reaction scraper [232] basically what I want is I want [233] something that scrapes posts with the [236] post copy right like I want the text of [238] the post because I'm going to take that [240] text and then I'm going to use it to [241] rewrite and then pump it into our [242] make.com scenario um I was just on [245] LinkedIn here browsing through a variety [246] of people's profiles Mato just some guy [248] that I follow and he follows me back [250] probably because of YouTube or maybe [251] he's in my community um but this is a [253] good example of the sort of thing that I [255] would want to do I would basically want [256] to get content from people like this I [259] would then want to um you know repurpose [262] this Con you know like take the copy [264] here as long as it is we want to be able [266] to get the full Copy [267] Text uh and then we're going to like [269] rewrite a little bit make it make it our [271] own and then we're going to want to post [273] it so we're going to need something that [273] delivers the text we're also going to [275] need something like it would be cool if [276] we' got the image although now that I'm [278] thinking about it if we do get the image [279] it's going to be kind of like imagine [281] you um doing this ostensibly super [284] unethical thing and they just using the [286] exact same image as the person you know [288] ideally we'd be able to modify the [289] images a little bit I don't know if we [290] could necessarily do that with AI like [293] there's just such a wide problem area so [294] no I'm probably going to keep the images [296] out of there um it's a shame that images [298] that are super engagement tend to do [301] well another thing that's coming to me [303] just as I'm I'm running through this is [305] if you think about it probably we're [307] going to need to have a filter step [309] before so it's not just that it's new [313] it's we scrape LinkedIn posts then we [316] determine if these are like evergreen or [319] personal the reason why is because let's [322] say somebody goes on LinkedIn and then [323] just makes a post about like a a coffee [326] chat that they had with a friend of [327] theirs we don't want to repurpose that [329] and say yeah had a great coffee chat [330] with Peter because that'll just be a [332] waste of content obviously we don't know [334] Peter and there's no real purpose there [336] so um we're going to have to do some [338] sort of AI filtering there too which uh [340] which I'll cover but yeah so I think we [343] have more or less everything we need [344] we'll use Google Sheets for this we'll [345] use AI for this this is going to require [346] a little bit of prompt finagling um but [348] you know anyway I think you guys are [350] tired of just seeing me scope the [351] project so let's actually go and do it [353] to be to be honest I would not spend [354] more than 5 or 10 minutes doing the [356] scoping um on like a real client project [358] or my own just because I typic Ty Al [359] learn a lot while I do the thing but [362] anyway let's start with getting the data [363] from our data source so I'm going to go [365] LinkedIn post [366] scraper and I just have a little window [368] here I'm going to have to move to the [369] top right uh this is going to ask us a [371] couple of things it's going to ask us [372] for cookies looks like so we're going to [374] need to grab some cookies here the way [376] that you do this on appify is you tend [378] to use a little browser extension called [379] the cookie editor which I've already [381] downloaded so if you guys don't have the [383] cookie editor um if you just Mouse over [384] this question mark probably yeah it [386] includes a little direct link to some [389] service and the way that this works is [390] you go on LinkedIn you go to your cookie [393] editor you just click export as Json so [396] I'm going to go back here and I'm going [397] to paste this puppy [399] in and now we have all of our cookies [401] inside um I don't know who this is [404] probably just some guy I was scraping [405] posts for before yes so I'm just going [407] to run this as a as an example thank you [409] very much R and then we can set a limit [412] of the number of um posts that we want [413] to scrape from The Source uh looks like [416] we also have the ability to scrape some [417] additional information I'm not really [418] sure what the hell that means [420] likes comments screw it why the hell not [422] we can also get the raw data I don't [424] know what that means but I'm just going [425] to run this thing first before I make [426] any more assumptions so let's click save [429] and start and let's just let this puppy [431] go the idea here is I'm going to let it [434] run wild um which actually now that I'm [437] thinking about it may not be good [438] because how many posts is it going to [439] scrape a ah whatever uh we see that [442] the LinkedIn account was successfully [443] detected so basically just took my [444] cookies and then used that to get in uh [446] and if we go to Output here we'll [448] actually see what it's what it's [449] generating for us so I'm just going to [451] preview this in a new tab just see all [453] of the [455] data [457] um oh sorry right over here [462] so looks [465] like yeah okay so it looks like um if [467] it's an article then it has a bunch of [469] additional [470] information and [472] then there's some information around the [474] background image of the [476] person okay it looks like there are a [478] variety of different post Types on link [479] so let's just see the post copy where's [483] the post copy [485] here okay right over here it's in this [487] text field so right now we're using a [489] they can do specific things like search [490] the web or drive the car this is called [491] narrow a the next step is make a they [493] can think and learn like a human this is [494] called General a perfect so this is [496] exactly the sort of thing that we'd want [497] to repurpose so I can actually use this [498] as like a test [499] case beautiful beautiful so um this is [502] this is everything that we need in order [503] to do good good work uh I guess we could [505] also check to see if there is an image [508] if there is an image we could pass that [509] through Ai and then we could ask you [511] know is this image relevant to us if it [512] is then great if not then not the end of [514] the world um the most important thing [516] when you're doing any sort of appi [517] scraping is just go to storage and what [519] you want is you want the data set ID you [520] just want to copy that over now in our [523] make scenario I'm just going to type in [525] appify now what I want to do is I want [526] to get the um data set items down here [530] the reason why I'm doing it this way and [532] I just have to select the write account [533] because I know I have a few is this just [535] allows me to pull all of that data for [537] the flow that I just ran so I'm [538] hardcoding the data set ID I'm feeding [541] it into this module called get data set [542] items and then I'm requesting it to give [544] me all of this data the value here is [547] you know we just took the data from [548] appify and now it's in make if you [550] haven't done you know the connection and [551] stuff like that just remember you're [552] going to have to do that as well super [554] easy just a little API key um I'll leave [556] that out for brevity but yeah we've [558] basically accomplished the first major [559] purpose in my mind which is getting the [560] data to make so now that the data is in [562] make we can actually do stuff with it [563] right so the very first thing I'm going [566] to want to do is I'm just going to want [567] to go through these fields soort of [569] mentally here and I'm seeing that [571] there's like there's different [572] types it looks like there's like a short [574] string and then there's a long string so [576] I guess after a certain character count [578] make just um makes this a little toggle [580] field [581] instead but yeah this looks pretty good [584] are there any images [586] here looking for images I'm not seeing [589] any images maybe attributes [592] no h I'm seeing profile pictures which [594] is cool but you know I don't really [596] think we can do anything with the [597] profile picture can we reactions [601] comments looks like this scraper is also [603] scraping for reactions and comments and [605] stuff which is cool now this guy that [606] I'm doing the scraping on he's not like [608] super famous or anything I imagine you [610] know if he was super famous the number [611] of shares likes comments and stuff that' [613] be like a good piece of data for us we [614] could use [616] that okay cool um anyway I think we have [618] more or less everything we need so what [620] I'm going to do is I'm just going to [621] start building out uh the GPT prompts so [626] you know I uh I can verify whether or [628] not this is a general post or this is to [629] something specific or or particular so [633] like I basically want to verify that [634] this is going to be Evergreen right so [637] let's do that let's go to [638] GPT and the way that I always build [640] these things out is I'm just building [642] them one module at a time the reason why [644] I'm building them one module at a time [646] is I just want to make sure that [648] whatever I do it is um I you know if [651] there was to be an issue with this flow [653] I would know exactly where it broke if I [655] don't do it this way you know I Tred [656] just like slamming slapping like 15 mod [659] modes on the page and then trying to [661] test it well then I don't know it could [662] be any one of the 15 modules but if I [664] test every module one by one then I know [666] exactly where the error is when the [668] error happens because I know it wasn't [669] in any of the previous modules obviously [671] the one that I'm screwing around with [672] now so I'm just going to have two steps [673] I'll have like a simple um filter post [676] step and this is just going to be like a [677] dumber sort of model it's going to be [680] simpler so I'm just going to scroll down [682] to model we'll just do GPT 40 I say dber [686] meanwhile it's like smarter than my hat [690] um the system prompt I'm going to use [692] here just off the top of my head you are [694] you're a helpful intelligent assistant I [698] would just say writing [701] assistant and then in order to set a [704] good prompt um usually I'll do I'll do [706] this structure I'll do system first and [709] then that'll just Define what the prompt [711] or what the am model like identifies as [713] and then I'll do a user prompt after [715] where I give it the instructions and [716] then after I'll give it at least one [718] user user assistant pair so it'll be [721] system user user assistant and then [724] after that I will put another assistant [726] uh sorry another user prompt where I [728] actually ask it for the data the best [731] way to build these flows out is usually [732] to treat the AI as just like an API [734] endpoint so I'm going to be sending it [736] some Json JavaScript object notation and [738] I'm going to be getting some Json back [739] so I know that for sure um and if I [741] click on show advanced settings there's [742] actually now an option for this under [744] response format where you can actually [745] just ask for stuff in Json treat it like [747] an API call then have it return data to [749] you but how are you actually going to do [751] this I'll say your task [754] is is to identify whether or not a post [758] is [761] Evergreen or [763] personal Evergreen posts are [767] about um general concepts ideas um facts [773] movements opinions statements [775] Etc personal posts are about [780] are about [783] uh [787] something personal posts are about a [791] specific person or about an event in the [795] posters [797] life or about [804] something okay I probably go with [806] that A good rule of thumb is [810] if the post [813] discusses something that is relevant [816] only to the poster it is personal if the [819] post discusses a broader idea [823] concept or subject it is [828] Evergreen return your result in Json [831] using this format and then I will [833] go um ver let's just call it [837] verdict personal okay cool that looks [840] good to me I'm then going to go and [843] provide a user um [844] example I'm going to [847] say post text or actually let's just go [850] post and then why don't we actually go [852] and like find a personal thing so I'm [855] going go back on this [858] fella um agents the cold Callum what's [860] your favorite combination of channels [862] stay tuned this is him and a [864] friend okay great oh beautiful beautiful [868] cool so this is a great example of a [870] personal post that I would not want um [872] duplicated right so we're just going to [874] paste all of this [876] in and I'm realizing now that a lot of [878] these are going to have tons of new [879] lines so what I'm going to do when I [881] feed it in is I'm actually going to [882] remove all the new lines this is also [884] just a good idea in general [886] when uh you know what I could just feed [889] this [890] in feed this into Ai and have it do it [892] all for [896] me and then um yeah the the benefit in [899] removing the new lines is you also have [900] slightly shorter um like fewer tokens so [904] I'm going to go post and then I'll go [908] assistant then I'll go verdict and I'll [910] go [912] personal and then um let's go user one [915] more time and then what I want to do is [917] now I want to provide an actual post so [919] I'm just going to go here to where it [921] say post [922] text then I'm going to close that off [925] and then yeah this looks pretty good to [926] me I don't see any major problems here [928] so we're just going to give it a try um [929] the first thing I have to do though is I [930] just have to head back to my get data [931] set items and I just have to set the [932] limit to one cuz I only want to do this [934] on one post basically I just want to see [935] how it performs on real [937] data okay result was Evergreen awesome [941] what was the text that we fed in there [943] let's go to [945] messages yeah this is basically exactly [947] what I wanted looks like it actually [948] even worked with the new lines which is [950] cool the reason why is because we're [951] just feeding this into GPT so this is [953] this wouldn't actually be like a good [955] like um a properly formatted API call [957] because there's a bunch of new lines in [958] here but because we're just feeding into [960] GPT as like content it doesn't really [961] matter uh we could we could fix this so [964] we could make this better and that's [965] what I'm going to do just for token [967] brevity purposes just to keep the [968] contact as short as possible and then [970] just make sure everything's formatted in [971] the right way I'll just go replace then [972] I'm just going to go um grab all the new [974] lines and I'm just going to replace all [975] the new lines with um let's just go [977] spaces [979] instead and then something isn't working [982] here why oh [984] yeah okay great now I'm going to do the [986] same thing it's going to give me the [987] result probably much faster [989] then I'm just going to check the content [991] nice that looks pretty good to me no [993] major problems here at all so we now [995] have basically a working filter this [997] filter I've only tested it on one result [999] but uh just based off my intuition of [1000] how these models work it's probably [1001] going to do pretty well I'm not saying [1003] that I have the best prompt ever but [1004] it's a pretty good prompt and I'm going [1005] to make sure to you know paste it over [1007] so you guys can just copy this in your [1008] own flows whenever you want so now we [1010] have a way to filter the post kind of [1011] the next step in my mind is we need to [1012] add this somewhere right we need to um [1014] add this to a Google sheet U preferably [1016] so I'm going to go over to uh uh let's [1020] go sheets. new let's actually put [1022] together a spreadsheet that we can use [1024] for this purpose so I'm go add a row [1027] what I have to do first is I actually [1027] have to like just connect this we'll go [1029] LinkedIn post and this will just be our [1032] like our LinkedIn post [1034] database and let's think about this [1036] really quickly first we're just going to [1038] want to make sure that this verdict is [1040] equal to Evergreen before [1043] proceeding and then everything that [1044] makes it in here is going to dump [1046] directly in here which means that now we [1047] need a bunch of um headers in our [1050] spreadsheet or in our database I should [1051] say like you know spreadsheet database [1053] same difference to be [1054] honest and yeah I can already see a [1057] bunch of valuable Fields here so um I [1059] could just map all these myself um and I [1061] have done this before but it's actually [1062] a lot easier if you just um basically [1065] get AI to do all of this stuff for you [1066] so I'm just going to paste all of this [1068] in uh sorry hold on there might be some [1072] additional data that that's relevant to [1073] us I'm just going to go on download [1075] output bundles and you see here we [1076] basically have all the data right [1080] so I don't really care about the author [1083] I don't really care about the author [1084] well actually author profile ID yeah no [1087] I don't really care about [1091] that it's not super relevant to [1094] me so let's just do okay let's just get [1098] AI to turn this into things for us like [1100] turn this into headings for us so I'm [1102] just going to copy all the stuff over [1104] and then I'm gonna open up my AI model [1105] which is just on my on my browser and [1107] I'll just say [1112] into um [1115] this this is Json that I'm putting [1120] into that I'm building a spreadsheet [1124] for um take all of the key names and [1127] turn this into list of headers in [1132] CSV then I'm going to paste this in and [1134] then I'm just going to remove the stuff [1136] that isn't really relevant the stuff [1137] that I don't really want um so I don't [1138] want all this author information for [1140] instance so the reactions to be honest I [1142] don't really care yeah I don't want to [1144] like store every [1147] reaction uh and it looks like there are [1149] a bunch of reactions here let just take [1150] all those [1153] out and [1155] then author um I don't really care about [1159] that except for the first and the last [1161] name I would say so oh actually we can [1163] just get the profile ID the profile ID [1165] is is good enough get the profile [1167] picture sure [1170] um and then what else author profile you [1171] post it okay awesome so I'm just going [1173] to pump that in it's now going to [1174] basically take this and generate just a [1176] list of headings that I can just paste [1177] into my Google sheet so I'll go back [1181] here and then what I need to do in order [1183] to split this into all of my headings is [1185] I just need to go split text to columns [1186] here and now I have a list of headings [1189] which I can just bold and then you know [1193] kind of organized in this way this looks [1195] pretty good to me I have most of what I [1196] want already which is nice and then all [1198] I need to is I just need to make this um [1199] accessible to my other account that's [1202] actually going to be managing [1203] this so I'm just going to call myself an [1206] editor share this with [1208] me and then I'm going to go back here [1211] and now we're actually going to try [1212] adding some of the data into our [1214] spreadsheet which is pretty [1215] cool I basically use AI to do all of [1218] these little things now um I used to do [1220] it myself but if you just do the math on [1221] it uh yeah you can save quite a bit [1223] sorry I need to go I think with shared [1225] with me because I technically shared [1226] this one I didn't make it inside of that [1228] account so I'm going to go shared with [1230] me and then I'll go LinkedIn posts [1234] perfect and now we're going to go to [1236] sheet one inside of sheet one we're [1238] going to have a bunch of fields now we [1241] just have to do the particular laborious [1243] thing of just matching them all so let's [1245] go over here and let's just pump it in [1247] um is repost Ur this is going to be our [1250] this is going to be our unique ID [1251] actually so now now that I'm thinking [1253] about it we should probably change this [1255] let's just drag this over here and then [1258] this is going to be here um this doesn't [1262] work like this says is repost but it's [1265] actually just column A so I know Ur n is [1267] going to be in column A is repost is [1269] going to be column B from here on out we [1271] can just proceed and what I'm doing is [1272] I'm just pressing tab here and then I'm [1274] just clicking on the thing that I want [1276] um this is just going to make it [1277] substantially faster attributes and [1279] comments probably technically won't work [1281] to be honest because these are nested [1282] but uh that's [1285] okay um can post comments can share [1289] commenting disabled allow commenters [1291] root share share [1292] audience other profile ID that's what I [1294] want so here here here here here here [1300] here and then post it at post it at ISO [1303] and then input your awesome so now we [1305] we're going to get all this data and [1306] it's going to pump into our spreadsheet [1307] so I'm going to run this it's Evergreen [1309] and voila now the reason this is bolded [1311] is just because um you know the first [1314] header row was bolded and it's just [1315] going to do the same thing that it sees [1317] I don't like how this is spread on all [1318] these lines so I'm just going to go into [1319] my Google sheet and then I'll just go [1322] clip so I don't want this to be wrapping [1325] then I'm [1327] also [1329] um hold on a second why is this so [1332] annoying and [1334] big I think I need to do [1337] this I don't like it okay there we go uh [1340] which is nice and then really thing that [1342] matters for us is this Ur n Li activity [1344] this is going to be like our our unique [1346] thing when you see you when I see UR and [1348] I'm thinking Universal Resource number [1350] or something um earn meaning in code [1355] Universal resource name permanent [1356] identifier right which is basically [1358] exactly what we want okay so now we have [1361] um our database but let's just make this [1362] a little bit prettier because I like [1364] when this is [1366] prettier nice nice and blue you know [1369] what let's let's change the text [1373] enter that's good okay great um and what [1376] do we have we have this text column [1377] which is the thing that we really want [1378] this is what we're going to be using to [1379] like generate our data [1382] so uh we can do this in a variety of [1384] ways we could [1386] do you know what we should probably do [1388] we should [1390] store okay now I'm thinking in my head I [1392] want this to be like a good future [1393] solution future proof I want us to be [1395] able to use this for as long as humanly [1397] possible so if I wanted to make this [1399] really really future proof I would [1400] probably store the outgoing posts as [1402] well as the incoming posts what I mean [1404] by that is this might be like the source [1407] posts or scraped [1410] posts and then this might be like the [1412] generated posts or [1414] something because what we're going to do [1416] is now now that we have this data we can [1418] feed this in AI we can have it rewrite [1419] it what we can do is we can add it to [1421] generated posts as well we're going to [1423] need different um headers than scrap [1426] posts and we're also going to have to [1427] change the sheet name here because right [1429] now it's sheet one but what we needed to [1431] say is we needed to say scraped posts [1433] otherwise our automation will break um [1436] they use the sheet name in the API call [1439] uh and then what we're probably going to [1442] want to do is we're just going to want [1442] to grab the text of [1444] it and then we're going to pump it in [1447] generated post alongside this Ur just in [1449] case we ever need to reference the two [1452] back and [1454] then I'm just thinking what [1457] else I think that's all to be [1460] honest you know maybe we'll do user as [1463] well yeah so let's do this let's um [1467] let's grab all of these [1470] headings then I'll go [1472] Ur and then we'll go [1476] text and then we don't need any of these [1478] because these are all likes and comments [1479] and stuff we can get rid of all this [1481] stuff all this stuff let's just keep the [1482] author [1485] information profile ID profile picture I [1487] mean we don't really need the profile [1488] picture do we I do I do like having the [1491] profile ID though the idea is just we [1493] could very quickly and easily reference [1494] these between each other uh profile URL [1497] sure author you are inure post it at [1499] timestamp post it at ISO [1502] cool we'll just go [1504] here paste these [1507] in and [1510] then let's just turn these other ones [1512] from Blue back to White awesome okay [1515] great now we have basically everything [1516] that we need in order to actually go and [1517] have ai generate the post for us and [1519] this is really where the magic is going [1520] to happen so why don't we do this we'll [1522] go Evergreen first of [1526] all oh you know what I'm realizing now I [1529] think I missed the step didn't I yeah [1530] because we need to we need to store them [1533] in a database with the UN and then [1534] double check to see whether or not these [1536] are actually unique every time we add [1538] them see I wouldn't have realized this [1540] had I not done this so here's what I'm [1543] going to do right before all this and [1544] this is going to save me some tokens I'm [1545] going to go search [1547] rows and before we even do the AI [1550] filtering we're going to just check our [1552] database to make sure that this doesn't [1553] actually exist there's a quick and easy [1555] way to check databases in [1556] make.com um [1560] H I guess would it be my drive I don't [1563] know I may not be able to search things [1565] that aren't technically ours uh what was [1567] this called LinkedIn posts yeah okay [1568] yeah we [1569] can and then we want to we want to check [1572] scraped post so here's the quick and [1573] easy way to do it all we do is it gives [1575] us columns that we can filter by so we [1576] check to see if Ur is equal to this and [1580] if it's the same post as before it's not [1582] going to [1583] proceed okay so [1586] basically what we're doing is we are [1589] filtering all of the rows that we are [1591] returning and then I'm just going to [1592] check to see if this returns more than [1595] one bundle if not if it's zero then we [1597] can [1598] proceed if it's not then we have to [1602] stop so let me show you guys what this [1604] looks like in practice we're just [1605] grabbing the same data over and over and [1606] over again with the same um Ur here so [1609] because of that we're running this [1610] through our Google sheet filter step [1612] we're checking hey does any of the UR NS [1616] equal to the new Ur that we're pumping [1619] in since our sheet currently already has [1621] one that does it's going to return more [1624] than one bundle and our flow is only [1627] going to proceed if we have zero bundles [1628] or more so I'm going to click run once [1632] voila and the total number of bundles is [1634] actually one because the total number of [1636] bundles is one um it's not proceeding [1639] beautiful beautiful so now we we've [1640] actually accomplished sorry um basically [1642] all these steps so this is good this is [1645] good this is good and now we're on to [1647] this one so if NE we use a to those [1648] posts in our own ton of voice let's go [1649] back here and let's go rewrite [1655] post let me just drink from my cherry [1658] bubbly I can tell all of the carbon [1659] dioxide is currently being [1663] wasted these things are goddamn [1665] incredible do you guys haven't tried [1666] this on your own o man bubblies it's [1669] like zero calories not that I give any [1672] shits to be honest but zero calories [1674] it's just like um it's like the oil from [1677] an orang orang [1680] peel and then yeah helpful intelligent [1683] writing assistant uh and then it like [1685] satisfies that craving that I always [1687] have for that that hit of [1690] something okay so now it's time for us [1692] to design our prompt I'm going to be [1693] using the same prompt design principles [1695] that I used before where I had the [1696] system prompt up at the top your helpful [1698] intelligent assistant that just defines [1700] it the next one is going to be basically [1703] just telling it what I wanted to do what [1705] I wanted to do is I wanted to rewrite [1706] some posts for me in order for prompts [1708] to be in order for uh yeah prompts to [1710] perform as well as humanly possible [1711] generally speaking what you need to do [1713] is you need to actually take the data [1716] that you want to transform and actually [1718] do one of these Transformations at least [1720] one time so it picks up on your tone of [1722] voice picks up on what you're trying to [1723] do AI is never going to be perfect so [1725] this is not going to be like the most [1726] amazing Post in the whole wide world but [1729] if you follow along with a couple of the [1731] little tweaks that I'm going to make [1732] here it will get you 80 to 90% of the [1734] way and a lot of the time that is [1736] sufficient so let's say your [1739] task is [1742] to write a post based on the text in [1745] another post you should be heavily [1753] inspired [1756] um I'm just going to call I'm not going [1758] to say copy or rewrite because in my [1759] experience when I've used the terms copy [1761] or rewrite tend is do a really job [1763] so instead I'm going to say hey you [1764] should write a new post based on the [1766] text and Sample post you should be [1767] heavily spired by the sample [1772] post and your output should be of [1774] similar length to the input okay [1778] great now I'm going to go over to user [1782] and assistant the issue [1785] is return your post in [1788] Json using this format let's [1794] go replace U lines with backs slash n [1798] this is just for us so we'll [1801] go uh [1804] post post goes here and then I'm going [1808] to actually um the issue with writing [1810] all this stuff ourselves obviously is [1811] going to take forever so what I actually [1812] do is I get AI to write me the first [1814] example and and then I just make a bunch [1816] of tweaks the example so I'm just going [1818] to go post and then I'm just going to [1819] feed in the text from [1822] um you know the I guess module number [1827] three get data set items [1828] here now I'm noticing that I'm going I [1831] keep on trying to do the same thing I [1833] basically am trying to feed in the same [1835] variable that I was feeding in here with [1837] the replace and stuff like that I don't [1838] really want to do that I don't want to [1840] be in the habit of just like constantly [1841] feeding in the exact same thing over and [1843] over and over again generally speaking [1844] when I notice that I do something at [1846] least once I will just copy this and [1847] then I'll just add it to a set variables [1849] module instead so I'm just going to go [1851] over [1852] here just going to go set multiple [1854] variables and I'm going to stick that [1857] puppy in here [1861] instead what I'm going to do is I will [1863] say uh [1865] sanitized post and I'm just going to [1867] feed this in so I'm going to replace all [1869] the Texs with a new line you'll notice [1871] that my filter is now not really in the [1872] right place I don't want this to run [1874] three times before it determines whether [1875] or not it's new I only want it to run [1877] twice uh because I could say one and a [1879] half Ops every run right so I'm actually [1880] just going to replace this filter I go [1882] back here I'll go new then I'll just [1884] make sure that's equal to zero and then [1886] I'm just going to delete this make.com [1888] currently has a little bug where you [1890] can't see the text unless you wiggle [1891] this around a bit so that's where that's [1893] coming from awesome um and now we'll [1896] just say sanitize text and now instead [1900] of the variable that I was using before [1901] I'm just going to use the variable from [1902] this [1904] module and this does technically add [1907] operations but it makes the flow more [1909] maintainable so instead of me um having [1912] you know if I wanted to change this and [1913] I forgot I have to go through every [1915] single one of these modules and double [1916] check and be rigorous and then forget [1917] half the time if I do an update um I I [1919] know now that like hm there's a purple [1921] module here let's say 3 months from now [1923] H there's a purple module here well I [1925] let me check the variable let me see [1926] what's going on oh okay this is what's [1927] grabbing the text so I need to you know [1929] if I'm going to make any changes to the [1931] post copy I'm going to do it right over [1932] here okay great so we have the rewriting [1934] um why don't we actually run this [1935] through [1937] now and yeah let's just see how this [1939] goes uh what I want to [1942] do is I want to I just want to see how [1944] it rewrites on its very first run and [1946] then by knowing that I'll be able to [1948] tell uh you know I'll be able to [1949] basically make my changes and stuff what [1951] I'm going to do is I'm going to change a [1952] limit from 1 to two the reason why is [1954] because I wanted to go through one more [1955] and I want it to add an extra new line [1957] for me so I'm going click run [1959] once cool so it stopped the first run [1962] and just went through all of the steps [1964] on the second and you can see that you [1966] know we now have the same thing we have [1968] another row added with its own Universal [1971] Resource number which is beautiful and [1973] we actually went through and we we [1974] rewrote the [1975] text okay great so let's see the source [1978] text let's see this and let's just [1979] compare [1981] them show your resume to 100 people and [1983] you'll get 100 different opinions at Ai [1985] and applicant track system and feels [1986] even harder it's a lot right but in the [1987] end a person will hire you do not [1988] rewrite your resume 100 times the resum [1990] is one job to get you notice and help [1991] you get an interview hash resume this [1993] one to share your business idea with 100 [1995] people and each will have a different [1996] perspective toss and market trends and [1997] Technology shifts and it could seem [1998] daunting overwhelming isn't it yet [1999] ultimately it's the customer who [2000] validate your idea instead of tweaking [2003] your plan inly focus on its core purpose [2005] to solve a problem and catch the [2006] interest of your target audience okay [2009] great now that we have this I can [2012] actually take this in [2014] here and I can use it as an example okay [2019] so uh I'm going to add an assistant call [2022] here and then I will just [2027] say let's say sample post for future [2031] reference I'm going to paste this [2034] in and then this sample post actually [2038] needs to [2039] be [2043] this beautiful cool so now I have U [2046] basically my first system prompt my user [2048] prompt my other user prompt and then my [2050] assistant prompt so sort of like the [2052] last thing I actually need and I'm I'm [2053] going to go through and I'm going to [2054] touch so I'm going to make it a lot [2055] better but the last thing I just need is [2056] I I just need you know the actual data [2059] itself if you think about it which would [2061] be [2063] uh this [2065] variable over here sanitize [2069] post now you know it's going to read [2071] through the text that I'm going to touch [2073] up and make better in a second it's [2074] going to get like the idea of the tone [2076] of voice and stuff like that and then [2077] it's going to use it to write um a [2078] response to this which is beautiful okay [2081] great so now that we've done this I'm [2082] just going to click okay just to save [2083] that because I've had a nasty tendency [2085] of um exiting out of prompts that I've [2087] worked a very long time on and I'm just [2089] going to go through this and I'm just [2090] going to use my own prompt engineering [2092] sort of like best principles um and then [2095] try and make this as high quality as [2097] humanly possible [2098] now keep in mind I'm like I have a [2099] writing background and so I used to do [2100] freelance writing it's actually I got [2101] started in the AI space I uh you know [2105] was doing some freelance writing right [2106] around 2020 when gpt3 came out I was [2108] like could I automate my job and the [2110] answer to that ended up being mostly so [2112] like I'm very familiar with how this [2113] stuff works and a lot of things probably [2114] come intuitively if something doesn't um [2116] if you have any questions about what I'm [2117] doing or or maybe I don't fully explain [2119] myself just leave me a comment down [2120] below I'm W happy to walk you through it [2123] but okay let's actually run through and [2124] do some of this editing so this is the [2126] sample post this is the [2129] so basically what I'm seeing that it's [2130] doing is it's changing resume for [2131] business ID I don't want that I wanted [2133] to talk about resume [2136] so if you shared your [2141] resume with 50 people each would have a [2145] different perspective then consider [2148] market trends and Technology [2152] shifts then when you consider market [2154] trends and Technology shifts [2158] it can [2161] get [2163] maybe maybe we should say add market [2166] trends shifts and it gets even more [2171] daunting I'm just going to remove the [2173] overwhelming isn't [2178] it one thing to note ultimately it's [2182] always the customer who [2186] validates so I guess instead of customer [2188] what we want [2191] is who is it the [2192] [Music] [2196] person oh sorry hold on a second I'm [2198] actually out of the loop [2200] here each would have a different okay if [2203] you shared your resume with 50 [2206] people you'd get [2209] 50 if you asked for [2213] feedback if you ask for resume feedback [2216] from 50 people you get 50 [2220] different [2228] perspectives let's go [2236] ultimately uh if you ask for resume you [2238] 50 people you'd get 50 different [2240] perspectives there are tons of [2245] conflicting there are many conflicting [2248] beliefs and not all of them are valid [2252] ultimately you only need one [2256] person instead of trying to satisfy [2259] every Everybody understand that [2262] ultimately you only need one [2267] person to like your [2270] approach in order to get [2274] hired that looks pretty good to me I I [2277] think this is a good inspiration it's on [2279] the same subject but it's not just [2282] recopying it and pasting it um so that's [2285] pretty solid you know some of these [2286] posts are going to be pretty timely [2287] they're going to be on like events that [2290] are really really hyper relevant maybe [2292] some like news thing if you just copy [2294] and pasted the same thing you you get in [2295] a little bit of trouble but if you just [2297] took slightly different angles to say [2299] the same concept I would say um then [2302] that'll generally be a lot uh a lot [2304] better of a strategy than just copying [2307] and pasting same thing so show your [2308] resume to 100 people you get 100 [2309] different opinions at a and applicant [2311] tracking systems and it feels even [2312] harder it's a lot right but in the end a [2313] person will hire you don't rewrite [2314] resume 100 times your resume is one job [2315] to get you noticed and help you get an [2316] interview if you ask for resume feedback [2318] for 50 people you get 50 different [2319] perspectives there are many conflicting [2320] beliefs not all them are valid instead [2322] of trying to satisfy everybody [2323] understand that ultimately you need only [2324] one person to like your approach in [2325] order to get hired right for that one [2329] person cool looks pretty good to me um [2331] I'm going to go down here and I'm just [2333] going to decrease my temperature a [2334] little bit on the am model I found that [2336] that tends to improve prove the [2338] output I'm not going to muck around with [2340] any of these other settings I'm just [2341] going to click okay and then what I'm [2343] going to do is I'm going to go back here [2345] and I'm just going [2346] to no we need to do one more actually we [2349] need to do um three instead of two so [2351] I'm going go here I'll do a limit of [2354] three and then I'm just going to make [2356] sure that I've set everything up right [2358] for this final [2360] test and based off this test I'll try [2362] giving it some higher level [2364] instructions oh let me do one more thing [2368] 20 of voice [2371] guidelines write [2373] simply write with simpler shorter [2378] sentences be [2381] Spartan in [2384] [Music] [2389] tone shorter straightforward sentences [2392] let's do a b Spartan in tone [2398] use what are these called [2400] asterisks for emphasis that's sort of [2402] like how I [2404] write [2409] use use asteris for [2412] emphasis if necessary the issue with [2414] writing this is it's going to include [2416] asteris in every single [2420] post maybe I'll say flip a coin the coin [2423] comes [2425] up heads use asteris from emphasis if [2431] not if not don't we're having to run a [2434] little simulation here it's not actually [2436] going to flip a freaking coin it's just [2438] I don't want it to write with the [2440] asterisks every single [2441] time and let's see what the post result [2444] is so the message that came in was [2446] before asking for a referral pause and [2447] think why would somebody refer you is [2449] they seen you work do they know you have [2450] you worked they trust you recently [2451] receive Val advice from experienced [2452] professionals blah blah blah blah okay [2454] cool and then the result before you ask [2457] for a referral stop and consider why [2459] would they refer you do they know your [2460] work have you collaborated for is there [2461] trust I recently learned from season [2462] Pros about the power of jine [2463] relationships a referral isn't a simple [2465] ask it's a testament your abilities and [2466] characters here's my strategy building [2467] real connections showcase your work and [2469] let it make an in Impact engage sinere [2471] with others add value every time solid [2473] connections grounded in trust and [2474] respect focus on these and referrals [2475] will come naturally this looks pretty [2477] reasonable um I don't like how there [2478] aren't new lines so I'm just going to go [2480] back and just do one little tweak here [2483] where I have a couple of new lines [2484] jumping in [2488] we'll go [2489] [Music] [2491] NN then we'll [2493] go [2496] NN cool and now if I were to delete this [2501] and then run the same thing on the three [2502] posts it'll grab that final result and [2505] it'll rewrite it but it should put in [2506] some new lines because my example [2508] contained new [2509] lines and it did right so voila we have [2512] the new lines which is cool I don't [2514] really like how it's parsing the [2515] freaking new lines uh ah whatever [2521] okay so now that we have this um I just [2523] want to update this to the database for [2525] generated posts and then once it's [2526] updated in the database for generated [2528] post I'm just going to go through and [2529] then um we'll actually like hook this up [2531] to LinkedIn and then pump this out and [2533] then I'll just set uh this appify Runner [2536] or sorry I'll set a schedule in appify [2538] to have this run every so often and then [2540] maybe we can just get the data set items [2542] I don't know like every 3 hours or [2544] something and that way I'm just going to [2545] be posting stuff every 3 hours that you [2547] know somebody has posted previously in [2549] in the last 3 hours if I assemble a list [2551] of very high Roi um LinkedIn channels or [2555] LinkedIn Pages LinkedIn people I should [2557] say because we're looking for people [2559] we're not actually looking for pages I [2560] also find that Pages tend to have lower [2561] quality content then we can [2563] realistically have a post come in like [2564] every few minutes which is pretty [2566] powerful so I'm just going to go back to [2569] our spreadsheet and I'm going to go from [2571] scrape posts to generated [2575] posts and then the values are going to [2578] still be the Ur So this is going to be [2579] the UR of the source post so why don't I [2582] go like Source [2586] Ur and then the text is going to be this [2592] right here author profile [2595] ID it's going to be this sorry there's [2599] two author profile IDs where are there H [2602] we don't actually need [2603] that did I include the same thing over [2606] here [2608] no looks like I just did one must have [2609] just screwed up when I created this okay [2612] uh so C is going to be auor profile d d [2615] is going to be author name let's go [2617] author [2620] name so that'll be [2623] here then the next one will be author [2626] profile Ur on it's kind of annoying that [2629] I have to scroll down every [2632] time sorry author profile URL I should [2635] say there you go this one is going to be [2637] the UR n and this one's going to be the [2641] timestamp iso and then input [2646] URL I'm just going to delete all of the [2648] rest of these because they're not [2649] relevant to [2652] us boy was this a lot of [2658] data awesome looks good and now I should [2661] have basically everything I need in [2663] order to go and actually post it um in [2665] order to do LinkedIn posts variety of [2667] different ways to do so um you do need [2668] to make a connection with your LinkedIn [2670] that's kind of like the big um hurdle [2672] for a lot of people so I'm going to go [2674] create a user text post then I have to [2677] well I'm not actually going to like do [2678] the whole connection myself I don't [2679] think I mean maybe I will I don't [2682] know I just don't want to like show any [2684] API details here if it's just a simple [2686] ooth it should be pretty [2689] straightforward you know what I probably [2691] need to change my password too oh [2694] actually okay yeah that looks like it [2696] worked okay great uh and then for [2698] Content what I need to do is I just need [2699] to put the actual Post in so let me just [2702] see to escape reserved elements use the [2705] backslash or set of the IML function [2706] replace with search string so it looks [2709] like there are some elements that we [2712] cannot include here and I think one of [2714] them is a [2716] bracket it looks like we can tag [2719] people that's really interesting we [2721] could totally use a to do that now that [2723] we have the um yourn identifiers wow [2727] anyway um we could also make an [2729] article I'm just going to do only my [2733] let's do only my connections because I [2735] don't just want to [2737] be pumping this out to many [2740] people yeah and yeah I don't want [2742] anybody to see this because it's just [2743] going to be a test I'm just going none [2745] um and then we're just going to give [2747] this a try see how it goes let's go back [2749] to my own LinkedIn nice that it was just [2751] um oo eh a lot of the time you got to do [2754] much more than ooth for this it's super [2756] annoying [2757] and then I just need to find where my [2758] posts are I don't think I've actually [2759] made a LinkedIn Post in a really long [2761] time I see some featured stuff here oh [2764] activity yeah sorry it's right over here [2767] so let's do this and then let's actually [2769] give this a run in order to do this we [2771] are going to have to go one more Let Go [2773] limit [2775] four might be a personal post I don't [2778] know it's an evergreen [2779] perfect we're going through our [2782] filters and I'm making the post so now [2785] I'm just going to refresh this puppy and [2788] then I'll go to [2789] post and then I'll go back to my own [2791] profile do walk in interview still [2793] happen yes they do the special place H [2794] world that might seem [2796] outdated cool I think this is more or [2799] less the same thing that this guy wrote [2801] just rewarded to be honest a little bit [2802] better um I think our English is [2804] probably just uh a little Cut Above [2807] which is actually kind of scary that you [2809] could create a campaign like this and [2810] then just proceed to absolutely MOG the [2813] guy that's doing the [2815] content um I think it'd be cool if we [2817] had some new lines here so I'm kind of [2819] thinking like hm how are we going to add [2822] some new lines looks like we did post [2824] content but I don't know if the new [2826] lines worked so let's go back here let's [2828] refresh us [2830] puppy no the the new lines definitely [2832] aren't working let me delete that that's [2834] embarrassing you just know there's some [2836] people that are like looking at these [2837] being like Nick is really screwing up [2839] his automations here uh yeah there has [2842] to be a way that we can get these new [2844] lines in here I don't really understand [2846] why ah okay cool that one worked so [2848] before I ask for referral pause and [2850] think why would some refer okay cool [2851] cool cool I figured it out so uh what we [2854] have to do in order to make this work [2856] after some handy dandy [2859] debugging was the new line characters [2862] that come in here need to be replaced [2864] with a new line from make.com because [2867] there's some string formatting thing [2868] that it does before it sends the request [2870] out to strip all of these so if it [2872] doesn't have a new line it's not going [2873] to work um so basically what we've done [2876] here is we you just changed the text so [2878] that instead of just result post we're [2880] replacing all instances of the new line [2882] and result post with new line which will [2883] make things just look a little [2885] better um which should solve more or [2887] less all of our our [2888] concerns now here's another issue um if [2891] you think about it the way that this is [2893] going to work right now is it's just [2894] going to scrape everything and the [2895] second that it scrapes the post it's [2896] just going to make the post so we're [2898] going to be creating like 50 user text [2900] posts every time we receive 50 records [2902] we don't actually want to do that right [2904] what we want to do instead now that I'm [2905] thinking about it is we want to add away [2907] to like schedule a post um and so the [2909] way that I'm I'm going to I'm going to [2910] create my scheduling feature is I'll go [2911] to generated post and then I'll just go [2915] Um scheduled [2918] post and then I'm also have a column [2921] here called [2922] posted [2924] status maybe I'll go like post [2927] status what scheduled post is going to [2929] do is we're just going to create another [2931] scenario and that scenario is just going [2932] to look through this scenario every now [2934] and then basically every hour or so to [2936] see if it is time for us to do the post [2938] if it is time for us to do the post [2939] we're going to grab the data from here [2941] do the posting math and then we're going [2943] to update the post status um this way we [2946] basically have like a closed loop and [2948] everything in our system is like self [2951] self-managing so uh I'm going to go for [2954] input URL here sorry I'm going to go [2957] scheduled post to J so what I'm going to [2961] do is we need to have some some way of [2964] scheduling a [2965] Time hm [2968] so I'm thinking about how we're going to [2970] do the time [2971] scheduling um we might need I ideally I [2975] want this to run [2977] automatically so what I want it to [2980] do is I want it to [2982] run completely [2985] autonomously and I wanted to distribute [2987] the posts so that I never have to worry [2989] about doubling up on a post I never have [2991] to worry about having [2993] multiple so what we're going to do is [2997] I'm G to use this as an example I'm [2998] going to go to scheduled [3000] post I'll go [3003] uh let's say December [3007] 8th [3009] 2024 and then we want [3012] like um [3016] 14 this should be a format that It'll [3020] recognize as a date so I'm going to go [3022] to format number we'll [3025] go date [3028] um no we need a date time [3031] sorry uh date time there we [3035] go and then what the hell's the [3037] format for the daytime [3040] uh I go back here it says 926 2008 um [3047] 15590 so right now would be [3052] 1208 [3054] 2024 1208 2024 4 um I want [3060] 14000000 is that right yeah okay that's [3063] right so if I wanted to make this [3065] 15 then I would just stretch this okay [3068] cool all right so basically what I'm [3069] going to have this do is I'm going to [3070] have it schedule a post every hour the [3072] way that it's going to do the hour [3075] scheduling is it's going to return all [3078] of the posts on the spreadsheet that [3080] have a date later than write the [3083] second so I'm going to sort those to get [3085] the latest one [3087] it's just going to add an additional [3089] hour to that and then schedule it that's [3091] how our schedule is going to work now in [3093] order to actually make this work [3094] obviously we need to make sure that [3096] whatever we're providing is in the exact [3097] format that um you know the thing [3099] needs so uh what we have now is we have [3102] month month so I'm going have to parse a [3105] date [3110] basically okay actually there are a [3112] couple more steps that need to occur [3113] before I do this what I'm going to do is [3115] I'm going to separate this [3117] and I'm going to add another scenario [3119] here uh first I have to update the [3121] status right so post status let's just [3122] have a couple of different post statuses [3124] one will [3125] be um let's just say uh yes we'll just [3129] say scheduled for [3131] now [3134] okay yeah we'll say [3138] scheduled this will be called schedule [3142] post add Source post schedule generated [3146] post [3147] um and then what we need to do is we [3148] just need to search the rows one more [3152] time now what I need to [3154] do is now I need a filter that [3158] says and we need to refresh this now [3161] because we're not getting all the fields [3162] we want so I'm just going to go back to [3165] LinkedIn posts and just run my way top [3166] to bottom uh sorry scraped post is not [3169] we want generated post and then I'm [3172] going to scrape this top to bottom for [3176] uh SK post it's date time operator I [3180] believe and we want it later than I [3184] think we can just say now I may be [3185] mistaken we may not be able to say now [3187] but I'm I'm just going to try and say [3188] later than now I'm going to run this see [3191] what [3193] happens um we get one right which is [3196] obviously the one that's for 2 p.m. so [3197] why don't we make just a couple as tests [3202] here we'll do one that's in the past [3206] do one that's 16 and then we'll do one [3208] that's 18 let's go back here now and [3211] let's see if we could just get all of [3213] the [3215] rows and we got this one which is [3217] scheduled for this which is nice then [3220] scheduled 16 which is nice 18 okay cool [3224] oh I I screwed up I should uh we didn't [3225] get the one that was 10 right just to [3228] clarify [3229] 14 16 perfect perfect so the system is [3232] now working well uh what we need to do [3234] is we just need to sort these now any [3236] way to sort these automatically no I'm [3238] just going to aggregate these into an [3240] array first and then sort them based off [3242] of that date time so I'm going to go um [3246] aggregator because we have multiple [3248] bundles here it's opening bundle one [3250] bundle two bundle three if I don't [3252] aggregate these results every module [3254] after this is going to run the same [3255] number of times as there are bundles so [3256] if there three bundles this will run [3258] three times that'll run three times [3259] there are 20 it'll run 20 times to [3261] eliminate this I need to select this [3263] multiple bundle structure then I'm just [3265] going to [3267] um map all of these fields and put them [3270] in an array [3272] instead the benefit to sorting based off [3274] of an array [3278] too is [3281] now I just go back here I just need to [3284] test out this specific [3286] flow if I run this [3289] now this is going to Output um array [3292] with three bundle or sorry three [3294] elements then we'll have the schedule [3296] post as one of those variables then I [3298] just want to set a [3301] variable and then I just want to call it [3304] sorted [3305] scheduled posts then I want to sort this [3308] array and what I want to sort it on is I [3310] want to sort it based off of this value [3314] um where it's a scheduled post here [3317] which as you see if I Mouse over this [3319] there's this little raw thing that's [3320] popping up that raw that nine that's [3322] actually the key name so I want to post [3324] this based off the key name I just want [3325] to see what happens I don't actually [3326] know this is going to work so we're just [3327] going to give it a [3329] try Okay so this one was 14:00 this one [3334] was 16:00 this one was [3338] 18:00 and this is how they were [3341] initially formatted so I I want to just [3343] change these a little bit want to say um [3348] 15 19 let's do 16 first so 16 15 19 [3354] should be 15 16 19 so we're gonna run [3356] this one more time we're gonna see [3358] whether or not the sort actually [3360] worked okay it worked 15 16 and 19 [3363] wonderful and now that we have this what [3365] we can do is we can just take the latest [3367] date and then we can just add an hour to [3368] it and that's how we're going to [3370] schedule our post that way everything [3373] that comes in is always going to be one [3374] hour later than the latest Future post [3379] essentially um oh boy actually hold on a [3382] second now I'm seeing an issue the issue [3384] is we have have uh turned our things [3388] into an [3390] array which now means that these [3392] elements are no longer accessible to [3395] us which kind of sucks [3400] H so if we're going to want to schedule [3402] our post we're going to need to do [3405] so either earlier which wouldn't make [3408] any [3410] sense or we're going to have to do [3412] so um we're going to have to pull out [3415] another iterator [3417] the data that we would iterate off of [3418] two probably be this data here [3421] right so I'm actually going have to pull [3423] another iterator now because I kind of [3425] screwed myself up with the structure [3426] let's drag that puppy there the array [3428] that I could feed in um oh hold on a [3431] second no no no I lied I lied my bad now [3434] you can you can totally do this I just [3435] didn't um have the variable on the right [3437] module if we connect these now and I go [3440] back here now we should still have this [3442] successful okay perfect yes we [3444] do and then this is now going to be with [3447] status scheduled [3448] perfect what we need is we just need a [3451] time so I could set the time through [3453] another set multiple variables but I [3455] think I'm just going to do it here I'll [3456] go [3458] um actually yeah let's do the let's do [3460] the set multiple variables one more [3462] time this is going to [3466] be sort um scheduled times and this one [3471] here is going to be [3474] calculate new scheduled [3478] time and then what I'm going to do in [3480] order to do this is I'm going to [3484] grab the last element of this [3489] array which is going to have the um [3493] excuse me the latest time so we'll go [3497] latest scheduled post I'm going to grab [3499] the last element in this array if I just [3502] show you guys what this looks like as a [3503] test one more time we're going to drag [3505] this back over over here and then run [3507] this [3509] puppy and now I have the last scheduled [3511] post and what we want is we just want [3512] the time so I'm just going to [3515] get and then what I want is I want the [3517] name of this [3519] so let's see here oh this is going to be [3522] annoying because actually the name is [3523] also just a number I think I can get [3525] nine it should work if not then we're [3528] screwed I'm do a different approach here [3530] okay no we did now what I want to do is [3533] I just want to H could we parse [3538] date um the date format is going to [3542] be oh boy uh mm [3545] SL oh hold on a second [3549] DD seeing here that this is just an [3551] eight that's not good MMD d y y y y and [3556] then hour hour minute [3561] minute and then second second I think [3563] maybe it's XX I don't know let go [3567] integrat datetime [3569] operator go to the tokens here and we [3572] just want the seconds so how the hell do [3573] we format seconds again I think it's SS [3575] that would make [3578] sense uh it's HH for 24-Hour time [3584] good SS with leading zero start actually [3586] we're going to have to go lowercase so [3589] [Music] [3590] mm yeah so M HH Capital HH mmss like [3595] this [3597] knowing that we have to do it that way [3598] but [3599] whatever so basically what we're doing [3601] is we're we're getting the date we're [3602] parsing it to get this in makes um [3605] built-in datetime format which has it in [3608] our built-in datetime format and then [3611] what we're going to do is we're just [3611] going to format the date after we've [3613] done this [3616] math oh but first we have to add an [3620] hour [3624] um add [3627] hours and [3629] [Music] [3630] then I kind of screwed up by add this [3632] format date thing let's just get rid of [3633] this and see how many semicolons we [3635] still [3638] have yeah uh I think this is probably [3641] sufficient right all right so let me [3643] just run this one more time make sure I [3644] didn't completely screw up my place [3645] every now and then I have to do this [3647] okay and then what we want to do is now [3648] that we've add the date we want to add [3649] an hour just going to add one and then [3651] you want to format the date you want to [3653] format it in the exact same format that [3655] we just did unfortunately we have to you [3658] know do this little bit of math in order [3660] to get this back in the format that we [3663] want um I have a [3666] feeling that this is going to be a [3668] different format but screw it we'll add [3670] it [3672] anyway and then I'm just going to remove [3674] the actual posting thing here for the [3676] purposes of this [3678] example now let's go back to our [3682] sheet let's delete this let's run this [3685] on actual live data now how many records [3687] are we returning four okay let's let's [3689] only return [3690] two let's run this and let's see if [3692] there are any breaks this is uh I [3695] consider this my like end to end test oh [3698] sorry the reason why this isn't scraping [3699] anything is because I did this on the [3703] generated side I didn't do this on the [3704] source [3707] side it's working through searching the [3710] rows scheduling the time okay great so [3713] schedule it for 1,700 should be 1 hour [3716] than the 1 hour later than the latest [3719] post doesn't look like this made it in [3721] Why didn't it make it in oh yeah because [3723] I didn't feed it in my bad we actually [3725] got to feed in the latest schedule post [3728] let's just delete that puppy one more [3730] time run it one more [3734] time uh right got to delete this [3740] too and with this we should now have [3743] everything we need in order for our [3744] system to function [3749] this is a time this is a time good [3752] wonderful cool uh now all we need is we [3756] have one side of the LinkedIn scraping [3758] system done now we just need something [3759] to post and uh the way you actually do [3761] the [3763] post uh let's do LinkedIn scraping [3766] system add to sheet scrape and add the [3770] sheet here the way that you do the [3772] actual posting is we just need to create [3773] a new scenario and then we'll have [3775] LinkedIn scraping system to which is [3777] just responsible for checking that [3778] generated post sheet and then actually [3780] putting the post [3782] out so my bad let's paste this puppy in [3785] just copy this your um [3788] title and we'll call this uh post [3791] schedule post from scheduled database [3794] beautiful the way this is going to work [3796] is we are just going [3799] to Google [3803] Sheets we are going to search [3810] Rose um we're going to do this every [3815] hour well I guess we can do this every [3817] six minutes now let's do this every [3820] hour we should really start this only [3827] on yeah we should only do this every [3830] hour if I go every day can I set the [3832] times [3833] no specified day pretty funny uh no [3837] we'll run this every 60 Minutes what [3839] we'll do is we'll start this [3842] on uh let me see [3845] 2024 [3847] 12 [3849] 8 [3850] 2 o' [3854] p.m. we're not going to run it yet what [3858] I need for this is I need to grab the [3860] sheet ID which is called LinkedIn posts [3867] is right over here and then now that I [3869] have that I'm just going to go sheet [3871] name um generated post we're just going [3873] to pull from this every hour what we [3875] want is we just want this scheduled post [3879] to equal to and we can do this with [3880] either text or datetime operator let's [3882] try datetime operators try datetime [3885] operators uh no it let's not do [3887] that well actually let's just grab them [3889] let's see what the the format is and [3891] then let's see if we can format our own [3892] date to be that run we didn't get [3896] anything why didn't we get anything H [3899] right right so we do have a filter in [3903] place so now we have our post with the [3905] date and time so all we need to do is [3907] just unfortunately it's 2 p.m. oh just [3909] missed [3910] it we had the perfect time to test and I [3913] let it pass Us by what I want to do is I [3917] just want to format the date the date [3920] that I want to format is now and I want [3922] to format this into the same format that [3923] we had before which was H uh sorry was [3926] um year uh month month day day year [3931] year year year space H H [3934] mmss I [3936] believe we're going to give this a try [3939] let's just see what we fit [3943] in right so this is running at [3946] 14131 so that's actually that's uh not [3948] going to work because this is going to [3950] grab the exact minute and the second so [3952] this make scenario is going to take [3953] probably more than half a second to run [3954] or something so it's it's not actually [3956] going to be correct so instead of now [3958] what I want to do is I want to [3960] set the minute of now to zero I also [3965] want to set the seconds of now to zero [3971] as well then I want to test [3974] this okay so what we fed in now is we [3978] fed in 1208 [3980] 24400 let's just go to our [3983] sheet and let's go [3986] uh 140 let's just see if we can grab [3989] that data going to run this little test [3991] with the current [3992] hour huh this is actually not pulling it [3994] for some reason [3996] why because this one says eight right [3998] yeah this one says eight this one says [4001] 08 so we used a leading zero I think for [4006] the [4008] day we don't actually need the leading [4010] zero for the [4013] day so I use DD we just need the D right [4017] yeah so that's what we need to do my bad [4020] we um we formatted it wrong because we [4023] slapped an extra zero in [4026] there pump that in now we do get the [4028] data there's one more thing I have to [4030] change though um I was doing the same [4031] encoding with the scheduling generated [4033] post I was doing it with the uh with the [4036] D [4038] so we'll do this D back we'll do this D [4041] back this should now work awesome and [4044] then basically um this this is going to [4045] run every hour so every hour starting [4047] from 2 p.m. so 3 4 5 6 7 it's going to [4050] grab all of the posts that have the hour [4053] equal to the current hour which will [4054] presumably just be one if you're you [4056] know pumping these puppies out and [4058] because we're searching it we're going [4059] to have access to the data which will [4060] include the text we'll replace any new [4063] lines with new lines which is nice and [4066] then yeah we should be able to pump this [4068] out and then I will just turn this puppy [4073] on and then all you need to do [4076] is uh basically hook this up to auler oh [4080] we can remove this now hook this up to [4082] auler and then voila you have um a [4084] pretty well functioning like LinkedIn [4085] parasite system that actually is a [4087] little goes a little further beyond what [4089] I was initially planning on doing when [4091] uh the view were sent in their request I [4092] was just going to have it like [4093] automatically post immediately but this [4095] is actually going to smartly [4096] intelligently schedule based off of the [4098] latest last post um theoretically you [4101] could create a Content bank that has a [4102] million posts here and it would just [4104] constantly turn it out every hour also [4106] theoretically you don't have to do it [4107] every hour you could do it every 15 [4108] minutes if you wanted to you could do it [4109] every 4 hours 6 hours 12 hours I just [4111] chose an hour for Simplicity reasons [4113] like you could schedule it to run every [4115] three hours but I just wanted it to run [4117] every hour um just to show you guys [4119] what's possible scheduling wise okay so [4122] the last thing that I want to touch on [4123] is the beginning of this if we just [4125] leave the scenario as is um it's just [4127] going to run every 15 minutes and grab [4128] the same data set right so there kind of [4130] a couple things that we could do um what [4132] I recommend we do is we go to appify [4134] again and go watch actor runs and we [4137] should make this the trigger of our flow [4139] and now instead of running every 50 [4140] minutes it's going to trigger only when [4142] web Hook is called basically and then [4144] under get data set items what we're [4145] going to do is we're actually just going [4146] to feed in the data set ID of the run [4149] that just [4151] finished um so that should be sufficient [4155] now we do need to set up a [4158] hook so I just have to go [4160] into I believe it was this account and [4163] then it was the LinkedIn post scraper [4166] right uh right [4168] here and then I'm going to click okay [4172] and now this is going to be tied to the [4173] runs of that scenar of that actor in [4175] appify if I click run this module once [4177] and actually go back into appify [4180] here and let's just go back to our [4181] LinkedIn post scraper and then why don't [4183] we just set the limit per source to be [4186] five or something instead instead of [4188] whatever it is right [4190] now we'll turn this on it'll run [4196] and you know it's going to go through [4196] and scrape the post voila just [4199] finished um that just turned green so a [4203] few seconds later this is now watching [4204] it it's finished we got the default [4206] default data set IDE of the new run and [4208] now that's good to go so we know now if [4210] we if we turn this on [4212] basically and we turn this one on we [4214] have like this the self functioning [4216] perpetuating system the only thing we [4217] need to do is we just need to schedule [4218] an ABY just go to schedules create new [4222] and then you know however often you want [4223] to run the the original scraper uh [4225] because we are checking to see if the [4226] post already exists in the database you [4228] can just you can run this as often as [4229] you want if if somebody runs and does [4231] like 500 million LinkedIn posts a day um [4234] anytime that you want to change who it [4236] is that we're scraping uh you can do so [4237] just by going back to our actor settings [4240] here and then um changing the or adding [4243] different URLs I should say you can just [4246] do all the stuff in make too you could [4247] run this scenario um using the [4251] appify uh run an actor module and then [4253] you can actually just feed in like a [4255] dnamic list of people so maybe instead [4257] of you having to do it in appify what [4258] you do is you store all the URLs in a [4260] Google sheet then anytime you run the [4262] thing which is once every day or [4263] something you pull all of the people [4265] from the Google sheet feed that in as [4266] input variety of different ways you can [4268] tackle this but yeah that's the [4270] completed system so I'm going to save [4271] These Blueprints and then make these [4272] publicly available to you guys so I'm [4274] going to export that number [4275] one I'm also going to export this one [4278] number two I'm going to go back to [4280] number one rename it oh apparently I [4283] can't use this uh [4285] because of this [4287] colon and I'll do the same thing with [4289] this [4289] one just remove this colon and I'm going [4293] to make it publicly available so anybody [4294] that wants this uh can feel free to to [4297] use [4297] it I don't know why my M Dash isn't [4300] popping up and then if you guys have any [4302] questions about hypo the St let me know [4304] hope you guys appreciated the video had [4305] a lot of fun putting it um in place uh [4308] as I mentioned previously this is a [4309] viewer request and I really like doing [4310] viewer requests because a lot of the [4312] time they ask for things that um weren't [4314] entirely that I didn't fully entirely [4317] understand before I actually did the [4318] thing for instance I haven't actually [4319] done the scheduling flow before where [4321] you um sort a list based off of the last [4323] date and then use that to pull uh and [4326] schedule future dates so if anything it [4328] was really just me honing my skills a [4329] little bit more and I really like doing [4331] that uh if you guys have any questions [4333] or suggestions for future flows just [4334] drop them down below otherwise if you [4336] could do me a big solid just like [4337] subscribe to my channel I have a I've [4339] been growing a lot faster recently as [4341] I'm sure some of you guys have noticed [4342] but as a result I have the lower [4343] concentration or lower ratio of watch [4346] time from people that are subscribed to [4347] unsubscribed so a lot of like new [4349] unsubscribed people are watching me if [4351] you're one of them and you like the [4351] stuff I put out just subscribe really [4353] helps me out

Title: My $919 YouTube Setup ($503,829 Profit + 50,000 Subscribers)
[0] I have made [1] $3,829 in profit off YouTube this year [4] alone and we still have a month left in [6] the year and I started a month late and [8] a lot of that is Mr so in this video I'm [9] going to show you my exact setup I'm [11] going to walk through all of my [12] equipment and I'm even going to show you [13] guys my production process from start to [15] finish we're going to cover lighting [17] cameras lenses microphones recording [20] software my production flow a few AI [23] post- production tools that I use during [24] my Productions how I edit my thumbnails [27] how I post my videos to YouTube then I'm [29] also going to cover four budget setups [31] valued at $150 $460 [34] $96 and [37] $156 so regardless of the level of [39] budget you guys are going to have [40] everything you need in order to get out [42] there and crush it on YouTube if that [43] sounds like something you guys want to [44] learn how to do for yourselves stay [46] tuned and let's get into it first thing [48] I'm going to do in this clip is cover [49] some common misconceptions I see thrown [51] around YouTube all the time and we're [52] going to tackle these one by one but the [54] first is that your production value [56] doesn't matter the truth is your [58] production value actually does matter [60] there's quite a bit whoopy freaking do [61] this is a video all about how to [63] maximize your production value so you [64] may think that I'm being biased here but [66] the truth is like if you took two [67] channels hypothetically and the first [69] channel had awesome content quality and [71] had really shitty production value and [73] the other channel had awesome content [75] quality and really good production value [77] which one do you think would grow faster [79] obviously the one that had great content [81] and great production value right so it's [83] not that you need good production value [86] in order to make growth happen on [88] YouTube but it's like a multiply flying [90] Factor would you guys rather grow at [92] like 1X speed or would you rather grow [94] at 5x speed I know I would much rather [96] grow at 5x speed and that's why I've [98] taken a little bit of time and energy [100] just to make sure that I got the 8020 of [102] my production value so that's number one [105] um the second is that your setup has to [107] be expensive no your setup does not [108] actually have to be expensive you [110] basically just need a couple of key [113] things in order to make content quality [115] seem well I'm going to cover them all in [116] a second I'm going to show you guys [117] exactly what I personally use um but you [119] know it's things like lighting it's [120] things like background blur it's things [122] like your audio quality and how to [123] process it so you don't actually have to [126] make a large capital investment right [127] off the bet I find you do typically have [129] to make some sort of investment to get [130] the ball rolling but uh if anything that [132] investment is probably like three or [134] four times smaller than you probably [135] think and the last big misconception is [138] that you should just like max out [139] quality right people tend to think it's [141] one of the other either you don't give a [142]  about quality at all or you go 100% [145] balls the wall in quality and you know [147] maybe maybe sacrifice some actual [149] content as a result of that well you [151] don't actually have to do that there [152] there is a sweet spot between the [154] quality of your videos and then the ease [156] of use on your end um like the amount of [158]  you have to deal with with like [160] your setup and all the various lights [161] and all the monitors and all that stuff [163] and then like the way that your videos [164] are perceived by viewers on YouTube and [167] you know technically in my case I could [168] e out another 20% of my content quality [171] if I really wanted to but that would [172] just be that' be ringing like a a towel [174] until there's basically nothing left and [177] it's not an effective use of my time [178] it's a better use of my time at this [179] point point just to continue producing [181] as many YouTube videos as humanly [182] possible so my content quality i' [184] consider the 8020 it's sufficiently high [186] quality that I pattern match really [188] successful YouTubers when there's still [190] a couple of rough edges here or there [191] but it's not a big deal right uh the [193] point I'm making is my content quality [194] doesn't get in the way of the [195] Productions that I make and that's [197] that's what's important um it's also [199] convenient enough that I could just take [200] my kit with me and I often do and it [201] still looks better than most which I [202] think is important especially if you [203] live like a travel heavy lifestyle like [205] I do all right let's actually dive into [207] my exact setup what I'm going to do in [208] order to make this simple and as easy [210] for both of us as humanly possible is [212] I'm going to record a video live kind of [215] first person view from my iPhone and [216] then I'm just going to show you guys [217] what it looks like um as I pan around [220] and then after that we're going to cover [221] just some general principles about [222] lighting um and then I'm going to cover [224] my actual exact setup so you guys have [226] the same products I do you guys can just [228] copy and paste replicate as necessary so [231] let's zoom into this puppy I should have [234] now connected both of these so you're [235] probably going to be looking through my [236] iPhone on the left hand side we have a [240] big key light this is a giant soft box [243] as well as my bubbly but more [245] importantly a giant soft box which [246] produces the majority of the light in [249] the video If you guys look at me right [251] now you notice how just looking down the [253] center line the left half of my face is [254] substantially brighter than the right [255] half of my face the reason for that is [257] because of this key light the key light [259] is like sort of the key focus of the [261] shoot and so you know if I could [264] quantify this if there's like 100% of [265] all the light available 70 maybe 80% of [268] it is over here and then then if we look [270] on the right hand side you see that I [272] have a much smaller light over there [274] this one's called a a fill light and [276] this is very similar in nature to the [278] kyite like you don't actually need that [280] to be way smaller you could just like [281] get another one of these puppies and [283] then just like I don't know make it [285] really far away or something um but the [287] purpose of this is to fill in that other [288] half of my face right and to make that a [290] little bit brighter so that there's [292] Dynamic contrast you could still [293] technically see both sides so you know [295] this is a bunch of fancy terms in [298] photography and videography two Point [299] threo lighting whatever um but if I turn [302] this off you guys see how now there's [303] just a little bit too much contrast in [304] my face it's probably pretty dark looks [306] very moody you can absolutely get away [307] with this you don't need to have both [309] but in my case I've just found that you [310] know people tend to respond better to [311] the videos I like the look of it a [313] little bit more when I have both the key [315] light and then the The Fill light so [317] that's more or less the lighting setup [318] um you know in general I have a rule [321] here and that's just you need some sort [322] of light at your face don't make the [323] mistake that I see a lot of novice uh [325] videographer or YouTubers or whatever [327] you want to call them do which is like [329] they'll have a really cool background [331] maybe they'll be like some Florida [332] ceiling really sexy apartment or [334] something and they'll think my God I [336] need to put that in the frame everybody [337] need to see my really cool sexy [338] background but the issue there is the [340] background has a lot of light coming in [342] right and so a lot of the time people [343] shoot against Windows if you shoot [344] against Windows uh all of the light [347] that's coming in is coming from behind [348] you so none of it is actually bouncing [351] off your face and going into the camera [352] all of it is just like shooting shooting [354] past you meaning your face will actually [356] look really dark and and kind of blown [357] out and really wishy-washy so when one [359] of the simplest and strongest levers [361] that you could pull in order to make [362] your content quality higher is just get [365] any sort of light ideally a soft light [367] and just point it at you know about a [369] 60° angle or so to your face um even if [372] you don't have both the key and the [373] fillite that's okay like having one of [374] these was just going to brighten you up [376] to the point where people can still see [377] you there's a fair amount of detail and [379] so on and so forth now in terms of my [381] specific setup as I mentioned I have [382] that softbox small fill I'm just going [384] to click on both links here let's do the [386] fill light first so this is the fill [388] light that I bought um I do all my [389] purchases in Canadian dollars cuz I'm [391] Canadian thank you great white North uh [393] but this is the one that I bought right [394] over here it's a two pack LED video [396] light kit from this brand nice VD I [398] imagine a lot of these are just straight [400] shipped from China I know that there's [401] like several dozen um light brands that [404] I think are all owned by the same [405] Chinese conglomerate and they just like [407] change the names to take up more real [408] estate good strategy I totally do the [410] same thing um but as you guys can see it [412] comes with like a little stand which is [413] pretty nice also comes with uh place you [417] could put your phone as well I didn't [418] even know that actually oh yeah looks [420] like there is one very cool uh and then [422] you have some buttons that you can click [424] to change the the color of the light and [425] so on and so forth uh so yeah that's [428] where I got my fillite 67.99 Canadian [431] with a 10% coupon I didn't even realize [432] it's a 10% coupon but looks like there [434] is that's sick and then I also bought my [437] softbox from this link here um granted [439] this one says it's currently unavailable [441] I think I actually had to order this one [442] from America and then it had to like [444] come through or something so it's [446] actually more expensive I bet you if you [447] just typed soft box [450] yeah softbox lighting kit probably get [452] something really cheap [454] nowadays look so you can get one for [456] $49.99 Canadian dollars and that's from [458] the same brand nice VD if you do the [460] math on that it's actually even cheaper [461] than than the money that I spent on it [463] because I bought two right so [464] collectively you could probably get this [466] for like 50 or 60 bucks USD but anyway [468] we'll go the 8420 just for the purposes [469] of this demonstration okay great so [472] that's the lighting um you know super [474] simple and straightforward basically [475] just position big soft box on your left [478] and then some sort of small fill light [480] on your right the variety of things you [481] can do for the fill like you you could [482] throw in like like a diffuser or some [484] sort of reflector or whatever I'm not [486] going to get into any of that this is [487] just a simplest way for novice [488] videographers or novice YouTubers to [490] understand what's going on so we're just [491] going to stick with that okay next up is [494] the camera so let me actually run you [495] guys through what the camera looks like [497] in reality um I got my iPhone over here [500] I'm just going to zoom in a bit because [501] I don't want to leave because my [502] microphone is in front of me um but that [504] is a Sony [506] a6500 it's a pretty good camera All [508] Things Considered I I think it was like [509] one of the better ones like eight or [511] nine years ago now it's definitely like [512] in a mid- tier um I haven't needed to [514] change this though because this does [515] everything that I want and uh yeah new [517] cameras are pretty expensive [519] so um in addition I also have a lens [522] there which I'll cover in a second but [523] it's called the sigma 30mm f1.4 pretty [526] solid lens All Things Considered I [527] really like it um but you need to make [529] sure if you buy that one that like it [530] connects with the camera what [532] unfortunate thing I've come to realize [533] is that different cameras um you know [536] can accept different lenses so you just [537] need to make sure the mount on the lens [539] is the same as the mount on the the [541] camera uh the general rule of thumb here [543] is you know you need to have some sort [545] of DSLR or mirrorless if you really want [547] to amp up your production quality like [550] your iPhone or your mobile phone the [552] sensor on it just isn't big enough to [554] capture and collect all of the light [556] necessary in order to illuminate the [557] subject fully get a lot of detail get [560] cool things in the background like blur [561] and so on and so forth so you need a [563] DSLR or some sort of mirrorless um there [565] are a variety of budget options which [566] I'm going to go through U my Sony a6500 [569] was definitely on the cheaper end um the [571] reason why is cuz I bought this used [573] from Craigslist for $650 Canadian dollar [576] 6 years ago I brought cash I met the guy [578] at a subway um you know we walked [580] through the camera together I had no [581] idea what the hell he was telling me he [582] was like yeah aren't you going to check [583] to see the shutter number and I was like [586] I don't know what that means man [587] just give me the camera um but I'll walk [589] you guys through exactly what that [590] process would looked like today and uh [592] there's really no no reason to buy a [594] camera new if you're using it for [596] videography purposes because of this [597] shutter number thing but let's actually [599] go through what it looks like um the [600] total price for me was [602] $48.99 I literally went to Facebook [605] Marketplace and I just typed in Sony [607] a6500 I don't believe they sell these [609] new so you have to do this if you want [610] to get the same one as me um so you see [613] it's a used market right you can grab [614] this one here for 790 bucks this one [617] comes with some cool adapter so maybe if [620] you leave the adapter you can get this [621] for like 700 [622] Canadian 710 it looks like I'm sure you [625] can negotiate that down um this one here [628] 800 bucks bucks includes the lens you [630] could probably get this for like 600 [631] bucks realistically yeah even with [632] inflation like this is a pretty cheap [634] ass camera All Things Considered things [635] to watch out for you just need to make [637] sure okay you see this little gray [638] bubble here that's just the cover for [640] the actual like sensor you just need to [642] make sure there are no scratches on the [644] sensor so the way that you do that is [646] typically you just grab the camera and [647] you like point it at either like [648] something totally black or like [650] something totally white and then you [651] just take a picture and you just like [652] look through the picture to see if [653] there's any smudges or scratches or [655] something like that um but it's it's [656] really not a big deal I mean I paid all [658] cash so [659] uh i' encourage anybody that's buying a [661] camera for videography purposes just [662] don't do it new there's no real point I [664] am going to show you a couple of new [665] options that you can buy later uh but [667] yeah in my case no real point I I don't [669] really recommend it um okay great let's [671] talk a little bit about the lens on the [673] camera and this is probably one of the [674] most important things aside from the the [675] lighting so pick up my iPhone here again [678] then I zoom way in see I have this lens [681] attached to my camera and this is the [683] sigma 30mm f1.4 now you're probably [686] wondering what the hell does all that [688]  mean like there so many letters and [690] numbers I'm confused and I was too um if [692] I keep things really simple for you 30 m [695] 30 mm is just the focal length so the [698] bigger the focal length the less warping [700] on your face and then the smaller the [702] focal length the more like wide wide [704] angle lens the more fishey sort of [706] effect so 30 mm for the Sony um a6500 to [710] me is just like a good blend of like [712] it's Compact and it's it's easy and it's [714] affordable enough that I could like [715] carry it with me anytime I want and it [717] also doesn't really you know suffer from [718] some of the downsides of the the closer [720] ones which is a bunch of distortion and [721] a bunch of warping for the longest time [723] I used um uh I used one that was much [726] closer to Sigma 16 mm f1.4 and then I [728] just found that like it warped my face [730] and I looked like really skinny and kind [731] of weird and reptilian um maybe I just [734] looked skinny and weird and reptilian [736] who knows um but ever since I switched [738] over to this one I I don't know I just [739] like the way that I look more I tend to [740] get better comments um things are just [742] easier for me so in general you probably [745] want something around 30 mm if you go [747] much longer than this you have to set [748] your camera far away which makes you st [749] logistically difficult to set up if you [752] look at this [753] um if you look at how far the camera [756] away is how far the camera is away you [759] know it's basically like I got my [760] monitor over here and then like a couple [762] more feet away I got the camera right if [765] you use one with a shorter focal length [767] um you can actually just bring the monit [769] like the the camera directly in front of [770] the monitor basically the shorter the [772] focal length is the um you know [774] obviously closer you can bring the [775] camera and the longer the focal length [776] is the further away you have to put the [778] camera so uh in my case I like stuff [780] that's around 30 mm you also want [783] something with a low f- stop remember [785] earlier I said it was like a sigma 30mm [787] f1.4 the f1.4 just refers to how [790] basically blurry the background gets for [792] you this is um called bokeh the F stop [795] is called the aperture but the lower the [797] f- stop is the more bokeh you get bokeh [799] is just like if you guys notice the [801] plant to my right here um it's just kind [804] of blurry in the background right so is [806] the one on my left if I have other stuff [807] in the background it would just blur a [808] lot and generally speaking on YouTube [811] like the high-end good quality very [813] famous YouTubers just tend to have like [814] really blurry ass backgrounds so in [816] order to get that blurry background you [818] need like a a lens with a very low f- [821] stop usually something that's like f1.4 [823] to maybe [824] f2.4 or something like that is is [827] sufficient I'll walk you guys through a [828] bunch of different options that you can [829] get later in my specific setup um I [832] wanted to use a sigma I used to use that [834] Sigma 60mm f1.4 I found that it was [836] warping me a lot it was great for [837] convenience cuz I could bring it really [838] close to my and just carry it in my [840] pocket but I now use the sigma 30mm f1.4 [843] it cost me about $370 Canadian if I just [846] like look this up right [849] now [851] um right over here and looks like [854] Google has a bunch of different [857] options this one's 369 it's for one [859] called an X Mount we want one called an [861] e [864] Mount I feel like I had one here earlier [869] oh yes this one here yeah so this one [872] here is Sigma 30mm f1.4 contemporary for [876] Sony you could literally you can just [877] buy this today have this shipped to your [879] house um it's the exact same lens that I [881] use and it's compatible with the Sony [883] a6500 so um yeah in this case I am [886] buying this one new the reason why um [888] I'm more down to buy lenses new as [891] opposed to cameras new is because the [893] lenses like use can actually scratch [895] them and kind of screw them up so I was [897] going to buy um a different lens quite a [899] while ago for a slightly different kind [900] of camera and then the guy's like no the [902] lens is good lens is good I'm like well [903] I actually brought my camera so let's [904] check and see if the lens is good so I [906] connected it and I noticed there was [907] this big diagonal uh basically scar [910] across the lens guy must have scratched [911] with his keys or something like that so [913] you can probably go cheaper than this um [915] in my case I did 369 CAD or 26127 USD [919] but this is definitely like the thing [920] you do not want to screw up because this [922] is the thing that is the most noticeable [923] if you don't get that nice blur in the [924] background it'll just kind of look [925] really flat just like you're you know [927] recording a video with your iPhone or [928] something [929] and then if there's scratches or [930] whatever people people are going to be [931] able to notice so my recommendation is [933] you know shell a little bit of money out [934] for the lens this is the thing that [935] really matters and I'll give you guys [937] some some camera options and stuff too [939] okay next up is the microphone I [940] consider this like one of the most [942] important parts of the setup as well I [943] love how I'm now saying that for [944] literally everything um let me show you [947] guys what this looks like so as you see [950] I have this like little boom arm thing [952] and this boom arm on it is mounted this [956] microphone here um and this one is [958] called the Samsung q2u it's a pretty [960] solid microphone I really like it the [962] reason I like it so much is because it's [964] what's called unidirectional and so if I [966] go like you know behind the mic and try [968] and talk or something like that um the [970] quality of the audio well the loudness [972] of the audio will go way down and so a [974] lot of the time I have like construction [975] and stuff like that I live on a pretty [976] busy street now I'll have construction [978] and stuff like that across the street [980] and people will have no idea that like [981] that is that is occurring because this [983] is only getting the audio from a very [985] small space in in in front of it so [988] there are a couple of alternatives you [989] could use you could use like a lapel mic [991] um personally I find that this just adds [992] too much friction I much prefer just to [994] be able to mount a microphone on the [995] desk and then have that be okay in terms [998] of my specific setup um I care a lot [1001] about this because for uh maybe a month [1004] month and a half I used a really cheap [1006] shitty microphone called a fifan a6t or [1009] fine I don't know what the hell it's [1010] called but anyway it was like 50 bucks [1011] off Amazon I was like o it's got colors [1013] let's do it and for that entire time [1016] period you could hear every drop of IA [1019] in my mouth while I was recording a [1021] YouTube video it was freaking brutal a [1024] lot of the people that are watching this [1025] Channel right now probably know and can [1027] hearken back to that time you actually [1029] had to like turn me way down and put me [1031] really far away in order for any of this [1033] to make sense um that didn't just have [1035] like a spiritual and cringe impact that [1038] also had a monetary impact because I [1040] noticed substantially lower watch times [1042] because the audio was so freaking [1044] annoying so that decision in hindsight [1047] I'm glad I made that decision because [1048] it's made me a lot better with the audio [1050] but that decision alone has probably [1052] cost me tens of thousands of dollars [1053] just in fewer watches a shittier ads uh [1057] Revenue you know fewer people joining my [1059] communities and stuff like that today I [1061] use the Samsung qtu with with the desk [1062] Mount um I should mention just before I [1065] get into the actual product uh my audio [1066] doesn't stop here I use a special [1068] postprocessing tool that I'll touch on [1069] later where I basically just drag and [1071] drop my my finished video recording with [1073] the audio into this tool and then the [1074] tool just does like some loudness [1076] normalization and stuff like that I [1077] consider this crucial it's one of the [1079] reasons why everybody thinks that my [1080] audio is so sexy and I have like podcast [1081] level stuff I've I've even gotten now to [1084] the point where people are comparing [1085] this to ASMR even though like you know [1087] the purpose of this is not ASMR but when [1090] you when you process the audio with this [1091] wonderful Library um it just ends up [1093] with this nice silky smooth tone to it [1095] which is which is pretty great so let me [1097] actually run you guys through the [1098] Samsung QT if you just go up [1100] here again I'm Canadian so keep that in [1105] mind if we go over here um this one is $ [1109] 43.86 Canadian you can see that it even [1111] comes with a little stand so you don't [1113] actually need this boom Mount thing that [1115] I have and in fact I didn't use this for [1116] the longest time I just use this little [1118] stand it's not the most sturdy of the [1120] stands so just be careful you don't [1121] knock it over while you're recording um [1123] but yeah that's the Samsung QT kind of [1125] looks like a karaoke mic right that's [1127] basically what it is it's just on top of [1128] this I've put the included um this this [1131] little included noise filter that you [1132] put on it's pretty nice and then uh yeah [1136] that's that so I realized now I didn't [1137] link this let me actually just copy this [1140] link then paste this here and now you [1143] all have access to it as well 145 CAD [1146] here uh a couple extra bucks or [1149] $12.39 us pretty solid microphone if I [1152] do say so myself there are a couple of [1153] additionally better options that I'm [1154] going to cover when I get into like the [1156] higher budget stuff but this is [1157] sufficient for me I'm probably going to [1158] use this for like the next year or two [1161] okay let's get into some recording [1163] software and this is going to be a [1163] little bit tougher for me to show but [1165] I'm just going to run you through what's [1166] going on on my screen right now um as [1168] you guys see over here I have um you [1170] know my my face in full actually you [1172] know what I just realized I could [1173] totally just drag this and then show you [1175] guys with the screen share function [1177] perfect let's do that okay so I'm moving [1179] this over here and perfect now you [1181] should be able to see what's going on [1183] okay so what I'm using here is I'm using [1184] this platform called OBS open [1186] broadcasting uh software and basically [1189] what this is doing is this allows you to [1191] set up uh different scenes based off of [1194] what you want um coming into your [1196] production and so this scene here I have [1198] main main you know if I kind of go back [1201] to the screen share section if I click [1203] on this my entire face just lights up [1205] and this is all that you see if I click [1207] on screen share plus overlay then you [1209] guys can kind of see there's this weird [1210] infinite mirror thing going on and the [1212] reason why is because I'm screen [1213] recording a recording of a screen which [1215] is a screen recording of a screen which [1216] is a screen recording of a screen I [1218] could somehow like move this into the [1219] corner you guys see how like what's [1221] actually popping up now is the left hand [1223] side of my screen that's cuz this is [1224] screen recording my left hand side of my [1226] screen so if I move this back [1229] over [1230] here and then if I show you guys what [1233] this looks like in practice what I've [1235] done is I've queued up some hotkeys so [1237] command shift one and command shift 2 [1240] I've queued up some hotkeys that allow [1242] me to quickly and effortlessly jump back [1244] and forth between this content so um [1247] what I can do is and this is like kind [1249] of my hack instead of me having to go [1251] into post or hire an editing team or [1253] anything like that I actually just do [1254] all of these transitions myself with a [1256] quick little hotkey um nobody knows [1258] notices because all I have to do is just [1259] click this button and then it allows me [1261] just to save time having more engaging [1263] content because a lot of the time you [1264] know you want to you want to jump [1265] between the talking head then you want [1266] to jump between the screen share talking [1268] head screen share I don't have to do [1269] that anymore in posts I don't have to [1271] like do all the editing I just [1272] click one button and then voila it's [1274] done so that's pretty cool um what I've [1276] done if I just use my little iPhone here [1279] is I've just added a bunch of different [1280] scenes to this sorry a bunch of [1282] different input methods um I have like [1284] my Sony a6500 as an input method Mac OS [1287] screen capture as an input method lavali [1288] your microphone the purpose of this [1290] video is not to be like an exhaustive [1291] OBS guide but just to show you guys that [1293] OBS is what I use um there are a variety [1295] of like very great tutorials online that [1297] show you how to use OBS uh again my [1299] favorite feature is just the hotkey one [1301] because I don't have to deal with a lot [1302] of the that most other people [1303] have to so yeah that's personally what I [1306] use um open broadcaster software um I do [1309] it with that full face talking head [1310] scene and a screen share scene and I [1312] just switch between them with a hotkey [1314] um the the whole idea is just cutting [1315] down time and post now you don't [1317] actually have to do this there are [1318] variety of great tools out there that [1320] just manage all this for you um for [1322] instance one that I've seen cropping up [1323] a lot more often now is called screen [1326] studio uh if you have a Mac OS this is [1329] like a professional automated screen [1330] recording platform that I'm definitely [1332] going to try um that automatically does [1334] cool things like it zooms in it Scrolls [1336] it it does it does a lot of math for you [1338] basically behind the scenes that you [1339] don't need to worry about um and you [1341] still get the same sort of screen share [1342] thing in the bottom left hand corner [1343] there's another one called ta TV which [1345] is blowing up right now as well same [1347] Vibe you um [1349] get to record like a talking head [1350] overlay thing and then you have like a [1351] couple of cool effects which increase [1353] the perceived production quality I'm [1354] probably going to be screwing around [1356] with these um in the future I think my [1358] next video I'll probably do with the um [1359] the screen studio just to see how it [1361] goes if it's better you know I'll update [1362] all of the descriptions in this video to [1364] show you guys and point to that new [1366] resource I'll do the same thing with ta [1368] and stuff like that but I want you to [1369] know the recording software that use [1370] isn't actually as important it's just [1371] like the way that you set it up so [1372] conceptually just just try and do as [1374] much of your production live during the [1376] the recording um versus like in post [1379] because post is where post just stands [1380] for editing if you guys are una aware [1382] post is where the vast majority of the [1383] time sync in YouTube tends to come from [1387] if you like those super high quality [1389] very refined fast edited videos you're [1392] going to have to spend a lot of time in [1394] order to create one and that's [1395] personally why I've set up every aspect [1397] of my recording and my production [1399] pipeline to avoid that wherever possible [1402] anyway mine's free a couple of these [1403] other ones might cost money but mine is [1405] zero cost and that's why I like it next [1407] let's cover some post production [1408] software um basically what I do is I [1411] will run my whole you know I'll finish [1413] the whole clip basically and then I will [1415] um export it through Premier Pro and [1417] then I'll just drag and drop that clip [1418] into a software platform called aonic [1421] aonic just uses AI to adjust your Reverb [1423] your Echo and your EQ uh to achieve very [1426] high production value results for very [1428] very little money it was shown to me by [1430] one of my community members in make [1431] money with make uh called Stuart white [1433] and I'm forever thankful for that he was [1434] trying to automate his podcast editing I [1436] believe um and as a result I basically [1438] got to use this amazing tool which just [1439] saves me tons of time and energy let me [1441] let me show you guys what this actually [1443] looks like you know they call it an AI [1444] sound engineer for podcasts but [1447] generally um you you have a couple [1449] different things here that matter the [1450] first is an intelligent leveler [1452] basically you know a lot of the time [1453] you'll have multiple speakers on a panel [1455] or you'll be further away from the [1458] microphone or closer you probably won't [1459] be able to hear the difference there [1460] because I'm going to use aonic to edit [1461] this but what this will do is it'll [1463] automatically bring up the levels of [1465] your audio using AI based on you know [1468] the average audio gain or whatever um um [1471] in segment to segment you don't have to [1473] do anything except for just drag and [1474] drop your clip in order to have this [1476] done for you noise and Reverb reduction [1478] this is huge there's a lot of these like [1480] Fast changing Reverb noises you know [1483] noises sort of bouncing off my wall it's [1485] coming back it's bouncing off the fabric [1487] bouncing off my monitor this just [1488] eliminates that makes it a lot cleaner [1491] there's some filtering in Auto EQ um a [1493] lot of the time you get this issue with [1496] uh microphones called sibilance which is [1497] where you go s over and over and over [1500] again and then or or like or uh these [1503] are plosives or fictives I believe uh [1506] respectively and they just make like a [1508] big bump on the mic and you just like [1510] kind of hear it and it's just very [1511] uncomfortable and it's annoying um what [1513] aonic does it just removes all of that [1514] for you and so I don't actually need as [1516] high quality of an audio setup as most [1518] other people have to achieve [1519] substantially higher results because I [1521] just use AI to do all that for me [1523] you knew a couple other things um one [1524] thing that I use is I use it to do [1525] automatic show notes so this just has a [1527] little integration with whis er um open [1529] AI model that takes the audio that I [1531] feed into the clip it transcribes it [1533] then it uses it to generate chapter [1534] headings which I then just copy and [1535] paste in YouTube this is probably like [1537] the quickest and easiest way that I've [1539] personally found to do this and then the [1540] really cool part is all you need to do [1543] is just drag and drop drop this here um [1546] when when you're done you'll get like [1547] your finished production here and I [1548] don't actually remember which clip is [1550] which I think a epifi is the most recent [1552] one that I've done before this or it [1555] might have just been a test that I ran [1556] for seven minutes hey there this is a [1559] guide [1560] toy get to see the and the after so they [1563] have the ability to listen to the input [1564] and the output and just compare the two [1566] which is freaking sick so you can like [1568] see how much better it is now that you [1569] use aonic anyway I'm not affiliated with [1571] these guys at all I just really like [1572] their software platform and I encourage [1574] anybody here that wants higher quality [1575] audio to give it a try on your own um [1577] just deals with all of the that [1578] I do not have the time or wherewithal to [1580] deal with that just allows me to not [1582] have to hire an editor I just get to do [1583] all this stuff myself um and it only [1585] costs 29 bucks a month USD for my plan [1587] you can actually spend money for a [1589] smaller plan if you want to although I [1591] think if you know you're wanting to [1593] recreate my my YouTube setup and stuff [1594] like that you'll probably want to get [1595] the $29 one as [1597] well okay great now let's actually do a [1599] little bit of math here um there's [1600] actually one thing I still need to add [1602] which I forgot about called a capture [1605] card but anyway let's just do a little [1607] bit of math on [1609] this after I do the capture card thing [1612] and then I'm just going to save this and [1613] I'm just going to link it down at the [1614] bottom of the video so you guys are just [1615] going to have access to this resource [1616] anytime that you want you can do this is [1618] like a cheat sheet you could I don't [1620] know you could leave comments on this [1621] for other people you could do whatever [1622] you want this this is just like your [1623] free little thing I'm not going to take [1624] your email address for this or anything [1626] no gatekeeping just just take the whole [1628] thing so um there's one more thing I [1630] need to cover here and I'm just going to [1631] cover it using my YouTube sorry my [1633] little iPhone um in order to connect [1635] that camera to this computer what you [1639] need is uh you need something called a [1641] capture card now a capture card is just [1644] a little device let me just close this [1647] and see if I can grab [1648] but it's a very very little [1653] device and all it does uh I also have [1656] this which just allows me to connect [1657] like a bunch of things to I don't know [1659] it's like a little USB hub uh but the [1662] capture cart is just a little device [1664] that basically just screen records your [1666] camera the whole time it's probably the [1668] simplest way that I found to to [1670] demonstrate it um if you don't have one [1672] of these you're not going to be able to [1674] connect your super high quality mirror [1676] list or DSLR to your computer [1678] uh I mean there are like a couple of [1679] like hacky workarounds with software but [1682] you're not going to be able to get like [1683] the good quality like you know I have [1684] really sexy sexy tasteful quality over [1686] here uh and I think with a capture card [1688] I think it'd be like down sample to 720 [1690] without a capture card it' be 720 or [1692] something like that so anyway it's just [1694] like a $20 little thing that you have to [1695] buy in order to make all this stuff work [1697] um and I realized now that means I'm [1699] going to have to update the title of the [1700] video that's really funny uh but [1702] whatever it so let me show you guys [1705] exactly what that would look like and [1706] some some options for you here [1710] s over to capture [1712] card what you want is you just want like [1714] uh in my case I wanted a 4K capture card [1717] so as you see there a variety of like [1718] pretty expensive options this one's 109 [1720] Canadian which come out to like maybe [1722] 7580 this is the most popular one called [1724] cam link this is what basically all the [1726] the big boys use I'm not using a big boy [1729] cam Link at all I'm using uh some much [1732] cheaper one that I found here for like [1734] 20 bucks or something I think I'm using [1736] this one here I believe it's this one I [1739] may be mistaken but oh yeah sorry this [1741] one here for $20 yeah 4K 1080p so you [1744] know feel free to just get whatever [1745] capture card you want this is going to [1746] cost something like another $13 or [1747] something like that us um I'm going to [1750] update the the video title and stuff [1751] like that to reflect it maybe I have to [1752] re-shoot my intro probably is what it is [1755] uh and you can see there variety of [1757] different use cases for this there's [1758] like the Nintendo switch 4K pass through [1760] there's the Elgato this is like the [1761] really really big dick one um I'm going [1763] to leave it at that but yeah let's just [1765] call this uh $13 [1768] let's update this to [1771] 19 with that capture card um we've now [1774] completed our stack our lights were 8428 [1777] our Sony a6500 was [1778] $45.99 our lens was $261 27 our [1782] microphone was [1783] $12.39 then the capture card is going to [1785] be somewhere around $ 13 to $15 um OBS [1788] is free and then we spend $29 a month on [1790] aonic my whole setup is down to [1793] $995 for basically like professional [1795] YouTube quality um since I've made over [1797] $500 $1,000 with this in profit I have [1800] basically 500x my return on this [1801] investment um I don't think that this is [1803] like the standard outcome for everybody [1805] that tries doing YouTube but I think you [1807] can at least 1ex your return or [1809] basically write this off pretty quickly [1811] within the first couple of months so [1812] long as you're good about the content [1813] you're actually providing value and so [1815] on and so forth so I wouldn't actually [1816] worry too much about that um what I want [1818] to do next is just give you guys some [1819] budget options that you guys can use [1821] even if you don't even if you don't feel [1823] like you're at the point where you can [1824] commit all this money to the same setup [1825] as I um what I wanted to do is I wanted [1827] to give you like a couple of different [1828] options at varying levels of your budget [1831] to ensure that you know whatever um [1834] stage you're in whatever country you [1837] live in with a higher lower cost of [1838] living basically wherever you're [1840] starting you can still get started on [1841] YouTube with like pretty good quality [1843] and nobody's going to hold the quality [1845] against you the quality will never be a [1847] reason why you can't grow okay so the [1849] very first option here is the $150 [1852] option this cost $150 plus 29 bucks a [1854] month for a phonic the first thing [1856] you're going to do is you're going to [1857] get an LED video light kit that led [1860] video video light kit is going to be [1862] something like this doesn't have to be [1863] the exact same thing I use this [1865] obviously and um I could have cut an [1866] extra $10 off or whatever with the [1868] coupon but I'm not I'm not going to [1870] include that in the cost savings [1872] basically you get one of these puppies [1874] and then one of these becomes your uh [1878] key light and you just bring that closer [1880] and you brighten that up because this is [1881] dimable then the other one just ends up [1884] being your fill light and you just make [1885] it further away and then you soften it [1887] and now you actually have professional [1889] is lighting um for like $48 freaking [1892] dollars which is sweet in terms of your [1894] camera you just use your mobile phone so [1896] just like I'm using my iPhone over here [1897] although this is not ideal just use [1899] whatever your mobile phone is and then [1901] mount it or I don't know just like stand [1903] it up or something like that I don't [1905] know maybe something like this um on [1907] like a a bookshelf or something of that [1910] nature and then just stream that you [1912] know like before you go uh before you [1914] start recording go click the record [1916] button put that on your shop or whatever [1919] double check to make sure it's pointed [1920] in the right place and stuff like that [1921] and then and then you're okay the next [1924] thing you want is you want a Samsung q2u [1926] Samsung QT is that microphone that I [1928] recommended to you guys it's uh one of [1929] the cheapest and highest quality [1931] microphones here you guys can get this [1932] for a little over 100 us and this is [1934] where the bulk of the spend is going to [1935] come from and the fourth thing you're [1937] going to want is aonic aonic is just [1939] going to be the place that you drag and [1941] drop your footage into after you're done [1943] um you can get all of this for $150 in [1945] total for the capital investment plus [1947] $29 month recurring investment so that's [1950] setup number one um if you use that [1952] setup your video is not going to look [1953] like mine like you're not going to have [1954] a cool background blur for instance um I [1957] think you're going to have a [1957] substantially less dynamic range on the [1959] light like the whites and the blacks [1960] will be a little bit closer together so [1962] it's just not going to look as high [1962] quality but I want you know that's okay [1964] I have seen a bunch of people start [1966] YouTube with the same approach that I [1968] have with a mobile phone and then still [1970] manage to scale to several thousand [1971] subscribers in just a few months this is [1973] not like the the thing that will stop [1975] you from growth the second is sort of [1977] like like a mid level maybe like a low [1980] mid- level if this is like low this will [1982] be like low to mid this will be mid and [1984] then I'm just going to call this High [1985] even though to be honest you can go way [1986] higher than this um you are still going [1989] to get the LED video light kit here for [1991] 48 bucks but then on top of that what [1992] you're going to do is you're going to [1993] get a Canon EOS Rebel T3i and that's [1996] going to be your camera okay so as I [1998] mentioned before that camera is not [2000] actually as important as the lens the [2002] lens is definitely substantially more [2003] important of an investment your camera [2005] is just like a permissive thing like you [2007] need a camera that can connect to one of [2008] these high quality lenses to get a bunch [2010] of light in there so we're just going to [2012] get an older camera this one called a [2013] Canon EOS Rebel [2018] T3i and this is going to be able to hook [2020] up to a much higher quality lens um this [2023] higher quality lens uh well maybe not a [2025] much higher quality lens but with this [2027] lens we're going to with this camera [2028] we're going to use a Canon 24mm f2.8 and [2031] the f- stop is pretty high so you're not [2032] going to get as much blur but it's still [2034] going to be sufficient blur that like [2035] people will be able to notice there's a [2036] distinction between the foreground and [2037] the background that's going to make your [2038] Productions look higher quality um I [2041] believe I found this okay I'm actually [2043] just going to go on Facebook Marketplace [2044] again see if I could find one of [2046] these I think it's the T3 or the [2048] 600D yeah as you guys could see I mean [2050] this is like I don't know 13 14 15 years [2052] old or something now so the cameras you [2054] can buy them for super cheap you can buy [2055] them for even cheaper I don't know how I [2057] feel about this [2059] one but uh I don't know that might be [2061] perfectly sufficient you know maybe go [2062] meet the guy you buy it for $70 American [2064] dollar this one's 260 bucks looks like [2066] it comes with a nice carrying case and [2067] everything like that also comes with the [2069] lens um I don't personally think this [2070] lens is [2072] sufficient but you know I don't know [2073] maybe you buy that and you try try a [2076] shoot and it ends up working anyway and [2077] you're like hell yeah um as you can see [2080] tons of different options here $300 [2081] camera with case with lens [2083] 260 um if you don't want to do that I [2086] think they might still sell these I [2088] don't I'm not 100% sure though I don't [2090] know so let's give it a [2093] look yeah no they don't sell the same [2095] type anymore um what they do is they [2097] sell like some uh substantially better [2099] type here for $600 Canadian which comes [2101] out to like 450 us so I would definitely [2104] encourage you guys to give this a go [2105] look on Facebook Marketplace grab [2106] yourself a Canon EOS Rebel T3i and then [2108] get yourself um a Canon 24mm f2.8 so I'm [2112] just going to Google this one that's [2116] 179 you know these aren't the same ones [2120] but yeah just get yourself a Canon 24 mm [2122] f1.8 let's check out if this is [2124] available on Amazon looks like it is 180 [2128] us uh$ 1880 Canadian dollars so about [2130] 130 whatever my math uh is over here [2133] you'll probably be able to find some [2134] cheaper options Samsung qtu as well um [2137] aonic for the audio total cost for this [2138] one's going to be 460 plus 29 bucks a [2141] month you are going to have to have a [2143] capture card actually so let me just add [2144] this here as [2146] well we'll go capture card and then why [2150] don't I just use one of these capture [2151] cards that I saw before you are going to [2153] basically need a capture card anytime [2155] that you get yourself a uh [2158] I'm a DSLR or mirrorless so let's go [2161] capture card here and then I'm going to [2162] go capture card down here [2167] too just so nobody yells at me later I [2171] think collectively this was 9 or 19 [2173] great um this is going to give you as I [2175] mentioned basically the same sort of [2176] content quality to me um it's just going [2178] to be a tiny bit less blurry uh the vast [2180] majority of people on YouTube watch [2181] stuff at 1080p anyway most people don't [2183] like upscale me to 4K or click on the 4K [2185] option because they just there's no real [2187] need to watch this at 4K it's not like [2188] you see something that you don't in 1080 [2191] um so you know at the 1080p level of [2193] resolution vast majority of people [2195] aren't really going to be able to notice [2196] that big of a difference you'll be able [2197] to get away with this for just 460 bucks [2200] the next option up was the option that I [2202] talked about with you guys here um where [2205] uh you know I have my Sony a6500 Sigma [2208] 30mm Samsung Q2 aonic capture card LED [2211] light kit and softbox as mentioned you [2213] can also get this cheaper than the 84 [2214] bucks um but I'm just going to leave it [2216] and say that this comes at to $900 19 [2218] and then the last option here is sort of [2221] like your your high-end [2222] option and let me just update this so [2225] that it contains uh the capture card [2228] cost as [2229] well yeah so [2232] basically if I just go up here kind of [2235] drag this around this high-end one the [2238] reason why it's so high-end um is [2240] because of this camera that I'm going to [2242] be using that you can use called the [2244] Sony [2245] a73 um this camera I I guarantee you [2248] like I would consider this mad Overkill [2250] you get a lot of like videography nerds [2251] in the comments probably being like no [2253] actually it's not even that good of a [2254] camera but this Sony a73 is freaking [2257] it's it's crazy powerful super Overkill [2259] if you're doing the sorts of videos that [2260] I'm doing like if you're not like a [2261] whole video production company um this [2264] is more than enough for you you can buy [2266] it for [2267] $18.98 Canadian new so about $ 13 or [2270] $1,400 or so or if you go on Facebook [2273] and you pump in Sony [2275] a73 and you might have used different [2277] key so you can use as 37 like I I I same [2280] thing uh you can get it for [2281] substantially cheaper this one's for [2282] 1,200 Canadian which is like I don't [2284] know 800 or so can American dollars um [2288] and from this you just use the exact [2290] same lens that I was using before but [2292] your your content quality is going to be [2293] even higher which is pretty nice yeah [2295] you see all these like photography [2297] videography guys are like this is The [2298] Beginner's uh camera it's not a [2300] beginner's camera man you could make [2302] well over [2303] $500,000 uh off of YouTube in your first [2306] 10 months posting very inconsistently [2308] with this camera so uh yeah I said [2311] $1,059 here um which is sort of like a [2314] middle ground between the the one that [2316] you could buy for new and then the one [2317] that you could buy uh for used then you [2320] add the sigma 30 mm f1.4 that's my lens [2322] um it'll work with the Sony 73 just like [2324] it works with the a6500 then for the [2326] microphone we're going to get a slightly [2327] different quality microphone we're going [2329] to get one called the Shure sm7b I [2331] realized I didn't update this price this [2333] is actually going to be more money but [2335] the sure is one of probably the best [2338] quality microphones currently available [2339] on the market um for the purposes of of [2342] what we want which is you know some sort [2343] of talking head or um recorded video [2346] like this you can buy it with this boom [2348] arm imagine if you guys um you know if I [2350] had a boom arm here it would go way up [2352] and then it would like Loop [2354] over you you'd have to make it [2356] inconspicuous it kind of depends on your [2357] recording setup if I have a boom arm [2359] that's overhead then my camera is sort [2360] of situated a little bit higher like [2362] most people are going to be able to see [2362] the boom arm which they don't want so I [2364] don't know if i' necessarily always buy [2366] said boom arm um but you know you can [2367] definitely buy the microphone itself for [2369] $450 and it's a great damn microphone [2371] it's like a very very good [2374] microphone so I'm just going to do the [2376] math on this and go 84 * 1,59 261 449 13 [2380] that's [2383] $1,866 plus $29 per month for aonic um [2386] and as you guys can see I'm using aonic [2388] in every single video shoot no matter [2389] what um it's just that good so yeah [2392] that's more or less the budget options [2394] that I have available for you or the [2396] options I have available for you [2397] different levels of budget that last one [2398] definitely is not a budget option so you [2400] can see um you know I didn't you still [2403] don't have to break the bank for this [2404] you can invest under $2,000 and have [2405] like basically a worldclass setup that [2408] everybody will think that you're like a [2409] massive YouTuber for even if you start [2410] with one subscriber um not saying that [2412] that's the right approach necessarily [2414] you should definitely just get whatever [2415] doesn't intimidate you on this list that [2417] is sufficient for your needs and then [2419] just produce a bunch of content but as [2420] you see it's really nowhere near as [2421] expensive as most people make it out to [2423] be um as long as you just you're smart [2425] about the lighting and stuff like that [2426] you'll be fine [2428] okay cool now what I want to do next is [2429] I want to cover my actual production [2430] flow from start to finish because I [2432] think equipment is one thing and [2433] equipment is nice and all and we love [2434] equipment and fantastic um but you also [2436] want to see how I use this equipment in [2438] order to actually create a whole video [2440] so I'm going to walk you guys through [2440] exactly what I do start to finish right [2442] now so you guys have everything you need [2443] to basically copy and paste my own [2445] recording setup maybe make some [2446] iterations on it maybe make it even [2448] better so the very first thing I'll do [2450] during my production flow is I'll [2452] basically write up an outline just like [2453] this one so in my case I wrote this in [2455] whimsicle whimsicle is just a visual [2456] flow chart software platform that allows [2458] me to very quickly and easily um whip up [2460] one of these little modules and then [2462] just copy and paste it a bunch of times [2463] fill it with a bunch of text I've [2465] experimented with a variety of different [2466] platforms for this whimsicle is not the [2467] only one that you could use I've used [2469] gamma I've used excuse me Google Slides [2472] I've used um PowerPoint I've used like [2474] 15 or 20 different ones to be honest um [2476] I basically just vary this every now and [2478] then because I get bored of it but [2479] anyway I'll start with an outline like [2480] this one okay then what I'll do is I [2483] will open up OBS I'll turn on all my [2485] lights and then I'll test my microphone [2487] the cool thing about OBS is if we just [2489] grab my iPhone you see how every time I [2491] talk into this my lavalier microphone [2493] section goes um up right well that's [2496] great that's basically what I want so I [2497] just want to make sure the microphone [2498] works what I'll typically do is I'll [2500] record a test video and I'll just play [2501] it back and listen to it after I'm done [2503] with that I will begin recording and [2505] then I'll I'll just say my hook um I've [2506] recently started using proof promise [2509] plan this is different from what I was [2511] doing before but this is just like a [2513] this is like a three-step hook [2514] methodology where you give people some [2516] sort of proof that you are worth [2518] listening to you're worthy of their [2519] attention so usually you have to say [2520] something like I made $500,000 in profit [2523] off of YouTube in the last year um then [2526] you need to give people a promise in [2527] this video I'm going to show you guys [2528] how to do X Y and Z then you have to [2530] give people a plan so we're going to [2531] start with this we're going to do that [2532] we're going to do that if you guys think [2533] back to the intro of the video that's [2534] basically exactly what I showed you guys [2535] right um this has multiplied my [2538] engagement um I didn't really think it [2539] was all that powerful or important [2541] before but ever since I started using [2542] proof promise plan has just gone [2544] pretty crazy um so I don't know if Alex [2547] rosi was the first one to talk about [2549] proof promise plan or or who exactly it [2550] was but this works really really well [2552] with video content I'd highly encourage [2553] you guys to do it um it's sort of like [2555] the the most salesy that I get as you [2557] guys could tell throughout my Clips then [2560] I will alternate between scenes as I [2562] explain my material um I think I wrote [2565] alternative between scenes so I'll [2566] alternate between scenes as I explain my [2567] material I go talking head like I'm [2569] doing right now then I'll go back down [2571] to video um share as I'm doing right now [2575] uh after I'm done I will export the [2577] recording so I will click stop recording [2579] and then I'll just drag and drop it into [2580] a Premier Pro template that I've [2581] developed for this purpose let me show [2583] you guys what that looks like I pop open [2585] Premier Pro okay so how do I actually go [2587] about editing a video let me show you [2588] what that looks like um first things [2590] first going to go grab my video file um [2594] and I just want to grab like an old one [2596] that I did that has most of my [2599] content okay cool let's do [2601] this so first things first I drag and [2603] drop a video in I usually just like go [2606] over my old [2608] content um in this [2610] template once I'm done with that I will [2612] delete everything else if I zoom way in [2615] here you'll now see that there are a [2616] couple of components to this that um are [2619] just sort of templated and they're in [2620] like uh other tracks so V2 is like my [2623] main track I have a couple in V4 V5 blah [2625] blah blah one that I have is I have this [2627] little like animation thing that happens [2628] at the beginning I just think it looks [2630] cool might not who knows I'll uh vary it [2633] eventually then I have me smiling like a [2635] dumb just to make sure that my [2637] camera works then I also have uh I have [2639] a little like title section here which [2642] is just a template and what I do is I [2643] take a screenshot of something that's [2644] relevant to the video and I stick it in [2647] there so this one was for apify I [2648] believe but let me just show you guys [2650] what that looks like in my [2651] case [2654] um yeah no let's do [2656] this it's not going to look the best but [2658] screw [2660] it then I'm going to [2662] drag the [2664] screenshot stick it on top of the [2666] section [2668] and now I'm just going to resize it to [2669] like 250 or something maybe 275 there [2672] you go and now you know I'm talking or [2676] whatever and then voila I have my little [2678] my little animation screenshot thing [2680] going on um and I find that this is just [2682] like a very simple and easy way to [2683] template out most of my work I then have [2685] gotten the habit of adding a bunch of [2687] these titles that I could just um screw [2688] around with whenever I want so these are [2691] just a bunch of titles for the last [2692] video that I recorded which pretty sweet [2695] and then I have the last title title [2697] which is sort of like the title of the [2699] video um and this one is just called [2700] beginners got to appify so what I'll do [2702] is I'll just jump in here and then I'll [2704] I don't really know what I want to call [2705] this YouTube video setup for little [2709] money that looks good to [2712] me and this just has all the animation [2714] and everything like that that I want [2716] okay great so after I'm done with this [2718] basically what I do yeah I basically [2720] template at the vast majority of the [2721] video right like obviously I have these [2722] titles here in the middle but it's not [2724] super relevant to me um what I'll do [2726] after is I will go through the audio [2729] recording I don't actually know where [2731] the hell is the audio recording oh jeez [2733] I don't think I actually imported the [2734] audio recording let me import this one [2736] more [2741] time yeah weird I don't know why this [2743] isn't getting my audio I'm pretty sure I [2745] recorded audio on [2747] this and Happ if I just allow yeah so [2751] let me just um sometimes I have to drag [2753] this thing here first [2758] and then after I dragg this in and maybe [2761] one of the video editors here could tell [2762] me why um that wasn't working but any [2765] who eventually I get to the point where [2767] like I obviously start my video right so [2770] I go through the audio waveform [2771] instantly cut out the vast majority of [2773] it hey there this is a [2776] complete video which is [2778] sweet I think when I did that I might [2780] have eliminated one of the little [2782] effects that I usually use [2784] unfortunately yeah there you go I did [2786] unfortunately so I'm just going to going [2787] have to go back and do that one more [2794] time uh good we'll cut this out [2798] now and I'll just drag that puppy in hey [2801] there got complete begin got to apify I [2805] other um and then yeah and then I [2807] basically just go through and sometimes [2808] I screw up sometimes when I screw up [2811] they're like major screwups so I have [2812] like big gaps in between my stuff here [2814] it's like three or four minutes and it's [2815] just me being like what the hell [2817] was I supposed to do for that again and [2819] then um you know I'll figure it out I'll [2821] solve the problem then I'll go back to [2822] the recording um this you know doesn't [2824] happen very often for like video content [2827] like this where I'm just talking a lot [2828] and as you can see you know I think I [2830] screwed up like I don't actually know if [2832] this counts because I was just [2833] transitioning to you scene but I don't [2835] know like once [2839] twice three times maybe four times in [2842] this like hourong clip um but on content [2845] that tends to be more build heavy um I [2847] can screw up substantially more so what [2848] I'll do is I'll just go through this and [2850] I'll find the periods where like I'm [2852] obviously not doing anything so as you [2854] see here I'm like setting up a bundle or [2856] a [2857] module something that isn't hyper [2859] relevant to you know I don't want [2860] everybody just to watch me in silence [2862] set this up for a minute so I'll [2864] actually go through and I'll just cut [2865] all that [2867] out and then I'll just go through the [2869] rest of it and just do the same thing [2870] I'll just quickly tab over and just see [2872] hm like what's going on here why wasn't [2873] I saying anything oh it looks like I was [2875] saying something maybe it was just kind [2876] of quiet [2878] then I'll go through the other silent [2880] sections yeah and it looks like I think [2882] something happened with my video here so [2883] it had to I don't know it got shut off [2886] so you know i' for instance I'd cut this [2887] out [2890] completely and in this way you know I'm [2892] spending as minimal time editing as [2894] humanly possible because I'm I'm just [2895] using the waveform um the waveform sort [2897] of tells me when I need to start when I [2899] need to stop this usually takes me like [2901] 2 or 3 minutes and then by the time that [2902] I'm done I basically have the full video [2904] laid out all I do after that is I go [2906] through the transition and I just make [2907] sure they don't look weird cuz sometimes [2908] when I do these Cuts they just look kind [2910] of weird and offputting so if they do I [2912] have to zoom way in and then I have to [2913] like make finer cuts to this as [2916] necessary um but you know again still [2918] saves a bunch of time relative to what [2920] most people do right which is they like [2922] actually go through literally every [2923] minute of their entire recording which I [2925] personally think is Bonkers I'd never be [2927] able to do [2928] that especially you know because I [2929] record like hourong videos and then uh I [2932] will stick this whole thing together [2936] I'm just going to assume that you know I [2938] went through and I I verify that [2939] everything works um I'll try and time [2942] this [2943] to actors task oh which I actually [2946] perfectly did time this to I'll time any [2948] titles or whatever to the specific Parts [2950] where I talk about [2951] it and then voila that's more or less it [2954] I can usually be in and out and done [2956] with the editing in like I don't know 15 [2958] 20 minutes or so um you know I'm not [2960] going to say this is the most studious [2961] and robust of approaches because I've [2963] definitely screwed up in the past where [2965] I've done this approach and then like I [2966] didn't realized but I cut out a giant [2967] section that was important for the [2969] context of the video Bunch people like [2970] Nick where's this section you said you [2971] were going to talk about this but you [2972] didn't I'm like or they've said [2975] stuff like uh you know Nick there's like [2978] a three minute period where you're just [2979] staring off into space and I'm like crap [2981] but I'll be real I don't care about that [2983] anywhere near as much as most other [2984] people do the most important thing to me [2986] is just producing the content [2987] consistently for a long period of time [2988] um and me having this very low friction [2990] setup just enables me to do that this [2992] were any bigger a part of my life than [2994] it already is I think I'd eventually [2995] grow sick of it and stop but it's still [2997] such a small part that like I can [2999] actually enjoy what I'm doing and and so [3000] on and so forth so yeah that's where I'm [3003] at with that um in terms of the rest of [3006] my production setup basically what I'll [3009] do after this is I'll do a cringy [3012] thumbnail pose for a minute or so at the [3014] end of my [3015] video like over and over and over again [3018] and then I'll just screenshot that and [3019] then I'll create a template in canva [3022] which I'll show you guys in a [3024] second then what I do is I just I edit [3027] this thumbnail with the new stuff um [3030] from my my screenshots anyway uh yeah [3033] and then yeah and then that's more less [3034] my editing flow uh and then when I [3036] actually do the posting on YouTube uh [3038] what I'll do is I'll I'll spend a lot of [3040] time trying to figure out like a really [3041] good title and the reason why is because [3043] titles are disproportionately important [3044] on YouTube like if I have a super nice [3047] short Punchy title it'll tend to perform [3048] a lot better than ones that don't so um [3051] what I'll do is I'll run my title [3052] through a title Checker platform so I [3054] personally just use this one capitalize [3056] my title [3057] I enter in my YouTube setup under what I [3061] 919 plus [3064] microphone mic camera lens something [3067] like that and I'll just make sure that [3069] it doesn't do that see there how I like [3072] cut [3075] off I don't want it to cut [3079] off looks like it cuts off right around [3083] 50 60 or so I don't want it to cut off [3087] um I've done tests on this and when they [3089] cut off I tend to just do a lot worse so [3091] I basically try and compress my title [3093] down until it's just as efficient as [3095] humanly possible um and then it just [3096] fits on that that one uh one line which [3099] is really important to me and then when [3101] I actually do the uploading itself I'll [3103] jump into my YouTube [3105] Studio I will get the output of the [3109] aonic I'll click create click upload [3111] videos drag and drop it here then in [3112] terms of like the actual editing it's [3114] pretty straightforward aonic outputs um [3116] a big audio file for me which is nice so [3118] I actually have sorry a big um chapter [3120] heading file for me so I'm going to [3122] pretend that this is a video that I'm [3123] editing right now while it's uploading [3125] I'll actually go through I'll upload the [3126] thumbnail which you can do so down here [3128] I'll typically upload three variants so [3130] in canv I'll make a couple variants and [3131] then test to see which one works the [3133] best so it looks like this one works the [3135] best and I'm getting a lot better at [3137] figuring out what thumbnails work the [3139] best and which ones don't typically the [3140] ones that have some sort of dollar value [3142] equivalent so in my case I've made over [3144] $200,000 with appify I've been selling [3147] appify services myself I've been [3149] building systems with appify for my own [3151] businesses and I've taught some people [3153] done some Consulting now show people how [3155] to use appify so when I have dollar [3157] signs in the in the thumbnail like this [3159] I tend to perform disproportionately [3160] better and then in this case I've also [3162] found when I use the logo of the service [3163] that I'm promoting it tends to do really [3165] well too so I was just running another [3166] test on this to make sure I was right I [3168] had a dollar value figure here then I [3170] had multiple variants um I had a couple [3172] without dollar value figures um uh one [3174] sorry one with the dollar value [3177] um and no logo one with the dollar value [3179] and logo and then one without the dollar [3180] value and the logo and obviously the one [3182] that had both of these perform the best [3184] so you know this is just a more general [3186] rule of life always be testing um once [3189] I'm done with that I'll just paste in [3190] you know my whole thing from a template [3193] and then I have the chapter headings [3194] over here which is pretty nice I didn't [3196] do this for the longest time but I found [3197] that when I add chapter headings um I [3199] typically have higher watch time and [3201] then for tags and stuff you know I have [3203] some software platform here called tube [3205] buddy I believe it's called I don't [3206] personally really use it I just paid for [3209] it once to um allow me to bulk edit all [3211] of the descriptions of my videos I just [3214] like haven't taken it off um but you [3215] know it has like some I don't know tag [3218] keyword explore I don't use any of that [3220] I just copy and paste the tags from the [3221] previous video into the next ones uh so [3223] I like to keep things as simple as [3224] possible I think you guys will notice [3226] that I don't really like optimize the [3228] hell out of every additional every um [3230] specific step um I used to back when I [3232] was a lot smaller on YouTube and I think [3234] a lot poorer as well and what I found is [3236] like optimization like efficiency is not [3238] Effectiveness efficiency is like how [3240] well you are at one particular tiny [3241] thing but Effectiveness is like how good [3243] you are across the entire stack and what [3245] I found is if you spend too much time [3246] optimizing one particular tiny little [3247] component you tend to be more efficient [3249] in that component you don't you don't [3250] tend to be more effective my flow right [3252] now which spends a minimal amount of [3254] time on editing uh minimal amount of [3256] time on production aside from a couple [3258] of little production value hacks like [3260] aonic and stuff like that uh my flow [3262] right now is very effective I wouldn't [3264] consider it super efficient but I [3265] consider it super effective and that's [3266] really what I want right like how many [3268] of these high quality videos can I turn [3269] out in a certain unit time um a fair [3271] number and every time I do I get a [3273] certain number of subscribers from that [3274] video and perpetuity I get a certain [3276] amount of money coming into my [3277] communities and so on and so forth so [3279] that's my mindset there hopefully you [3281] guys enjoyed this um this video is going [3283] to be a little bit different because I'm [3283] going to have to grab the export file [3285] for my iPhone which is actually still [3286] recording I'll probably stop that right [3288] now but you know aside from that this is [3290] more or less what to do with every [3291] single YouTube video if you guys have [3292] any questions about how I did this feel [3294] free to drop them down below if you're [3295] thinking of starting a YouTube channel [3297] your own and you guys wanted some [3298] feedback or maybe a roast or something [3300] like that then yeah just leave me a [3301] comment I'm more than happy to do that [3302] for you I get most of my ideas from my [3304] audience at this point so if you have [3306] anything else that you guys want me to [3307] talk about feel free just let me know I [3309] think this video is specifically an ask [3311] from somebody about four weeks ago that [3313] I'm finally getting around to and if you [3315] guys could do me a big solid like [3316] subscribe do all that fun YouTube stuff [3317] to bump me up in the algo I'll catch you [3319] on the next one cheers

otherwise if you are with [74] me for the Long Haul let's get started [76] with the beginning which is the [77] introduction to appify all right so why [80] appify well I think if you guys have [81] watched any sort of tool tutorial before [83] you'll know they always start with a [84] section like this I'm going to try and [86] keep it as simple as humanly possible [88] because I don't really think it's that [89] relevant you probably already know why [90] the hell you're using appify if you're [92] watching a video on it but essentially [94] appify just solves a simple problem it's [95] in the name appify API FY that first [99] half is all about apis and apathy's [102] whole promise is that it can help [103] convert any resource out there in the [105] internet into an API even if it wasn't [107] really meant to have one think about [109] social media platforms if you think [111] about it what is Facebook or Instagram [113] well it's just a giant ass database that [116] may be a reductive way to say it but [118] it's a giant ass database [120] with a ton of data points on every [122] person basically on planet Earth right [124] Facebook doesn't want you to be able to [126] call an API and get data on any person [128] on planet Earth that's kind of the whole [130] business model apify lets you make an [133] API anyway and get that data just [136] through sort of a roundabout [137] unconventional means which is you know [138] scraping scraping Facebook pages um so [142] that's kind of the use case of bavi it [143] just allows you to turn anything into an [145] into an API even if the thing wasn't [146] necessarily meant to be so I'm sure you [148] guys can imagine that gives you a ton of [149] Leverage if you're in like the sales [150] marketing growth hacking space if you're [153] doing any sort of like business use case [155] where you need access to a structured [156] data source but they don't want you to [158] have one that's a great alternative to [160] paying a large sums especially for [162] structured data sources especially those [163] gatekeep ones that I was mentioning [165] earlier some people would charge you [167] like astronomical several thousands of [168] dollars per month to access a resource [171] why why do that when you can just make [172] an apify scraper in 5 minutes for 30 [174] cents a day that does it instead right [177] so another reason is because of how easy [179] it is to get up and running with and how [180] much value it affords to people at [182] different levels of experience um I know [184] how to build my own scrapers at this [186] point my own scrapers can do basically [188] whatever the hell I want but I find [190] myself returning to appify over and over [191] and over again because it just makes my [192] life a lot easier as opposed to me [194] having to start from complete scratch [196] every single time I want to do this I [197] can just jump on appify check out their [199] store get something that works 80 90% of [201] the way and then either massage that [203] data or add some additional input [205] parameters or something and then get [206] what I was looking for anyway the last [208] rule reason is um the pricing is very [211] very scalable when I say very scalable I [214] mean you know we're at the point now [215] where we can get several thousand [217] records in my case I usually use appify [219] for lead scraping purposes right because [220] I'm selling Automation Services and so [223] on and so forth so you can get several [225] thousand records for like a dollar it's [227] crazy how high leverage using appify is [230] to get data if you think about it back [232] in the day you might have to pay [233] somebody you know $5 to $20 an hour to [236] go and scrape 50 records for you now you [239] can just pay appify you know a dollar [241] get a th000 and have them perfectly [243] structured and basically 100% accurate [245] every time so the purpose of this [246] tutorial is to sort of take a slightly [248] different look at appify you know I care [250] more about appify for the purposes of [252] making money not necessarily for [254] academic purposes so these are the key [256] features that make appify worth using [258] for me all right so let's actually get [260] started and dive into appify just before [262] we do we need to understand Three core [264] principles the first is we need to [266] understand what an actor is then we need [267] to understand what a task is and then [268] finally we need to understand understand [269] what a data set is this tutorial is [272] meant to be an active one so I'm [273] actually going to go and I'm actually [274] going to scrape real resources I don't [276] want this just to be dry academic Theory [277] I want to show you guys how to actually [278] use this stuff to make money but in [280] order to really get there faster we just [282] need to understand these three so bear [284] with me for a moment I'm an actor is [287] basically just ampify branded term for a [289] serverless program that runs in the [292] cloud because we're using appify the [294] scraping platform um these are almost [297] always scrapers I mean there are [298] different terms for this a scraper [299] crawler there's some browser automation [301] things that like click on links and do [303] things for you but I'm just going to [304] bundle all of this under the term [305] scraping because that's probably how you [307] arrived here so that's what an actor is [309] an actor is just a program okay a task [311] is just one specific run of an actor [313] it's like an instantiation of that actor [316] it's the program running top to bottom [318] and actually executing and delivering [319] some output what is that output well [322] that output is usually stored in a data [324] set and a data set is just a place where [326] the data that is scraped from a resource [328] say we're scraping Facebook it's a place [330] where we go we get that data from [332] Facebook and then we put it somewhere [334] and it's where you pull your information [336] from later on um and the cool part about [338] data sets is epy lets you do this in a [340] variety of formats you can store data as [342] adjacent JavaScript object notation CSV [344] comma separated value HTML you actually [347] have a lot of freedom to design this if [349] you create your own scraper which I'll [350] talk about in a moment but okay that is [353] enough of the dry academic 3 Let's [355] actually jump into creating an appify [356] account then navigating the dashboard [358] let's talk about a couple things on [359] there let's actually just Dive Right In [361] with a real practical example which is [363] scraping a social media platform okay we [365] are now on appify homepage this is what [367] it looks like as of the time of the [368] recording of this video may look [370] different um when you are looking at it [372] as you see one of the very first things [374] that we have in front of us is a bunch [376] of different scrapers and data [377] extractors for different platforms [379] obviously they're doing this for [380] marketing purposes as is their landing [381] page they just want to show you that you [382] can do basically whatever the hell you [383] want with apify uh which you can so you [386] can scrape Tik Tok Google Maps Instagram [389] websites uh Amazon and then you can also [392] build your own actor over here which is [394] sweet um they have as I've mentioned [397] before a Marketplace of scrapers which [399] are these a lot of them are [400] extraordinarily lowc cost Andor free you [402] can build your own and then they also [403] have some Professional Services at the [405] beginning of the offer where you can [406] basically like get connected to a [408] network of developers which is pretty [409] sweet this stuff isn't super relevant to [411] us how do you actually like get up and [412] running and use the platform Let Me Show [414] You by making an account so I'm just [415] going to click get started over here and [417] then I'm going to sign up with Google [419] just going to use [420] this email address over here I'm just [423] going to use that to create a new [424] account okay let's just enter our phone [426] number let's click continue this phone [429] number is an open phone number this is a [431] service that I use to manage my business [433] number so let's jump back in here and [434] then let's paste in the code confirm [437] awesome I'm going to set up my own [438] profile now I used to go by Nick Wells [440] which is why everything is Wells um I [442] just thought that nobody would know how [443] to pronounce my last name I was correct [445] nobody does but turns out it's way [447] easier to compete uh on Google when you [450] don't have the same name as a famous [451] baseball player so I went back to SAR [454] awesome and now we're in appify we have [456] the the store in front of us which is [458] pretty cool now first things first I [460] just want to walk us through a couple of [462] things in the top leftand corner I want [464] to walk you through this dashboard at [465] least just the buttons we'll actually [467] dive into every one of these later and [469] then after I'm done with that and after [470] you know like the 80% the 8020 we can [473] actually jump into like making a scraper [475] and doing something cool with it so [477] first things first is this store the [479] store lists every single actor currently [483] available publicly on the platform now [486] as you'll see a lot of these if you look [489] at the URL say appify SL something so [493] appify website content crawler appify SL [497] Instagram scraper appify slf Facebook [500] post scraper right appify Cheerio [503] scraper you'll also notice that some of [505] these say different words Compass slgo [507] Maps extractor Clockwork free Tik Tok [510] scraper what does any of this mean well [512] appify develops a number of these [514] themselves to make it easier for people [516] to get up and running with their program [517] so a lot of these are actually developed [519] by the appify platform but a bunch of [521] these are also developed by people that [523] are regular human beings like you or me [526] or companies that hire developers and [528] use them to build these sorts of flows [530] to make money off of them later and I'll [531] cover all the economics momentarily but [533] essentially this is compass this company [535] is Clockworks right this company is [538] streamers this one is epct Tex and as [541] you guys can imagine this is just this [542] is just an Open Marketplace these are [543] all uh scrapers that have been developed [545] by other people that you can then spend [547] a little bit of money on so you can [548] compensate these people uh to use the [550] good news is when you make a new app ify [552] profile you'll see down here in the [553] bottom leftand corner it says free usage [556] zero out of $5 well they actually [558] provide you a whole like every month [560] they give you $5 of free usage with [562] their server meaning a lot of the time [565] you can use these completely free $5 is [567] a lot of money on appify and it's money [570] to like actually go out there and do [571] like tons of real world things um you [574] know scrape hundreds if not thousands of [576] listings on on one or more of these um [579] actors so I'm not going to cover every [581] single one of these but I just want to [582] show you guys the magnitude available [584] just the sheer diversity of them um [587] LinkedIn jobs Facebook reviews indeed [590] Google Trends Zillow zip code Amazon Tik [593] Tok Trip Advisor Facebook Airbnb vented [596] like you really can scrape virtually [598] anything else and so as just a rule of [600] thumb anytime that I'm starting a new [602] scraping project before I actually go [605] through all the rigar roll and Bs of [607] building the scraper I will always jump [609] on appify first just search it and then [612] see if somebody else has done the leg [613] work for me if so I can usually just use [616] that and it saves me hours upon hours of [618] actually having to go through the rig [619] roll of putting one together myself okay [622] so that's that first tab here that's the [624] store the second tab is your actor's tab [628] now there are two ways to get Act actors [629] into apify the first is you can use one [632] of these store actors as I just [633] mentioned and the second is you can [635] build your own actor we're actually [636] going to be building a very simple actor [638] using chat GPT and some basic nodejs [640] JavaScript later on in this video but as [643] you can see we could either browse [644] actors inore build our own what happens [647] when you browse an actor in the store so [649] I'm just going to go over here I'm just [652] going to click [653] save I'm going to go back to our actors [656] is you'll see this has now been [657] populated with um the actor that I was [660] just using so Google Maps extractor is [662] now actually in our little dashboard [664] here the reason why they do this is it [665] just lets you save your configuration [666] settings and I'll talk about the [668] specific configuration settings in a [669] second so this tab is just used to list [671] all of the actors that in your account [673] nothing [674] special next up is your development tab [676] this allows you to see the actors that [678] you are creating so you can actually [680] create an actor they'll guide you [682] through a big list different programming [684] languages um libraries and approaches uh [687] I'll show you guys what to do with this [688] momentarily but you just give this a [689] click and then work your way through and [691] then you'll have some stored actors um [693] in this tab then you have some saved [696] tasks essentially as I mentioned a tasks [698] is a specific instantiation or specific [701] run of an actor and so what you can do [703] is you actually save all of the [705] configuration details of a specific run [707] to this tab and then you can just fire [709] them off one by one anytime that you [711] want you then have a list of runs every [713] time you run this is sort of like your [715] log here you'll see their outputs you'll [717] be able to click on specific ones and [719] then then finally you have an [720] Integrations tab the Integrations tab is [722] pretty sweet you can basically take [723] actors and then you can connect them [725] with other services in order to automate [727] things you can put things on a schedule [729] you can set it so that every time this [731] thing finishes you get a slack [732] notification there's really almost an [734] infinite number a different things that [735] you can do with this then we have a [737] schedules tab this just allows you to [739] schedule and run actors at specific [741] times so you can create schedules for [744] daily minute hour weekly monthly or even [747] yearly you can set specific configs here [750] where you want to do it on specific days [752] last days you want to do it Monday [754] Tuesday and Thursday there's a variety [756] of um I want to say granularity here [759] with which you can use to schedule [761] things then you have storage which has [763] data sets key value storage and request [765] cues a data set is just that simple um [768] store that I mentioned earlier where we [770] have Json Json L CSV excl HTML you have [773] all these formats basically that epifi [775] will come up with and allow you to build [777] things in then you have some key value [779] stores this is basically you can think [781] of it as um I don't know like a like a [785] nosql database essentially just a big [787] list of key value items then you also [789] have a request cue this is specifically [791] used in appify um web crawling feature [793] where basically when you run one of the [796] actors or a variety of actors they'll [798] scrape all the links available on the [800] page and then you can just add them to a [801] big request queue and then it'll call [803] this request CU constantly to figure out [805] what that next link is to access so more [808] on all of this detail later I just [809] wanted to give you guys a top level [811] overview of what all these freaking Tabs [812] are on the left hand side because [813] personally when I start a new program or [815] a new platform I always just like not to [817] feel super overwhelmed I always like to [819] be able to like look at something and be [820] like okayy I think I know what that does [822] next is proxy if you're unfamiliar with [824] proxy essentially what this is is just a [826] way to mask where the request is coming [828] from as I'm sure you guys can imagine [830] because appify does a lot of things that [832] aren't necessarily um Allowed by the [834] terms of service of the platforms that [836] we are [837] requesting a lot of the time these plat [839] forms have it's sort of like a cat and [840] mouse game between the platform and [841] appify or scraping Tools in general to [844] try and figure out well where is this [845] request coming from is this request a [846] legitimate user of our service or is [848] just somebody trying to scrape us what [850] proxies allow you to do is they [851] basically allow you to mask or hide your [853] request pretend that it's coming from [854] some different place or resource in our [856] case a different IP address or different [858] home or a different mobile phone and [861] then as a result you know we can access [862] the data a lot easier then you have a [865] settings tab here um this is just pretty [867] self-explanatory you can change your [868] email username you can add a little [870] profile here add a bunch of your [872] programming stuff like your GitHub [873] homepage um you can change the theme I'm [875] a big fan of the Dark theme personally [877] hell yeah uh two Factor authentication [879] session stuff you have access to your [881] API tokens over here in API and [883] Integrations this is easily one of the [885] simplest ways to connect to a service [887] that I personally found I mean I use [889] make.com and an A10 and zap here and all [892] you need to do in order to like send a [893] request to appify is just click on the [894] appify modu and just paste in this token [896] so it's really easy organizations you [898] can can actually join a bigger company [901] here um just as a user and then you can [903] set your notification and privacy [905] settings over here the last thing that [907] I'll touch on is just this billing tab [909] now appify bills in four different ways [911] it bills you based off of actor compute [914] units which is the amount of like [916] compute the amount of CPU or or or [920] runtime basically on the serverless [923] cloud program that you are instantiating [926] you have data transfer which is data [929] sent to and from appify you have proxy [932] so proxies are build through appify if [934] you use their appify proxy tool which I [936] recommend for Simplicity so they'll [938] charge you based off that then you have [939] storage you can see that they store uh [942] they charge you based off of your data [943] sets your key value stores and your [945] request cues so this is sort of how [947] everything is managed price-wise under [949] the hood but as you can see our free [950] usage is currently $0 out of $5 meaning [953] we have five whole bucks of free usage [956] um which is pretty great the $5 is [958] usually more than enough to do whatever [959] you want to do with this now we also [961] have access to historical usage [963] dashboards you can actually see on a [964] daily basis where all of the dollars [967] that you are spending on this platform [968] are coming from which I really [969] appreciate a subscription tab that [971] allows you to obviously sign up to a [973] variety of different packages right free [975] starter scale business [977] Enterprise um some information about [979] pricing uh some actors are priced at [981] different uh dollars per compute unit I [983] believe you also have proxy costs all [986] these things change over time and so [988] this is just a way to see see them at [989] any given point invoices and then you [991] can also set some limits so that you [992] know you don't go over spending $10 a [994] month or something or uh you know have [996] appify notify you if you're approaching [998] your limit all right so I think now by [1001] this point you guys probably know [1002] everything you need to know in order to [1004] make appify at least makes sense to you [1006] from bird ey view let's actually go [1008] through now and let's run an actual [1011] scraper let's get real data from a [1013] social media platform let's just let's [1015] just take a look at how all this stuff [1016] works let's actually run through a [1018] practically use case an example of using [1020] appify to do something for business all [1022] right so let's actually build out a real [1024] scraping application what I'm going to [1025] do in this case is I'm just at the store [1027] here I just clicked view all I'm just [1029] going to find something that I could use [1031] I think in my case let's just start with [1032] Instagram because this is built by [1034] appify it's probably the most supported [1035] and is very simple per unit based [1037] pricing which I think everybody here [1038] will [1039] appreciate so in order to use this when [1041] I click on it you'll see there's some [1043] additional information first of all we [1044] have the title then we have the rate now [1046] not all actors are paid in the same way [1049] this one is a specific type of payment [1051] plan called pay per result as you see [1053] here it says $2.30 per 1,000 results [1056] that means basically every result that [1057] comes in is going to be I don't think my [1060] math is super good but it's going to be [1062] what two cents I think 2.3 cents or [1065] something like that I think 2.3 cents [1067] yeah no it won't be 2.3 cents it'll be0 [1070] 23 cents I think um the idea there being [1075] that uh I'm so bad at this I'm actually [1078] going to run the numbers okay it's [1080] 0.0023 cents so it is0 23 cents as I [1083] mentioned 023 so it is 023 cents as I [1086] mentioned so you can tell I clearly need [1088] my coffee um any who uh what that means [1091] is every result that you get you'll have [1093] to pay 23 cents on uh which I consider [1096] very fair and reasonable pricing you're [1097] getting a th000 results pay two bucks [1099] for that's pretty sweet considering that [1101] a single result can do great things for [1103] it right even one result can make you [1104] thousands of dollars if you're doing [1106] this for some sales reason U but anyway [1108] so you get the pricing up here you get [1109] the number of monthly users here you get [1111] the number of stars and then you get the [1113] person that it's crafted by and [1114] maintained by I usually look for things [1116] that have more than maybe a 100 or so [1117] monthly users if you have fewer than 100 [1119] monthly users a lot of the time it's [1120] just like a new scraper that was [1122] developed by somebody that's just [1123] getting started in this space and uh [1125] it's a little a little bit less reliable [1127] a little bit less trustworthy regardless [1129] let's actually go through how to how to [1130] use this stuff the first thing you'll [1132] see on the left hand side is this big [1134] input tab so you'll see here we have um [1137] a manual modee and adjacent mode [1139] so I'm going to use manual just for the [1140] purposes of this demonstration but I [1142] want you to know that you could also [1143] just like feed in Json or JavaScript [1145] objects directly into appify as input [1148] for any one of these scrapers and it'll [1150] work that's actually how you communicate [1152] with them through API which I'll share [1153] to you later as well so you can see here [1156] right this Instagram URLs you want to [1157] scrape this is actually just this [1159] element here direct URLs and it's an [1161] array of URL objects actually just URLs [1165] um in strings so you just list a bunch [1169] of Instagram URLs here in this tab and [1171] then it will go it'll scrape a bunch of [1173] information from that for you you then [1176] have a few additional settings what do [1177] you want to scrape from each page do you [1179] want to scrape posts comments details or [1181] profile post hashtag replace profile [1183] mentions profile Reals in my case I'm [1184] just going to stick with posts what are [1186] the max number of results per URL 200 [1190] let's just do 10 for the purposes [1191] demonstration then you also have a [1193] little filter here that allows you to go [1194] newer than so you can select only things [1197] that are newer than I don't know 2024 d [1201] uh [1202] 03-10 or something like that let's do [1207] 2023 03 and then let's do 10 so now [1211] we're only going to be scraping results [1212] that are newer than March 10th 2023 from [1216] this humans of New York Instagram page [1218] the purpose of this demonstration let's [1220] actually jump in here and let's just see [1221] when sort of posts we have most of these [1224] look to be photos which are quite nice [1226] and yeah looks like we have a bunch that [1227] are going to be before or after rather [1229] December or March the 10th 2023 so we [1232] should have access to a lot of these as [1233] you can see we're going to have some [1234] photos here we're going to have [1235] obviously like a big caption we're going [1237] to have some additional um things like [1240] comments posts and so on and so forth so [1243] let's actually pump this in and let's [1244] see what sort of data we get in order to [1246] do so just click save and start down [1248] here this will now run the actor and [1251] what's happening when we do this and [1252] this isn't going to happen instantly [1254] because we're actually literally [1255] spinning up a server and sending it but [1257] this is going to be scraping that [1258] resource that we called it's then going [1260] to be using whatever the logic or the [1263] programming uh whatever the code in that [1265] specific scraper is for or or or was [1268] built for it'll be using that to extract [1271] data and then it will add that data to a [1273] data set that apfi just created for us [1276] that is now linked to this actor as well [1278] and as a result we now have a link or a [1280] list I should say of various posts here [1283] with all of these [1284] columns so what I'm going to do just so [1287] we could see everything so I'm just [1289] going to go over to Jason here although [1290] you can also view in tabular but I'm [1292] just going to jump it into Jason and [1294] then show you guys the data that we just [1296] received from Instagram keep mind that [1298] Instagram does not have an API that [1300] allows you to do this stuff right we [1302] just created our own API essentially so [1305] this first one is you know we have an ID [1308] of the Instagram post we have the video [1310] type we have the short code we have a [1312] caption I kind of miss mail attention [1313] interesting hashtags mentions we have a [1316] URL like an actual link to the Post if I [1318] just copy this and then paste this in [1320] here you'll see that you actually have [1322] the whole video this looks to be one of [1324] the more recent [1326] ones you see that there's a comment we [1329] actually have access to the first [1330] comment on the post then we have a big [1332] array with a list of other comments I [1334] mean I think you guys are already [1335] starting to appreciate but we could do a [1337] ton with this data like you could [1338] theoretically and this is just literally [1339] off the top of my head you could scrape [1342] pages that have above a certain number [1344] of followers so find a big list of uh [1347] pages that I've overun a million [1348] followers or something and then get all [1350] of their data scrape the most I don't [1353] know five most recent posts get like uh [1356] the caption get the photo maybe feed the [1359] photo through AI get a couple of the [1361] comments and stuff like that and just [1362] use that to recreate the same sort of [1365] content and then repurpose it and use it [1367] to grow your own Instagram Channel this [1369] is something a lot of people do right [1370] now manually there are whole teams that [1373] are just tasked with scrolling through [1374] famous people on Instagram or Tik Tok or [1376] various social media platforms and using [1378] them as idea Farms you can just do this [1380] completely autonomously now through [1381] appify you can also scrape posts from [1384] people um you can scrape comments from [1386] people you could look for comments that [1388] say certain things and then respond to [1390] people send them DMS or something like [1392] that work through other automations and [1394] platforms I think you guys can [1396] appreciate just how unlimited the [1397] options are here and we received quite a [1399] ton of [1401] data for something that really just took [1403] like 2 seconds as you can see we got 10 [1406] results the price was 2.3 cents so 2 3 [1409] cents time 10 not bad if I do say so [1412] myself okay so that's the Instagram [1414] scraper and I'm going to show you guys [1416] how to use these to actually go out [1417] there and then do cool stuff with it so [1419] I'm going to show you how to connect [1420] this to like uh no code platform like [1422] make.com to run one of those AI flows [1424] that I talked about show you guys how to [1426] use web hooks to pump this into anything [1428] you want whether it's na1 or power [1429] automate or whatnot but before then let [1432] me just run through a couple of other [1434] ones and let's just see if we can get [1436] some more interesting data so now maybe [1439] instead of trying to scrape Instagram [1440] what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to [1441] scrape uh Twitter instead as you see [1444] here we have this tweet scraper V2 pay [1446] per result X Twitter scraper and then [1448] you can see we have 40 cents per th [1450] tweets instead of being $230 cents per [1452] th records we're now only spending 40 [1454] cents which is pretty sweet and what I [1456] want to do is I just want to read [1458] through this thing top to bottom it [1461] looks like what we're [1462] doing is we are adding Search [1465] terms here so jumping over to Twitter [1471] we are adding whatever search term that [1473] we want [1476] so let's say [1481] Automation and then we're getting all of [1483] the posts that show up for [1486] automation from that we're also going to [1487] get a ton of data on each post we're [1491] going to receive I imagine probably like [1492] the post text itself the person that [1494] like made it um you know probably some [1496] comments stuff like that and we'll be [1497] able to do some cool stuff with it so it [1499] looks like all these fields are optional [1501] looks like you can do one or the other [1503] you could scrape URLs so we could just [1504] feed in a direct URL we could feed in a [1507] search term like automation that's [1508] probably what I'm going to do for [1509] Simplicity you could also feed in [1511] Twitter handles if you wanted to so [1512] maybe scrape all the posts from Elon [1514] Musk or Taylor Swift then even you have [1517] the ability to pass in conversation IDs [1519] so the only thing I want here is I'm [1521] only going to want um automation just [1524] for the purpose of this demonstration [1525] but I think you guys can see you know [1527] you have a lot of latitude here here if [1528] you wanted to like try and repurpose [1530] Elon musk's tweets or something or have [1532] some sort of like Twitter um Watcher or [1535] something that takes uh you know Elon [1537] musk's tweets every five minutes and [1539] then tries and and and does something [1541] cool with them you absolutely could you [1543] can do the same thing for a variety of [1545] different approaches start URLs Search [1547] terms Twitter handles conversation IDs [1549] and so on WE for a maximum number of [1551] items on output I don't actually want to [1552] pay 40 cents so why don't we just do 10 [1555] again and then what we're going to do is [1557] we're going to sort this by [1559] latest then we have access to a variety [1561] of other filters so we could filter [1563] tweets by their language we can only [1565] make verified users popup only Twitter [1567] blue only image video or quotes maybe [1570] you wanted to run something that [1572] extracted images and then edited those [1574] images slightly maybe reverse them and [1576] then uploaded them to some other Service [1578] uh maybe you wanted to only do quotes so [1581] that you could extract the text and then [1583] try and repurpose that text for some [1585] other purpose um you can also do what [1588] looks like a query wizard which is their [1590] Advanced um sort of uh tweet finder tool [1594] where you can filter by author reply to [1596] mentioning Geo tags near and so on and [1598] so forth so they just filled all the [1600] stuff in just so we could see what this [1602] looks like but I'm just going to exit [1605] out of all this because I don't want to [1606] constrain our search with any [1607] unnecessary [1609] filters then finally we have some [1611] Advanced options and this is what I was [1613] talking about earlier where you can get [1614] 80% of the way there just using a [1616] pre-built scraper and then just [1617] modifying a little bit in code we're not [1620] going to do any advanced options here [1621] what you can do is you could take the [1622] output object and then you could map it [1624] you could do something different with it [1626] you could add strings you could filter [1628] things if you know a little bit of [1629] JavaScript or node those skills go a [1631] long long way there are variety of um [1635] pieces of documentation that sort of [1637] teach you how to do this so I'm not [1638] going to dive into that aspect on my own [1640] but at the end of this video I'm going [1641] to cover some places that you can go to [1643] learn more about how to do things like [1645] write little code Snippets using node [1647] and so on and so forth to do stuff like [1649] that okay great now that we have all of [1652] our settings let's actually pump this up [1654] to 20 I'm happy to spend I don't know 4 [1655] cents on this however little it is and [1658] let's see what sort of data that we get [1660] as you can imagine what's happening well [1662] bottom leftand corner you'll see this [1663] memory tab just shot up from 0 to 256 [1666] megabytes the reason why is because we [1667] actually just spun up a server a 256 [1669] megabyte of memory server that actually [1671] went through Twitter and then scraped [1673] you know all of those posts um again we [1675] didn't need to know how to build a [1676] scraper we didn't need to know any of [1677] that stuff all we needed to do was set [1680] this up with a search term Automation [1682] and it handled all of the BS for us and [1685] it did so for 04 cents in total now one [1689] thing that always confused me when I [1691] started with abifi was this output tab [1693] you'll see here there's summary data [1695] check storage tab for all fields and [1696] then there's all Fields one thing that I [1699] always used to confuse was I used to [1700] think that all the fields that I'm [1701] seeing here were all the fields that I [1703] got but in reality if we click all [1704] Fields you'll see there's actually way [1706] more data here we basically doubled the [1707] amount amount of data that we managed to [1709] get from this and included a bunch of [1711] additional columns so for instance we [1713] have um 29 Fields buried under author so [1718] we have type user username we have URL [1721] Twitter URL ID name is verified profile [1725] picture if I just check this profile [1727] pick really quickly let me show you guys [1729] that you can actually do basically [1731] anything with this granted this is a [1733] very small profile picture but it looks [1734] like two stickmen one walking up this [1736] little pillar that say GC [1739] you have descriptions you could use this [1741] to copy profiles you could use this to [1743] run some competitor analysis in a space [1745] I mean like the ideas are are virtually [1747] Limitless it looks like buried under a [1749] card you have a full photo images which [1751] is pretty sweet you have various [1754] entities and so on and so on and so [1756] forth this is pretty cool right um you [1758] know because you have access to the [1759] links to you can run some sort of QA [1761] thing where actually jump back in make [1762] sure it works looks like this was some [1763] hiring post for a company called gcmc [1766] that was hiring for a cyber security [1767] automation engineer speaking of hiring [1769] you can totally run campaigns that like [1771] just look for the term hiring and then [1774] get all of the posts find uh you know [1777] add them to a big spreadsheet then maybe [1779] you or somebody else just goes through [1780] that spreadsheet once a day clicks the [1782] links and then submits a CV so very very [1786] many creative ways to get up and running [1787] with appify and I think the purpose of [1789] me doing this brainstorming live is just [1791] to show you guys how many possibilities [1793] there are how many ways you can augment [1795] your own workflow with the results of an [1796] automation like this [1798] let's see if we could scrape something [1799] else so we just scraped Instagram and [1802] then we scraped Twitter why don't we try [1804] scraping Google [1806] Maps let's say we're looking for I don't [1808] know we're running some campaign and we [1810] want to send a bunch of people emails uh [1811] specifically we're running a campaign to [1813] sell some project management system for [1816] restaurants maybe some order management [1817] system well the search term we're going [1819] to supply here for Google Maps extractor [1821] is restaurant we're then going to look [1824] for all restaurants within relatively [1826] populated place New York us say let's [1828] say we only want to search for 10 places [1830] per search term or URL cuz I don't want [1832] to bump that usage up too high it's [1833] already a two whole cents the variety of [1836] filters I can do here and I'm not going [1837] to cover the filters because um I think [1839] as you guys are probably appreciating [1841] basically every scraper has different [1843] filters because you as a developer get [1845] to choose what you want to add but I'm [1848] just going to click save and start let's [1849] just see what pops up here in the bottom [1852] left hand corner you guys just take a [1853] peek here you'll see that we are now [1855] spinning up a server as opposed to 256 [1857] megabytes the servers Now 1 Gigabyte the [1859] reason why some servers are bigger and [1862] other servers are smaller um or the [1863] reason why they have more or less memory [1865] is just because some platforms have [1866] stricter scraping controls and so in [1868] order to scrape a resource you need to [1869] do a little bit more work you need to [1871] have a little bit more running under the [1872] hood anyway it took us something like 18 [1875] seconds from start to finish to get all [1877] of this data and let's uh let's take a [1879] look at what we actually have first [1881] thing we have is we have the image URL [1882] of the restaurant that looks pretty [1884] tasty looks to me like some Diner or [1886] something we have the total score we [1889] have the reviews count we have the [1891] street address the city we have the [1892] state country code um we even have the [1895] website for all restaurants with [1896] websites we have the phone number we [1898] have the category name we have URL and [1901] so on and so forth and keep in mind that [1903] I'm just using the overview field here [1904] right there's more there's all fields [1907] and as you can see we now have [1908] substantially more data on this so what [1910] could you do with this you could just [1911] very quickly and easily write up a [1913] little program or in no code do some [1915] dragging and dropping of modules and [1917] find only places that have a review [1919] score let's say under four and then [1921] maybe you pump them into some cold call [1924] campaign and you call them and say Hey [1925] you know I noticed your reviews are [1926] under four I wanted to solve that for [1928] you with my special thing or maybe you [1930] look for restaurants that have above a [1932] certain number of reviews or something [1934] use that as your filter to say well this [1936] is probably a pretty big restaurant they [1937] probably have a fair amount of money if [1938] they have that many reviews um let's see [1940] if we could go to their website and then [1942] get their email address get their phone [1943] number a lot of the time you are going [1945] to have their phone number but lot of [1946] the time this is just like the main [1948] restaurant phone number if you want to [1949] contact let's say the general manager or [1950] something you need to go a little bit [1952] deeper but I'll show you guys how to do [1954] all that U momentarily using this data [1956] source because this is one of my most [1958] commonly used data source to find phone [1960] numbers and email addresses of small to [1961] mediumsized businesses and I want you [1963] guys to appreciate just how valuable [1964] appify can be for that [1966] purpose okay great so we did Google Maps [1969] Instagram we did Twitter but there's a [1972] variety of other things that you can do [1973] here as well let's do one [1976] more let's see Facebook ad Library [1980] scraper Google search result scraper Tik [1982] Tok video Tik Tok scraper [1986] H so many options Facebook ads [1990] booking.com indeed I like the indeed [1993] scraper just on that same note of us [1995] looking for jobs you can look for [1997] positions let's say automation or [2000] actually let's just type in um I like [2002] automation we'll do Automation in the [2004] United States specifically why don't we [2006] do [2008] Austin and then we'll just return 10 as [2011] you can see this is five bucks per [2012] thousand results so we should be this [2014] should cost us another five cents or so [2015] I [2016] believe um we can follow redirects for [2019] apply link this is interesting it looks [2021] like the scraper actually has the [2022] ability to follow any redirects to find [2024] the link to apply directly to the job so [2026] if you were a smart enterprising [2027] individual looking for work and you had [2029] you know couple of minutes available and [2032] $5 fre ampify usage you could totally [2034] search for [2036] jobs in automation and apply to them in [2038] basically an automated way okay so let's [2041] click save and start and let's just see [2042] what happens see what sort of data comes [2044] out the other side as you guys can see [2046] this particular scraper has a memory of [2048] 4 gbt why well because this one probably [2051] needs substantially more resources in [2053] order to you know start and finish um a [2055] lot of the time when you scrape these [2057] resources that really aren't meant to be [2058] scraped like indeed like Facebook like [2061] Google they have very strict controls [2063] and protections in place that prevents [2065] you from actually going that extra mile [2067] and the only way to get around them is [2069] by spinning up you know a server with [2071] much larger memory doing a lot more [2073] essentially um and that's basically [2075] what's going on here that's why this is [2076] 4 gigabytes whereas the other one was 1 [2078] gab and the one before that was only 256 [2081] megabytes okay great you'll see that our [2084] free usage just jumped up to nine whole [2085] cents whoop [2086] be let's look at some of the data that [2089] we got from this job [2090] scraper the first thing that we see is [2092] the position name then we see the salary [2095] we see the job type company rating [2097] number of reviews even see a URL we get [2100] company info here if I go to all Fields [2102] you see we get substantially more we [2103] actually get [2105] descriptions wow so much you could do [2107] with that you could pump that into [2108] artificial intelligence you could use [2109] that artificial intelligence to write up [2112] or customize your CV based on these [2114] descriptions that sounds like a pretty [2116] fun thing let's actually do that as an [2118] example different job types full-time [2120] contracts on and so forth position names [2122] locations obviously all of them are in [2124] Austin because those the parameters that [2125] we set posting name posting date rating [2128] reviews salary scrape at search inut in [2130] url so I'm not going to make this the [2133] whole focus of the video obviously I [2135] don't want you guys have to necessarily [2137] just run through every single one of [2139] these that would take me probably [2141] several hundred if not a thousand hours [2143] um but I want you I wanted you guys just [2144] appreciate the diversity of scrapers [2146] available and the various things that [2147] you could do with them on appify all [2149] right now you know everything about [2150] appify that you need to know in order to [2152] actually get out there and make real [2153] money with it so that's what I want to [2155] cover next what do you do with this data [2157] how do you take this data and then use [2158] it for some actual business capable [2161] purpose so what I'm going to do is I'm [2163] going to be walking you through a couple [2164] of quick and easy ways to connect appify [2167] with a few thirdparty applications I'm [2169] going to show you how to connect it [2170] specifically to one called make.com very [2172] simple no code Builder that I use a lot [2174] I'm also going to show you how to get [2175] the outputs as a web hook which [2177] technically allows you to take that data [2179] and then put it anywhere on any platform [2181] any server any script that you're [2182] running and so on and so forth for the [2185] purpose of demonstration I'm going to be [2186] using two simple examples one is our [2189] restaurant example from earlier so we [2191] got a bunch of restaurant data in New [2192] York right I'm going to pretend that [2194] we're actually running a campaign where [2196] we're cold emailing restaurants with [2198] some copy right with with some Pitch we [2201] I don't know just made this new cool [2203] order management software we're just [2204] trying to get it out to as many [2205] restaurants as possible we show you how [2207] to use appify to scrape that data and [2210] then use the various fields that are [2211] returned to enrich the website to get an [2213] email address and once you have the [2215] email address I'm going to show you how [2216] you can use AI [2218] along with those app IFI data fields to [2220] customize the cold email and then [2221] actually draft one in your email inbox [2224] the second is going to be um based off [2226] the indeed data that we got with the job [2227] listings we're just going to pretend [2229] that you are looking for a job right now [2231] and you want to build a system to help [2233] you so this automated system will scrape [2235] jobs using appify if the job has a [2238] description like a detailed write up of [2239] what the job is looking for we're going [2240] to feed that into Ai and have it [2242] customize a resume template for us then [2244] create a Google doc and then ultimately [2246] cue that email up as well um I bring [2248] these up to you not because I think that [2249] these are the most perfect examples of [2251] the coolest and highest Roi systems I [2253] built thousands of way cooler systems in [2255] well hundreds of way cooler systems in [2256] this probably at this point feel free to [2258] check my channel if you want examples um [2260] but just to show you guys using the [2262] actual examples like using the actual [2264] runs of the data that I just showed you [2266] a moment ago how many cool things you [2268] can do I came up with these in five [2270] minutes if you spend a lot of more time [2272] and energy on this you'll probably be [2273] able to come up with substantially [2274] cooler use cases and ultimately do [2277] things that make a ton of money okay so [2279] let's start with our very first example [2281] which is to get a restaurant check to [2283] see if the website exists if it does [2284] enrich it um AKA get the email address [2287] if you're familiar with the par Lance a [2289] customize the gold email and draft the [2290] gold email so I'm going to head back [2292] over here and then what I'm looking for [2294] is our Google Maps extractor right we're [2296] looking for restaurants in New York and [2298] instead of you know what 10 or something [2301] I'm going to search 100 I'm going to [2303] click save and start now what I'm going [2305] to do is I'm going to go to my no code [2306] tool it's called [2308] and I've actually already built this out [2309] just a second ago um the second time I'm [2312] recording it unfortunately my first [2313] recording did not include any [2316] audio and then what I'm going to do is [2318] and I realized that I'm actually going [2320] to board this because I don't want to [2321] run it yet um what I'm going to do is [2323] I'm going to show you how to take appify [2325] and then connect it with make.com which [2326] is a third party no code tool one that I [2328] use very often I teach people how to use [2330] so go appify restaurant um C email [2334] system and the very first thing we have [2336] to do is click on this purple PL plus [2337] button like in order to get here you [2339] need to go to let me just show you guys [2341] for the purposes of illustration you [2344] just log in to make.com and click create [2346] a new scenario up here and then you'll [2348] be tasked with this uh very intimidating [2350] purple button just type in appify here [2353] what you're looking for is watch actor [2354] runs give that a click what you need to [2357] do is you'll need to create a connection [2359] so I'm just going to go restaurant [2360] example under web hook name then for [2363] connection I'll click add and I'm just [2364] going to enter my email address here and [2367] then have API token because remember [2369] back when we went inside of appify [2372] settings then API and Integrations we [2374] saw this personal API token section well [2377] all I need to do is copy this then head [2379] back over to the scenario in question [2383] which is this one paste that in and [2385] click save from here this will now be [2388] connected to our account so appify and [2390] make.com this third party code platform [2392] these are literally now connected [2394] together you can shuttle data to and [2395] from them in one piece of data that [2397] we've gotten is we've gotten a list of [2399] actors that have been used on the [2401] account so Google Maps extractor indeed [2403] scraper Instagram scraper tweet scraper [2405] what we want is Google Maps extractor so [2407] I'm going to click save here then I'm [2410] click okay and now what I'm going to do [2412] is I will go back to my actor Google [2415] Maps extractor here now I'm going to [2417] click [2418] Start and then inside of make I'm just [2421] going to click run once and what this is [2423] now going to be doing is this is [2425] currently as the title suggests watching [2427] the actor run so as the actor runs as [2430] the memory gets spun up the free usage [2432] goes up alongside it we're now going to [2435] be sending a completed status update to [2439] make.com with all of this [2442] information so it's currently scraping I [2444] see that it's just about done and that [2447] data if you guys were very very astute [2449] here you'll have seen that we got this [2451] little check mark in the tab before we [2453] got the data in make so there's about a [2455] second delay or so but we have a status [2457] message along with a bunch of other data [2458] columns your ID actor ID user ID started [2461] at finish at blah blah blah we got the [2462] status message say the scraping is [2464] finished you can view all scrape places [2465] lay down on a map here you can take some [2467] time to load for fully large data sets [2469] that's cool okay great so we've now [2472] determined that we can send data from [2474] appify to make well can we use make to [2476] get data from appify can we kind of go [2477] in the other direction and that's [2479] actually sort of the the default way [2480] that appify likes you to communicate [2482] with its API let's go back to appify and [2484] what we need next is we need this get [2486] data set items module so I'm just going [2488] to drag that over and connect that and [2490] what we what we do is if you click on [2492] this you'll see it says data set ID this [2495] is the ID of the data set that we just [2497] dumped the data to and in make.com this [2500] is just an empty field we basically need [2501] to fill it with something okay so really [2504] what we're looking for is we're looking [2505] for this variable right over here it's [2506] called default data set ID you can see [2509] the last run the value is ZB 012 z t [2513] blah blah blah now the issue is if I [2515] just click on this if I just leave leave [2517] everything else then click okay and then [2518] I run well now make.com is just waiting [2520] for the actor to finish running again so [2523] we don't actually want to do that what [2524] we want to do is we just want to we just [2526] want to grab the default data set ID and [2528] then we just want to hard code it so the [2530] way that you do this is you head to [2532] storage and then there'll be this data [2534] set ID variable here zb0 I2 zto and then [2539] in our case we're just going to hardcode [2540] this directly in here so that every time [2542] we run this module it's just going to [2543] grab the data from the data set ID this [2545] is the difference between testing and [2546] like production ready flow and this in [2548] our case we're just testing so I just [2549] want to grab the same data every time [2552] okay so now I'm going to click run once [2553] and let's see what [2554] happens what you'll see is we have the [2556] search string restaurant search page URL [2558] we have the title of the restaurant [2560] category name address neighborhood [2562] street blah blah blah we even [2565] have uh yeah it looks like we have a ton [2567] of data on this [2569] honestly we even have stuff like [2572] the um Reserve table URL you can [2575] literally reserve a table at the [2578] restaurant if I scroll through here a [2580] little further you'll see that some of [2581] these have descriptions comfy diner with [2583] counter stools serving American eats [2585] from all day breakfast to sandwiches and [2586] steaks there's a lot of value here [2588] basically and this is just shuttling the [2590] data directly from appify into our [2593] make.com [2594] instance okay great so what's the next [2596] step well now that we have a bunch of [2598] data on this the question is like [2600] hypothetically if I wanted to whip out [2601] this cold email campaign there are a [2602] couple things I would need like I would [2603] need for for one I would need an email [2605] right so let's tackle that next in [2607] make.com it's pretty easy to get emails [2609] um as long as you have you know some [2611] loose change uh very simple platform [2614] that I like using to get emails is one [2616] called any mail finder so you'd have to [2618] sign up to any mail finder for this but [2619] basically what you do is you pump in the [2620] domain name and then it goes and it [2622] Scrolls the internet and looks it trolls [2624] the internet and looks for an email [2626] address at this domain name and if it [2628] finds one then it returns one to you so [2630] I'm going to use the search for a [2631] company's emails module to show you guys [2633] how easy it is to get an email address [2635] it's so straightforward [2637] unbelievable I'm click search by [2640] domain email verification filter I'm [2642] just going to use all found emails and [2645] then for domain I'm just going to type [2646] in the website [2650] here now I don't want to return all 100 [2652] of these because I don't actually want [2653] to consume a 100 of my credit so I'm [2655] just going to set the limit to [2657] five and then I need to add a filter in [2660] between these two modules which is just [2661] going to be does the website exist so [2663] I'm going to go over here find [2665] website and and then under this filter [2668] operator I'm going to say basic [2669] operators exists so now I'm checking to [2672] see does this website exist if so [2675] continue if not [2676] don't all right sweet now I have [2678] everything necessary for me to actually [2680] test this looks like I had uh some error [2683] with authentication I imagine that's [2684] probably because I was using the wrong [2686] connection there my [2689] bad so now we're actually running this [2691] we're actually going out we're finding [2693] email addresses or we're attempting to [2694] anyway this system can take however long [2697] um you know the number of domains that [2699] you're feeding into could take so in my [2701] case I'm feeding in three we'll see how [2703] long that this takes on the first run [2705] looks like it took like 5 seconds or [2709] so looks like we are mostly receiving [2714] true results which is [2718] nice and sorry I fed in five so it looks [2720] like out of the five there were four [2722] with websites it looks like one of them [2724] was a Facebook website so I don't think [2726] this is going to have the right email [2727] but that's cool and of the rest of these [2729] we actually found four four out of four [2732] so three out of four I should say three [2734] out of three with websites um have [2736] results so we go to emails you'll see [2739] there's info at Lena tutoria [2741] [Music] [2742] wonderful there's probably going to be a [2744] bunch of Facebook ones no anyway doesn't [2745] look like we got anything from the [2748] Facebook looks like we didn't get any oh [2751] my bad actually we didn't actually get [2752] these emails I'm not entirely sure why [2754] success was true for some of these but [2756] anyway it does look like we got one for [2758] lor.com which is sufficient for me to [2760] think that the system is working [2762] realistically in my experience you [2764] usually get somewhere between like 30 to [2766] 50% of the domains that you pump in [2767] there so we fed in uh four and we got [2770] one just sort of like luck of the draw I [2772] bet if you fed in 100 we'd probably get [2774] 50 or so but okay great why don't we do [2776] the next step to this once we find a [2778] website once we find um an email address [2781] if we have an email address why don't we [2782] now pump this into AI so I'm going to go [2785] GPT [2787] then what I want is create a completion [2788] right over [2792] here this create a completion we'll just [2795] allow us to very quickly and easily um [2797] basically create a system that uses AI [2799] on the back end so you'll have to set up [2801] a connection now I've already set up my [2803] connection under select a method create [2805] a chat completion and under model I'm [2806] just going to use whatever I like GPT 40 [2808] now this is entirely up to your personal [2810] preference you need to play around these [2811] models a little bit to understand the [2812] limitations of each and so on and so [2814] forth under messages my rule of thumb is [2817] always to create a new system message [2818] that says something like you are a [2820] helpful intelligent email assistant I [2823] find that this typically just makes it [2825] perform a tiny bit better and then next [2827] you just give it the actual prompt that [2829] you want this is the system prompt this [2830] is sort of how it identifies from here [2832] on out you actually just say hey AI can [2834] you do the thing that I want in our case [2836] can you customize an email template [2838] based off of information about this [2840] website so obviously we need that prompt [2843] now I've already written that prompt [2844] before so just for the purpose this [2846] video not to make make us watch me write [2848] a big prompt all over again I'm just [2849] going to copy this from my previous [2852] run and let me explain it to you [2857] now uh let's go here paste this in your [2861] task is to customize a provided email [2863] template based on information about a [2864] restaurant here's your template hi I [2866] found you when looking for restaurant [2868] type in location I love thing about your [2871] restaurant we make AI powered order [2873] Management Systems specifically for [2875] restaurant type and I wanted to see if [2876] you we'd be interested in seeing what [2877] that might look like our system [2879] increases restaurant revenues by 10 to [2881] 50% and we just finished raising a $10 [2883] million series B round I'm 100% [2886] confident it's better than we already [2887] have would this be worth a call let me [2889] know and I'll set one up thanks Nick at [2892] the bottom it says return only the email [2893] in plain text so this a pretty good [2896] email it's not the best email it's [2897] pretty reasonable I mean I don't know I [2899] think it's probably like a seven out of [2900] 10 or [2902] so um let's just say checking and out [2906] instead of seeing what that might look [2908] like once we're done with this we just [2910] need to actually provide like the [2912] data so I'm going to go provided [2914] data and then I'm just going to feed in [2917] some stuff so category [2918] name [2921] location [2924] um not getting a description here but [2927] I'll just say description okay so now [2930] we're feeding the description into [2935] AI is there anything else we could feed [2937] in I don't think so that seems pretty [2940] relevant to me IDE like theoretically [2941] you can feed in whatever the hell you [2942] want [2943] right okay great and now what I'm going [2946] to do is I'm going to make [2949] sure that [2952] emails basically has like there are [2955] records inside of it so let me [2959] go array length is greater than zero so [2964] if the emails array is greater than zero [2967] then [2968] continue and just because I already know [2971] what I'm doing here I'm going to go to [2973] email and I'm just going to go create a [2974] draft I'm actually going to create a [2975] draft of the emails that I'm generating [2978] the email I'm sending this to will be [2980] the email that we found [2983] here um sorry I need to change my [2986] connection settings again so let me just [2988] make sure this is with the right account [2990] I have so many accounts because I've [2991] done so many connections so many [2993] different clients and different people [2994] and different projects my own that it's [2996] gotten a little Annoying to keep track [2998] of these days I think realistically what [3000] I should do is I should go back and [3001] delete all of them that aren't uh [3005] relevant so I'll say quick question will [3007] be my subject line the content will just [3008] be whatever the email body is that we [3010] just sent okay [3012] great why don't we do this uh I don't [3015] know I want to I want to que up a couple [3016] so I'm I going to go eight I'm run once [3019] let's see what [3021] happens looks like we are working our [3023] way through it [3030] looks like we got a second email so [3033] we're now queuing up a second [3035] email and what I'm going to do here is [3037] I'm just going to go [3038] back um [3040] to this and I'm just going to see what [3042] sort of email drafts I have set up [3046] here awesome that's what I got for [3049] Tratoria 35 pretty cool hi if anyone [3052] looking for an Italian restaurant in [3053] Bayside New York I love your intimate [3054] atmosphere in the delicious Woodfired [3056] pizzas we make AI powered order [3057] Management Systems specifically for [3059] Italian restaurants I want to see if [3060] you'd be interested in seeing what that [3061] might look like our system increases [3063] Reven our revenues to 10 to 50% we just [3064] finished raising a 10 million series [3066] beer on this must have been from a [3067] previous one [3070] actually now I don't really like how [3072] it's putting the exact address here so I [3074] might have to tweak The Prompt a little [3076] bit maybe instead of um this we do the [3078] neighborhood instead of the actual [3080] address that's probably going to be a [3082] little cleaner right why don't we do [3084] that so I'm just going to go back to my [3086] prompt here and instead of me pumping in [3087] the actual whole [3089] address under location I'm going to [3092] [Music] [3093] return [3095] um we'll go in neighborhood that way [3098] it's I'm looking for restaurants in East [3099] Bronx just to be a little more [3101] conversational uh but yeah that's that's [3103] about that that's system number one good [3104] to go and I don't think we had to spend [3106] more than 15 minutes maybe 10 minutes [3108] really from start to finish to get an [3110] actual like email customization system [3113] you can use to actually talk with real [3114] customers the only thing we have to do [3116] is we have to the data set ID now so [3117] instead of us hardcoding it it's the [3118] actual data set ID brought from the [3120] watch actor runs module so just going to [3122] map that in here and then instead of [3124] that limit I might do like 100 or [3126] something at a time looks good to me [3129] okay so that's system number one let's [3130] make system number two [3132] now where instead of functioning off [3135] restaurant data what we're doing now is [3136] we're going off that indeed data so just [3139] to clarify the system is going to get [3141] the job listing it's then going to read [3143] through the description if it exists [3145] pump that into a AI have ai um tell us [3148] some things about this job and then [3150] we're going to use AI to customize a [3152] resume template that I've pre-prepared [3154] for us so that it is more in tune with [3157] what the job requirements are like as [3159] I'm sure you guys can imagine this [3161] massively adds leverage if you are [3162] looking for a job because instead of you [3164] having to manually customize every [3165] resume this just does it automatically [3167] based on the description which is pretty [3168] sweet a lot of people are doing this [3170] sort of thing right now although they're [3171] just copying and pasting it from chat [3172] gbt back and forth if you have an appify [3174] scraping system just scraping and D jobs [3176] for you as I'm sure you guys can imagine [3178] this is much much more valuable I'm and [3180] much more scalable as well so first [3183] thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go [3183] back to our actors and then this time [3185] I'm going to go to indeed [3187] scraper okay now in terms of the runs [3190] I've actually already ran a couple times [3192] you see this one cost me 8.5 cents got [3194] 70 results [3196] here uh I I only want a few items let's [3199] just do 10 and yeah let's just search [3201] for Automation in the United States um [3204] let's set this up in satam make.com as [3206] well though this is one this is our our [3209] restaurant scenario so let me just copy [3211] this over to a new scenario here and [3213] let's just call this jobl listing CV [3215] customizer or [3217] something job listing or resume [3220] customizer let's do that and then I'm [3223] going to take this and then we're going [3226] do the same thing we did before with [3227] appify so watch actor runs right over [3229] here but we have to create our own like [3232] another hook so this will be um indeed [3235] scraper [3237] I have to add sorry I can actually use [3239] the same connection I don't have to add [3240] new connection here I just have to add [3242] one of the accounts that I was using for [3243] nickj Wells and then here I'm going to [3245] go uh indeed scraper and now this is [3249] going to be watching the run of the [3250] indeed scraper for me right it's pretty [3252] sweet I think we already know what we [3253] need to do we need to get the data set [3255] items from [3256] this so I'm just going to feed in the [3259] data set ID same thing we did last time [3262] and I'm only going to return [3264] 10 and then after this let's just run [3266] this puppy and see what happens so I'm [3268] going to go back over to [3271] Appo we have unsaved changes let's save [3274] them and let's actually start this run [3276] sty is going to be pumping in automation [3279] into indeed and it's going to be doing a [3280] bunch of magic hij Jinks behind the [3282] scenes uh to find listings then it's [3284] going to extract the HTML from the [3286] listings and then from there we're going [3287] to have everything that we need which is [3289] pretty sweet so I'm pretty stoked about [3291] this um I'm just finding that we didn't [3293] actually get anything yet odd this might [3296] be because I didn't provide a specific [3297] location for the search yeah I might [3299] need to provide a location why don't we [3301] do Automation in San Francisco or [3304] something and then why don't we do 100 [3306] items that's probably better sorry Let's [3308] do let's do Seattle I think that's yeah [3311] you might need a location order to make [3312] this work in which case I uh I've taken [3314] it off so just use [3317] whatever um parameters are necessary for [3320] your specific search you may need a [3322] location as I [3323] mentioned looks like it's now starting [3325] the crawler [3327] and it should show [3330] us um results here live while it's doing [3333] the [3334] scraping so let's just see what we got [3336] okay it's crawled two out of 21 Pages 18 [3338] out of 41 Pages cool so it's actually [3340] doing the crawling I don't actually [3342] really want any more results than this [3343] but whatever we'll just wait for it to [3345] finish obviously when it finishes we're [3347] going to be getting the result inside of [3349] make.com so I'm just going to be [3351] watching for that second that's done [3353] we've already hooked it up to the get [3354] data set items module so um because of [3356] this we'll just have access to all the [3358] data that we need we don't need to do [3359] anything else fancy and then from there [3361] we're going to need to find a resumé [3362] template now I've gotten a resume [3364] template looks like this pretty cool if [3367] I do say so myself it's for an [3369] unidentified kangaroo I'm G to go like [3371] Peter [3372] Schmidt we go Peter atgmailcom [3376] maybe we'll do [3378] that and what we want to do is we [3381] basically want to take this resume [3382] template for this guy who looks like [3383] he's done some administrative assistant [3385] work and we just want to customize it to [3387] the jobs that we get [3389] okay damn looks like this puppy's still [3391] running a lot of automation jobs in [3393] Seattle I put 100 results in there so I [3395] think we're going to have to wait until [3396] we get to [3399] 100 unfortunately um because I did 100 [3402] results here we're going to end up [3403] spending nearly 50 cents on this [3407] request so you know this is sort of like [3409] an order of magnitude type thing if this [3412] allows you to apply to even a couple of [3415] jobs better than you would have [3417] otherwise [3419] um oh did I say a thousand or did I say [3421] 100 hopefully I said [3423] 100 well anyway I guess we'll find out [3425] sooner or later um you know I'm sure you [3428] can imagine if you were down in your [3429] luck and looking for a job or something [3431] like that and somebody gave the ability [3432] to spend an additional 50 cents and then [3434] for 50 cents just have all of your [3436] automation all of your resume [3437] customization done automatically you [3439] probably would say yes right this is [3440] basically the sorts of economies of [3442] scale that we're dealing with anyway we [3444] got the actor run completed and as you [3446] see we have ux researchers at Amazon [3449] maintenance mechanic at the state of [3450] Washington Department of Health Oracle [3452] delivery lead at Accenture right Seattle [3455] is a big Tech Hub so we obviously get a [3457] ton of tech jobs the question is what do [3458] we do with all this stuff well um what [3460] I'm really interested in is this [3461] description key you see how this [3463] description key includes a bunch of [3464] information about the job what I want to [3466] do is I want to take this whole [3468] description and I want to use it to [3469] customize a resume template the one that [3471] I was showing you guys earlier so how do [3473] we actually do this well um you see how [3475] this is nicely formatted and there's [3476] like headings and stuff like that this [3478] isn't really going to work for us [3479] unfortunately uh the way that it is cuz [3481] we we can't just generate and using AI [3483] nicely formatted text like this what we [3485] have to do instead is we have to convert [3487] this into markdown which is like a [3490] third uh it's sort of like a like an [3493] intermediate step um which is similar in [3495] nature formatting wise but we can't [3497] embed stuff like font and and stuff like [3499] that like we can here but I'm going to [3501] show you guys how to do it anyway we're [3502] going to take this resume example then [3505] I'm just going to pump this into a I [3506] I'll say convert this to [3510] markdown I'm going to paste excuse [3514] me I'm going to paste this [3519] in and click go and I'm just going to [3522] have this write all this stuff using a [3524] markdown format for me which is just a [3526] format that AI tends to understand [3527] really well you see how it has these [3529] little number signs here this is just [3530] going to allow us to take this data and [3532] use it to create like a Google doc just [3534] like this so that's what I'm going to do [3536] next um I'm going to click on this [3538] module go open Ai and while my other [3541] open Ai call is running I'm going to [3542] create a [3545] completion thank you very much chat GPT [3547] just finished I'm going to copy this and [3551] what I'm going to do is I'm going to go [3551] GPT [3554] 40 and then I'm going to add a similar [3557] message to last time just this time [3558] it'll say you are a helpful intelligent [3561] resume [3563] assistant then underneath here [3567] I'll say resumé [3569] template right over here I'll say your [3572] task is to customize a resumé template [3575] based on information about a [3582] job only return the [3588] resume take information from the [3592] description and use it to cater the [3594] language on the resumé [3596] to said [3601] job don't make anything [3604] up but rewrite sections as needed to [3608] make them more palatable to the hiring [3611] manager we're sending this to only [3614] return the customized resume cool now [3618] let's actually provide the data we'll go [3620] description then I'll stick into the [3623] description and that should be pretty [3625] good yeah I think that is basically [3626] everything we're looking for I guess we [3627] have the company name as well right eh [3630] most of the time that'll probably be [3631] included in the [3636] description [3639] cool um now from this we need to make a [3641] Google [3642] doc so I'm just going to go create a [3646] document I'm going to take the output of [3648] this I'm going to say resumé 4 uh [3652] company so resumé 4 Amazon web services [3655] the content I'm seeing here it needs to [3656] be an HTML some modules are like this [3658] I'm actually going to go in let me [3660] adjust this I'm going to go in and [3662] actually add an additional module in [3663] between these two but I'll show you why [3664] in a [3666] second and then the [3668] content um okay the content is being [3671] output of this uh AI module as markdown [3674] so we need to convert that markdown into [3676] HTML which is just the format that's [3678] used in Google Docs so we have luckily [3681] in make a bunch of modules that allow us [3683] to do this quick conversion you can [3684] basically convert any file type or [3686] formatting into another one uh this is a [3688] simple module called markdown to HTML so [3690] it's just going to take the input as [3692] markdown and then it's going to convert [3694] it into HTML which I can then feed into [3697] the content [3698] field awesome we should have basically [3701] everything that we [3702] need now for testing purposes I'm going [3705] to unlink [3706] this I'm going to grab the default data [3708] set ID and then I'm just going to feed [3711] it in here so we can actually run and [3712] sort of see what this looks like on real [3714] data let's just do two jobs to [3717] start and the only thing we need to make [3719] sure of is that there is a description [3720] so I'll say does the description [3723] exist if the description does exist [3725] proceed with the flow make a Google doc [3727] for us okay looks like on our first job [3731] the description existed that's why we [3732] got this little one [3734] filter looking pretty solid and looks [3737] like we are now ai generating now we're [3740] creating the document and looks like the [3742] description exists in the second one as [3743] well let's actually go in and see what [3744] this looks like [3749] REM resume for Amazon Web Services [3753] Inc you could see that we have now [3755] catered our resume basically entirely to [3758] the job the questions on the job you can [3761] see we even specifically we specified [3763] that we're looking to leverage my strong [3765] organizational communication skills to [3767] contribute to AWS Kumo's Innovative team [3770] environment right it adjusted the job um [3773] details it adjusted basically everything [3776] that we need basically order in order to [3778] make this [3780] happen I am looking here and I'm seeing [3783] that there might be some additional [3784] output from the AI we don't want this so [3787] we could adjust our prompt to make it so [3789] that it doesn't give us any output aside [3791] from the actual rume body itself [3794] obviously if it says this resume does X [3796] Y and [3798] Z ah okay cool this looks pretty good to [3801] me [3803] yeah and now you know instead of uh [3806] previously I talked all about like our [3808] operations experience for Amazon AWS [3811] Kumo now it's all about detail oriented [3813] professionalism with four years of [3814] administrative experience a strong [3815] background and managing task maintaining [3817] systems why because that's exactly what [3818] it asked for in the job [3820] description so hopefully those pretty [3822] cool and I think you guys can see the [3824] value here when we can combine appify to [3827] a third party no code platform drag and [3829] drop a couple modules run and literally [3831] in less than 30 minutes have functioning [3833] systems that can drive a ton of Revenue [3835] I mean you can use the approach that I [3836] just did to help you land 150 to [3838] $200,000 jobs and I think a lot of [3841] people have probably done this it's just [3842] not really being talked about too much [3844] um because uh you know it's being done [3846] intelligently it's being done subtly [3848] you're aren't just copying and pasting [3850] stuff from chat gbt anymore you're [3851] actually building out integrated flows [3853] that allow you to manage your life these [3855] sorts of um more like agent enabled [3858] flows I want to say they're they're only [3859] going to grow more and more popular with [3861] time so the quicker you learn how this [3863] stuff works obviously more powerful your [3865] you're going to be um as we as we go [3869] into you know like this AI enabled [3872] future but it's not all about make.com [3874] what I want to do next is show you how [3875] you can use appify with a variety of [3877] other platforms as well um let me jump [3879] into appify again one second here we'll [3883] jump into the console and let's go over [3886] to Integrations and then what we want to [3888] do is go to I don't know any one of [3890] these let's just go Google Maps [3892] extractor that seemed pretty [3893] good um what you can do [3896] after you're done with this is you know [3897] how like make.com we had our own little [3899] flow here with HTTP requests and web [3901] Hooks and stuff like that well all that [3903] is really doing like all the all the add [3906] connection button that I was clicking [3907] before is really doing under the hood is [3909] just adding a web hook using this modal [3911] diagram it's just sort of like a they [3913] just had like a little snippet of code [3915] setup that just does what I'm about to [3916] show you but you don't actually need to [3918] hook it up to make.com like this is a [3919] make.com URL right what you can actually [3921] do is you can just hook this up to [3922] anything that you want so if you go add [3925] integration you'll see there's actually [3926] a variety of different ones here and [3929] they have some suggested these images [3930] are broken which is why they're not [3931] showing up but you can you don't just [3933] have to do web Hooks and stuff you can [3935] actually send emails so you could send [3936] an email to my email when the actor is [3938] completed that's sweet you could upload [3941] the result file to a Google Drive when [3943] the actor is completed you could create [3944] a new GitHub issue when the actor run [3946] fails you have a variety of these no [3948] code platforms right like make was one [3949] of them zappier is another one if you [3950] want to connect this is zappier you [3951] literally just click this button and [3953] it'll walk you through it you have some [3955] AI stuff with Vector databases and [3956] whatnot you have um an HTTP web hook I'm [3959] just going to do an HTTP web hook just [3961] because that's the simplest and easiest [3962] for us to understand but basically what [3964] we could do is we could set an event and [3966] we could say when the run is created [3968] succeeded fail timed out a board [3969] resurrected created succeeded fail timed [3971] out or aborted sorry the first half is [3973] the run and the second half is the build [3976] um you know you can you can do something [3978] with this and so what I want to do in [3980] this case is I want to send it to a URL [3982] let's just do like web hook. site or [3984] something [3987] or maybe it's called Web hook site [3988] basically this is just a thirdparty tool [3990] that allows you to get a web hook [3992] request and then just view it so I'm [3994] just going to grab this this is My URL [3997] I'm going to paste that in here I'm [3998] going to save and [4000] test and now what this is going to do is [4003] it's just going to wait for a request oh [4005] I think I'm doing a post request [4007] actually hold on a second I know if this [4008] is okay okay yeah it looks like it's [4010] okay and you see that we just sent the [4011] we just sent the the the request over [4014] and I guess appify f so they have a [4016] resource with a joke called Chuck Norris [4018] can watch it episode of 60 minutes and [4020] 22 [4022] seconds oh man man these guys are great [4026] so that's such a dad joke that's exactly [4028] what I would do speaking of which this [4030] whole video has been light on dad jokes [4031] recently what the hell uh definitely not [4034] to form okay but anyway so we actually [4036] want to give this puppy a run so let's [4038] click Start here and let's actually do [4041] this on like a sample of data I [4042] hope I didn't get like a 100 results [4044] anyway whatever [4046] even if we get 100 results it's fine so [4048] uh what we're doing now is we we [4049] basically just created a web hook in web [4051] hook. site same thing as the make web [4053] hook I'm just using this as an example [4054] to show you can connect this with any [4055] service you could pump this into a Zapp [4057] or you could pump this into NAD whatever [4058] the hell you want you can do um and then [4061] now we're just waiting basically for [4063] this run to finish when this run [4064] finishes we're going to receive a little [4066] post request here with a bunch of data [4068] which is pretty sweet so looks like it [4071] just did finish and it looks like it [4072] just sent it to that fourth web hook [4074] which is us [4076] um we're just going to wait for this UI [4077] to [4078] update we need some Jey music wonderful [4082] and here we have the HTTP request pretty [4085] simple right we got tons of data we [4087] actually looks like we got a bunch of [4089] data as [4090] well oh never mind they're just like [4094] advertising to us through the Json man [4095] these guys crack me up yeah so um from [4098] here you know you can connect this to [4099] whatever the hell you want like you [4100] could make your na10 web hook you could [4101] do your zapier web hook you could [4103] connect this to your own server and [4104] Heroku or I don't even know if heroki is [4106] still a thing am I showing my age here [4108] yeah no it's definitely still a thing um [4111] and then you won't just be beholden to [4113] the make.com app ifif flow that I showed [4115] you you could really just pull this data [4116] out and connect it with anything that [4117] you want all right next up I want to [4118] cover how to build custom scrapers in [4121] appify a disclaimer here you don't need [4123] to be a programming professional in [4125] order to make this work uh what I'm [4126] going to show you how to do here is take [4129] maybe two hours worth of JavaScript [4131] knowledge and then combine that with [4132] chat PT to write a script that does [4135] something thing and I'm not saying that [4137] everybody here will be able to do this [4139] obviously there's only so far you can [4140] get with chat GPT and other AI AIDS but [4144] I think you'll see that it's actually a [4145] lot easier to build a custom scraper for [4147] advanced purposes than you guys think as [4149] long as you combine it with some of the [4151] rationale and some of the logic that I [4153] showed you guys in the previous module [4155] on connecting with no code platforms so [4157] why would you want to build your own [4159] custom scraper well there are a couple [4160] reasons the first is you might just have [4162] some Advanced requirement or use case [4164] that isn't covered by the app ify store [4166] the second is that maybe there's some [4168] web components on a website that you [4169] want to interact with for instance maybe [4172] instead of you just scraping a resource [4174] you actually want to do something you [4175] want to click a button you want to [4176] update a field this is venturing into a [4178] slightly different area of um web [4181] Technologies it's not scraping it's [4182] actually browser automation but it's [4184] still something that appify allows you [4185] to do there might be also a bunch of [4188] instances where other scrapers or [4189] prebuilt ones just don't work maybe [4191] there's some very particular Edge case [4193] the website monitors your network [4194] connection activity it takes a look at [4196] your cookies and and you know boots you [4198] off of it if you're not ver verified or [4200] validated and you just need to go a [4202] little bit deeper than otherwise what [4204] we're going to cover next is how to [4206] build a simple scraper that allows you [4207] to do these things using appify IDE IDE [4210] stands for integrated development [4212] environment basically it just means that [4213] instead of you having to download a [4215] bunch of stuff on your own computer and [4216] then muck around with libraries and [4218] development configurations and whatnot [4220] you can actually just do it directly in [4221] the cloud if anybody here has used repet [4223] it's quite similar in nature so all I'm [4225] going to do is put together a simple [4227] example using some very Elementary [4228] JavaScript that just lists website [4230] contents I'm going to use a template [4231] that appify provides you for this [4233] purpose and then do some modifications [4235] and I'm going to have chat gbt help us [4236] build this the idea being that I'll just [4237] show you an accessible way to build [4239] scrapers despite not having too much [4240] programming experience I do recommend [4242] that everybody here at least understand [4243] what Json is Javascript object notation [4246] you know they take a couple of hours of [4247] code academy for JavaScript or node just [4250] makes everything that I talk about and [4251] everything else on the web scraping [4253] World a lot easier but I don't [4254] necessarily want to preclude people that [4256] don't have that from you know being able [4257] to get up and running so without further [4259] Ado let's actually jump right into it [4262] I'm going to head back over to appify [4264] itself you guys remember at the very [4265] beginning of this video I covered [4267] development well this is where you can [4269] actually go and create an actor so [4271] that's what I want to talk about next [4273] let's click on this create actor [4275] button going to see that you have a [4277] bunch of different options of how to [4278] create set actor you could start with a [4281] code template for instance you can also [4282] start completely custom or you can link [4284] a git Repository GitHub is just like a [4286] place where people put um scripts and [4288] then you can also push your code from [4289] the command line all this stuff sort of [4291] just puts the cart before the horse I'm [4292] just going to try and get you guys up [4293] and running as simply as humanly [4294] possible so obviously that's apathy gool [4297] as well you could use JavaScript [4298] typescript or python we're going to be [4299] using JavaScript in this case because [4301] it's just simplest typescript is just a [4303] little bit more involved than JavaScript [4305] they do a bunch of like uh strict typing [4308] and stuff we don't need to concern [4310] ourselves with any of that what we're [4312] going to be doing is we're just going to [4313] go start with JavaScript scrap SC single [4315] page with provided URL with axios which [4318] is a scraping or a web request library [4320] then extract data from Pages HTML with [4323] Cheerio you'll also see that there's [4325] Crawley plus Cheerio these are different [4326] libraries Crawley plus Puppeteer Plus [4328] Chrome this is like uh sort of like the [4329] the grandpa stack or well maybe not [4331] grandpa but the daddy stack where you [4333] can get out there and then actually like [4334] do browser automation clicking buttons [4336] and stuff but I'll leave that for you [4338] guys to check out on your own when you [4340] click the button you'll see there's a [4341] bunch of JavaScript already inside of [4343] the page inside of your integrated [4346] development [4347] environment and you know there's a bunch [4349] more information about what you do how [4351] it works so on and so forth and then [4354] there's even some guides on how to kind [4356] of dive a little bit deeper than I'm [4357] going to dive into um and actually build [4359] out you know more complicated libraries [4362] but the few things there are a few [4363] things for us of note so the first is [4366] that we're importing this Library we're [4368] importing another one called Cheerio and [4371] we're reporting this like appify Library [4373] as well anytime you see an import [4374] statement in javascri script just means [4375] that you're pulling data from from [4377] somewhere else and you bring it in your [4378] flow so uh we're basically importing [4381] these three libraries so just good to [4383] keep in mind we are then initializing [4386] our actor that's what this await actor. [4388] init bracket does we're then defining [4391] the input so input equals get input the [4395] reason for this is because sometimes you [4396] provide the actor input this is just [4398] sort of like a way to handle um the [4401] appify platform where you can actually [4403] just provide your own actor input [4404] through like a structure Ed data field [4406] thing in our case what we're doing is [4407] we're just making uh the input that's [4409] provided will just be a URL a single URL [4412] and then this is really the thing that [4413] matters we are getting the URL it's [4417] going to give us a bunch of page HTML [4419] and then we're just going to convert [4420] that into [4423] um uh data that is parsible using a [4426] parsing Library called Cheerio okay so [4428] if that sounded like French te let's [4430] actually click use this template let me [4431] just show you how this works the [4432] simplest example possible [4435] so this looks pretty solid we now have [4436] the code in our own integrated [4437] development environment it's pretty [4440] sweet I'm going to head over to input [4443] schema and just show you guys what this [4445] looks [4447] like we have um properties URL and then [4452] we have the URL that we're providing so [4454] I'm going to show you guys how to [4455] actually provide a URL to this and give [4457] it a quick example what we do first is [4459] we need to build this actor and once [4461] we're done we're going to go to this [4462] input [4463] tab with building an actor is is it's [4466] basically see how this um server used to [4468] just bumped up to 4 gbt it's basically [4471] running this code in the cloud for [4474] us okay now we're going to go to input [4476] and you see here how there's now just [4477] some Fields where we just put our own [4479] data in well what I want to do is I want [4481] to scrap down own website left click. a [4482] right over here okay seems simple enough [4485] I'm just going to pump this in save [4488] start and let's just see what happens I [4490] think seeing what happens is probably a [4491] better and simpler way for us to scrape [4494] data from the website then kind of [4495] building up the thing ahead of [4499] time okay so the output of this scraper [4501] was pretty straightforward right looks [4503] like it's logging a bunch of stuff [4504] extracted heading level H1 text this [4508] extracted heading H1 text this H1 this [4512] what this is basically doing to simplify [4515] it is it's just going through my website [4517] it's extracting all of the headings and [4518] then it's just listing what the level of [4521] the heading was H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 and then [4524] the text as well [4525] so that's pretty cool we actually [4526] already doing something with the scraper [4528] not bad you see the output here in a [4530] more structured format where we actually [4532] now logged this to a data set right if I [4535] wanted I could go to storage grab this [4536] data set ID and then do a cool [4538] automation with make.com like I just did [4541] um so we're already using custom code [4543] which is sweet anyway the file that we [4545] want to manipulate is this main.js over [4548] here now I don't actually necessarily [4550] just want to do this um maybe instead I [4553] want to do something different you see [4554] here where it says [4556] headings basically what we're [4558] doing if I scroll and zoom in a little [4562] bit hopefully you guys can still see [4563] this uh basically what's happening is [4566] we're doing this H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 um [4570] these are just the various things on the [4571] page that we're cycling through but [4573] there are a variety of things in HTML [4574] that you could cycle through for [4576] instance if I check out the code on this [4579] website this is an H1 right so that's [4582] one thing that we just saw in the app if [4584] I out but but there are other [4585] interesting Snippets of code that I want [4587] to know about for instance how about [4589] this P I like this P tag why don't I add [4592] P tags in there um maybe in addition I [4597] want let's see obviously we're going to [4599] have a ton of P tags maybe we'll have [4601] spans as well so maybe we want to add [4603] some additional tags to this so that it [4605] doesn't just return um you know all of [4607] this maybe in addition we want to return [4609] p and we want to return [4612] span then maybe instead of extracting [4614] extracted element sorry extracted [4616] heading we want to go extracted [4618] element and then let me just see if [4620] there's anything else we'd have to [4624] do maybe instead of headings we just [4627] want elements and then push data we'll [4629] just do elements and then elements that [4631] looks pretty good to me so I'm just [4632] going to save this build it and start it [4634] and now instead of going through a list [4636] of headings it's actually going to go [4637] through just all of the elements that I [4638] listed six of which include headings but [4641] two of which are not actually pings [4642] which is pretty interesting so now we're [4645] running and as you see we're getting way [4647] more elements why well because this [4649] isn't now just returning the um headings [4652] it's also returning all of the paragraph [4653] tags as well now how cool would it be if [4656] we just took all of the text on this [4658] page now all of the things that we've [4659] just returned and then we fed that into [4661] Ai and did something cool with it well I [4663] can actually show you how to do it right [4664] I'm just going to grab this data set ID [4666] and I'm going to go back to [4668] make.com I'm just going to open up a new [4672] sort of flow here create a new scenario [4675] I'm going to go to appify get data set [4677] items I'll just paste in the data set ID [4680] here then I'm going to return this now [4682] we already have the text that we were [4684] looking for before pretty cool huh now [4687] what we're going to do and this is um [4689] just something that's make.com specific [4691] we're going to aggregate all of [4694] this what I want is I just want a bunch [4696] of text [4699] basically and then what I want after [4701] this is I just want to take all this [4703] text and I just want to join the [4705] resultant array with a [4709] space I'm going to run this the output [4713] of this oh sorry actually we have oh my [4715] bad there's a little text parameter we [4718] actually have to map this array and the [4720] value that I'm looking for is text then [4723] we have to join this with a [4726] space now if we run this you'll see that [4729] we now just have all of the text on this [4731] website basically and now let's say we [4733] want to feed this into Ai and just have [4735] ai tell us something about this website [4738] we can pretty [4740] easily let's go gbd [4743] 40 and let's just omit the system prompt [4746] for breev we'll just [4749] say [4751] extract a on line and [4754] paragraph description of this [4757] website return in [4761] Json use one line and Par [4767] paragraph As key names we going go show [4771] put down here response format Json [4772] object parse response then I'm just [4775] going to add all of said text on the [4779] website and let's see what it [4783] returns we've now [4786] essentially just built a simple system [4789] in less than 2 minutes or so that takes [4792] a custom scraper in appify it then [4797] outputs or in our case we converted a [4800] custom scrape where just outputed [4801] headings to one that outputed both span [4804] tags and um P tags as well we then took [4808] all of that data and then just [4810] concatenated it together into one long [4811] string just to get all of the plain text [4813] on the page and then we fed that into AI [4816] to have it extract two things one was a [4818] oneline summary of what this website is [4819] maybe you need this for some database [4821] that you're creating when you're [4822] scraping a big list of websites another [4825] is a paragraph which might be a little [4826] bit more in depth maybe use it for some [4828] report or document that you're creating [4830] later um this took just a few minutes to [4833] put together obviously there was some [4834] annoying string manipulation that I had [4836] to do that most people probably wouldn't [4837] know how to do as quickly um but rest [4839] assured there are multiple ways to [4840] manipulate this and you can definitely [4842] use chat gbt to assist you in the uh [4845] creation process now hypothetically what [4848] I'm going to do is I'm just going to go [4849] back to my [4852] code and then [4855] go to builds here sorry I'm going to go [4858] back to development go to back to my [4860] actor and then what I want to do is go [4862] back to code and now you know I just did [4865] this because of my knowledge of code but [4866] let's hypothetically say I want to [4869] convert this code so instead of just [4871] getting um I don't know maybe instead of [4874] just getting the H1 tags we just get all [4875] the text on the page what I'm going to [4877] do is I'm just going to take this I'm [4879] going to feed this into chat GPT I have [4880] it on a MacBook which is why I can just [4883] click a little hotkey and then spin it [4884] up but you can also just like paste it [4885] into the browser so this code currently [4888] gets all [4890] H1s h6s on the [4892] Page Plus p and span tags but I just [4897] want to get anything with [4899] text or H maybe instead of that uh why [4904] don't we ask it to do something [4906] different this code currently gets all [4908] the H1s h6s on a Page Plus p and span [4911] tags but I just want to get the meta [4915] description of the page instead convert [4918] this code into [4920] one that [4922] pushes that gets the meta [4925] description this might be good for some [4927] SEO [4929] purpose okay I just ran this just going [4932] to drag this over [4938] here and let's see it's currently [4939] writing the code [4948] wonderful [4950] wonderful um and now we have just a way [4952] to very quickly get the meta description [4954] we get the meta with the dollar sign [4957] instead attribute content what I'm going [4959] to do is just copy this [4961] over go back here I'm just going [4964] to paste this [4968] here then we'll just go meta description [4971] sorry meta description [4976] then I'm going to build and start let's [4978] just see how this [4979] goes just going to make sure that there [4981] was no erroneous value here looks pretty [4985] good to me I just copy and pasted some [4987] pretty simple code so I don't [4989] necessarily think there's going to be [4990] any problem um instead we're just going [4992] to push the meta description oh the one [4993] problem might be that it's on Jason [4995] we're just pushing the meta description [4996] as [4997] is yes there might be a problem with [4999] that let's take a [5001] peek yeah it looks like it it was [5003] expecting data to of type object but [5005] receive data of type string that makes [5007] sense uh [5009] okay let's oh actually let me show you [5012] guys what I would do in this case I [5013] would actually just copy all of this and [5015] then I'd go back to chaty [5017] BT and I'd say output needs to be an [5021] object I just got this [5026] error I'd actually paste this whole [5028] thing in and I just have it fix it for [5030] me so it's going through this code now [5033] it's fixing it it and now it's saying [5035] okay paste this in instead so I'm going [5038] to go back to the code and then this [5041] section here the previously erroneous [5043] one I'm just going to repaste [5046] it and then I'm going to run it as an as [5048] an object instead of whatever the hell [5050] it was before which is I guess just a [5052] string so let's see if we could do a [5054] little bit of debugging with [5058] chubbt okay looks like we're still for [5060] whatever [5062] reason um not getting the right data so [5065] I'm just going to pump that in one more [5077] time okay great now we're just going to [5080] give this a little [5083] copy then I'm going to go back [5086] to um the code section up [5090] here then paste this in [5101] okay and then now we're not going to [5102] have a null entry which should work [5107] fine cool and we now wave the extracted [5111] meta description U meta description on a [5112] website is uh if you guys are unfamiliar [5114] it's just like the snippet that you do [5117] that shows up on Google so this is the [5119] meta description on the [5121] website this is the meta description on [5125] GitHub this is the meta description on [5127] YouTube meta description on Crawley so [5128] on and so on and so forth so yeah we've [5131] now just changed our scraper to deal [5133] with meta descriptions instead of just [5135] the headings on the page obviously you [5136] can do whatever the hell you want um my [5139] recommendation to you if you don't know [5140] any code would just be to copy this [5141] whole thing into chat gbt and say hey [5143] currently this is doing this but I [5144] wanted to do this instead could you help [5146] me out if it gives you an output that [5148] works fantastic if he gives you an [5150] output that doesn't work on the first [5152] run don't actually be dis dis [5154] incentivized don't actually just call it [5155] quits just paste the output error back [5158] into chat GPT and just say hey I just [5160] got this error what do you think we [5162] should fix and just do that three or [5164] four times and if you can't finish it by [5166] I don't know your fifth round or [5167] something like that you probably don't [5168] know enough about this to really be [5169] screwing around with it but you'll be [5171] surprised a lot of the time at least at [5173] the current level of Technology you can [5174] totally get away with this without [5176] actually knowing basically anything [5177] about code um then from this you can [5179] bridge that knowledge Gap and build [5181] systems that actually make tons of money [5184] so yeah that's how you build a custom [5185] scraper in appify as you see here you do [5187] all of the actual development operations [5189] the devop stuff just directly [5192] on like on appify itself just in this [5195] little development tab you don't need to [5196] worry about you know mucking around with [5199] um complicated uh scripts or libraries [5202] or anything like that you don't need to [5203] download python onto your computer and [5205] muck around with the 20 different [5206] versions you can instead just do it all [5208] in appify and all the libraries are [5210] supported just cuts a massive learning [5212] curve down which is great [5217] all right now I want to talk a little [5218] bit about scheduling I want to talk [5220] about storage and I also want to talk a [5222] little bit about proxies so let me run [5224] you through some Advanced configuration [5225] and settings in appify just to walk you [5227] through some of the cooler additional [5228] features and these all well schedules [5232] are simple enough that I can cover it [5233] but storage and proxies are such complex [5236] topics that they basically deserve their [5237] whole own videos so depending on how [5239] this video goes I may just record some [5241] follow-up videos specifically on storage [5243] uh and proxies as well but first let's [5245] just cover schedules you saw how back [5248] there um sorry under actors we had that [5251] Google Maps extractor right and it just [5252] ran queries looking for restaurants in [5254] New York USA 100 restaurants searched [5257] every scrape well hypothetically what if [5259] I wanted to run this every week well we [5261] can actually do this really simply in [5263] appify we could say run this every [5269] week oh sorry and then my bad I was [5271] going to add this without any um uh any [5274] scrapers what you do is you select the [5276] time up here it'll tell you what time [5278] and what time zone my case I don't want [5281] that I want us mountain and then down [5284] here under actors your tasks what you [5285] want to do is you want to add an actor [5287] the actor that you want to run is in our [5289] case the Google Maps extractor so [5291] basically you then have the choice to [5293] enter in your own Search terms and so we [5296] could say I want you to repeat the [5297] restaurant search term once a week and [5299] maybe from this you're just like looking [5301] to see whether or not any new [5302] restaurants have been added on gole [5304] Google Maps or something I'm sure you [5305] guys could see there lots of use cases [5307] when you save this then just go save and [5309] enable and now you have a schedule [5310] that's running now the value in [5312] something like this let's just rename [5313] this to weekly restaurant [5317] scraper the value in doing something [5319] like this is you guys remember how [5320] earlier our restaurant cold email system [5323] would watch the actor runs right well [5325] now what we can do is we can actually [5327] just turn this on and basically once a [5329] week whenever this thing runs it'll [5331] actually just go through this whole [5332] sequence create the drafts and and maybe [5333] send them out so maybe um as an [5336] intermediary we had some Google sheet [5337] step where we check to see if any new [5339] entries have been made in this Google [5340] sheet and if the new entries have made [5342] then it continues if not then it doesn't [5344] I'm sure you guys can see but there's [5345] there's a lot of value in doing [5346] scheduling and it's one thing that a lot [5348] of people don't really understand about [5350] abifi which is [5351] unfortunate next up I want to cover [5353] Storage storage is pretty intense as you [5356] see here we have a bunch of data set I [5358] use in the left hand side but I don't [5359] want you guys necessarily to be [5360] discouraged by this um basically every [5363] time that you run an actor or change the [5365] configuration of an actor and give it a [5366] run we create a new data set ID um in in [5370] the storage Tab and so that's why we [5372] have you check out the created dates on [5374] this basically this is I've been testing [5376] this for quite a while today as you can [5378] see so over the course of the last two [5380] and a half hours or so I've created um I [5384] guess 15 unique data sets if you give [5387] any one of these a click you'll actually [5389] be able to go in and see all of the [5391] historical data of that run which is [5393] nice so as you can see see this one is [5394] from our custom scraper has spans H1s PS [5397] H2S so on and so forth if we go back to [5399] maybe this one here you can see this has [5401] a bunch of jobs from our indeed scraper [5403] go back all the way over here you can [5404] see this one has a bunch of restaurants [5406] tutoria 35 the guys that I sent that [5407] draft email to um and you know so on and [5410] so on and so forth the unfortunate thing [5413] here is that if you don't name a data [5414] set it'll be automatically deleted after [5416] 7 days so if you want this not to be [5419] deleted what you have to do is you have [5421] to go up here and then rename it [5426] going say don't delete me please now [5428] that we've done this renaming um this [5430] data will last substantially longer and [5432] we're also if you think about it going [5433] to be build for this because now this is [5435] like in apathy's database essentially I [5438] think uh actually previously it was [5440] being buildt for as well it's just [5441] that's why they delete it once a week [5443] because they don't want you to be buil [5444] for stuff that you're not really using [5446] but it's just a quick and easy way to [5447] like have access to this data for as [5449] long as you want which is nice so you [5451] know if you have any runs that you know [5453] you're going to be doing testing on over [5454] and over and over again then just make [5456] sure to rename that specific record um [5457] and then you know appify W automatically [5459] delete them but otherwise it's actually [5460] super valuable and a very easy way um to [5463] keep track of just all the data that [5464] you've [5465] generated same thing with the key value [5467] stores you see that every time that [5469] we've run this um we basically created a [5472] key Value Store key in this case being [5475] input and then um in this case uh the [5478] value was URL left click. a this is 31 [5481] bytes let's see if we could find [5482] something bigger this one was 10.2 [5484] kiloby so this looks like it was [5487] automatically created when we ran the [5489] Google Maps extractor and the reason why [5490] is because it looks like there were a [5492] bunch [5494] of um in our case like export URLs that [5497] are D duplicated I think these are the [5499] IDS of the specific places in Google [5501] Maps so just the way that Google Maps [5503] stores this data I could be mistaken [5505] they store a bunch of like additional [5506] programming stuff like session pool [5508] state I'm not really sure what this is [5509] to be honest but as you can see there's [5511] a wealth of data hidden in apify that [5513] the buil-in scrapers or Community [5515] scrapers um kind of track for you and [5517] there's a lot that you can do with it so [5519] keep an eye on that and then last but [5521] not least there's a request CU remember [5523] how earlier I said that crawlers tended [5525] to create these cues um where you know [5528] they would scan let's say a website and [5530] then it would look for all of the links [5532] on the website then it would add that to [5533] something and then just go off of that [5535] that Quee basically to find the next [5537] link and the next link well that's [5539] basically what this puppy does um this [5541] is also created automatically by appify [5543] and not all all uh scrapers that you [5546] will use will have a request cue but [5548] just to show you guys a quick example of [5549] one that would if we go to the store [5551] here see it says website content [5555] crawler basically what happens with this [5557] is this will you enter some start URS a [5559] website to crawl and then it will find [5561] all of the additional links on that page [5563] and then crawl those to that's the [5565] difference between a scraper and a [5566] crawler a scraper sort of just does one [5568] page at a time a crawler will actually [5570] crawl around using links to navigate now [5573] this one takes a lot of memory as you [5574] can see we just maxed out at8 and I [5576] imagine that's because it's more [5577] computationally intensive to open God [5578] knows how many new tabs but let's [5580] actually just watch and see what what it [5583] does I'm just going to open up the log [5586] here and it is queuing up links so it [5589] just went through that first link and it [5590] queued up 22 new links on this link what [5594] it's really doing under the hood is it's [5595] finding every single URL here on all [5597] these blue sections and then it is [5600] adding them to that [5601] que and you can see you know that it's [5604] um it's doing said in queing process [5605] here that's that's what crawlers do so [5609] um yeah that's more or less what's [5610] happening underneath the hood when we [5612] run this if I check the request queue [5614] now you'll see that there's just a big [5615] cue of URLs that this is set to access [5619] but there's nothing really special about [5620] a request que request que is still just [5621] like a data set it's just a data set [5623] with specific columns like URL and and [5626] whatnot okay great so the tldr behind [5629] storage obviously being just a place [5630] where you store the data if you don't [5632] want your records to be deleted after [5633] seven days and just make sure to name [5635] them and different actors will use [5637] different types of stores but all sorts [5639] of storages are reasonably similar to [5641] one another um data sets are just like [5644] the common place where data is dumped [5647] after any actor uh well most store [5650] actors are completed um request cues are [5653] specific to crawlers they will create [5655] long cues of different URLs and cue them [5658] and then just go through them one by one [5659] and then key value Stores [5661] um typically store screenshots they [5664] store metadata surrounding the specific [5667] actor run like we saw earlier with that [5669] 10.2 kilobyte thing um with the URL [5671] exports and IDs and whatnot um in [5674] reality you're probably mostly going to [5675] be using data sets and request cues last [5677] thing I wanted to chat about was proxies [5679] proxies are pretty straightforward [5680] they're basically just tunnels that you [5682] route requests through um you do this [5685] because you don't want your actor or [5688] whatever service that you're attempting [5689] to scrape data with to be blocked by the [5691] service that you are getting it from so [5694] like let's say you're attempting to get [5695] a bun of data from Google for instance [5697] well you can only really ping Google so [5698] many times so quickly before they start [5700] being like is this guy a real human [5701] being or is it a robot and generally [5704] speaking Services don't really like [5705] robots so proxy allow you to to just add [5708] an additional layer of subterfuge to [5711] your scraping basically an additional [5712] layer of complexity and instead of your [5714] IP address being the same one that calls [5715] it every time instead of your IP address [5717] just being like the problem IP address [5719] that is now blacklisted on all of these [5720] social media platforms um you can you [5723] can purchas temporary usage from a [5725] rotating network of different IP [5727] addresses that help you escape this so [5730] yeah they have a they have a service [5731] called appify proxy that's divided into [5733] three sections there's data center [5735] residential and then special data center [5737] just means that there are these big [5738] server warehouses with IP addresses that [5741] they are tunneling your requests through [5743] these are typically the cheapest but [5744] they tend not to be the most secure the [5746] most reliable just because so many [5747] servers are now wising up to the data [5750] center proxies and they're saying huh I [5752] recognize that IP address I think 50 [5754] people used that IP address yesterday hm [5756] we should block list it um residential [5758] IPS are sort of like the next level up [5760] they are same IP addresses used by [5762] people like you or me um I don't exactly [5765] know how IDE does this I don't know if [5767] they have some sort of like relationship [5769] with a bunch of locations to like rent [5772] out their IP addresses or or something [5775] like that but resident residential IPS [5777] tend to be a lot more trusted by all of [5780] the major providers that you would want [5782] to scrape from so as a result they also [5784] tend to be a lot more expensive and then [5786] special proxies are just proxies that [5787] are like purpose-built for um handling [5790] requests to specific Services uh like [5793] Google search engine results page [5794] scraper the Google Ser scraper for [5796] instance in apify they they kind of made [5798] their own little IP address that's just [5800] like super fine-tuned and and you know [5803] does exactly what Google wants um in [5805] order to like minimize your rate limit [5807] and give you as high throughput or [5808] request volume as possible so you can [5810] see the usage over here just by clicking [5812] on the type you see I use 22.4 megabytes [5815] today I did so without really knowing [5817] because a lot of appy actors use them U [5820] built in so you can see I accessed app [5822] ay.com 19 times through my data center [5825] proxies I downloaded 14 megabytes I [5828] accessed Clarity dat IMS 11 times um I [5831] accessed intercom.io 24 times probably [5833] because if I just drag this over here [5834] see this little blue thing that's [5835] intercom so basically there's um every [5839] time you load a page so probably the the [5840] crawler that I just ran was doing this [5842] every time I loaded a page with with a [5843] crawler probably like sent a request [5845] over to intercom and I had to pay for it [5847] 175 kiloby not a lot mind you but yeah [5851] you can check out the billing rate on [5853] this by going to billing and going down [5856] to proxy and then there should be some [5859] uh data on this on the subscription yeah [5861] so proxy serps $3 per 1,000 serps for [5865] the search engine results proxies which [5866] I believe is the special proxy that they [5868] talk about it's $10 per gigabyte for the [5870] residential and then I don't know what [5873] the pricing is for the data center maybe [5875] it's not even maybe maybe they don't [5876] even charge you for it anymore I don't [5878] know but you know as you can imagine $10 [5880] per gigabyte can really add up [5883] considering I've already used 22.4 [5884] megabytes and all I was doing was just [5885] some really simple tests you had systems [5887] that were running an actual volume like [5889] maybe 50x what I just did you would have [5891] already spent an additional $10 um just [5893] on the proxy stuff which yeah as I [5895] mentioned can add up so be careful you [5897] can learn more about this proxy stuff if [5899] you want um by going over to this HTTP [5902] setting thing and then sorry I just go [5905] top right hand corner how to use U [5907] basically if you wanted to use a proxy [5908] in your your own appify actor not just [5910] one that's like automatically used uh [5913] you'd have to get this connection string [5915] here with a username a password host [5917] name and a port appify will actually [5919] automatically provide you the host name [5920] the port and the username um the [5922] password is sort of like your API key to [5924] do the proxy request and you just have [5926] to add that to your actor when you make [5928] a request to a specific resource [5930] basically you need to you need to Tunnel [5931] the request through this the [5934] you know you doing this is is beyond the [5935] scope of this video because it's very [5936] much more programming but feel free to [5938] just jump in into ay docs it's one of [5940] the reasons why they're so great which [5941] I'll cover in a minute um and they [5943] they'll run you through how to do it you [5944] just need to add them to like your [5945] environment variables in the actor that [5947] you set up so yeah that's that on the [5950] scraping sorry on the scheduling storage [5953] and proxy side of things um why don't we [5955] cover one more thing which is using [5958] appify as a business model now I've [5960] talked a lot about how to use the [5962] outputs of appify a business model like [5964] in the restaurant scraper cold email [5967] system and then the indeed Jo listing [5969] resume customization system which you [5971] know took me 30 minutes to set up there [5972] are many many cooler systems that you [5974] can do if you spend a little bit of time [5975] thinking about it but I want to I want [5977] to show you guys like a new business [5979] model um and it's basically a way where [5981] instead of you you know providing [5982] services for people or whatever appify [5984] actually allows you to make money using [5985] their platform by putting together your [5987] own scrapers and then just charging [5989] people per usage just like the scrapers [5991] that I was using a moment ago [5994] um as examples so you know logically if [5996] there's an ampify store some people are [5998] going to be making money on it right you [6000] can absolutely put your own actors into [6002] the store and charge for it and people [6004] are making a lot of money with us and [6005] I'm going to find you some examples [6006] right now so let's just jump over to the [6009] app IFI store let's actually just get a [6011] feel for how much money people are [6012] making with this [6013]  uh I'm just going to go view all [6016] and then pricing models like there are a [6018] couple different ones why don't I just [6019] do rental for now rental is the simplest [6020] one to extrapolate cost let's just do [6022] one that's not from appify let's do [6025] traffic [6027] generator okay so you see this one is 20 [6029] bucks a month right well this one has [6031] 4,600 monthly users so just do the math [6034] on that this is making 92 Grand a month [6037] this one scraper right here this is a [6040] pretty involved scraper not going to lie [6042] and it's maintained by this company epct [6044] TX but you can kind of like think about [6045] it like what this is is this is a [6047] distribution mechanism by which you can [6048] make a really cool scraper that scrapes [6051] some data source and delivers it in nice [6053] format for people and then appify will [6057] allow you to build $20 a month times [6059] 4,600 users for that now not all this [6063] money is going to you appify takes a fee [6065] and um I think appify store [6070] fees I believe there's some cut or [6077] something how much does apify take [6084] oh gez I don't [6090] entirely remember exactly how much money [6092] this [6094] was how to monetize an actor oh monetize [6097] your code okay there we [6099] go uh [6103] so yeah it looks like there's cost [6107] around uh there used to be a flat [6109] percentage ah okay okay s there is a [6111] flat percentage still it's 20% so 80% of [6114] the total goes to you and then 20% of [6116] the total goes to appify so of the [6118] $92,000 that that guy's making um [6121] they're making 73,800 it's pretty sweet [6123] right so you can obviously make a lot [6125] more money than just this I mean just [6127] run through and find the same one that I [6129] was showing you guys a moment [6132] ago uh boy there are a lot of these [6134] we'll go back to the [6137] store and yeah so that one was 92,000 [6140] bucks um why don't we go back to pricing [6142] models check got some other rental ones [6144] you can see that appify as well charges [6145] you for stuff like Facebook post scraper [6147] there's 1.4k monthly users 35 bucks a [6149] month they take 100% of it but I'm just [6151] interested in like non appify ones so [6153] maintained by Community there we go gu [6155] this LinkedIn job scraper $29.99 so it's [6157] say 30 bucks a month and you how many [6158] people are using at 64 that's still [6160] making [6161] you uh [6163] $188,000 so even with appify cuts Bey is [6167] printing I just type in Bey let's check [6170] this out they're all rentals here [6173] so let's just add up the total amount of [6174] money that these graders are making 15 * [6177] 4 so 60 bucks off that 18,000 bucks off [6181] that's just say 18 [6183] Grand uh let's say 19 Grand now 30 times [6186] this is another 15,000 so [6189] 34,000 this is 25 * 80 2,000 36,000 this [6194] is 15 * 3,000 45 so 39 plus did I say 39 [6200] I think I said 39 anyway 39 Plus 45 is [6204] what [6205] 74 no 84 I think is that [6209] 84,000 these guys are making basically [6212] zero that's basically zero so Bey this [6214] one company is making $889,000 a month [6216] with this so anyway I'm not I mean I'm [6218] obviously interested in this I was [6219] interested in this as a business model [6221] myself I'm not telling you you have to [6222] go and do this but I just wanted to run [6223] you guys through what it looks like if [6224] you if you wanted to you know try and [6226] monetize this um you can make a ton of [6228] money a lot of people have whole [6229] businesses that are built off of appify [6232] at this point which is pretty sweet um [6234] so [6236] yeah so anyway there are a variety of [6238] ways that you could share this actor oh [6240] my bad you want to go over here to [6241] publication on the right hand side here [6244] um they'll rate your actor based off of [6247] kind of whether or not you have all the [6248] fields filled out you got have like the [6249] title filled out ideally you should have [6250] like a profile pick and stuff they're [6252] just trying to help you um you need to [6254] have a public account so you need to [6255] like add a bunch of information here [6257] underneath uh your profile with like [6259] your name and your bio and stuff like [6261] that and then once you have moneti once [6263] you have your billing details and [6264] payment method set you can set up a [6266] monetization and then basically um you [6268] can tell people how much money they need [6270] to spend in order to do this like are [6271] you going to have people pay you on a [6273] monthly basis are you going to have [6274] people pay you on a per unit basis like [6275] we saw before are you going to have [6277] people pay you on a platform usage basis [6279] there are a variety of different um you [6281] know monetization mechanisms um like the [6284] Google Maps scrapers and the indeed [6285] scrapers they all did this on a paper [6287] results right but there were a bunch [6289] that were also rental based so you kind [6290] of just need to figure out what works [6291] for you cost-wise [6293] um yeah you can either pay per usage you [6295] can either do rentals or you can do that [6297] uh pay per result thing nowadays I would [6299] say just anecdotally based off my [6301] experience using this a lot of people [6302] like paper results just because it's a [6304] lot more linearly scaling like in their [6306] heads they'll be like okay I'm scraping [6307] 10,000 leads today 10,000 leads means [6310] that I'm going to spend I don't know $20 [6312] scraping it from uh indeed or maybe [6314] Google Maps and then I'm going to have [6316] to spend another $15 doing some [6318] enrichment and then I'm going to have to [6319] spend $15 in the email platform and in [6321] that way like the costs are easy for [6323] them to calculate you can probably also [6324] as a developer get away with charging a [6326] little bit more money relative to a [6328] monthly rental pricing model but you [6330] know pricing sort of like beyond the [6332] purposes this um then you're going to [6334] have like a sample input and a sample [6336] output and the second that all that's [6338] done you have your monetization you can [6339] just publish this to the [6340] store and your actor will literally be [6343] seen just like just like all of these I [6345] mean you know yours is probably not [6347] going to be seen here under the most [6349] relevant tab yours will probably be seen [6350] under here as the newest tab CU you'll [6352] have like one user but yeah you can very [6355] quickly and easily monetize this stuff [6357] and by the way also if you want [6358] something really funny just head over to [6359] appify newest and then just scroll [6361] through them some of these are really [6362] really funny um you know like there's [6365] like joke generators Ron Swanson quotes [6367] scraper generator API there's there's a [6369] bunch of really cool here uh to be [6371] honest so I'm a big fan of their [6372] ecosystem I think appy is doing pretty [6374] great awesome so um that's yeah that's [6377] apify is a business model um next [6380] question and probably the most logical [6382] last question to have is K Nick I love [6384] everything you told me about so far [6385] You're great and I should definitely [6386] like And [6387] subscribe but uh where do I go for more [6390] where do you go for more um appify gives [6393] you literally everything you need within [6394] the platform and no they're not paying [6396] me to say this but they give you [6397] literally everything you need within the [6398] said platform in order to go out there [6400] and crush it my main reason why I love [6403] apify so much is just because of how [6405] incredibly well documented everything is [6408] like it is beyond well documented it's [6410] amazingly documented I cannot stop [6412] speaking Praises about the the level and [6415] the quality of the documentation of this [6416] company it's insane I'll show you two [6419] things the first will be a web scraping [6421] guide from Zero to Hero and then the [6423] next is going to be um just like a [6425] general walkthr um that gets you started [6428] with uh like basically everything you [6430] need to know but appify versus like a [6431] specific web scraping one so if you just [6433] go like appify Docs Google it you'll see [6437] that they have some great documentation [6439] over here but we're really curious about [6443] is web scraping Academy they give you [6445] free practical courses on web scraping [6447] and browser Automation and these courses [6449] are fantastic now what you want is if [6452] you're a total beginner you don't want [6453] any of the advanced web scraping ones [6454] down here what you want is this web [6456] scraping for beginners course top to [6458] bottom which will teach you how to do [6460] everything you need in order to build a [6462] custom scraper just like I did a second [6464] ago with minimal coding knowledge you're [6466] going to learn all of the principles [6467] behind scraping protections um [6469] JavaScript versus typescript some web [6472] scrap ing for python versus node you're [6475] going to learn a couple of the number [6476] one libraries Puppeteer and playright [6477] you're going to learn how to like click [6479] buttons on pages and do cool with [6480] them for browser automation basically if [6482] you just make it from start to finish to [6484] the end of this like web scraping for [6485] beginner guide you will know more about [6487] web scraping than like 99% of web [6489] scrapers and that's for beginners these [6492] guys are crazy if you wanted to monetize [6494] appify and actually get out there and [6495] start making money with the platform as [6497] well this is one of the simplest and [6498] straightest line paths to do so because [6499] they will literally show you what you [6501] need to do in order to make money on [6502] their plat platform why do they do this [6504] because they want you to win because [6505] when you win they win because they get [6507] paid after you're done with that check [6508] out the appify platform guide which [6511] walks you through everything you need to [6512] know essentially about like now you know [6514] how to do web scraping well how do you [6516] actually interact with apify how do you [6517] actually interact with like what what [6519] what is inputs what are uh tasks and [6521] runs and how do you query them via you [6523] know programming and code from there you [6526] can learn how to do like some API [6528] scraping including I believe hidden API [6530] scraping although I don't know because I [6532] don't I made it to the end of this um [6534] you can learn all about anti-scraping [6536] protections so you know we were just [6538] talking about different types of proxies [6539] a moment ago we can also learn about [6541] entirely different things like [6543] fingerprinting for instance and a [6544] variety of ways to overcome it um adding [6547] headers and authorization Snippets to [6550] various parts of the request that you [6551] send over and then down here you also [6554] have an expert scraping part so you need [6556] to basically be like a programmer in [6558] order to fully understand all the stuff [6560] but if you get to the point where you [6561] can fully understand this stuff stuff [6563] then not only will you be the top 99% or [6565] the top 1% of web scrapers you'll be the [6566] top 1% of the 1% you'll basically be [6569] like one of the most dangerous people on [6570] planet Earth to be honest so yeah highly [6573] recommend you guys check out appify [6574] documentation I'll make sure to link [6576] them all down below um as I mentioned [6578] like they they're really they're not [6580] paying me to say all this stuff believe [6581] me uh I just really really like [6583] companies with good documentation and [6585] appify has by far the best documentation [6587] that takes us to the end of the tutorial [6589] if you have any questions about anything [6590] that I mentioned feel free to drop them [6592] down below I hope you guys now see just [6593] how easy and simple it is to use a [6595] service like appify to go and get real [6598] actionable data from websites that for [6601] the most part people thought were never [6602] scrapable um we built a couple of high [6605] Roi simple flows that enable us to [6607] automate things like applying to jobs [6609] and sending cold emails to restaurants [6612] you could take these same ideas and you [6613] could apply them to any sort of data on [6616] any sort of platform to do basically [6619] anything really appreciate your time I'd [6621] love it if you guys did me a solid and [6623] liked subscribed and commented on my [6626] videos for engagement purposes I take [6628] most of my requests from viewers at this [6630] point so if you have anything in [6631] particular that you want me to talk [6632] about maybe something I didn't talk [6633] about related to appify or just web [6634] scraping more generally just leave a [6636] comment down below and I'll add it to my [6637] queue and yeah I will see youall in the [6640] next one thanks for your time cheers

Title: How to Earn $10,000/Month As a Solo Freelancer (No Agency)
[0] hey I'm Nick I made over $30,000 a month [2] last year as a solo freelancer and in [4] this video I want to peel back the [5] curtain show you guys how I did so give [7] you guys a practical road map to get [8] there yourselves and then also make a [10] case for why I think for the vast [11] majority of people that are watching [13] this video it actually makes more sense [14] to become a solo freelancer than it [16] necessarily does to start an agency but [18] I'm going to cover all that in a minute [19] so if you follow all of the steps that I [21] lay out in this video if you learn all [23] the concepts it's virtually impossible [25] not to hit $110,000 a month or more if [27] this is something you guys want to do [28] then stay tuned and let's get into it [30] all right so just before I get into the [31] nitty-gritty a quick disclaimer this is [33] just one way that I scaled my own [35] freelance practice to $30,000 a month [37] with nobody else in my business it's not [39] the only way so um if I were you you [41] know a lot of people on the internet [42] make claims like this is the only way to [44] do it you have to do it my way if you [45] don't you're not going to succeed just [47] be a little Discerning here in reality [48] there are multiple ways to achieve [50] success this probably makes more sense [51] for me just given my my background and [52] my experience and stuff like that but I [54] know that there's still a lot of value [55] sharing this with people so to any [57] Discerning viewers just take whatever [58] makes sense to you and then leave the [60] rest so I have a qualifier here I say [63] how to earn 10K a month solo without an [65] agency and the reason I do so is because [67] what I'm found um are that everybody on [69] the internet wants to run an agency but [70] very few people know what actually goes [72] into said agency so uh to be clear the [75] benefits of running an agency the [76] benefits of starting one as a business [79] is that they have basically no Capital [81] cost or very low Capital cost uh there's [83] there's very little barrier to entry [85] super easy to like whip up an agency um [87] and then you can make a large amount of [89] Revenue very quick quickly notice how I [90] said Revenue there I didn't say profit [93] so people like to think that an agency [95] is just like The Logical first step for [96] them and I'm kind of guilty of [97] perpetuating this notion um for search [99] engine purposes like every second video [101] of mine says agency AI agency automation [104] agency but in reality in this video I'm [106] going to show you why you don't actually [107] need to do any of that you can actually [108] just do solo leveraged freelancing and [110] you can make a similar amount of monthly [111] profit to a big agency with 10 or 15 [113] people just as a solo operator and you [116] can do so with less time less energy and [119] much much l risk because you don't have [120] people depending on you you only have [122] technology and the current state of [124] technology is such that you could you [125] know build systems um that produce [127] leverage like I'm going to talk about [129] and and and show you guys some of uh and [131] in reality you can achieve more than [132] $10,000 a month with just a few hours of [135] dedicated work per day so if that all [136] sounds Fantastical to you um it's it's [139] not uh myself and many other people make [141] much more the money than this online uh [144] with just a few hours of dedicated work [145] per day the whole myth that you have to [146] work 16 hours a day and bleed for your [149] businesses definitely like a deprecated [151] one one of the past um what I'm going to [153] do in order to help you guys get to that [155] point yourselves is impart a few simple [158] Concepts in this video particular we're [160] going to be talking about three the [161] first is called displacement the second [163] is called Leverage and the third is [165] called feedback loops and let me just [167] see if I could draw on this yeah I [169] can Okay so let's actually jump into [172] what I mean by [174] this I have a little picture of money [176] here and you're probably like why is [177] there a picture of money well the reason [179] why is I just don't want want us to [180] forget what we're doing all of this for [182] in the first place the reality is if you [183] start an agency or if you want to start [184] an agency you're probably not trying to [187] ship people to Mars or something you're [188] just trying to build a better lifestyle [190] for yourself and so the only real thing [192] that matters to that end is is your [194] ability to earn money and your ability [195] to earn money quickly and money in [198] business terms sort of has two [199] components has the revenue component [201] which is the top line then it has the [203] profit component which is how much is [204] sort of leftover after all expenses so [206] in reality leverage freelancing um [208] allows you to earn sub substantially [210] more profit per dollar of Revenue [212] because your margins tend to be a lot [214] higher and you tend to be able to keep a [215] lot more of the money that you make so [217] an agency hypothetically might make [220] $100,000 a month or something but you [222] know their their profits in the end of [223] the month might only be $220,000 or [225] $15,000 or something whereas you as a [227] leverage freelancer you might make [228] $15,000 a month and then your profits um [231] would be like $14,000 a month from that [233] so you can basically achieve the same [235] sort of outcome which we all want which [237] is money you can just do so at sub [239] stantially lower Revenue multiples and [241] you can um you know uh also structure [244] your life in such a way that you're not [245] constantly working you have better work [246] life balance and so on and so forth let [249] me be very clear about why you should Jo [251] you should join um or you should start [253] some sort of leveraged freelance [255] operation uh the main benefits here are [257] you don't really have to sacrifice work [259] life balance you get similar levels of [261] Financial Freedom as an agency with the [262] typical lack of work life balance that [264] comes with it this lack of work life [266] balance this tends to happen because you [268] start hiring a lot of people you start [269] bring other people onto your team and so [271] you stop just being responsible for [272] yourself and for your clients you start [273] being responsible for a bunch of [274] internal team members as well you need [276] to take care of work that you weren't [278] necessarily expecting to and somebody [279] has like a a PTO or maybe like an [282] unexpected leave you start having to [283] just like deal with a lot of [285] that quite frankly does not contribute [286] to revenue so on that note you also have [288] no wasted time if you do this yourself [290] anytime spent communicating a project [293] communicating about a project is time [294] not spent doing the project and that's [296] something that not a lot of people [297] understand until they get into a [298] corporate environment um you would be [301] surprised at how much of the total [302] effort in a project has just spent [304] talking about a project not actually [305] doing the project I think the bigger a [308] company gets generally speaking it's [310] like a rule where like as a solo [311] freelancer you spend 100% of your time [314] like doing the project right you spend [315] very little time just talking about the [316] project unless you're like me and you [318] just talk to yourself in front of a [319] camera sometimes um if you invite [322] somebody into your business well now [323] because they don't know everything that [325] you know there's a little bit of this [326] communication cost that comes in maybe [328] you spend 80% of your time working on [329] the project but 20% of the time talking [331] about it when you invite three people [333] into your business now maybe do 60% five [335] people it's like 50% that number just [337] keeps on going down when you do leverage [339] freelancing when you do it solo um 100% [341] of the time you [343] spend that is the shittiest line I've [345] ever seen 100% of the time that is too [347] I'm going to need to figure this out [349] 100% of the time you spend just goes [350] towards the work I guess is what I'm [352] trying to say so that's really important [354] um you don't have to manage staff I [356] freaking hate managing staff I think I'm [358] good at it but it's a lot of work man [359] man there's a lot that goes into [360] managing staff and you can really screw [362] it up um there's training there's [364] onboarding there's dealing with sick [365] days poor performance there's a lot of [367] legal requirements especially if you [368] want to go about hiring [369] employees um you know getting rid of all [372] of the staff like Terminator T2 style [375] like reduces risk you don't you don't [378] have any of that stuff Weighing on your [380] shoulders anymore um you can just do [382] what you want um and that takes me to [384] the next point which is that you're much [385] faster instead of having an idea like [388] most people do in companies and they [390] have an idea at some like top level and [392] then as a manager their their their task [394] is they have to like get everybody on [395] board with their idea or their vision [397] and then convince them of it and then [399] and only then do you start like [400] delegating and collaborating and making [402] the idea happen as a leverage freelancer [404] you don't have to do any of that you [405] just have the idea and then you just do [407] it and it's just so much faster the the [409] gap between you and then the [411] implementation of the idea is basically [413] zero um a good example of this is I [415] wanted to get myself on a bunch of [417] podcasts and I was curious to see [419] whether I could just reach out to people [420] and say hey how's it going I run a [421] YouTube channel has 35,000 subs and I [423] just want to see if you were interested [425] in hosting me in your podcast so uh it [427] took me something like an hour to whip [429] up a campaign that started getting uh [431] you know maybe a dozen or more positive [433] responses from various podcasters and [434] hosts and so on and so forth if I were [436] in a bigger agency you can imagine how [438] that process might have been very [439] different like somebody would have had [441] an idea they would have distributed that [443] idea to their team their team would have [444] had to get on board with the idea [446] understand the purpose of the idea [447] understand the vision they would have [448] had to you know uh create a strategy [450] around that you would have had to give [452] it to a copywriter who would have had to [453] check with me to make sure the copy [455] looks good I don't have to do any of [456] that I just got to do it on myself [457] obviously you know that comes with the [460] uh qualifier that like you have to be [462] good you have to be able to write all [464] the stuff yourself and do all this stuff [465] yourself but I find in practice the gap [468] between you and the level of skill you [470] think you need to do something well uh [473] that that gaps a lot smaller than you [474] think and if you just do leverage [475] freelancing you tend to learn these [477] things pretty quick okay another more [479] High level thing is Personnel [480] constraints make your business lean so [482] have you ever heard of the phrase um we [484] should throw more people at this problem [486] well most companies operate like this in [487] a leverage freelancer's case we have [489] very limited Personnel Resources just [491] you and so because of that you are [493] basically forced to structure your [494] business super lean from the get-go you [497] you are forced not to take on more than [499] you can do you're forced to be smart [500] about the way you approach systems and [502] businesses and and and clients and I'm [504] going to make the case later in this [505] video why that constraint is actually a [507] very very good thing it's great to have [510] an artificial constraint put in front of [511] you especially at the beginning because [513] it forces you to build your business [514] lean from the GetGo build your business [516] efficient from the GetGo if in the [517] future you decide to hire and build an [519] agency anyway well no freaking problem [521] you've already built uh an agency three [523] or four or five times efficient because [524] it's just you when you bring people on [526] you know now you have systems and stuff [527] like that that multiply your leverage uh [529] and then the last one is obviously [530] higher margins and it's all yours the [532] majority of S&B agencies small to [534] midsize businesses they make about 30 to [535] 40% margins that's sort of like a [537] generous estimate a lot of them make 15 [539] to 20% on $30,000 Mr that means they [542] might take home [543] $10,000 as a leverage freelancer your [545] profits are usually closer to about 90% [547] which means you can make the same profit [548] at literally a third of the size without [550] all the annoyances listed above the tldr [553] is more freedom uh more money more joy [556] okay anyway so I think I've I've gotten [558] my case out of the way I'm no longer [559] going to talk about why you should do [561] agencies as opposed to well I am going [562] to talk a little bit about that but uh [565] from now on we're going to get into some [566] Core Concepts and I'm also going to [567] cover like the implementation of how [569] actually take an idea to do this [571] leverage freelancing thing and then [572] actually how to go out and make it a [573] reality I'll show you guys how I did it [575] I'll show you guys how a bunch of other [576] people do it and um yeah I'm looking [579] forward to diving into this because I [580] think this is the first time somebody's [581] really talked about these Concepts in [583] the context of business so I have three [586] concepts that I want to cover with you [587] guys the first is an idea called [590] distance versus displacement this is an [592] a doge like a hand-me-down from physics [594] class if you guys remember back in I [596] don't know secondary school or maybe [598] College um people talk a lot about [600] distance versus displacement and and the [602] reason why is because the two are [603] different looking at this graph here we [605] have a point a and then we have another [606] point [607] B the the distance is the total amount [613] of well I guess I can't recursively [616] Define this distance as the total amount [617] of distance traveled it's the total [619] amount traveled before you get to the [622] point you want to get to and in this [624] graph as you see we have these dotted [626] lines that go up and we're traversing [628] quite a lot of distance to get to this [630] point B displacement on the other hand [632] is just the straightest line path from A [635] to B so you can walk a really long [639] distance but if your distance isn't in [642] exactly the right direction that [644] doesn't matter it doesn't matter if [645] you're jumping all over the place right [648] doesn't matter how far you walk you [649] could walk 7 million miles north okay [653] hypothetically and that wouldn't matter [655] at all the only thing that matters is [658] your ability to make it [660] this is actually kind of fancy uh make [661] it to that to that point B so agencies [665] will typically cross a lot of distance [666] they'll spend a lot of energy moving but [668] a lot of that movement at the end of the [669] day is wasted it doesn't take them any [670] close to their target when you're a [672] leverage freelancer you you have a very [674] straight line path from a Tob you [676] basically accomplish the same [677] displacement you just get to do so in [679] about half the distance so um a lot of [681] the time you know because it's just you [682] and the organization it's not like 10 [683] other people pulling at you uh you you [685] just get to go the way that you want to [687] go so this isn't just a con cept for [689] agencies and and freelancing it's a [691] concept that we're going to we're going [692] to talk about basically in this video in [694] every video forward and that allows you [695] to achieve more in half the time more [699] and half the work more and half the [700] distance so I want you guys just to keep [702] that in mind it's a mental model um that [704] I use all the time it's what I use to [705] get to $30,000 a month it's just how I I [707] see a lot of problems the second concept [710] I want to chat about is one called [711] Leverage now again this is a [713] hand-me-down from physics you'll see me [714] do a lot of this but uh all levers are [718] that's where the term Leverage comes [719] from levers they're just machines simple [721] machines that multiply force they make [723] it easier to do things like lift a load [725] for example so to use leverage means you [728] just do the same thing with less or you [731] do more with the same if you see over [734] here I have this little little diagram [736] of um basically like a fulcrum and then [738] a little lever and it was one of the [740] simplest levers possible um you know [742] anybody that's gone to some high school [744] physics class will probably understand [745] this intuitively but this load is really [748] close to this fulcrum you see how it's [749] like it say 2 m here and then over here [751] on the right hand side um this the [753] length of this thing is 6 M well there's [755] a physical law where when you push one [758] end of a lever and that lever rests upon [760] a fulcrum like this the distance between [763] that the tip of that fulcrum and then [764] where you put down the effort basically [767] multiplies the amount of force that [768] you're able to generate you see how this [770] load is 2 meters away whereas we're [772] putting the effort 6 meters away we're [774] basically generating three times the [776] effort with the force that we're putting [778] so in order to this load which might be [780] 1,000 lb we only need to put 333 lbs of [783] effort down here you don't actually have [786] to fully understand that the physics [787] behind it that part isn't relevant all I [788] want to do is just give you guys a [790] simple example because I think we we all [792] understand intuitively how this works if [793] you go further and then you push it'll [795] be a lot easier than if you go really [796] really closely and all uh we're going to [798] be doing is we're going to be finding [800] very high leverage actions we're going [802] to be finding the spot on this lever [805] that we just push a little bit that [806] produces a massive result Eric aredes [810] said give me a lever long enough and a [811] Fullmer which to place it and I shall [813] move the world I think this is sort of a [814] a dramatization of the reality but yeah [817] you know logically speaking if your [818] lever is long enough and the stick does [820] not break you could lift a black hole [822] for all I care um so that's core concept [826] number two I just want you guys to keep [827] that in mind as we talk about what I'm [829] going to talk about core concept number [831] three is um the difference between tight [833] and loose feedback loops so if you put [836] your hand on a hot stove what are you [838] going to do obviously you're going to [839] pull it away really quickly right the [841] reason why is because you have a tight [843] feedback loop you are very closely in [845] tune with your body and the consequences [847] of the actions of that body what you [849] find in practice is that not all [851] feedback loops are this tight imagine if [853] instead you put your hand on the stove [855] and then it took your brain 15 seconds [857] to register that your hand was burning [860] your hand would probably look a lot [862] different at the end of that 15 seconds [864] right so when you have tight feedback [867] loops you're able to iterate very [868] quickly and that's what we get to do as [870] leverage Freelancers but it's also [871] something that I I just want us to keep [872] in mind moving forward if you're in a [874] big agency and there's tons of people [876] and there's reporting structures and you [878] don't actually see the things that you [880] do play out in the real world when you [882] have that distance you tend to burn your [884] hand a lot more and you know it's not [887] even that you burn your hand more often [888] is that when you do burn your hand it [889] tends to be a lot worse so that's um [892] those are the three concepts that I [894] wanted to cover just to remind you guys [896] we had distance versus displacement at [898] the beginning which which is where you [899] can travel a much longer distance to get [901] to the same point so it's always good to [903] try and travel as little distance as [905] possible we had leverage which is where [908] you can multiply your Force by pushing [910] as far up that lever as possible and [912] then we had tight versus loose feedback [915] loops where if you want to make good [916] decisions and if you want to be smart [918] about how quickly you respond to [920] decisions typically you want to minimize [921] the distance between you and the [923] consequences of your decisions you want [924] to keep those feedback loops really [926] tight all right sweet enough with the [928] philosophy how do you actually earn [929] $10,000 a month solo um now that we know [932] these three concepts now that we can [933] keep these in mind while we operate well [936] it's pretty straightforward and you know [939] I talk a lot about automation agencies [941] in my material and in my programs and on [943] my YouTube channel um but what I've come [945] to realize in Consulting with people [946] recently is that you can do the exact [948] same approach I show people how to do [950] for automation agencies but you can do [952] them in whatever industry you want [953] essentially I've helped copywriters hit [955] $10,000 a month I've helped um I don't [958] know program software Freelancers I've [960] helped uh I've helped some accountants [962] hit $10,000 a month uh I've helped video [965] editors hit $110,000 a month the core [967] process is almost always the exact same [970] the only thing that differs is Step [973] number one which is a high income skill [975] so four key steps to this number one is [977] we're going to get a high income skill [978] which I'll talk about step two is we're [980] going to productize that high income [982] skill step three is we're going to do [984] daily lead generation I'll talk about [985] how to do that and then step four is [986] we're going to do optimization and [988] client retention I'll talk about that as [989] well um this works for anyone regardless [991] of where you're starting out it works [992] for any skill level it works for any [994] area of expertise uh you can treat this [996] like a curriculum if you need to keep [997] track uh you can you know get a [999] whiteboard on your on your beside your [1000] bed every morning when you wake up and [1002] just do the daily leg generation task [1003] that I'm going to talk about however you [1004] want to structure this is fine but these [1006] four steps along with these three [1008] concepts this is all that you really [1010] need to know to hit $10,000 a month um [1012] capitalism at the end of the day is just [1014] a game it's literally just a game that [1016] you were signed up to without your [1018] choice or consent and so because you are [1020] thrust in this game uh you might as well [1023] learn the rules of the game you might as [1024] well learn some strategies that you can [1026] just repeat effectively in order to get [1028] what you want to get and that's that's [1030] the case that I've made here okay so [1032] let's talk about that high income skill [1033] first and foremost what is a high income [1035] skill well I like to simplify this I've [1037] a lot of people ask me um the simplest [1039] way to explain this is a high- income [1041] skill is an ability that either [1044] generates money or it saves money for a [1047] client by doing this you make yourself [1050] highly indispensable to that client you [1053] make yourself extraordinarily marketable [1055] to that client and it gives you a lot of [1058] staying power and sticking power now the [1060] rub is which most people I think [1062] misunderstand when they hear the high [1064] income skill part they're like well yeah [1066] Nick no I could be a master at [1068] something and of course I'll make 10,000 [1069] bucks a month the reality is you don't [1071] actually need to be that great at [1073] anything in order to make $10,000 a [1075] month with that you'd be surprised at [1077] the graveyard of extraordinarily skilled [1080] Specialists out there that are amazing [1082] at what they do and they don't make more [1085] than three or $4,000 a month because [1087] they they have the high income skill [1088] they don't have anything else that I'm [1090] about to show you and this is a big [1091] problem that I see when people sign up [1092] to my my programs to be honest they are [1095] very good at what they do hell I'm sure [1097] a couple of them are even better [1098] automator than I am or definitely better [1099] computer programmers that's for sure [1101] they just lack everything else and so um [1105] you know they could be the best in the [1106] world with that thing if they don't have [1107] the other bits it doesn't kind of falls [1109] apart you don't actually need to be that [1110] good in order to combine this with the [1112] other bits and make a ton of money so uh [1116] the distance I would say nowadays [1118] between you and then somebody that makes [1120] a ton of money with a high andcome skill [1121] it's just a few weeks it's a few weeks [1122] of self-education realistically it's a [1124] few hours a day of practice few hours a [1126] day watching YouTube videos we have the [1128] best Library um out there ever and I'm [1132] going to run you through a couple right [1133] now we have automation obviously I'm a [1134] little biased here because this is you [1136] know the the content of my programs a [1137] lot of what I talk about but there are [1139] other high- income skills as well [1140] copyrighting people talk about how AI is [1142] completely decimated copyrighting and [1143] stuff it hasn't not good copyrighting [1145] anyway and that's going to take quite a [1146] few years left um in order to like [1149] replicate really really powerful [1151] copywriters specifically like um like [1154] direct sales letters like long form copy [1156] um newsletters um anything where there's [1159] just a lot of nuance built up over over [1161] many [1162] layers the third is Performance [1164] Marketing So Paid ads um this is still a [1166] very high income skill although people [1167] like to think that you know Facebook and [1169] Google and stuff like that are like [1170] taking taking over all this video [1172] production and editing that is getting [1173] substantially more in demand I would say [1175] as we're changing um you know like the [1178] distribution of content and then I have [1179] a big list of other skills here as well [1182] so you know SEO funnel building growth [1184] hacking email marketing affiliate [1185] marketing business development uh web [1187] development mobile apps are still really [1189] big um I say a and machine learning here [1192] really generally I don't actually mean [1193] like you need to be able to create an AI [1195] model or anything um cyber security I'm [1197] seeing blow up a lot public relations I [1199] worked at a PR agency $115,000 retainers [1201] you can make a ton of money with any of [1202] these things all I've done here is I've [1204] just given you a little list here and [1206] it's not important what you pick okay it [1208] really is not important what you pick [1209] the only thing that is important is that [1211] you just pick something and you spend 10 [1212] to 15 hours learning the fundamentals [1214] with free lowcost resources everything [1216] you need is 100% free on YouTube um the [1218] second that you're at about 10 to 15 [1221] hours and you feel at least reasonably [1222] confident about like the the subject [1224] matter of this you can just move on you [1226] don't have to become a pro um don't [1227] spend your entire learning before you [1229] actually go out there and start [1230] marketing yourself that's a very classic [1231] beginner's [1233] mistake okay so once you've um achieved [1235] this High income skill once you have [1236] something and it's got literally 10 to [1238] 15 hours which some of you guys could [1240] realistically do before the end of the [1241] day today once you have achieved this [1244] level the next step is you need to take [1246] this and you need to productize it what [1249] is productizing your offering well you [1251] know if you don't productize you will [1254] never make more than a few thousand [1256] dollars a month doing freelancing [1259] this is because um a lot of Freelancers [1261] fall into this pit where you know they [1263] have some sort of custom project that [1265] they give or they they just offer a [1266] general service they say like I offer [1268] copywriting services and then every time [1270] they get a new client every client has a [1272] different copywriting need some clients [1273] need some you know video sales letter [1275] other ones need some I don't know email [1277] marketing newsletter other people need [1279] like Google ads and whatnot they take on [1281] every project and because every project [1283] is so different from the previous [1284] projects they're never ever able to [1286] build momentum they're never able to [1288] take advant of things like templates and [1290] this is really where the leverage comes [1291] in right why would you uh kind of like [1295] in The Leverage example why would you [1297] push the lever super close to the full [1298] Chrome when you could just go way far [1299] out and push it push it really far [1301] instead multiply your Force if you could [1303] build templates that do 80% of your work [1305] for you which is what productization [1306] essentially refers to you're going to be [1308] a lot better off so you know [1311] productization just means you create [1313] clear repeatable and templated services [1315] that do I like to say 80% or more of the [1317] job um that's just my my rule of thumb I [1319] don't try and get like 100% of the way [1321] because I found that's infeasible and [1323] just like a long lever and a fulcrum [1324] this is going to multiply your output [1326] multiply your ability to do cool things [1328] like if you think about it if um before [1332] that is not a square that's a triangle [1334] if before you know you're pushing down [1337] here this is going to help you push all [1339] the way over here this is going to [1340] multiply your ability to uh produce some [1343] output at the end okay so what are some [1345] examples of product IED Services a quick [1347] one is a 200 $25 website in 72 hours [1350] package maybe you just whip up a website [1353] um with a set number of pages or [1354] something like that that's like your [1355] beginner offer um you you guarantee some [1357] sort of result here in 72 hours this [1359] solves a short-term need for people that [1361] need like a highquality website quickly [1363] uh one that I talk a lot about in my [1365] program is uh cold email systems let's [1367] say $1,538 cold email system setup you [1370] use templated copy you give people nine [1372] mailboxes and then you say you're going [1374] to get 10 guaranteed leads in 60 days or [1376] you don't pay uh be a $596 detailed SEO [1380] audit with actional recommendations [1382] maybe you're some big hot shot SEO guy [1384] and people just pay you to give them a [1386] giant list of things they need to fix [1387] saves them a ton of time and energy why [1390] is this important the reason why is [1391] because clients get exactly what you [1394] tell them that they're going to get you [1396] never have any sort of misunderstanding [1398] regarding the deliverables he provided [1400] and then the deliverables that they paid [1401] for and then more importantly it means [1404] that you get to template things you do [1405] get to template assets you get to [1406] template um you know proposals you get [1409] to template sales materials you get to [1411] template basically everything uh which [1413] at the end of the day allows you to just [1414] like not have to spend 2 to three hours [1416] every time you get a customer or a [1418] client you just spend a few minutes [1420] you're also able to deliver much faster [1421] because of said templates and the [1423] repeatability of the process this also [1424] means you'll deliver better when you [1426] start doing the exact same thing every [1428] single time and if you just do this for [1429] a month the the deliverable at the end [1432] of the month is going to be completely [1434] unrecognizable compared to the [1436] deliverable at the beginning of the [1437] month the issue is because we provide [1439] different services and we work on [1440] slightly different skills we never allow [1443] ourselves to get really good at doing [1444] that one thing and because we never [1446] standardize it we're never able to point [1447] out the deficiencies in every service [1449] implementation well if you take this [1451] approach and if you productize as [1452] quickly as you possibly can you tend to [1454] deliver a lot better um which helps you [1456] you know make uh make money without [1458] having necessarily to spend the concent [1460] amount of time and then speaking about [1462] time this allows you to move away from [1463] hourly billing it allows you to start [1465] focusing on the outcomes that the [1466] customer gets Instead This is NE [1468] necessary to minimize your daily time [1469] spend and take advantage of Leverage [1471] this is really where the term leveraged [1472] freelancing comes in so now you're [1475] thinking Nick this sounds great and all [1476] but how the hell do I actually do this [1478] in practice right these are three or [1480] four steps I I have no idea what this [1482] looks like um what I want to do here is [1484] I just want to show you a good example [1485] of a friend and a former client of mine [1488] um Joe Davies aacho these guys producti [1491] the hell out of search engine [1493] optimization and PR now I'm not saying [1496] you have to excuse me I'm not saying you [1497] have to set up a website uh that does [1499] all of this just like they did with this [1501] cute little devil thing and then this [1504] wonderful little animation I'm not [1506] saying that I'm just um giving you guys [1507] a quick example of how you can how you [1510] can talk about the deliverables how you [1511] can take services that people previously [1513] thought were like really vague and and [1515] and hard to conceptualize and hard to [1518] make these discreet line at them type [1520] things and turn them into something that [1521] is producti so check this out digital PR [1524] campaigns designed to be resold one of [1526] the big things in PR and I know this [1527] myself cuz I worked like I owned a PR [1529] Agency for a period of time um a [1532] reasonably big one as well one of the [1534] big issues with PR is like when you [1536] start working with a company they [1538] typically do things extraordinarily [1539] custom they want to like learn about you [1540] your vision your brand you know that [1542] this whole consultation period might [1544] take weeks and then the whole idea [1545] behind PR public relations is at excuse [1547] me at the end of the result at the end [1549] of the working relationship the idea is [1551] that you just get a couple of articles [1553] in big journals like CNN or uh uh you [1557] know Wall Street Journal or or something [1559] of that nature what fcho has done here [1563] is instead of all that instead of that [1564] lengthy consultation period instead of [1566] all this time energy and resource [1567] mobilizing all this you instead [1570] just offer people a guaranteed number of [1573] links you offer people a guaranteed Dr [1576] that just stands for domain reputation [1578] guaranteed amount of traffic guaranteed [1580] number of stories created and then you [1582] give them like a very flat and simple [1584] cost up front all they need to do in [1586] this case is they need to like click on [1587] button you also show them an example of [1589] what they get if they do buy or work [1591] with you so I love the way that these [1594] guys do this stuff and you know if [1595] you're follower my channel you know that [1596] I mention them pretty often because I [1598] think they their their productization is [1599] one of the reasons why they're able to [1600] make you know seven or sorry eight [1602] figures a year now um with PR where a [1605] lot of people can't now after you've [1607] looked up some companies that provide [1608] your service I mean fcho is a great one [1610] if you're doing any sort of SEO then [1612] open up this Google sheet and I have a [1614] couple of very simple steps here and I [1616] just wanted to like put this somewhere [1617] that wasn't on my whimsical in case I [1618] tried to change it or turn it into an [1619] asset later um but uh all you need to do [1622] is just follow these these three steps [1624] First Once you have this list of [1626] services broken down into deliverables [1628] like the number of links and so on and [1629] so forth um what you do is you [1632] deconstruct each service down into the [1633] work that you have to do in order to [1635] create it for instance if you think [1636] about it a $225 website in 72 hours that [1639] package that I talked about earlier you [1641] might need a couple of things for that [1642] you might need a landing page you might [1643] need an about page maybe you need a [1645] contact us page maybe you need some [1647] images maybe you want to be an image of [1648] the founder waving or something [1650] basically you have to list all this [1652] stuff out line item Style just so you [1653] know everything that goes into the [1655] project and then after you're done all [1657] you need to do is just produce a [1659] stepbystep guide on how you would do it [1662] assuming that you have zero knowledge [1664] once you have the step-by-step guide the [1666] reason why you do this is because we're [1667] starting to standardize the way that you [1668] you provide or produce a service and [1670] this might only take you I don't know 20 [1672] 30 minutes per thing once you're done go [1674] through this process step by step the [1676] the process that you just created so [1678] that you can see if this is sufficient [1680] of an sop in order to produce the [1681] desired result and then just use it to [1683] create a general template with sections [1685] that apply to maybe 80% of projects so [1688] how do we actually make this relevant [1689] well if you think about it in terms of [1690] Fat Joe you see how it says two to six [1692] stories created the whole idea here is [1694] you you write up a story and then you [1695] send it to a journalist and you're like [1697] hey how's it going you know I know you [1698] specialize in this here's a story that [1700] we wrote for this client which is doing [1701] all this cool you can literally [1703] just copy and paste this and post this [1704] on your magazine or or your your [1706] newspaper if you want so you're saving [1708] the a lot of time what you would do in [1709] this specific case is you would just [1711] template out like 50 stories you would [1713] like one time write 50 stories they'd [1716] all be slightly different they'd all be [1718] General uh enough that you could just [1720] swap in various Brands and so on and so [1722] forth and maybe when you get a new [1724] client you would ask them a couple of [1726] simple questions then take that brief [1728] feed it in chat gbt and now you just [1730] have like a slight little variance to [1731] that story that you just send over to a [1733] PR journalist or something this [1735] eliminates you needing to copyright it [1737] eliminates you have spend a bunch of [1738] time and energy doing that um and [1740] it's basically one of the straightest [1741] line paths to just do the work involved [1743] in this um once as opposed to every [1745] single time you get a client obviously [1748] you can then spend a lot more time on [1749] every story you're not like stressed out [1751] because you have a client deadline [1752] that's coming up um and you know it just [1754] gets a lot easier what's another way [1756] that you would productize this you would [1758] uh get a big list of journalists you [1760] you'd spend one period of time [1763] assembling a big list of all the [1764] magazines for all these different niches [1765] that maybe you want to work with and now [1767] when you get a new client you don't [1768] actually have to like do that when you [1769] get the client you just know okay well I [1771] have this big network of Journal um all [1773] I need to do is just take that story [1774] customize it to every client using the [1775] brief and then just send it out so you [1777] could make [1778] $576 and you could do so in [1780] realistically like 20 minutes of work [1782] that's the whole idea behind [1783] productization I know I talk about SEO [1785] here and there's a lot more than SEO [1787] that you could do but you can take the [1788] same approach and you can apply it to [1789] copywriting you can take the same [1790] approach and you can apply it to [1792] automation I talk a lot about templates [1793] I always provide blueprints at the [1795] bottom of my videos you can take the [1796] same approach talk about C cyber [1798] security get template out audits you [1800] literally take this approach to more or [1801] less any service that you [1803] provide cool so now that we understand [1805] what produ ising our offering looks like [1807] the third and probably the most [1808] important part of all this is the daily [1810] lead gen so you know in in in an agency [1814] you typically have salespeople you have [1816] people that fulfill the work right if [1818] you're doing leverage or solo [1819] freelancing yourself logically you have [1821] to do all that yourself so you have to [1822] sell the product and then you also have [1824] to fulfill the product unfortunately [1826] what always happens when I see freelance [1828] to start this stuff is they end up [1829] getting caught around like the 3 to 5K a [1831] month Mark and the reason why is because [1833] they will generate a bunch of leads [1835] first and then they'll get so [1837] overwhelmed with all the leads and now [1838] they have to fulfill and deliver on all [1839] those leads so they stop doing the lead [1841] generation once they're done the [1843] projects because they haven't done any [1844] lead generation now the pendulum swung [1846] the other way and now they have no leads [1847] again so they have to go full into lead [1849] gen well there's a much better way of [1851] doing this and the best way to do so is [1854] just to always have some sort of trickle [1856] of lead generation going on my [1858] recommendation and one that's worked [1859] really well for me and approximately [1861] over 1,00 people now 1,200 agencies and [1863] Freelancers that have tried this is [1865] doing daily lead generation instead and [1868] just making it a non-negotiable if you [1870] can get in the habit of doing some sort [1871] of daily lead generation um you'll find [1873] that like 95% of your competitors you'll [1875] just leave them in the dust because so [1876] few people have the wherewithal to to [1878] even do like half an hour to an hour of [1881] consistent daily sales activity per day [1883] uh and if you are smart about how you do [1885] it if you take this idea of distance [1887] versus display placement in mind and if [1888] you find the shortest line path to [1890] achieve the same result you can [1892] typically achieve basically what an [1893] entire sales team will do just yourself [1896] as long as you're smart about it so how [1898] do you actually get smart about it well [1899] I'm I'm going to talk about it here but [1900] there are three strategies I like to use [1902] for Leen the first is um upwork which I [1905] think a lot of people um they on [1907] constantly and I'm going to tell you why [1908] you shouldn't on it especially for [1909] freelancing it's a little bit harder for [1911] agencies but I also talk about it there [1912] as well the second is cold Emil and then [1915] the third is [1916] communities um and yeah Legion is just a [1918] numbers game at the end of the day it's [1920] just all about momentum as long as you [1921] can keep this up if you do this I don't [1922] know every morning when you wake up for [1924] 30 to 45 minutes using the platforms I'm [1927] going to tell you um you you are almost [1930] guaranteed to win and I'll talk about [1932] why in a sec okay so the first thing is [1935] or the first platform or or tool is [1937] upwork now I've made about half a [1939] million dollars on upwork if you're not [1941] already making $10,000 a month and you [1942] don't have a profile on upwork you are [1944] losing a ton of money um if you are not [1946] signed up to upwork because you have [1947] some pre-existing limiting beliefs about [1949] it like the clients are really shitty on [1950] this platform or doesn't matter how much [1952] time I spend on upw work I'll I I don't [1954] want to do my stuff through a platformer [1956] or whatnot I just want this to be my [1958] permission to you to at least give it a [1960] try right like you probably have all [1962] these opinions but all sorts of things [1963] that you've never actually done because [1964] people have told you or you've read a [1966] couple of Articles and all that [1968] subconscious is just swirling [1969] around in your head um I'd recommend not [1971] fully disqualifying anything until you [1972] actually try and dip your toes into that [1975] water until you actually get your feet [1976] wet cuz it worked extraordinar really [1978] well for me it's working very very well [1979] for hundreds um over a thousand people [1982] um in in my groups now so most people do [1984] up workor wrong here's how you do it [1986] right the first thing you do is you set [1987] up your profile and then you optimize it [1989] um and I have some optimization [1990] checklists that I'll run you guys [1991] through in a second but essentially this [1993] is my profile over here you guys see how [1995] it says Nick s Vancouver Canada 99% job [1998] success top rated plus the job success [2000] the top rated plus and the earnings [2001] amounts and the jobs you're not going to [2003] have this stuff if you just make a [2004] profile it takes you some time to acrew [2005] this sort of experience um and to be [2007] frank the amount of experience I have is [2009] one of the reasons why getting future [2011] jobs has been so easy for me but all you [2014] need to do is just follow this little [2015] checklist the first thing is just check [2016] your profile pick and just make sure [2017] that like it it stands out um I like to [2021] uh Center myself so that it's like [2022] somewhere around chest level just a [2024] quick and easy hack that you know [2025] eliminates 95% of the issues where [2027] people just don't trust you because they [2028] don't see your face or something like [2029] that um I like to use a really bright [2031] colored background just another little [2033] conversion hack if I use a bright [2034] colored background I find I got 2 or 3% [2036] higher proposal to reply right that's [2038] important um online for messages you [2040] know if you want upw workk to work for [2041] you you have to play the game and just [2043] like uh you know you do cro for a [2045] website you also do c on your upwork [2047] profile when people see that you're [2049] online for messages they're just more [2050] likely to get back to you these are all [2051] very low hanging fruit but if you want [2053] to win on upw work try this you'll be [2055] surprised at how easily it wins the next [2058] is uh your little description and your [2060] title and stuff like that when you do [2061] this put yourself in the shoes of the [2064] clients that you're attempting to win if [2066] you think about it make sure you know [2068] the problem that you are solving or or [2070] make sure you know the the the issue [2072] that you are attempting to to to solve [2074] on upwork people already know what they [2077] want so you don't have to tell them what [2079] it is that you do because if you're [2081] applying to one of their jobs it's [2083] evident that you do the thing that you [2084] said that you did right they also don't [2088] care about all your fancy copy writing [2091] and stuff because everybody tries to do [2093] this fancy copyrighting and stuff that's [2095] not really a thing to compete on the one [2097] thing that actually matters is your past [2100] experience the big issue with people on [2102] upwork is they tend not to have any past [2103] experience and so if you can provide the [2106] implication that you have some past [2108] experience if you can have them infer [2109] that oh yeah this guy's worked with some [2111] some big people before uh you're [2113] basically always the person at the top [2114] of the list you're basically always [2115] going to win so I always talk about a [2117] simple format where you introduce [2119] yourself you talk about what it is that [2121] you do and then you just do two or three [2122] little bullet points with the big dick [2124] you know social proof case studies in my [2127] case my work over 50 million reads I [2129] write a newsletter read by the founder [2130] of HubSpot and I've been featured in [2131] major Publications like Popular [2133] Mechanics and Apple news you know if [2134] you're hiring me for article writing and [2136] you see these you're going to be like [2137] wow that guy knows his if you look [2139] at all of the other profiles and [2141] platforms it's just going to be filled [2142] with people trying to show off how [2143] amazing they are at copyrighting very [2145] few people actually give a the [2147] biggest trust signal you can do on [2148] upwork is just um use my social proof [2151] format okay so that's juice Point number [2153] one juice Point number two is to apply [2155] with a customized video so upwork [2157] application just cost money to send um [2159] you know it's like 10 12 connects or [2161] something like that comes out to about a [2162] dollar and a half since every [2164] application costs a certain amount [2166] logically you should attempt to recoup [2168] as much of that value as you can the way [2170] that you do so is you customize the hell [2172] out of every application right we talk [2174] about leverage we also talk about um [2176] things that don't scale this is an [2177] example of a thing that doesn't scale [2178] but it's very effective so because [2181] you've already paid this money you're [2182] going to try and recoup as much value by [2184] maximizing your conversion rate and the [2186] way you do so is not just by copying and [2187] tasting some shitty CV like 99% of [2189] people you do this by recording a [2191] customized loom video or equivalent if [2193] you don't want to use Loom you can use [2194] something else uh where basically you [2196] introduce yourself oh that's much better [2198] and then you produce something of value [2200] for the customer without the customer [2201] asking what do I mean by this well um [2204] you know if I were to go on upwork right [2206] now let me see if I could dig up a tab [2211] and drag that puppy [2213] over and then if I were to uh let me see [2217] see here I don't know I'm just going to [2219] type in automation because I think [2220] that's a little bit [2221] easier and then if I were to I don't [2224] know python developer needed to split [2225] large CSV files let's say I was a python [2227] developer I was trying to do some [2228] software freelancing or something I [2230] would record a video that looks [2230] something like this hey how's it going [2232] my name is Nick I just came across your [2234] job post looking for a python developer [2235] splitting large CSV files for context I [2238] run a YouTube channel with 35,000 [2240] subscribers and I make thank you rise [2242] about [2243] $130,000 a month currently I'm talking [2246] about stuff like this development and [2248] and Automation and so on and so forth [2250] what I want to do in this video is [2251] actually just want to create the thing [2252] that you're asking for or at least show [2254] you how to create it um you know get you [2256] about half the way there so that if you [2257] do choose to work with me it's going to [2258] be easier for me to do it's going to be [2259] easier for you to do okay great so [2262] here's what I would do I would and then [2264] I would open up my vs code I would [2267] create a sample CSV file and then I [2269] would literally try doing the thing that [2270] the guy is hiring me for basically um [2274] this does take a fair amount of time if [2275] it's the first time that you've done [2276] something like this [2277] and you're unsure exactly of how to you [2280] know do the thing you obviously have to [2281] learn how to do the thing um but this is [2284] where you produce an insane amount of [2285] value and basically if somebody actually [2287] clicks through your video you are almost [2289] guaranteed to get that job every time [2292] the average proposal to reply rate [2293] through my communities is now somewhere [2295] around 25ish perc meaning that if you [2297] send a proposal about 25% of the time [2299] you are going to get some sort of reply [2301] back this is skewed because a lot of [2302] people have no job success no top rated [2304] no nothing imagine if you're me uh my my [2306] proposal to reply is substantially [2308] higher because I'm always at the top and [2309] people see wow this guy big dick huge [2311] amount of money that he's earned so on [2312] and so forth he knows his stuff uh [2314] imagine if 30% is the lowest you ever go [2317] you spend $3 basically to get a positive [2320] response um three to four five $6 per [2324] meeting something along those lines [2325] maybe you do three meetings to get a win [2326] and it's like 20 bucks a 20 bucks a [2328] client this is extraordinarily low cost [2331] and it's super scalable so if you're not [2333] doing it I'd uh i' recommend that you [2335] look into it the last thing is just [2337] outbid everyone on every job upwork has [2339] like this bidding feature if I um can I [2342] go back to the screen that I had before [2344] let me see I think it's because I'm full [2346] screen here so give me a [2348] second if I were [2351] to go over to a random upwork job and [2354] then just apply let's do [2357] this you see how at the bottom left hand [2359] corner uh it says boost your proposal uh [2362] what you can do basically are these are [2363] the top four spots on upwork when you [2365] submit a bid on a job uh what you do is [2368] you just outbid everybody and you just [2369] make sure that you're always at the top [2370] so I I just spent you know uh an extra [2372] $25 doar or something like that on this [2375] right if if I'm trying to outbid if I'm [2376] 20 right it's first place second place [2377] we sort of tie the first person to do [2379] that the bid always gets it we go 21 I'm [2381] first I've now spent an additional [2384] amount of money to earn this job and [2385] you're probably thinking like well Nick [2386] doesn't that add up it does but if you [2388] think about it again you've already paid [2390] right if you've already paid but you're [2392] basically guaranteed to get a meeting if [2394] you do something that is this high value [2396] for the customer then you might as well [2397] spend whatever money you need [2399] additionally um they have this little [2400] Gambit if your proposal isn't viewed you [2401] get all your money back so the game [2403] theoretic move is just always out bit [2405] everybody okay so yeah I I wanted to be [2408] very specific here I didn't just want to [2409] give you guys broad overviews because [2410] lead gen is the most important thing if [2411] you don't have leads you don't have a [2412] business so um optimize your profile use [2415] the walkthrough and the checklist that I [2416] just showed you guys apply with a [2418] customized video because up work apps [2419] cost money you might as well get as much [2421] of that back as you can and then just [2422] outbid everybody on every job obviously [2424] don't be ridiculous about it if [2425] somebody's bid 200 connects or something [2427] they spend I don't know how much money [2428] that is but it's a lot uh you [2430] know you don't need to be first place [2431] right you could be second place If you [2432] bid 15 instead um but yeah be be a [2435] little bit smart about it and I think uh [2437] if you just try and put yourself in the [2438] customer shoes uport can go a long way [2440] for you okay so the second approach um [2443] is cold emo I've generated hundreds of [2445] thousands of dollars from cold emo [2446] campaigns and I firmly believe if you [2448] are currently not using this channel to [2450] reach high value clients you are leaving [2452] a massive amount of money on the table [2453] you're being silly I have cold email [2455] campaigns that are constantly running [2456] despite the fact that I'm on YouTube and [2458] I'm you know making a lot of money on [2459] YouTube too cold email is so high [2461] leverage there's basically nothing [2462] that's higher leverage right now than [2464] cold email um so here's how you do it [2466] right the first is basically you need to [2468] set up multiple mailboxes for volume so [2470] unfortunately the way that the vast [2472] majority of people do it is this is our [2474] little email um you know and they send I [2477] don't know like 500 a day uh across to [2482] many different email inboxes so they'll [2484] send to you know this is one mailbox and [2487] this is like a bunch of [2489] mailboxes uh this 500 a day this is [2491] going to be marked to spam basically [2493] immediately so what you do instead is [2494] you use a platform like instantly or [2496] smart lead and what this does is instead [2498] of just one [2499] mailbox basically this is just our array [2502] of mailboxes we get like 50 different [2505] mailboxes and then it automatically [2508] distributes volume from every one of [2510] these [2511] mailboxes to you know the the client or [2514] the prospect mailboxes for you it takes [2516] care of all this automatic distribution [2518] so now basically the uh daily average [2521] amount of mail that's being sent from a [2523] single mailbox is not 500 now it's maybe [2526] I don't know like 30 per day future [2529] videos will involve me with an actual [2531] pen instead of me painstakingly drawing [2533] this with my mouse the idea being uh [2535] when you do stuff like this um you know [2537] the likelihood of every any one [2538] individual mailbox being banned is super [2540] low uh and then you can yeah you can [2543] typically just get a lot more Alpha that [2544] way uh which is a little re [2547] recommendation oh cool an eraser so yeah [2549] 30 emails per day per mailbox um keeps [2551] you below spam th thresholds that's my [2553] personal recommendation um you don't [2556] have to do it this way but this is just [2557] what I like to do this is what I [2559] recommend in my program some people can [2560] get away with more some people have to [2561] get away with less after that you need [2563] to Source your leads the two best ways [2565] to Source leads as of the time of this [2567] video is use a platform called Apollo um [2570] or use a platform called LinkedIn sales [2572] Navigator Apollo is basically just a big [2574] directory of different leads you can buy [2577] leads using Apollo itself but uh [2579] basically what's occurred now is there's [2581] this whole ecosystem setup around Apollo [2583] where instead of just buying the Apollo [2585] leads what you do is you buy a scraper [2587] that some other dude developed that [2588] actually sort of it it it like scrapes [2592] Apollo instead so instead of paying [2593] Apollo now you're paying some other guy [2595] and then this other guy you know uh [2597] delivers the leads for instead of $79 [2599] per month for 24,000 export credits per [2601] year you pay like $3 for uh I don't know [2606] the the equivalent is probably like 12th [2607] of what Apollo is charging something [2609] along those lines it's just an [2609] estimation don't hold me accountable so [2612] you can do that with Apollo um there are [2614] two good ones right now there's one [2615] called leads rapidly which is pretty big [2617] there's also another one called um it's [2619] like apify Apollo [2621] scraper and uh these just both like take [2624] your uh sorry they take your Apollo [2626] cookie and then with your cookie they [2629] scrape vast amounts of leads for you [2631] that otherwise would be behind some sort [2633] of pay wall type deal uh once you're [2635] done with that write good copy I have a [2637] bunch of videos on this so just feel [2638] free to check out the rest of my channel [2639] if you're unclear but um you can just [2641] use this as my template moving forward [2644] hi I found you on platform I help Niche [2646] do really cool thing last year I made [2648] amount of money for other clients and [2650] I'm confident I can do the same for you [2651] I guarantee and if you don't love it you [2653] wouldn't pay a cent would this be worth [2654] a call in practice hi I found you on [2656] LinkedIn I help B2B agencies make [2659] $50,000 a month or more in an added [2662] Revenue last year I made $2.3 million [2665] for insert big client name here and I'm [2667] confident I can do the same thing for [2668] you I guarantee you at least 20 booked [2671] meetings and a three times Roi and if [2673] you don't absolutely fall in love with [2674] it you won't pay a scent would this be [2676] worth a quick call feel free to just do [2678] whatever variation of this that you want [2679] you don't have to use the same language [2681] but in general this seems to pattern [2682] match like an effective um piece of [2684] Outreach copy it's very short it's very [2686] Punchy and it just respects the viewers [2688] time which I think is really important [2690] and then the fourth is just always test [2691] never just send one sequence you should [2693] always be split testing your variants [2694] against each other the most valuable [2696] resource cold email is not actually the [2698] positive responses that you're getting [2699] it's the data that you get back because [2701] of those positive responses it's seeing [2704] what happens when you use different [2705] subject lines it's seeing how best to [2707] pitch your service you're going to get [2710] this data or the time will pass anyway [2712] you might as well get a bunch of data [2714] while you're doing it this is another [2716] form of Leverage it's another form of [2718] having a tight feedback loop uh which is [2720] what allows us to use cold email and [2722] grow really quickly so get those tight [2724] feedback loops um when you're using cold [2726] email never just send a single sequence [2727] always be split testing okay and then [2730] lead generation approach number three is [2732] called communities uh a lot of people [2734] are skeptical that communities work and [2735] for good reason but essentially [2737] communities are a big business model [2738] right now um owing both to Alex hormos [2741] investment in school and a couple of [2742] other reasons communities are just a [2744] simple and and straightforward way to [2745] solve a lot of problems that [2746] entrepreneurs have they typically don't [2748] have a support network because it's a [2749] very lonely road they typically don't [2750] have templated assets or resources as [2752] well um [2754] because yeah you know they're just [2756] getting started with business for the [2757] first time and they also kind of solve [2759] like QA and common one-off consultations [2761] so they're they're extraordinarily [2763] powerful a lot of people just haven't [2765] really experimented enough with them to [2766] make them work um here's a way to make [2768] them work what you do is you [2770] consistently provide value in a [2771] community you then establish yourself as [2773] a go-to expert within the group for a [2775] for a thing and then once you're the [2776] go-to expert in the group um you drop [2779] value give people some sop that helps [2782] them do XYZ then people will like [2784] comment and DM you when your [2785] contributions resonate all you have have [2787] to do at that point is just engage back [2788] and then explore opportunities to help [2789] them further somebody says wow this is [2791] so cool I never thought about this you [2793] reply to them and then you just send [2794] them a DM and you say hey Peter you know [2796] what were you planning on using my sop [2797] for it's super cool that you know you do [2799] X Y and Z just wanted to just wanted to [2801] see if I could still help something [2803] along those lines how to actually do it [2805] three or two steps here the first is [2807] just find the right groups so use [2809] platforms like school so if you go [2811] school.com [2813] slcover that page does not exist do not [2815] go to school.com discover go over here [2818] oh Discovery my bad uh jump over here [2821] and then just scroll through and look [2823] for communities that fit uh demographic [2825] that you think that you can help you [2827] know you can sort by free or U paid or [2830] or whatever ideally you're not going to [2832] want to be looking for things like um I [2834] don't know musculature unless you're [2836] some [2837] physical uh sorry personal trainer or [2839] something you're going to want want to [2840] be looking for something to do with [2841] business [2843] so I don't know it always cracks me up [2845] how this guy is a thous members 49 bucks [2847] a month I have no idea what it what his [2849] stuff is but like when I see his profile [2851] picks it's just so funny uh what's a [2854] good example this is a good example um [2858] this is a good example I granted this [2859] one takes a fair amount of money but [2860] this is like one for [2862] editors this is one for per menopausal [2864] or postmenopausal women this is print on [2867] demand stuff so you can absolutely help [2868] print on demand people the point that [2870] I'm making is you basically pick a niche [2871] or a few niches you join these [2873] communities um through school Google [2875] Facebook uh Discord slack whatever and [2878] then you instead of self-promoting and [2881] being like hey guys how's it going uh [2884] please visit my website and I'll make [2886] you guys a a great funnel for your [2888] campaigns instead of that you have to be [2890] a little bit clever and you have to kind [2891] of go more ctitious what you do is you [2894] spend time observing the group before [2895] posting so you actually scroll through [2897] the whole community in my case the [2898] school Community from top to bottom and [2900] then you just kind of like ask yourself [2901] hm like what are these guys talking [2903] about what sorts of questions do they [2904] have if I uh give you guys like a [2906] practice [2907] example um there are a few communities [2910] here uh one of my friends just launched [2912] one called organic search Academy so uh [2915] this is uh my buddy Charlie Clark [2917] founder of minty digital it's a great [2918] like SEO agency and he just started [2920] organic search Academy which is meant to [2922] help people boost their organic search [2924] marketing campaigns in the age of AI if [2926] you think about it what sorts of people [2927] are probably going to be here people [2929] that are seos or people that need help [2931] with SEO so maybe what you do is you [2933] scroll through this top to bottom so you [2934] can see it's mostly Charlie at this [2935] point because I think this launched like [2937] a week ago or something but you scroll [2939] through this top to bottom you see the [2940] various conversations that people are [2942] having the things that they're talking [2943] about the the The Branding that they're [2945] using the terminology they're using so [2946] on and so forth and then you you you [2950] make like a little short list of these [2951] terms and the ideas and the pain points [2953] and problems that they're facing and [2955] then after that just start replying to [2957] people with a few interesting tidbits or [2959] positive energy or ideally value so I [2960] would just go back here and I would [2964] say welcome Erica good to have you view [2967] here I would scroll through uh Charlie's [2970] post and I would [2973] say this is going to be [2975] huge I actually know Bennett I think [2977] he's in one of my other communities [2979] funny um you know you you'd respond not [2982] just these positive little like thumbs [2983] up type deals you'd actually go through [2985] and you'd provide some sort of [2987] thoughtful analysis or a thoughtful [2989] reply and you do this for maybe like a [2991] week or so um you'd build up a bunch of [2993] familiarity in the group and now people [2994] know who you are they know that every [2996] time that they get a response from you [2998] it's always positive it's always good [2999] and then the second that you are at this [3001] point where you have like some [3002] reputation in the group all you do is [3003] you just write a value post and this [3005] value post just needs to mimic this hey [3008] I've been struggling with problem that [3009] everybody else is struggling with and I [3011] know many others here have too last week [3013] I found a way to do this for very little [3016] money or very little time step one do [3018] this step two do this step three do this [3019] hope this helps let me know if [3020] anything's un here you don't pitch you [3022] don't ask for anything back from them [3024] you just wait to have your thing filled [3026] with DMs and and messages and comments [3028] and stuff like that and then you connect [3029] with people book calls with them and so [3031] on and so forth um very very [3033] straightforward method that you can do [3035] right now as any sort of freelancer uh [3038] and the value there is you get a ton of [3039] Leverage The reason why is because these [3040] are posts that you make once and then [3042] they stand the test of time they're [3043] going to continue producing leads and [3045] stuff like that for you for basically [3046] the lifetime of the group if the group [3048] is small and if your post is really good [3050] odds are the person that owns the group [3052] or whatever is going to continuously [3053] site this Resource as a piece of value [3054] within the group so you're just going to [3056] get constant like positive notifications [3058] of people weeks and months later like [3060] sending you replies and thanking you and [3062] sending you positive DMS you don't have [3064] to believe me um you know my community [3066] does this this is one of the way one of [3068] the main ways that my community members [3070] in make money with make and maker school [3071] um actually make money they do exactly [3073] what I'm I'm telling you guys for the [3075] community aspect um and it it works [3077] super well okay and now that we are done [3080] with steps one to three which I think [3082] you probably understand more intuitively [3085] we're going to get into more abstract [3087] one which is optimization and retention [3089] you know how I talked about testing in [3091] cold email being really important well [3093] uh testing and optimizing and and [3096] improving by 1% every day or week or [3099] whatnot this is a really important [3100] concept more generally uh if you don't [3103] do this then if we go back to our [3104] distance and displacement graph you're [3106] just going to be sort of all over the [3107] place right you're trying to get from A [3109] to B but you just keep on looping and [3111] doing random circles all over the you [3113] know all over the screen um optimizing [3116] and and retaining basically means every [3118] time you move you just ask yourself hey [3119] am I moving in the right direction no [3121] okay well let me just move a little bit [3122] to the right then okay am I moving in [3123] the right direction no I got to move a [3124] little bit back up and then eventually [3126] what you do is you approximate a [3127] straight line path um and logically um [3130] optimizing and retaining is something [3132] that just basically everybody should be [3133] doing whether it's split testing cold [3135] email split testing your products split [3136] testing your um I don't know upw workk [3139] split testing your community approach um [3141] or whatever okay so what does that [3143] actually mean in practice I like to set [3145] the rule to to get 1% better at the [3147] thing that I'm doing every week so 1% [3150] better at my craft means 1% better at [3151] providing the service it means 1% better [3154] at doing my daily lead generation it [3156] means 1% better at uh I don't know [3158] creating content in communities means 1% [3160] better at productizing my offer [3162] literally just get 1% better at your [3164] craft every week mathematically if [3166] you're a nerd like I am the formula for [3168] this is 1.01 raised to 52 that's 1.67 [3171] meaning every year you grow by 67% if [3174] you get 1% better every week that means [3176] that if you make $110,000 a month in [3178] year one which anybody here can do very [3180] easily by the time year three rolls [3182] around it'll be making $28,000 a month [3183] year four it'll be making like $40,000 a [3185] month basically this this uh increases [3188] your Revenue exponentially and try and [3190] contrast this to working like a 9-5 drop [3192] like in a 95 job you get like a 3% raise [3194] every year that tends just to match [3195] inflation you don't actually make any [3197] more money most of the time um if you [3199] can grow by 67% and the only thing you [3202] need to do to to get there is to get 1% [3204] better every week like one % better [3206] every week is like .1% better every day [3210] like that's that's nothing you could [3212] read three words on a page in a book um [3215] that provides help on how to do some [3217] freelancing thing some some YouTube [3219] video on how to become a better video [3221] editor or something you literally watch [3223] one minute of that per day and you will [3224] be 0.14% better um the the leverage here [3227] in just being consistent and applying [3229] yourself daily is [3230] insane and then the second thing you [3232] need to do in order to optimize is [3234] retain retention just means having a [3237] client come back to you for more so if [3240] you do these lead generation activities [3242] that I talk about and if you do them [3244] daily and I'd personally recommend [3245] spending at least an hour and a half [3247] every single morning on the three tasks [3249] that I laid out above you could easily [3251] quantify it by saying I'm going to send [3253] five upwork applications a day I'm going [3255] to spend 15 minutes reviewing and [3257] responding to cold emails a day I'm [3259] going to spend half an hour um you know [3261] uh creating Community posts per day if [3263] you do this consistently you will be [3265] swimming in leads [3267] it is just a matter of time um and once [3270] you're at that point you'll start [3271] realizing that actually just acquiring [3272] more leads isn't always the best answer [3275] uh once you're at the point where you [3277] know you you have a bunch of leads [3278] typically the shortest line path to [3280] maintaining and then growing your [3281] revenue is not actually just getting [3282] more new ones it's actually just [3283] retaining it's retaining the ones have [3285] already paid you money and this is for a [3287] couple reasons the reason why is because [3289] happy long-term clients are a lot easier [3291] to manage than consistently finding new [3292] ones which means that eventually you can [3294] you know reclaim that one per day that [3296] you're spending on Outreach which [3297] increases your leverage [3299] further and then clients are also just [3302] they tend to pay a lot more because they [3303] like and they trust you've already [3304] gotten that out of the way so my average [3306] amount of money that I make on like a a [3308] follow-up deal and like a second deal is [3310] supposed to a first deal something like [3311] 1.5 times the amount meaning if on an [3313] initial project I make $2,000 on the [3315] follow-up project I might make $3,000 on [3317] the follow-up project after I might make [3319] $4,000 how do you actually do this you [3322] just overd deliver you exceed [3323] expectations wherever possible um you [3325] stay in touch um what I mean by stay in [3327] touch is you basically you don't [3328] discount the human connection there um [3330] you set some sort of like weekly [3332] follow-up reminder with all of your [3333] clients just say hey I found this and I [3335] thought of you or hey you know um I saw [3337] that you guys just won this big award I [3339] just wanted to check in that's really [3340] cool hey I noticed you guys were [3342] experimenting with this how can I add [3343] value for you this is super simple to do [3346] but a lot of people never do and they [3348] never really think about it this way you [3349] can absolutely systematize your client [3351] relationships and then obviously you [3353] incentivize loyalty in some respects if [3355] you think about it offer a discount to [3356] somebody that's paying you more money [3358] anyway just sort of like negates the [3359] thing so uh you know if you're working [3362] with somebody uh long term odds are it's [3364] going to take you less time to fulfill [3365] the same project at the two-month Mark [3367] than it will the the first day that you [3370] guys work together because you guys have [3371] a better working relationship things are [3372] faster some expectations are already set [3374] and dealt with ahead of time to reward [3377] them for making your life easier you can [3379] absolutely give them some sort of [3381] discount or or incentive bonus or [3383] something along those lines um because [3385] then it it aligns both of your needs you [3387] want to get even more work from this [3388] person they want to get work from you [3390] because you've already verified that [3391] you're good at video editing or [3392] automation or cyber security or whatever [3393] the hell I'm just make it like a [3395] no-brainer for them to do [3397] so okay great I hope you guys [3399] appreciated this video This Is In Sum [3400] how to earn $10,000 a month solo without [3403] an agency obviously there's only so much [3405] that I can get into in a video like this [3407] which is um you know we started with [3410] high level Concepts and then we sort of [3411] worked our way down to like daily lead [3412] generation actions I'm fully cognizant [3414] that you need to deal with stuff like [3415] setting up payment processors and I [3418] don't know actually writing the cold [3419] email copy and and and juggling uh [3422] client relationships and kickoff [3423] meetings and stuff like that it's tough [3425] to make a one-size fits-all video for [3427] all of this just because there are so [3429] many niches out there and there are so [3431] many different like onboarding protocols [3433] for clients um I will do my best over [3435] the course of the next couple of weeks [3436] to um put out resources that apply to [3438] various niches that are sort of like [3440] intran Niche if that makes sense but [3441] it's going to take me a little bit of [3442] time to do so still I do firmly believe [3445] that leverage freelance ing is a lot [3447] higher Roi per unit of your time than [3449] running an agency um I've made $30,000 a [3452] month as I mentioned to you guys before [3453] consistantly last year just doing this [3456] which is more money than you know 99.5% [3458] of all human beings on Earth or [3460] something like that uh will will ever [3462] basically hope to make and it doesn't [3464] need to be super crazy complicated if [3465] you just spend a little bit of time [3467] understanding the concepts that I talk [3468] about here understanding the idea of [3470] Leverage and of distance versus [3472] displacement and of tight feedback loops [3475] um and just the relative ease of which [3477] you can get into something like this [3478] with low barar entry you you can [3481] absolutely do this for yourself if you [3482] have any questions or anything like that [3484] just drop them down below as a YouTube [3485] comment more than happy to get back to [3486] you otherwise if you can do me a big [3488] solid like comment subscribe let me know [3490] what you guys want to see in the next [3491] video I'm going to be making a whole [3493] series on how to do the sort of Leverage [3495] freelancing moving forward so it'd be [3496] great to hear from you thanks so much [3498] have a great rest of the day

Title: My Step-by-Step Automation Agency Delivery Process (Copy)
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here I [1] made over 72,000 bucks a month with my [3] automation agency and the way that I did [5] it was optimizing the client experience [8] now one of the most important and lowest [10] hanging fruit in optimizing the client [12] experience is the actual Service [13] delivery it's also something that I feel [15] is very underrepresented on YouTube [17] people talk about how to build flows [18] they talk about how to scrape leads and [19] get customers but nobody ever talks [21] about what to actually do like [22] logistically when you're done a project [25] how to minimize revisions how to [26] maximize the likelihood of retaining a [28] client how to upsell them how to send [30] the email how to record the [31] documentation what I'm going to do in [33] this video is show you my own [34] step-by-step process that I've been [36] using for the better part of two years [38] including all my templates including [39] everything um to do this to maximize the [42] quality of the client experience impress [44] the hell out of them and then optimize [46] the odds that they want to work with me [47] again in a future project and unlock all [49] that leverage that I talk about in most [50] of my other videos so if you guys want [52] to just cut the and get [53] straight into how to optimize Service [55] delivery then this is the video for you [56] let's get into it [64] cool so I have a Whimsical setup here [66] and this is really my step-by-step [68] automation delivery process this is what [69] I do basically every time that I get a [72] new client uh I'm going to walk you [74] through every one of these steps in [75] excruciating detail but just before I do [78] I just want to show you guys the example [80] system I'm going to be using um I'm [81] keeping this super simple this is just a [83] a super straightforward four module [85] system that I built that literally just [87] scrapes my own School Community once [89] every hour and it just tells me if the [91] member count is 400 I built this a few [93] months back back when I needed to do [94] stuff like this um I now have much more [96] sophisticated systems for this but we're [98] just going to be using this as my like [99] finished system um obviously you know I [102] I could use other systems but um part of [104] what I'm going to be showing you guys in [105] a minute is like how to do documentation [107] how to increase the perceived value of [108] your projects at the most crucial steps [110] and I don't really want to have to do [111] the documentation for this it would just [113] take too long and kind of defeat the [114] purpose so we're going to start with a [116] simple form module system I want you [117] guys to know that you can apply this to [118] whatever system you're running exact [120] same approach doesn't matter if it's [121] four modules uh 400 modules although I [124] highly recommend you do not build 400 [125] module flows uh but I think you guys get [127] my point okay great so let's actually [129] dive into my step-by-step automation [131] process here this is the most effective [133] way I found to deliver highquality [135] automation projects at scale period I've [137] experimented with dozens of approaches [139] this way from what I can see is the best [143] the way that this works is and if you [145] follow this system you know you guys [147] will see what I mean but the way that [149] this works is this maximizes the [152] retention of my customers and it lets me [155] get get my foot in the door for upsells [157] later on that include things like a [159] second project things like a monthly [161] retainer it also impresses them and it [163] like makes asks to do those upsells at [165] very particular points that I think a [167] lot of people don't appreciate are very [169] high Roi times to do so so in a nutshell [172] when the project is completed what we do [174] first is we do an end to- end test this [175] is really important I'm going to dive in [177] exactly how to do it with some examples [178] in a moment then we're going to copy all [180] of our Blueprints and templates for that [182] project this is the secret to [185] scalability with an automation agency if [187] you're not doing this then uh basically [189] every time you get a new project you're [190] starting from scratch which is silly you [192] should really be doing is building a [193] whole automation template Library so [196] that next time that you're faced with uh [198] final boss you don't have to start them [200] at 100% Health you could start them at [201] 20% I'll show you guys how to do that in [203] a second then we're going to record some [205] Sops or documentation the reason why we [207] do this is because automation is sort of [209] like Emeral like automation if you think [211] about it is just a bunch of bits and [213] zeros and ones stored on cloud servers [215] and God knows where it's very hard for a [217] client to conceptualize the value of [218] this so you need to increase the [219] deliverables that you're providing them [221] as much as you can and a video is a [222] quick way to do so it's something that [224] they can see it's something they can [225] hear um and it's something that they're [227] going to think adds value to the project [228] even if it only took you 10 or 15 [230] minutes we're then going to turn that [233] Loom sop into a text sop using large [236] language models and screenshots that is [238] again something that's going to take you [239] 5 minutes but it's going to double the [241] proceed value of the documentation we're [243] then going to dive deep into the client [246] business and we're going to see ways [247] that we can actually like scope out a [249] proposal to to do retainer services and [251] we're going to deliver this in a [253] templated delivery email that just like [255] you know hits all the notes make sure [256] that you get everything you need if [257] you're doing some type of platform sales [259] you'll make sure that you get your [260] review taken care of uh it's going to [262] maximize the probability of you [263] receiving a paid invoice as opposed to [265] just hanging there waiting I'm then [267] going to talk about how to minimize [268] revisions how to frame your project in [269] such a way that allows you uh to you [271] know confidently deliver a thing without [273] actually having to be like hey is [274] everything okay like do you want some [275] changes which I used to do a lot back [277] when I was starting and absolutely [279] murdered my service uh deliveries and [281] then you know we'll we'll deliver the [283] project as you can see I've sort of [284] created a little Loop here where it just [286] goes from eight back to one uh and so on [288] and so on and so forth so this is a loop [290] that's how I want you guys to think [291] about it let's jump in with our very [293] first example which is what to do when [295] your project just finished and it's uh [297] you know time to time to do the delivery [299] and give it to the client so this is the [302] endtoend testing part this is one of the [304] most important steps in the [306] entire automation agency business model [309] I want you to think about this [311] logically let's say you spend 30 hours [314] developing the best project ever known [316] to man it is so amazing it's an [318] automation that summons God I don't know [321] it's really cool all right it does some [323] just amazing let's say it does [326] everything the client wants for wanted [328] and it makes them a million billion a [330] day but when it comes time to deliver [332] that project you know there's just a [335] little I don't know you added an extra [337] semicolon somewhere in one of the text [338] parsers or some and it just it [340] doesn't work the first time the client [342] tries to use it it doesn't work how much [345] value do you think that you have just [347] destroyed for yourself by having that [349] system not work it doesn't matter if you [351] spent a million hours building it if it [354] doesn't work when you deliver it it's as [356] if you spent zero hours on it the client [359] percept is going to be basically the [360] same so endtoend testing e toe is by far [365] one of the most important parts of any [367] service delivery whether it's [369] automations whether you're doing some [370] marketing campaign whether you're doing [372] some security it whatever the hell [374] across business models if you don't just [376] give everything a once over before you [377] give it to your client you are shooting [380] yourself in the foot and you're wasting [381] a massive [382] opportunity so an actual end to-end test [385] like logistically is just where you [387] execute your flow from start to finish [388] as if you were your client and you make [390] sure that every one of the modules in [392] your flow like using make or something [394] like that activate even if you have [395] filters even if you have um I don't know [398] several routes or several subsequences [400] or or [401] whatnot it's obviously very tempting to [403] think that well hey I just spent 30 [405] hours on this thing like I I get how it [406] works okay I've just isolated I've ran [408] this module and that module and that [410] module but trust me when I say I can't [411] tell you how many times I have thought [413] the exact same thing and then I deliver [414] a project that maybe a client paid three [416] four $5,000 for and their first thing is [418] like Nick this isn't working like you're [420] just you're obliterating your odds of [421] getting a retainer or follow-up uh you [424] don't want to do that you want to be [425] very detail oriented with the stuff um [427] and you know as I always mention in my [429] videos like retention unlocks a massive [431] amount of Leverage here so that's what [432] we're going to talk about all right so I [434] have this little scenario set up here as [436] I mentioned previously let me just walk [437] youall through it so we're on the same [438] page it makes a HTTP request to school [441] slake money with make slab know the [444] little get method then we parse the text [446] uh turn it into sorry parse the HTML [448] turn it into text [450] that's what that looks like and as you [451] see there is a very important little [454] snippet right here private group 400 [456] members that's basically what we're [458] looking for we're looking for that [459] little number 400 so what do we do [461] logically we're going to use a Rex here [465] um I'm going to just be feeding it in a [466] very simple pattern private group and [468] then this is what I'm looking for space [469] members I don't need all of this text [471] but I just copy and paste it and then it [473] worked one time and I was like all right [474] good enough for me and then last but not [477] least you know if the number is not for [479] 100 we create a message in slack and I [482] publish it to my left click sales [484] channel right voila we have our our code [487] here it's like a little block formatting [488] you could just use plain text nothing [490] special but if I uh if I jump to my [492] slack this is what the uh notification [495] looks like I just ran this again because [497] I wanted to test that last module but [498] let's just use this one mmw member count [500] is no longer 400 current member count [502] 399 right um the purpose of the system [505] way back in the day was just like notify [507] me when stuff like this would happen I [508] don't really use it anymore uh but yeah [512] all right so I need to somehow magically [513] get back to the screen should be good [516] working with two monitors is weird uh [518] awesome so now that we understand what [519] the system looks like the question is [520] like how how do you actually go about [522] end end testing this thing well it's [523] pretty simple um all you need to do is [525] you just need to run every single module [527] uh and you don't want to do so isolated [528] you don't just want to click run this [529] module only you don't want to just click [531] run this module only you don't just want [533] to do that and work your way down you [534] actually want to run it as if the client [535] were to use it in my case this is [537] schedule to run once every let's just [539] say 60 minutes so I'm actually just [540] going to a run we're going to see what [542] happens okay cool number one that [544] executed fine this looks like it [546] executed fine that looks like it [548] executed fine but there's some filter [550] here and we can't actually see the [552] execution of that last module uh oh so [554] what we need to do is in order for us to [556] have fully endend tested everything in [557] our flow we're going to need to find a [559] way to either remove that filter or or [561] just have it run anyway so uh this is [563] not 400 so it says if you know this [566] number is not equal to 400 then it'll [568] run I'm just going to go like [570] 401 you know just so I can really [572] quickly run it and let me just change [574] this number here too just so that it [575] doesn't seem weird okay great let's run [578] this awesome awesome awesome what is the [581] intended output the intended output is a [582] message that says make money with make [584] member count is no longer 401 and then [587] we have a current member count of 400 [588] perfect so now I'm I'm going to go back [590] here and I'm going to very [592] intentionally just make [595] sure that I reverse that change and this [598] is the same production ready system it [601] was just a second [602] ago awesome and uh yeah now I am good I [608] can continue onwards with my system I've [610] verified that you know I have every [613] module here working the way that I want [615] it to work I'm I'm good I I don't need [616] to worry about this anymore as you see [618] that took maybe two or three minutes [620] it's by far the most valuable two or [621] three minutes that you are going to [622] spend throughout this entire process if [624] you forego this two or three minutes for [627] some other reason you are making a very [628] big strategic era you're always going to [630] want to do some type of an0 testing in [632] your system okay great let's talk a [634] little bit about step two which is [635] copying Blueprints and templates this is [638] hyper important um if you think about [641] this logically Automation and software [643] engineering are one of the only [644] industries that you can effectively do [646] this but let's hypothetically say that [647] you just spent 20 hours working on a [649] project and you were just making uh I [651] don't know the project was like 500 [652] bucks okay really small project you made [654] 25 bucks an hour with this you're like [656] killing yourself you're like what the [657] hell's wrong with me why can't I make [658] more money than 25 bucks an hour I'm a [660] useless automation agency and I should [662] just stop well I want you to think about [664] it this way um you didn't just spend you [668] know 20 hours to solve this project you [671] spent 20 hours to solve every instance [673] of this project ever if you ever get [676] this project again or a variant of this [678] project you now have Blueprints and [681] templates that allow you to get 99% of [683] the job done in 5 seconds so sure it [686] might have taken you 20 hours at the [688] very beginning but the second time it'll [690] take you 30 minutes the third time it'll [692] take you 2 minutes the fourth time it [694] might take you 30 seconds maybe you [696] build an automation that delivers the [697] automations right it's kind of like Apex [700] um stuff and that's what a lot of people [701] aim for so the point that I'm making is [703] the reason why automation is an industry [705] is so freaking awesome is because once [707] you're done you can just copy and paste [709] this forever the issue is most people do [711] not save their blueprints when they [713] develop them for clients especially on [714] like other client environments and stuff [716] like that and so I made this mistake a [718] lot when I was stting starting if I had [720] you know been very organized about the [721] way that I copied all my blueprints [723] copied all my templates change you know [724] when I say templates I mean like the [726] clickup environment I mean like the the [727] Monday environment if I had been a [729] little better with this I think I [730] probably would have been able to hit at [731] least another you know $3 $40,000 a [734] month I think I would have been able to [735] make at least $100,000 a month with the [737] automation agency um but I didn't you [739] know I was pretty disorganized I said ah [741] well maybe I'll just I'll just copy it [742] later and lo and behold you know a year [744] or two later everything's disorganized I [746] have no idea what system is which I [748] don't have access to a few client [749] environments anymore I've lost a lot of [751] that leverage that I could have gotten [752] so what I highly recommend you guys do [755] is after every one of your projects is [758] done download all of the blueprints if [761] you're in make.com download the I don't [763] know scenarios or or na10 Json if you're [766] using another platform and store them in [768] a Google drive or similar um so I have a [771] very simple folder structure set up here [773] as you can see I just called it the name [775] of my company left click underneath we [776] have just my clients and inside of them [779] you know there's this one called NSM Nix [781] rif media I'm not very creative clearly [784] uh and inside of that we have mmwm [786] member count scraper slack notification [787] so this is where I'd store that [789] blueprint so what I would actually do is [791] literally I would go here I would export [793] this blueprint okay and then I would go [796] back over and drag it in just so that I [799] have an organized record of every [801] blueprint that I've ever made and then [803] just to make it even better and more [805] organized i' actually copy the name of [807] this scenario um because make and has [809] the unfortunate tendency to just call it [812] like blueprint 5. Json or whatever um [814] and then I just i' I'd name it that just [816] so I know you know let's say six months [818] from now when I come in and get a [819] similar project and I want to copy and [821] paste this so that's personally the way [824] that I highly recommend you guys do [825] things um if I had done this from the [827] very get-go if I done this from day one [829] with my agency I would have made a lot [830] more money and it also just would have [831] probably spent way less work rebuilding [833] the wheel 55 million times um but I'm [836] going to leave it at that all right so [838] step three our system is to record a [840] loom standard operating [842] procedure what exactly do I mean by this [844] well you need to understand that [846] automations are ephemeral they [849] are virtual they don't really exist [853] right the vast majority of the clients [854] that you're going to be working with are [855] going to be working with you because [857] you're like a technology expert you're [858] an automation expert you typically know [860] more about like Cloud stuff than they do [863] so to you these automations have value [865] right you're working with them it's [866] dragg and dropping across a screen they [868] they do stuff right but to a client you [870] know especially a client that you've [872] like um done most of the work away from [874] sort of this Black Box Thing their [877] ability to conceptualize the value of [878] your automation is very limited and so [881] what you need to do instead of just [883] delivering the automation is you need to [885] find excuses to add some more onto [888] them uh you know instead of just [890] delivering a blueprint let's say which I [892] highly recommend you never do you [894] actually record a video that goes in- [896] depth walking through what the [898] automation does from from start to [899] finish it shows the the the result of [901] the automation it shows how to make [903] changes to the automation if necessary [905] you're there so you can kind of walk [906] them through and frame how great your [907] system is giving them some ideas [909] obviously charm them with your [910] personality but this is essentially like [912] another deliverable that you are [913] providing alongside your system and [915] alongside what the system is supposed to [916] produce which just instantly buys you uh [919] an extra win if you think about it if my [920] deliverables previously were the system [922] and now my now now my deliverables are [924] the system and a loom I basically [926] doubled the number of deliverables but [927] I've done so in like 15 minutes or so so [929] now I've actually recorded a whole Loom [931] here for you guys and I'm not going to [933] go through that loom in this video um I [936] think it's right over here yeah I'm not [937] going to go through the whole loom in [938] this video but this is exactly the [940] format that I take every time I do uh [942] you know like a documentation or video [944] walkth through um I typically start off [946] with just like a brief introduction of [947] what the purpose of this video is I will [949] never ever say like hey Peter how's it [952] going great delivery man I'm going to [953] walk you through it I'll always say [954] something like hey the purpose of this [956] video is to act as video documentation [959] for Peter blank's team I'm going to [961] ensure that you guys know how this works [963] and I'm also going to ensure that you [963] guys can make some common changes to the [965] system if need me the reason why is [967] because I just want them to be able to [968] copy and paste it to their team members [969] as necessary if you do little things [971] like this they'll appreciate it and [973] they'll also think like man this person [974] really knows business I mean if they're [975] just making my life that easy uh and it [978] helps anyway uh you know you go through [980] you talk about the use case you talk [982] about what the system is for the [983] problems the system solves you actually [985] walk them through if they wanted to make [986] some changes to this if they wanted to I [988] don't know [989] um let's see change the scheduling from [991] 60 to 30 minutes they could do it that [993] way if they wanted to change uh the [995] message that they're getting they could [996] do it this way uh you actually go [998] through and you like record a very [999] detailed comprehensive video that walks [1000] them through this and this does like a [1002] couple of things um that that I consider [1004] bonuses one your client is going to [1006] think that it's a bonus because they [1008] weren't really expecting to get anything [1009] at this level of detail and they're [1011] going to think that you spend a lot more [1012] time on it then you probably did but [1014] like remember you've just been working [1015] with this system for God knows how long [1017] you know everything about this like it's [1018] it's not that bigman ass to have you [1020] just talk through those thoughts out [1021] loud right you realistically do it in [1024] like 10 15 20 minutes but the second and [1026] probably one of the most important [1027] issues is you get the chance to show off [1028] a little you also get the chance to [1030] shape the client perception like again [1033] you know automations are these ephemeral [1035] things that just exist in the cloud if [1036] you are here walking people through that [1038] automation you have the ability to turn [1040] it from something that's ephemeral [1042] ephemeral and you know virtual or [1044] whatever into something physical right [1046] you can constantly relate this back to [1047] Roi demonstrable um some type of like [1050] demonstrable savings or demonstrable [1052] Revenue uh you could talk about you know [1055] the complexities of the system you could [1056] treat yourself as an authority [1057] essentially and really sell yourself [1059] even more than you've already done um so [1061] I I highly recommend you guys record [1063] Loom Sops anywhere uh for any service [1066] that you do whether it's you know [1067] automation or any anything else that's [1068] technical it's obviously going to put [1070] you miles ahead of other service [1071] providers and then yeah you know it [1073] takes you like 20 minutes that's about [1074] it like it's super fast and easy to do [1076] realistically um and the cool thing is [1078] once you have a piece of loom [1080] documentation you can very easily turn [1082] this into other forms of documentation [1084] as well [1085] particularly text [1087] documentation the value here is not only [1092] have you just created a video so so you [1093] know if we go back a little bit like at [1095] the very beginning your first [1096] deliverable would have only been the [1098] system right but then you made a video [1099] documentation so now you have two [1101] deliverables instead and now what you're [1102] doing is you're literally just copying [1104] and pasting the loom transcript into gp4 [1107] or a large language model and you're [1108] saying hey turn this into a standard [1109] operating procedure in like 3 or 4 [1111] minutes you're turning the deliverables [1113] from two into three you're basically [1115] tripling the perceived value of this on [1116] the customer side of things and you're [1118] giving them more that they can [1119] touch feel hold uh and so on and so [1122] forth and so uh you know this is a [1124] reasonably simple prompt I'm not going [1125] to get super deep into the prompt [1127] engineering but I'm going to show you [1128] guys an example of what this might [1129] actually look like in practice just drag [1131] this puppy all the way over [1132] here what I did was I went to my loom [1135] video right and then let me just not [1139] make this other one full screen that way [1140] we can actually like jump through tabs [1142] and stuff okay great so I went to my [1144] loom video which is right over here and [1146] then you know I watched it back which [1148] took me I don't know like five minutes [1149] at 2x speed and while I was watching it [1152] what I did was I just took screenshots I [1154] just did this you know on Mac it's uh [1156] commands command shift or command [1158] control Shift 4 or something I literally [1160] did this and then I went back to GPT and [1163] then I pasted that image in and then I [1165] did this in three or four key areas that [1167] I think that uh you know like the person [1170] would need some visual help for in my [1171] documentation then I just said you are [1173] writing documentation for an automation [1175] system that manages whatever company I [1177] said cleaning company in this instance [1178] below is a transcript and several images [1180] from a video that we recently recorded [1181] convert these transcripts and images [1182] into a piece of text documentation use [1184] markdown ATX formatting I then went to [1187] my loom video I clicked on the [1189] transcript button up here and then I [1190] clicked copy and then I just pasted it [1192] all in [1192] here and then what did we get at the end [1196] make money with make member count [1197] scraper documentation over review this [1199] documentation outlines the functionality [1200] blah blah blah blah blah right here we [1202] have our whole documentation basically [1204] it's extraordinarily simple for us to do [1207] and as you could see um you know we [1210] essentially if I just go to docs. new we [1213] essentially can just copy and paste this [1214] whole thing and they just have like a [1215] nicely formatted thing so hold on a [1219] second I think the reason why this isn't [1220] working uh you should just be able to [1221] copy and paste this in I think the [1223] reason why I couldn't do that there is [1224] because I disabled markdown or something [1228] no I guess I didn't let's go back here [1232] and then let's just [1234] copy this whole [1237] thing starting from the very [1239] top give that a [1243] copy and then give that a [1251] paste there we go okay great um so now [1254] we have basically like a full Google doc [1256] that's up and running ready to go looks [1258] really sexy you know even includes some [1260] formatting with the the URLs and stuff [1262] like this and just walks people through [1264] what to do and then uh you know I've [1266] experimented with having it output [1268] images as well um unfortunately I think [1270] Claude could do this I don't think that [1272] chat GPT 40 can do this or perhaps I was [1275] experimenting with um uh like the API [1278] version but what you can do is because [1279] you just included all these images in [1280] your prompt you can actually just copy [1282] these and then just paste these directly [1284] in so very simple you know as you can [1286] see this just takes a couple of add [1289] seconds so I'm going to go [1293] here then I'm going to go over here I'm [1296] going to feed in I don't [1299] know let's just feed in this image [1304] here uh let's do this one [1309] here actually we should do this first [1313] that's probably higher quality probably [1315] makes more sense yeah [1320] great and you know now we have some [1322] images we have just going to copy this [1325] and paste this on the Rex [1329] part somebody's going to yell at me for [1331] saying redx again um now we have like a [1333] pretty high quality Tex stock that we [1335] can just include alongside the delivery [1338] in a templated email which I'll show you [1340] guys in a second so you know that took [1342] me I don't know two or three minutes I [1343] was obviously just pasting randomly [1345] might take you a full five so let's just [1347] go back here and not get myself in [1349] trouble [1351] here people always exaggerate on the [1353] internet um you know this might have [1355] taken you let's say 15 or 20 that might [1357] have taken you five realistically you've [1358] spent less than half an hour but you [1360] tripled the number of deliverables that [1361] the client is going to get and not only [1362] are they going to appreciate it but [1364] they're going to be very impressed which [1366] is the perfect opportunity for us to get [1368] into actually thinking like okay you [1370] know if they're super impressed in a [1371] perfect world what more can I get from [1373] them what more do I want from them and [1374] what you probably want from them if [1376] you're in the automation industry anyway [1377] is you want to retain some kind you want [1379] some typee of subscription billing model [1380] some long-term upsell uh that allows you [1383] to work with this person not just on [1385] this one project which you know might [1386] have given you a tangible Roi but we [1388] want to talk you know months or years in [1389] the future but consistently over time [1393] generating some type of mrr that you [1394] know you can depend on and then you can [1396] ultimately use to build revenue [1397] stability and and build the rest of your [1399] business so at this point you are [1401] delivering a high quality completed [1402] project you're also delivering detailed [1404] video docs and training and then [1405] detailed text docs and training this is [1407] crazy they're getting three things here [1409] for the price of one in contrast to what [1410] most service providers do which is they [1412] just only ever do this you're going [1415] above and beyond this and you're giving [1417] them three deliverables for a few [1419] moments of extra work on your end half [1420] an hour if you spent five hours to build [1422] the system you spend an additional 30 [1424] minutes at the end doing all this stuff [1426] um you know you're doing what's that uh [1429] 5.5 I don't know 10% or something more [1431] work for like three times the results [1434] this is the time to upsell now what I [1436] personally do is I don't like try and [1438] sell my customer or client really hard [1440] I'm I'm pretty soft about this if I'm [1442] honest and I like to think that like I [1443] buy myself a lot of Goodwill with this [1445] and this is why I've been a successful [1446] as I have there are a lot of people out [1448] there that are like hard sales you know [1449] they'll probably recommend that you do a [1451] delivery on a call or something and then [1453] you try and bring this stuff up with [1454] them I've always thought personally that [1456] that's like high pressure sales and I I [1458] used to do a lot of that stuff way back [1459] in the day and always just had a sour [1460] taste in my mouth so personally what i' [1462] do is I just try and just make the most [1464] sense possible and then I try and just [1466] give them really good over an Emil [1469] peque their interest and then try and [1470] get them on a call to to chat about a [1472] retainer or or something of that nature [1474] the way that I do it is I will frame [1477] this in terms of client Roi I'll say [1479] something like hey I think that you [1480] might be able to make an additional 10% [1482] here I think I might be able to bump you [1483] up by another $20,000 a month there and [1486] then I say a simple three bullet point [1487] snippet along with estimated returns I [1489] then take that and then I include it in [1491] our next step and you know it's hard for [1493] me to really make this work without [1494] showing you this template so I'm just [1495] going to show you what this might [1497] actually look like I'd also like to [1499] discuss that retainer I see no reason [1500] why I can't add 5% or more on your [1502] margins with a few changes I'd need a [1503] bit more context to this effectively but [1505] here's what I'd look to do in the next [1506] few weeks number one I'd like to build [1508] out a dashboard that does this number [1509] two I'd like to create a streamlineed [1511] work management system for you that does [1512] that number three I want to do something [1514] that does that you know if you could [1516] scale past 250k a month with 35% margins [1518] we' need to make some some tweaks you [1520] know they sort of do the math and [1521] they're like holy this guy could [1522] make me a lot of money so obviously [1524] you're going to need to understand what [1526] the client business is in order to make [1527] this work [1528] um but that's what the whole [1529] consultative sales side is really like [1531] you're getting to know them during that [1533] sales pitch and uh during that sales [1535] call the Disco call and then you're [1536] getting to know their business over the [1537] course of your project you're getting to [1539] learn through their systems you're [1540] getting to poke around their crms you're [1542] you're essentially getting to see what [1543] they're missing and where you can fill [1545] that Gap as an automation engineer um [1548] whether you're an agency or freelancer [1549] whatever you have a ton of value you [1552] know after you've worked with two or [1553] three businesses because you could [1554] literally just look at like business a [1555] and be like huh business a is doing that [1557] that wrong like that just looks [1559] really ineffective then you start [1560] working with business B and you're like [1561] huh business B is doing a really good [1562] job with that part I wonder if I just [1564] like took some of the elements of [1566] business b or the systems I'm creating [1567] for busb and applied them to Busa I [1568] wonder if they'd make more money a lot [1570] of the time you will um so the sort of [1572] sharing and like building your template [1574] base and consultant knowledge base can [1575] be really valuable and a lot of people [1577] just need like a simple uh bullet point [1580] uh sort of thing in order to be like [1581] holy yeah you know what I can do [1582] that and it is willing to spend money on [1584] I am willing to spend money on this okay [1587] now in terms of what this looks like um [1589] the last step or the second last step is [1590] to send a templated delivery email at [1592] this point you know as I mentioned we [1594] have these three features we have the [1596] high quality completed project the [1597] detailed video docs the detailed text [1599] docks now it's really just time to tie [1602] all the stuff up together in a nice bow [1603] and then just like present it to the [1605] customer so I just have a pre-created [1607] template that I make a few modifications [1609] on you can just save this and make this [1610] like a Gmail template or you can find a [1611] way to automate this completely I [1613] automated this uh a little while ago but [1615] then I found that even if the automation [1618] did it like way faster and it was like [1620] pretty good quality I just wanted I [1622] wanted the ability to make a few minor [1624] little changes that the automation just [1625] couldn't really do like AI would [1627] struggle with so I personally send these [1629] myself as as I mentioned you know it [1631] uses a template it takes me like 10 [1632] minutes and this is another really high [1633] Roi 10 minutes to spend um before I do [1636] this I do make sure that my client has [1637] access to everything that they need I [1639] think that's really important not a lot [1640] of people talk about this but I don't [1642] want my client to feel like pressured I [1645] don't want them to think that they need [1646] to keep working with me in order for [1647] their system to continue running or in [1649] order for me to maintain it if that was [1651] the promise in the contract they don't [1653] um I want them to be able to make a [1654] decision from like a p a place of [1656] strength and from a place of like cost [1657] benefit as opposed to fear um and I [1659] think I think that's really important um [1661] I don't know if everybody agrees with me [1664] on that and I think you know you could [1665] be all Mach ellan and be strategic and [1667]  about it and fine whatever but [1669] generally speaking I've bought a lot of [1670] Goodwill with this approach and it's [1671] worked really well for me so that's what [1673] I do I'll make sure that they have all [1674] the creds and everything like that but [1675] after they do um then I move into uh [1678] template so you can swap out whatever [1680] bolded sections you want here I've just [1682] um I've actually like included a real [1683] one that I sent to somebody and then I [1685] just made a few tweaks for anonymity [1686] purposes but you know our blank name is [1689] ready so maybe our CRM system is ready [1691] had a lot of fun working on this and [1692] hope you enjoy it as much as I did two [1694] things this is where you claim your wins [1696] I recorded a detailed video breaking the [1698] system down that you can use as both [1699] documentation and training material [1701] there's a technical section which covers [1702] how to modify the system if needed and a [1704] more General system to show users on [1705] your team how to use it in practice [1707] number two too I also put together a [1709] comprehensive Google doc just so you had [1710] something in both video and text format [1712] this is where we're going to be putting [1713] our links by the way regarding payment [1716] and this is really important a lot of [1717] people forget to ask for money you [1719] should always be asking for money no [1721] matter what um even if the system is not [1723] entirely what you what you wanted or [1725] doesn't conform to the specifications [1727] you should at least make the ask for the [1728] money um otherwise clients aren't going [1730] to take it seriously nobody's really [1731] going to want to make sure that you get [1732] paid so in this case this is a project [1734] that I did on upwork I talk a lot about [1736] upwork on my channel and in my [1738] communities CU I think it's the easiest [1739] way for somebody to get their first two [1740] or three customers with zero experience [1743] zero client management skills zero idea [1744] where to start um but back in the day I [1746] was using this with an upwork contract [1749] and one thing that's really important [1750] upwork is making sure that when they [1752] finish when you finish a project you get [1754] a high quality review because that [1755] review is basically like SEO and cro for [1758] your profile so regarding payment I [1760] submitted a milestone on upw please [1761] accept after you've had a chance to [1763] check it out and then close the contract [1765] plus leave a written review if you think [1767] I did a good job [1768] this is really important because I'm [1769] assuming the win and that's what this [1771] template does it just assumes that [1772] everything is going to be good I'm going [1775] to talk about how to minimize the [1776] likelihood of a revision request in The [1777] Next Step but I find that this in [1779] practice is crucial and then down here [1782] is where I make that ask that we talked [1783] about I'm just in that last step and I [1785] cannot for the life of me draw a square [1788] I think the shape detection even was [1789] like what the hell are you doing man [1792] okay there we go um this is where I [1794] bring up the retainer and this is where [1795] I actually talk about Roi I'll say I see [1797] no reason why can't add this much money [1798] or more to your margin with a few [1799] changes I need a bit more context blah [1801] blah so uh the reason why this is really [1804] valuable is because if you think about [1805] it this is a single email that can make [1808] me $5,000 more dollars this year it's a [1810] single email that can increase the [1813] likelihood of a a uh retention or [1815] something by like four or five times [1817] it's a single email that essentially [1820] takes all of this hard work that I've [1822] done you know that might this is like [1824] the engine of a car and then it wraps it [1826] in the sexiest Ferrari chassis or [1829] whatever you've you've ever seen do you [1831] know what I mean it we're buffing the [1833] paint here we're making this look as [1834] beautiful as humanly possible we're [1836] squeezing as much value out of the work [1837] that we've already done and that's my [1839] approach to this client management stuff [1841] and this is my step-by-step framework [1842] all the time so yeah you know I'll [1844] assume the sale all the time I'll say [1847] you know we can chat about this on a [1848] call let me know if that works here's a [1849] calendar if you want me to book on yours [1850] just send it over thanks again can me [1851] post if you need anything you guys can [1853] copy and paste this I'm going to include [1854] this wiic Co link down below so you guys [1856] could literally just take all the text [1857] that want here and use it for your own [1859] business um feel free but after that [1861] step uh we get into probably one of the [1864] more important parts of this and one [1865] area that I think a lot of beginners [1866] struggle with which is you know Nick [1868] what about revisions what do I do when [1869] the client asks for changes should I [1871] charge them should I not charge them [1873] what the hell is the deal here well a [1876] truth in any service-based industry is [1877] that clients will almost always want at [1879] least one revision people don't like [1881] talking about this because obviously it [1883] eats into the perfect view of like oh [1885] like I I made $2,000 in five minutes [1887] right but the truth is clients almost [1890] always want some form of revision I'd [1892] say probably over 70% of the time I get [1894] a revision request like there is the odd [1896] situation typically with people that [1898] I've worked with for a longer time that [1900] you know just get the project and [1901] they're like this is amazing thank you [1902] very much we're done here's $5 million [1905] well I haven't had a situation like that [1906] yet but if you want to be my [1908] first anywh who the other 70% of the [1911] time right um yeah so 30% of the time [1914] they say the other 70% of the time they [1916] want some type of change they like hey [1917] this is amazing [1918] just had a quick thought do you mind [1919] changing this thing to that thing or you [1922] know like we just over the course of the [1923] last couple weeks we've been changing [1925] our file sorting procedures so do you [1927] mind just updating the Google Drive [1928] structure or hey do you mind changing [1930] out this software platform for that [1931] software platform and most of the time [1933] these revisions are pretty minor right [1935] if the client likes you and if you just [1936] wowed the hell out of them with all of [1938] this like this acts as like a [1941] vaccine it's like inoculation against [1943] somebody asking for revisions because [1945] they're like Jesus Christ did this guy [1947] do a lot of work for me my God meanwhile [1950] you only spend an extra 20 30 minutes [1951] but they don't know that so [1953] realistically it's really not that much [1954] work um here are my rules of thumb for [1956] revisions and this is personally what I [1957] do to minimize the likelihood of them [1959] coming up and to uh you know like [1961] streamline my project as much as [1963] possible number one is I'll always take [1965] at least 24 hours to [1967] deliver this sounds interesting the [1969] reason why is because I found that when [1972] I did revisions as quickly as possible [1973] when I was first starting out you know [1975] somebody'd be like hey can you change [1976] this be like oh sure you can me 15 [1978] minutes I change it I hand it back there [1980] was a much higher likelihood that they [1982] would ask for another revision [1983] afterwards so that's that's one [1986] thing the second thing which I didn't [1988] mention here was a lot of the time [1990] clients will have multiple revisions [1992] that they want they'll look at something [1993] they'll be like this is a great system [1995] great I just want one little change let [1996] me send that off to Nick and then an [1998] hour later they'll be like you know what [1999] I had another little change I want and [2000] then they'll send that off again so in [2002] this way I don't have to change the [2004] project deliver it again have the [2006] revision request come in again have [2007] change your project deliver it again [2009] right I can just batch those two and [2011] again it's usually like 5 10 15 minute [2013] little fix here and this enables me to [2015] to send the stuff back much faster and [2017] more efficiently and then three the [2019] value here is if you do this and it [2021] takes a day you know clients generally [2024] want their systems up and running right [2026] like you committed to a schedule for a [2027] reason so if you show them that like hey [2029] you know these revisions that you're [2029] asking for they aren't trivial they take [2030] a little bit of time so you know I'll [2032] deliver this in like 24 hours or so I [2034] don't say that but I say hey yeah sure [2035] you know I'm happy to do this for you [2036] it's going to take me maybe one or two [2038] business days to deliver um you know [2040] clients tend to brush off a lot of the [2042] smaller they don't really care [2043] about and they think well you know I [2044] want this business I want the system up [2046] and running more than I really want like [2047] the font color on this thing change so [2049] never mind it's okay we'll just move [2050] ahead you can make that change whenever [2051] you want so that typically helps um and [2054] then also you know if it takes me a day [2056] as opposed to five minutes right they're [2058] more likely to think okay well this [2059] actually took actually took a fair [2061] amount of time and energy like I can't [2062] exactly squeeze Nick like a like a wet [2064] rag um yeah you know so [2068] it it helps it's a good I guess from [2070] both perspectives both like an Roi [2072] perspective for the client but also like [2073] a decency perspective a lot of the time [2075] you know they great to respect you and [2076] like you when you know everything about [2078] their business and offer real tangible [2080] advice um the other big rule of thumb [2082] that a lot of people talk about is I [2084] will never explicitly ask for um [2087] revision requests I'll never say hey do [2089] you have any revision requests I think [2090] that that's just really silly um it's [2092] not because I'm not happy to do the [2093] revision well I'm not happy to do the [2095] revision request first of all just cut [2097] that out obviously I don't want [2098] to do revision requests I mean I just [2099] did the system exactly like you asked [2101] and I'm amazing so it should be great [2102] right but what I'm trying to say is you [2106] know I'm I'm okay doing them if it leads [2108] to a higher likelihood of me getting [2110] some retained contract later on and then [2112] me making a large multiple on my time [2114] but I don't want to make it really easy [2116] for them I prefer to make it a little [2117] bit more difficult for them so instead [2119] of me saying hey how's it going um do [2121] you like the project is everything okay [2124] right like um you know can I change [2126] anything to make this even better for [2128] you I don't do that I'll just always [2129] assume that it's good I'll assume that [2132] they're willing to pay that invoice I'm [2133] assuming that we're going to wrap [2135] everything up and I'll use language like [2136] this if that sounds good to you let me [2137] know and we'll wrap this one up or I'll [2139] say um you know if there's nothing else [2141] then let me know if you have any trouble [2142] paying the invoice or or something of [2143] that nature so I will Almost Never say [2146] this because I just don't want them to [2147] feel like they have to use their [2149] revision privileges I don't want them to [2150] think well like h i mean the system is [2152] great yeah and like I would have been [2153] fine with it but I guess Nick wants me [2154] to make a revision request or something [2156] I I don't want any of that I'd prefer [2158] that we just don't do revisions at all [2159] if I don't have to because obviously you [2161] know that's my time that we're talking [2162] about so that's how I handle revisions [2165] and then uh yeah that last step here [2167] project delivered right if you've [2168] followed every step that I've talked [2170] about here your service delivery is now [2171] better than the overwhelming majority of [2174] not just automation agencies but like [2175] any business right God you could apply [2178] the same tips that I'm talking about [2179] here to like a landscaping company and [2181] your Landscaping retention uh you know [2184] on future projects and stuff would go [2185] way the hell up um you can use this in [2188] literally any industry you want and you [2189] can crush and I'm not saying that just [2191] to toot my own horn but because I [2192] actually used the same approach in a [2193] number of different Industries and it [2195] has crushed so highly recommend you guys [2198] take that in stride um just going to [2200] double check and see if I'm missing [2202] anything at all here I don't believe so [2204] if anybody has any questions about this [2205] feel free to let me know but thanks so [2207] much for watching the video um more than [2208] happy to help just drop a comment down [2210] with the next video idea you like I'm [2212] pretty sure I sourced this from a [2213] comment that I got like three or four [2214] weeks ago so so you guys can see I'm [2215] just working my way through that Quee uh [2217] otherwise thank you very much for [2219] watching like subscribe do all that fun [2221] stuff to pump this automation agency [2222] Channel up

Title: How to Scale to $100K WITHOUT Hiring People (Step-by-Step)
[0] what is going on everybody Nick here a [1] few years back I scaled a Content [2] writing company to 92k a month with 16 [5] staff members then I scaled an [6] automation business a 72k a month with [8] two staff members and now I run a [10] blended Automation and info product [11] business that does over 100k a month [13] solo so naturally I've learned quite a [15] bit about how to scale a business [17] without necessarily adding to the [18] headcount and that's what I want to talk [20] about in this video I want to give you [21] guys a simple four-step framework you [23] can use to scale any digital business [25] without having to hire more people in [27] this video you're going to learn about [29] Revenue cealing and how to maximize [31] Revenue per staff member you're going to [32] learn about productization including how [34] to break down any deliverable into [36] components and my personal approach for [38] that I'm going to teach you automation [39] how to use machines to do your work [41] instead of people then we're going to [43] talk a little bit about distribution or [44] how to multiply your reach per unit time [46] invested and lastly I'm going to run you [48] through a few scalable business models [50] including how to pick ones that [51] naturally let you grow without adding [53] headcount if that sounds interesting to [54] you guys stay tuned and let's get into [56] it all right couple things I'm going to [57] show you in this video I have a couple [58] diagrams I have a slideshow I'm gonna [60] walk you through it step by step but [62] just before I get into it I have to add [63] my usual disclaimer this is just what's [65] worked for me I'm not necessarily trying [67] to prescribe anything for you if I was a [69] Discerning viewer of the nixar [72] Cornucopia of YouTube content I would [74] take whatever makes sense to me and then [76] discard the rest I'm not going to do any [77] gatekeeping I'm just going to show you [78] everything that you need in order to do [80] the same that I did so how to scale [82] your business without adding staff I put [84] 100K a month here just because it's [85] clickbait but let's get into it so first [87] and foremost everybody thinks that you [88] need to hire to grow uh but my secret [92] sauce is that you don't the reason why [94] is because we are quickly entering an [95] era where if you properly configure your [98] tools and your business [101] infrastructure those alone can do the [103] work of dozens of people without you [105] needing to hire anyone so you can [107] absolutely scale your company without [109] adding a headcount or by adding a very [111] minimal amount of headcount in this [114] video we're going to cover that [114] four-step framework that shows you how [116] to do it I'm going to cover uh a revenue [118] ceiling a revenue per member first and [120] then I'm going to get into how exactly [121] to go about establishing this framework [123] and then carrying it out but this is the [124] same framework that is currently being [125] used by thousands of people myself [127] included to build high margin High [129] Revenue solo businesses usually in the [130] past you can't have to pick one right [132] either you were high revenue or you were [134] uh low Revenue high margin I will now [136] you can have both and there's no reason [137] why not so this applies to any digital [139] business if you're running a physical [140] business it's a little bit more limited [142] obviously because I don't know if you're [143] some hfat guy uh it's going to be [145] difficult to you know carry out the [147] step-by-step process that I'm laying out [149] in this video I'm not necessarily saying [150] that if you run a physical Services [152] business or a physical product business [153] that you can't Implement these I think [154] you certainly can you're just going to [155] have a harder time doing it and it's [157] going to be a little bit less effective [159] a concept that I want to cover just [160] before we get into things is that [162] software and artificial intelligence you [164] can kind of treat these as Force [165] multipliers these are very similar if [167] you guys like think back to uh I don't [169] know if you guys learned this in high [170] school I guess it depends on where you [171] are but like the force multipliers in in [173] engineering like a lever right a lever [175] is a force multiplier or a screw is a [177] force multiplier a wheel is uh in effort [181] in essence some some type of Leverage [183] well software and AI do the same thing [185] except instead of it being in the [186] physical world it's kind of in the [187] virtual world and essentially they allow [189] one person to provide the output of many [191] people so your goal in scaling your [193] business and implementing what I'm about [194] to show you is to increase the ceiling [197] Revenue that a single person can manage [199] what I mean by that is if a single [201] person currently in your business can [202] manage maybe $5,000 or so if you [205] implement the tips I'm going to show you [206] we'll be able to get that higher to [208] maybe 25,000 ,000 50,000 [211] 100,000 in addition hiring people [213] includes many hidden costs and risks [216] that usually aren't talked about right [218] you have tons of issues with hiring [220] especially if you're looking to hire [221] employees like onshore employees and [224] especially if you are in places where [226] legislation just just makes that really [227] difficult right I don't want to be super [229] evil capitalist or anything like that [230] but I'm sure most of the people watching [231] this are business owners so uh you know [234] I'm sure yall feel me when you know you [236] have to deal with like certain [237] probationary periods sometimes you deal [240] with unions you have to deal with like [241] termination pay you have to do [242] onboarding uh there's a certain number [244] of sick days you have to take you have [246] to give to staff members obviously you [247] have some base compensation rules and [249] whatnot well the really cool thing is [251] software and machines they don't require [253] any of that and Ne that ises your [254] business infrastructure so there's near [256] zero onboarding cost there's near zero [258] training cost there's near zero legal [260] costs right uh I mean aside from [262] clicking a terms and service button and [263] maybe some I don't know very unlikely [266] disastrous things that occur with data [268] realistically you don't have to do with [269] 99.9% of the you have to deal [271] with when hiring people and that's [272] that's my inspiration behind this that's [274] the inspiration behind the framework and [275] why I'm running my business the way that [276] I am and then my last point is even if [279] you do eventually have to hire why not [281] just set your business up in such a way [283] that enables you to scale as much as you [284] can before you do so so that when [286] somebody eventually does come in well [288] guess what now you know you don't have [290] to hire 20 people you can just hire one [292] right you can pay a lot less money that [295] person has hyper leverage you can do way [296] more with it um this is more or less my [298] mindset and the reason why I'm telling [299] this at the beginning of the video just [301] so that we're all on the same page here [302] I don't want anybody being like Nick [303] what the hell why wouldn't you hire [305] people why would you get a machine to do [307] the work um well this is why right here [310] okay so the very first and probably the [311] most important concept that we have to [312] learn in order for the Restless to make [314] sense is the revenue per staff member [318] I've talked about this before in my [319] videos and I've called this Revenue per [320] employee or rpe this is a pretty [323] standard metric in like business [325] analysis basically these analysts and [327] these Consultants come in and then they [329] count your total revenue for the year [331] usually and then the total number of [333] employees at your company and they just [335] divide the total revenue say million [337] dollars by the total number of employees [339] which is I don't know 100 and then they [340] figure out the uh I don't know the [342] revenue per staff member which is [344] $110,000 $10,000 per year per staff [346] member is and if your company is [348] you know an rpe of that then obviously [350] you're doing something wrong unless [351] you're at like some I guess startup and [353] you're not making any money but you're [355] fundraising or whatnot but I'm I'm I'm [356] assuming none of you guys run startups [358] here I'm assuming we're all just like [359] bootstrapping agencies or service [361] businesses so I'm taking this one step [363] further and I'm calling this a revenue [364] per staff member just because this [366] reflects I think a little bit better the [367] modern hiring environment we're not all [369] hiring employees anymore we hire uh [371] contractors sometimes we hire like uh I [374] don't know like Flex workers sometimes [376] we have vas and stuff like that this is [379] just a more comprehensive term that I'm [382] just taking to mean like the total [383] number of people in your business that [384] you interact with on a regular basis um [387] or sorry the revenue of your company [388] divided by the total number of people [390] that you interact with on a regular [391] basis now if you're a solopreneur like [393] me you can also think of this as how [395] much economic value alone can I create [399] right with just myself before I add [400] anybody else to my business and this is [402] important for me because I'm I'm always [404] trying to optimize this and this is [405] where systems and tools artificial [407] intelligence and the software approaches [408] I'm going to talk about in a minute get [410] into this is typically the way that most [412] businesses work like most people will [414] begin service businesses organically [416] right let's say you start I don't know [418] you start like doing some design you're [420] a great designer you've worked at a [421] bunch of other agencies or something [422] you're like you know what I don't get [423] paid enough of this goddamn company I'm [425] going to Branch out on my own and I'm [427] going to become my own designer and make [428] way more money so you're you're a [430] specialist right naturally you're going [432] to do the vast majority of the work [433] yourself because that's sort of like [435] your key value prop it's like hey I'm [436] amazing at this and I'm going to deal [438] with you personally and I'm going to [439] take care of it fast I'm going to low [441] turnaround times right this is sort of [442] like the way that a freelancer um starts [445] becoming an agency in scale So [447] eventually you hit a point where you're [448] juggling so much that you get [450] diminishing returns on any additional [451] time that you spend so naturally you [454] know you see a bunch of business gurus [455] talking about this all the time [456] they're like higher higher hire delegate [458] delegate delegate you're like all right [459] cool why don't I delegate my work then [461] that's kind of The Next Step that I have [462] to take in order to grow now if you [465] think about it up until this point the [466] amount of money that a single specialist [469] can handle in a company is and this is a [471] very high estimate here but maybe it's [473] $15,000 or $20,000 per month like if you [476] got your together you already [477] understand some of these systems you lay [478] out your work in like an efficient way [480] maybe at the high end you can make like [482] 15 grand 20 grand a month and that's [484] with like great products great services [486] and that's also with you working [487] yourself like a dog this is the [489] definition of working for yourself being [491] self-employed you know you're doing [492] you're doing a ton arduously uh you're [495] you're working some incredible hours so [496] you're at 15 let's just say you're at [498] $20,000 a month just for simplicity's [499] purpose okay but then you hire somebody [502] and maybe you hire like some designer or [503] something like help you out with some [504] work well now what you've done is you've [506] taken your Revenue per staff member [507] which was previously you know that 15 [509] $20,000 and you've divided it by two [512] okay so now your RPS is half now the [515] reason why you hired is logically you [516] were like well I can only do $5 or [518] $20,000 of work myself so maybe if I [519] hire somebody else I'll be able to do 30 [521] or $40,000 of work right but the [523] unfortunate thing is you are rarely able [526] to scale to twice your size by hiring [529] twice as many people and i' i' I'd go as [531] far as to say that's almost like a rule [533] of service businesses with every [535] individual person you add and I'm going [537] to show you guys this in a second but [539] with every individual person you add [540] your Revenue per staff member tends to [542] go down and there are a couple reasons [543] for that so you know think about it you [546] scale your agency and now you're making [547] $60,000 a month right you got five hires [549] you got a couple designers maybe you [551] have some marketing guy to help you out [552] maybe you have a salesperson and you [554] know maybe a few more people and then [555] you and you might be making $60,000 a [557] month but just do the math at $60,000 a [559] month if you divide that by the total [560] number of people working in your company [562] when other Revenue per staff member has [563] gone down from uh you know what it was [565] before let's say 15 or 20K to $112,000 [569] which is I mean that's almost like half [570] the RPS right so the goal here is [573] obviously to maximize our RPS what's the [577] solution to do it and how can you do so [578] and I have sort of like a two-pronged [580] approach the first is is systems and the [582] second is software and both systems and [584] software have laid out intelligently [585] will allow you to increase your Revenue [587] ceiling and then you as an individual [589] before you get to the point where you're [590] thinking of hiring right instead of you [591] hitting that camp of 15 20K a month [594] you're making good money but you're [595] being worked like a dog maybe you can [596] make3 or $40,000 a month and then maybe [598] instead of you being work like a dog you [600] can work at half capacity if I'm being [602] honest this is what the vast majority of [603] people that are probably watching my [604] content right now want you want to have [606] a super high income without necessarily [609] having to compromise in your lifestyle [610] too much you but you also want to be [612] good at what you do and you want to be [613] able to provide like a great service [615] right you want to be able to provide [616] security for your family you want to be [617] able to I don't know get the latest [618] Apple watch or whatever the hell uh but [621] you know you don't necessarily you don't [623] necessarily want to do so um strung out [625] with 20 employees that you're managing [627] you know under an incredible amount of [629] stress stress so you know the solar [630] preneur lifestyle for me uh is is super [634] high Roi personally and you know I I've [636] implemented systems that I'm about to [637] show you that have enabled me to do this [639] okay so just before we proceed let me [640] just like kind of let let me just show [642] you what the I guess relationship looks [644] like between the size of an agency and [646] then your Revenue per staff member [647] generally speaking so let's pretend that [650] you are starting at the start line here [652] your Revenue per staff member is pretty [654] high okay you are I don't know can I [656] draw on this puppy oh hell yeah I can [658] draw on this puppy I don't like how this [660] like automatically turns into a circle [663] though all right whatever um anyway so [665] at the very top here your Revenue per [667] staff memb is pretty big right the [669] second that you make that first hire it [671] starts plummeting the reason why it [672] starts plummeting is well now that you [675] have another person you can't contain [676] all of the work in your head anymore [679] there's some information that you know [680] that your staff member doesn't know and [682] so you need to communicate that well [684] guess what any time spent communicating [685] is time spent not doing the thing and so [688] you started ating communication costs [691] that's number one number two because of [693] these communication costs and because of [695] miscommunications you substantially [697] improve or increase rather uh the number [700] of uh mistakes that you're making okay [703] you're no longer uh you know like the [704] sole service professional this person [706] might not know everything that you know [708] right so now you have some mistakes in [709] place in addition one thing that I [710] didn't mention here was you also have to [713] do training right if you want this [715] person to learn your process as well as [717] you know it or be able to replicate it [719] to some some reasonable percentage maybe [720] 80% well you need to train them and any [722] time spent training them is time not [724] spent doing the work right so uh in [726] addition to that you have like some [727] group think in larger companies larger [729] companies tend to be able to make less [731] ideal decisions simply because of a [732] human bias known as group think where we [734] tend to agree with decisions for [736] appearance more so than for uh you know [739] correctness um and then you know there [740] are also some social issues sometimes [742] Betty at the front desk hates Stephanie [744] in the back or some or Tom is angry [746] at [748] Jerry uh anyway the point that I'm [749] making is every single additional staff [751] member you hire you're going to have [753] some issues right and your RPS is going [755] to go down because less a smaller [757] fraction of the total time of every [758] single person in total mental effort is [760] going to be spent actually delivering [761] the service that provides you money so I [764] say that sort of Platos here well that's [765] just because you know the marginal [767] additional person at the at an agency [769] size of I don't know like 100 plus um [771] you know the effect in your RPS becomes [772] really really small but I don't know [773] maybe it still goes down just a tiny bit [775] um and you can imagine this sort of just [777] proceeding for Infinity [780] so I I show that to you just so you [781] understand the factors of play here and [782] so you understand why we should get away [784] from hiring people being our first [786] solution to you know constraint issues [788] and we should focus instead on this [790] four-step framework I'm going to start [793] us off with step number one which is [794] productizing what you can and then [797] noting what you can we're going to take [799] the stuff that you can we're going to [800] move to the next step I've added some [803] Revenue sealing estimates here these are [805] totally rough I mean you know these are [806] just based off of my uh experience in [808] agency genes I've worked with obviously [810] several designate well I guess now over [811] a thousand agencies if you can all my [813] communities so I I tend to know what the [814] revenue ceilings of agencies are are [816] sort of intuitively um I'm saying 20 to [819] $30,000 a month per person if you [821] productize your operations effectively [823] and I also I'm going to provide a quick [824] example of businesses that I think have [826] done a really good job of this um and [828] the the business here that I'm going to [830] talk about is Fat Joe so these guys are [831] like an SEO platform they provide tons [834] of services I mean if we just go down [835] here you guys will see link building [837] digital PR SEO content writing design [839] Nvidia blogger Outreach PR campaigns [840] Niche edits um I'm friends with the with [843] the founder and essentially the reason I [845] bring this up is because these guys have [846] done a fantastic job at at at building a [849] business around this principle that I'm [851] about to talk about which is [852] productization if you want you know uh [855] uh link Building Services or SEO [858] services from [859] them they know in advance exactly what [863] margin exactly what percentage they're [865] going to make on this they have [866] checklists over checklists of every step [869] involved in that link building process [872] and they could basically at this point [874] hand off that job to a monkey and it's [876] so granular and so step by step that [878] that monkey would still probably do a [880] pretty reasonable job I'm not I'm not [881] saying they staff members or monkeys [883] anything I'm just saying that they're [884] very very good at designing the [886] infrastructure behind a productized [887] business so um productization if I just [890] zoom out a little bit is just breaking [892] down what your business does into [893] concrete deliverables okay deliverables [895] are what the customer or client sees not [897] necessarily what goes into it but just [898] like the actual end result um and then [901] what you do is you take these [902] deliverables then you break those [903] deliverables a little bit further down [905] into the steps needed to produce them [906] and then once you have those steps then [908] you can break them further down into [909] little checklist items once you have [910] those checklist items you can break them [911] further down into inputs and outputs so [913] here's a quick example of how you might [915] producti a simple marketing Services [917] Company okay let's say you run a [918] runof-the-mill marketing agency you [920] provide PDFs uh uh I don't know you [923] provide like PPC campaigns uh you [924] provide like marketing General like a [926] local marketing Services you provide [928] some type of like SEO anyway uh what you [931] do is you take those services and you [932] break them down in specific deliverables [933] what is it exactly that the customer is [935] getting they're getting a certain number [936] of links probably right just as the fcho [938] example showed a minute ago you're [940] probably giving them some reports you're [942] probably giving them maybe like a [943] website you're spinning up for them [945] maybe you're giving them some PPC [946] campaigns in their Google ads manager [947] right um basically take all of the [950] services that you're providing and then [951] break them down into their specific [953] deliverables the products that the [955] customer is basically buying from you [957] now once you have these Del Ables [959] deconstruct each deliverable into its [961] components quick example here is let's [963] say PPC campaign is one of your [964] deliverables this is in one of your [966] packages that you sell well if you think [967] about it logically like what is a PPC [969] campaign a PPC campaign is where you [972] take add copy and then add creative and [976] then you upload it to I don't know [978] Google ads manager or something like [979] that that's typically like like that's [982] the component that goes into the service [984] that you're providing right so if we [985] just if we just try and get a microscope [987] and we Zoom way in on that product [989] what goes into it are let's say three ad [991] creatives and three ad copy variants [992] hypothetically right however many ad [994] creatives or ad copy variants they are [996] what you do is you repeat this process [997] until you have all of the parts of the [999] entire service Suite that you're [1001] providing so if you think about it you [1003] know your ad copy right that deliverable [1005] or that component might have a couple [1007] components in and of itself maybe add [1009] creative or sorry add copy is composed [1010] of a headline and then it's composed of [1011] some body text right um and each of [1014] these may have some character limits so [1015] if you're doing Google maybe it's [1016] different than Facebook right you have [1018] to get very granular here in order to [1019] productize properly but the point is you [1021] are deconstructing what makes your [1023] business or your service tick once [1025] you've defined all of these explicitly [1027] what you do is you create a step-by-step [1029] guide or an sop standard operating [1031] procedure on how you would Define or how [1034] you would deliver this thing assuming [1036] that you had no knowledge assuming that [1037] you were basically just starting at the [1039] at the very start line the reason why [1040] you do it this way well it's TW fold I [1043] I'll talk about one of the reasons why [1045] which is because you can start [1046] automating it um but the reason why you [1048] do it this way is by assuming zero [1049] knowledge you start thinking and [1051] explicitly defining all the knowledge [1053] that goes into this thing and the second [1054] that you know that you start you [1056] basically lay out all the resources that [1057] you need uh to automate uh you know to [1060] to delegate more effectively to [1062] basically turn this whole thing on [1063] autopilot now is there something that [1065] you can't productize because sometimes [1067] there are things that you can't [1067] productize if something does require an [1070] incredible amount of knowhow if it's [1071] some deep business consultation or [1073] something like that if it requires a [1074] laborious number of personal hours [1076] sometimes you know you can't actually [1078] productize a service and that's okay all [1081] I want you to do is just make a note of [1082] what that is then move on to the next [1084] step so if you're watching this right [1086] now like I want you to get as much value [1087] out of what I'm talking about as humanly [1089] possible so if you run a business I [1091] highly encourage you to actually pause [1093] the video and at least just give it 30 [1095] seconds to a minute of thought run [1097] through the services that you're [1098] providing in your company and just say h [1100] okay so I do provide three or four [1102] Services how do I break those down into [1103] deliverables well I guess I provide I [1105] don't know SEO services so H that [1107] includes link building and then that [1108] includes some marketing report and then [1110] that includes some website cro what what [1112] what do each of those include I just [1114] want you to do this thought experiment [1116] because I was going to make this next [1116] step a lot more valuable if you don't [1118] yet run an agency or anything like that [1119] that's okay we can just move on right [1121] away but just keep this in mind as you [1122] are designing your products or Services [1123] it's going to make the rest of your life [1125] really easy like I wish I did this with [1127] my first couple agencies I would have [1128] crushed it and I would had to spend way [1130] less time and energy in it so step two [1133] is we have all of those producti you [1135] know steps right and then we have a [1136] couple things that we can't step two is [1139] well now we can automate all of those [1140] things that have those step-by-step [1141] guides and that are very clearly [1143] definable um and that you can do with [1145] zero knowledge and the things that we [1146] can't we're going to optimize [1148] productization by itself is already [1150] massive leverage but if you automate [1152] steps within the product and you don't [1154] have to automate all of it you can just [1155] automate specific steps right like in [1157] our ad copy example which I'm going to [1158] talk about uh maybe you can't automate [1161] the creative because your creative is [1162] just it's just a little too high quality [1164] for machines right now but you can [1165] certainly automate your ad copy right [1167] the only reason why you know that you [1168] can do do that is because you've since [1169] broken everything down into very [1171] specific deliverables um but now you [1173] know if you think about it if ad copies [1174] half the work ad creatives half the work [1176] you just automated half of that project [1178] right you've essentially doubled The [1179] Leverage you've doubled the revenue per [1182] employee or Revenue per staff member by [1184] automating 50% of that deliverable so I [1187] talk here about a revenue ceiling um at [1190] this point I'm saying it's about $50 to [1191] $100,000 per month per person a good [1193] example of this is design Joy now design [1195] Joy doesn't just automate everything I [1197] mean this is an actual designer but the [1199] way that he automates things and I think [1201] Brett makes like 100 to 140k a month so [1204] probably a little bit more money than I [1205] do um and he's a total solopreneur as [1207] well the way that he does things is he [1210] his automation is templates so he has a [1213] massive library of I imagine hundreds of [1216] highquality templates of every [1219] conceivable variation and when a client [1221] makes a request for a new design he [1223] thinks to himself hm what template is [1225] closest to what the client wants you [1227] know I've already spent all the time and [1228] effort building these templates their [1230] design is really clean the spacing is [1232] perfect I don't have to like ramp the [1233] freaking wheel here so let me just pick [1235] something that's really close then he [1236] picks a really really high quality [1238] template and the thing about this [1240] templating feature is the template is [1241] 80% of the way there right so that means [1243] that the distance that Brett has to [1245] travel between 80% and 100% that's just [1247] 20% if you think about it 100% divided [1251] by 20% that's 5x leverage so he just [1253] increased his revenue or his uh his [1255] Revenue per staff or his leverage by [1257] five times by using templates so you [1259] don't necessarily have to automate [1260] things in the traditional term I know a [1262] lot of my viewers are probably [1263] automation agencies or automation [1264] Freelancers uh but you know [1266] understanding uh the the principles here [1268] which is just leverage um you know goes [1270] a goes a long way so anywh who uh this [1272] is Brett's business as I mentioned he [1274] does a ton of money and the guy's pretty [1276] funny to follow on Twitter although I [1277] think recently he's gotten some spats [1279] which I may have had to temporarily mute [1280] him for but uh you can make a fair [1282] amount of money and your Revenue ceiling [1283] can be pretty high if you follow what [1285] I'm about to show you so here's another [1287] example of how to eyes or sorry how to [1289] automate the product eyes marketing [1291] services that we just generated in the [1292] previous step number one is we're going [1294] to take all the step-by-step guides you [1296] created before and the next thing is [1298] we're just going to ask ourself can a [1300] machine do 80% or more of this if [1303] properly instructed my rule is 80% or [1305] more I never try to do 100% because [1307] realistically machines can very rarely [1309] do 100% of your job right now they're [1311] quickly getting to the point where they [1312] can do 100% of small little things and [1314] eventually we'll piece those small [1316] little things together and get the big [1317] thing but right now you know 80% is [1319] sufficient for me and it's personally [1321] what I use to make you know over 100K [1322] per month so if it's good enough to make [1324] 100K per month you want to make 100K per [1325] month then odds are is probably good [1327] enough for you now if you're like most [1328] digital businesses the answer is yes you [1330] can do a ton at that 80% Mark um using [1333] our ad example you can totally automate [1334] the production of copy you can totally [1336] automate the production of headlines of [1338] body text you can automate the [1340] production of creatives at this point [1341] super easily whether it's through [1343] templating features or whether it's [1345] through uh I don't know like you you you [1347] have mid Journey or something spit out [1349] some beautiful looking sexy cool [1350] gradient that's branded right or maybe [1352] some assets maybe you create your own uh [1354] uh vectors or svgs or something the [1356] technology exists to do literally [1358] everything that I'm talking about here [1359] there might be somebody that's watching [1361] this video right now that runs a [1362] marketing agency that thinks wait a [1364] second I could automate literally 100% [1365] of this and then takes this and then [1367] uses it to build a product IED service [1369] then starts making a million dollars a [1370] month within a few months like the [1372] technology here is entirely is entirely [1374] at the point where you can automate the [1375] vast majority of it now it's also Poss [1378] possible that you know maybe you run a [1379] different service or something that's [1380] just a little bit more involved maybe [1382] because you're doing link building uh [1384] part of Link building involves the [1386] creation of a bunch of personal [1387] connections and maybe you need to have [1388] somebody managing your inbox or [1390] something and even if you use AI to [1392] draft up the responses there still [1393] technically needs to be a person there [1394] or whatever that's fine and that's why [1396] we want 80% rather than 100% maybe [1398] instead of doing the whole thing they [1400] just pre-draft your messaging or maybe [1402] they do like uh like like like an RD [1404] like a rough draft of your creative or [1407] maybe they send the first two or three [1409] emails in a sequence to your warm [1411] Network every time you get a new link [1412] building opportunity that you want to [1414] you know um um rank somebody on all of [1417] the stuff is still leverage the point [1419] that I'm making is just ask yourself how [1420] much time can I save if I construct the [1423] service a little bit differently than [1424] what I'm doing right now um you know if [1427] I look at all of these services with a [1428] fine- toothed comb if I peer through [1431] every single one how much further and [1432] how much more efficiently can I get and [1434] that's really what the step is for um [1436] and if a step is not automatable then [1438] just ask yourself how you might optimize [1440] it like for instance um you know I [1442] provide consultations and my [1444] consultations can be anywhere from like [1445] 15 minutes all the way up to an hour or [1447] so now I have been trying to reconstruct [1450] my consultations to take me less time [1452] and to be a lot more amendable for my [1454] customers and my clients because you [1455] know my calendar's starting to fill up [1457] um things are getting a little bit [1458] tougher I think on on both ends so I've [1460] started asking myself H is there a way [1462] that I Could reconstruct my [1463] consultations the other day I found a [1467] guy called Kristoff hman I don't know [1470] how to say his name who has a completely [1472] new take on consultations and I think [1473] this is a very good way for me to [1475] illustrate how even if you can't fully [1477] automate something you can streamline [1479] the hell out of it what this guy does is [1481] you know he's some Advanced Tax [1483] professional who I found when I was [1484] looking for some tax Consulting on my [1486] own what he does is he gives people [1490] consultations through voice [1492] messages what you do is you book a [1495] consultation via one of these purchase [1497] buttons then you send this guy Kristoff [1500] a message on Telegram and then you send [1502] him all of your questions in [1504] writing you can ask questions about all [1507] of these and the idea is you know if you [1510] really need help but don't have the [1511] financial resources to book a [1512] consultation for €2,000 or something you [1515] can get 80% of the value there with his [1518] voice message package where he just [1520] reads your question and then answers it [1522] for you via some sort of [1524] voicemail so you know like this is a [1527] great example of of a semi-product IED [1530] service obviously it still takes [1531] Kristoff's time to like take the phone [1533] and then and say it but think about all [1534] the problems that he eliminates here he [1536] completely eliminates uh time [1537] synchronicity like having to be in the [1539] same in the same at the same time [1541] calling a person both of you guys having [1543] to be there I mean he could go [1545] downstairs and walk to his car while [1546] answering a voice message and make 500 [1549] EUR right in I don't know how many [1551] minutes probably five or 10 minutes The [1552] Leverage on this is crazy sure this is [1554] still requiring his time but how much [1556] more time does it require to sit down [1558] and have that full hourong consultation [1560] versus what he's doing here now I should [1562] note that he also provides full hourlong [1563] consultations but you know these voice [1565] message packages with I don't know [1567] extended voice message package for 800 [1568] bucks uh ultimate voice message package [1571] for [1571] 9.97 and so on and so forth these are [1574] novel takes on something that people a [1576] lot of people just think that you cannot [1578] productize Well turns that you can um so [1580] I want you to take an approach similar [1582] to what Kristoff hurman did here where [1584] he asked himself hm you know I'm [1586] suffering from these problems this that [1588] I'm providing makes me money but isn't [1589] really scalable how could I improve my [1591] Revenue per staff member if I'm doing [1593] this solo right what if I do Messengers [1595] you know maybe then I can 5x my leverage [1597] and then I can make five times more and [1599] instead of me being stuck at 20 to 30k a [1601] month now I can go between 50 to 100K [1603] per month all right the third step that [1604] I'm going to talk about here is building [1606] automated Distribution Systems and to me [1608] this is the step that I'm currently on [1609] you know I've followed all of these all [1611] of these steps myself right I [1612] productized then I automated now I'm [1614] sort of building automated distributions [1616] tests myself and then eventually I'll do [1617] that fourth one as well [1618] um but for me this is this is hyper [1621] relevant because this is what I'm doing [1622] and it's also one of the highest [1623] leverage things that you can do um just [1625] look at the revenue multiples here right [1627] I think a single person can easily get [1628] to 100 to 250k per month a good example [1631] of the uh person that's doing this right [1632] now is Justin Welsh he is leveraging the [1635] hell out of automated Distribution [1636] Systems if you don't know what that [1637] means I'll cover it in a sec um in order [1639] to sell I think he runs like a like a $2 [1641] million maybe a three or4 million doar a [1644] year business now I'm completely solo so [1646] I think it's somewhere around the 250 C [1647] month mark another example is obviously [1649] me um with my [1651] automated two of me on the screen [1654] simultaneously that's a little too much [1655] um another good example this is me with [1657] like my automated distribution through [1659] my YouTube and so on and so forth so the [1662] value in automated Distribution Systems [1663] is like if you don't know what [1664] distribution is stick a step back [1665] distribution is your ability to put your [1667] product or service in front of other [1668] people so in a modern digital business [1670] if you want to scale your distribution [1672] without necessarily adding staff that [1674] means one of two things the first is [1676] Outreach systems so like automated cold [1678] Outreach where you distribute to [1680] hundreds of thousands of people per day [1683] with seemingly customized me messages [1685] without having to individually go [1687] through look the person up send them an [1689] email right um the value in this is [1691] whether you connect with 100 or 10,000 [1693] people your time investment is going to [1695] be the same this is sort of option one [1697] and this is something I talk about a lot [1698] on my channel but if you think about it [1700] a few months ago when I started my [1701] YouTube in Earnest I started posting all [1703] the time what I was really doing was I [1704] was doing number two which is where I [1706] was creating content like YouTube videos [1709] SEO articles and that sort of thing that [1712] do the same thing that cold Outreach [1713] does it's just they allow me to do it [1715] completely on autopilot which in my [1717] opinion is a little bit higher leverage [1718] now so you kind of have two choices you [1721] could do content systems or you could do [1722] Outreach the point is though any [1725] automated distribution system has value [1727] because the amount of time it takes to [1729] connect to one person or a thousand [1730] people is approximately the same like if [1732] I made this video and I've just been [1734] shouting to the void for the last half [1735] an hour or something like that and a [1736] single person saw it [1738] it would not take me any additional time [1740] if instead I had gone viral and 10 [1742] million people had saw it right my my my [1744] inputs are the same the outputs are [1746] completely variable and they can scale [1748] infinitely until all8 billion people um [1751] you know stare me deep in the eyes and [1752] listen to me Yap so yeah the point that [1755] I'm making is if you really want to grow [1757] substantially bigger than probably what [1761] most people would consider a high income [1762] which is somewhere between like 30 to [1764] maybe $50,000 a month if you want to [1765] grow even bigger than that you basically [1767] have to make use of automated [1768] Distribution Systems of some kind um [1770] those automated Distribution Systems [1772] might also be stuff like uh like like [1774] ads right I mean I talk here about [1776] content but you can also think of this [1777] like advertising uh the downside of that [1779] is although it is an automated [1780] distribution system you obviously have [1782] to make some Arbitrage or margin on the [1784] on the people that click through your ad [1785] and then convert to your offer versus [1786] the amount of money you're paying per [1787] click but you know you can think of it [1789] that way as well same sort of idea with [1792] cold Outreach right you are paying a [1793] certain amount for the mailboxes you're [1794] paying a certain amount for the leads [1796] the idea is you know arbitraging uh you [1798] know organic content is a little bit [1800] different because a lot of the time your [1801] investment is not necessarily money it's [1802] more so just the time uh and the knowhow [1805] um and you know that's that's what I've [1806] chosen to do here but you can easily [1808] scale to $100,000 to $250,000 per month [1811] per person and I firmly believe that [1813] like the next solo priner wave here is [1815] or the next wave really in business you [1817] know we had Indie hacking for a little [1818] while we had like build and public is [1820] going to be a solar printer wave of [1822] people making over six figure monthly [1823] revenues um through approaches like what [1825] I've talked about here it's going to be [1826] people that have productized their [1827] business businesses like I have people [1829] that have automated what they can and [1830] optimized what they haven't been able to [1832] and then people that build automated [1834] Distribution Systems that sort of just [1835] sell for them you know while they sleep [1837] like I will wake up a lot of the time to [1839] like stripe notifications saying people [1841] have purchased my product or service um [1843] you're very unlikely to get that without [1845] some sort of automated Outreach system [1847] or some sort of content or advertising [1849] funnel all right so this next step here [1852] I'm keeping purposefully vague because I [1854] have yet to get there and I don't [1856] consult with many people at this level [1857] myself but it's purposefully picking a [1860] scalable business model I know that [1862] you're probably thinking Nick why the [1863] hell are you putting this at the end as [1864] opposed to at the beginning and the [1866] reason why is because don't put the cart [1868] before the horse if that makes sense [1869] don't you know forget what you're doing [1872] this for odds are if you want to run a [1873] business and you're watching my content [1875] to help you do so you're doing it [1876] because you don't want to build the next [1878] Uber or necessarily fire up the next [1880] rocket ship SpaceX competitor to get to [1883] Uranus or something I could have picked [1884] Mars I picked Uranus uh you know you [1887] just you again again you want a [1888] sufficient amount of security you want [1890] to be able to uh you know enjoy various [1892] luxuries of life you want not to have to [1894] worry about like uh various inflation [1896] numbers or world events or anything like [1897] that and so if you if you started by [1900] picking a scalable business model the [1901] likelihood that you actually hit that [1904] level of wealth is a lot lower than if [1906] you pick something like a service agency [1909] um simply because there's a trade-off [1911] all the time and I think this is a good [1913] opportunity for me to whip open the [1915] Whimsical the tradeoff is basically [1918] you know if this is our little thing um [1923] scalability and short-term Revenue are [1927] both at odds so if you pick a business [1931] model that allows you to scale very big [1935] it will likely be more difficult for you [1937] to make short-term Revenue as a result [1940] let me reconstruct this and make this [1942] sideways [1943] instead and then let's put short-term [1946] Revenue over here and then scalability [1948] over here and let's just look at some [1950] candidate business models okay uh one [1952] candidate business model um that [1954] maximizes your short-term Revenue might [1955] be what we're doing here like [1957] freelancing you know agencies is another [1959] one right probably somewhere right [1961] around here um some type of like B2B [1964] managed [1966] Service uh you know as as as we scale [1968] obviously things change a little bit [1970] from B2B managed service maybe go to [1972] like B2B High touch [1973] SAS maybe after B2B High touch SAS we go [1976] like low touch SAS [1979] and then maybe you know all the way on [1981] the right hand side we have some sort of [1983] like actually I think low touch sass an [1985] info product or probably pretty similar [1987] maybe info products actually a little [1988] bit um lower than than low touch SAS so [1991] this is where like you're I don't know [1993] and then uh finally actually let me do [1995] one more uh we'll do sort of like paas [1997] that stands for platform as a service [1999] this is like basically Uber and whatnot [2002] so you know if I just move this around [2004] so that it's a little bit [2005] prettier you can see on the left hand [2007] side here if all you want to do is you [2009] want to make money today and you want to [2010] make $10,000 as quickly as humanly [2012] possible you know starting with the next [2015] Uber is not going to help you accomplish [2017] that mission why because if you want to [2019] build a platform obviously you need to [2021] invest a ton of time energy and [2022] infrastructure you got to hire Engineers [2023] or you have to be a fantastic engineer [2025] you have to build something of worth you [2027] have to build distribution channels you [2028] have to have distribution channels you [2030] know you're not making a ton of money [2031] per deal I mean even with like uber what [2033] what what are the margins on a single [2034] deal if I try and take an Uber to [2036] downtown how much is Uber really Prof [2037] profiting from that probably a few bucks [2039] right versus let's say a freelance deal [2041] where you can sign like a three four [2043] $5,000 deal like literally in your first [2045] day [2046] freelancing you know if you if you play [2048] your cards right so same thing with [2050] agencies right one of the reasons why I [2052] came into freelancing and agencies is [2054] because they are the fastest way to get [2055] short-term revenue and then if you think [2057] about it logically right if I were to [2060] take a freelancing or agency outfit and [2062] then if I were to productize it automate [2064] it optimize it automate the distribution [2066] of it I basically now now have like [2068] leveraged agency and a leveraged agency [2070] I would wager you know has all of the [2073] benefits of the short-term Revenue um on [2075] the left- hand side but also a lot of [2077] the benefits of the scalability of like [2078] the high touch SAS info products low [2080] touch SAS and platforms as a service so [2082] you know as you go to the right of this [2084] graph you make less money up front and [2086] then you make more money on total now [2088] the reason why that's important is [2090] because you know you kind of have to [2091] know what you want um you know if if you [2093] wanted to start that rocket company or [2095] something like that well you know you [2097] sort of have to accept the fact that [2098] you're probably not going to be making a [2099] lot of money in the short term um so I [2102] guess this is my long ass justification [2104] for why I put this thing last and I [2105] didn't really need to do that but uh [2106] whatever so if you've exhausted [2108] everything in this list and you're still [2109] not happy with your Revenue ceiling [2110] let's say you've been doing this uh for [2112] a few years and you're making like [2113] $1,000 a month as a solar preneur [2115] similar level to me and you're like [2117] you know I'm still not really happy with [2118] how much money I'm making there are [2120] certain business models that inherently [2122] let you scale further the con is that [2124] they take way more in the way of [2126] resources set up and if Mis calibrate [2128] you can waste it all how many horror [2131] stories have you heard of the next big [2133] thing that's completely tanked and lost [2135] investors hundreds of millions of [2137] dollars they the Silicon Valley [2140] graveyard that's the trade-off right [2142] scalability versus short-term Revenue so [2144] I have some examples here of scalable [2146] things information products tend to be [2148] scalable um software products tend to be [2150] scalable affiliate advertising is one [2152] thing that I didn't really touch on that [2153] tends to be scalable as well although [2155] you do have to know what you're doing [2156] and you do have to be open to some level [2158] of risk typically you know if you're [2160] doing affiliate you're either [2161] organically ranking pages on Google or [2163] some other search engine and then having [2165] some percentage of the revenue that you [2166] generate per lead or you are creating [2169] some type of paid advertising that [2171] refers somebody to a funnel um or maybe [2173] you make the funnel yourself and then [2175] you know your your whole Gambit is okay [2177] like is the amount of money I spent to [2179] acquire one new [2180] customer times whatever the small [2183] percentages that I get is that more than [2185] the amount of sorry is that less than [2187] the amount of money that I made off of [2189] that deal essentially so you know these [2192] are these are purposefully scalable [2194] business models that you know people [2195] pick when like they're trying to I don't [2197] know disrupt an industry or whatnot um [2199] but I put these here at the end just [2200] because that is sort of The Next Step if [2202] you get to maybe $250,000 a month per [2204] person $300,000 a month per person and [2206] you start plateauing and you're like [2207] well you know I need to hire if you [2208] are dead set on being a solar preneur [2210] you can absolutely uh start a business [2213] either Solo or with a Founder um you [2215] know that makes substantially more money [2217] than that [2218] I forget exactly how much money I think [2219] it was Tinder um you know that the [2222] dating app that had like nine you uh [2224] software Engineers or something and I [2225] think they had like over a billion [2226] dollar valuation like if you think about [2228] the leverage on each of those people [2230] that's a ton right and that's really [2232] what I'm getting at here with these [2233] scalable business models so in short we [2236] have four main Concepts that I want you [2238] guys to think deeply about we have uh [2241] the revenue ceiling but then we have [2242] thinking about your business in terms of [2244] economic productivity you have [2246] productizing you have automating and [2248] then you have Distributing um and at the [2250] end there you know assuming that you are [2252] unhappy with being able to make $250,000 [2255] per month per person with [2256] extraordinarily High margins you lunatic [2258] then you also have the ability to Pivot [2260] and pick a more scalable business model [2262] and there's nothing necessarily wrong [2263] with that but if you want to do that I'd [2265] highly encourage you guys to at least [2266] get your bag first all right hope you [2268] guys appreciated the video had a lot of [2269] fun putting it together if anybody has [2270] any questions about scaling their own [2272] business how to do so without adding [2274] headcount just leave a comment down [2275] below I'm more than happy to get back to [2276] you if you guys have any ideas for [2278] future videos or any questions about any [2280] of the content that I've created so far

Title: How To Build An Automation Business In 30 Days For $396
[0] hey everybody Nick here I made over 100 [2] Grand last month with AI and Automation [4] and in this video I want to show you how [5] you can do it too I'm going to run [6] through the fastest no way to [9] build a thriving automation agency in [11] just 30 days for less than $396 you're [14] going to learn all about the agency life [15] cycle and then I'm going to show you how [17] you can copy and paste systems that work [19] into your own business so you can start [20] selling them immediately we're going to [22] cover three simple Revenue generating [24] activities for you to do every day and [26] lastly I'm going to show you how to [28] consistently deliver high quality [30] projects if that sounds like something [31] you guys want to get into and learn how [32] to do for yourself then this is the [34] video for you all right the very first [35] and probably the most important step is [36] going to be learning the agency life [38] cycle what is the agency life cycle well [41] if I could put it simply agencies [43] haven't changed much over the course of [45] the last 50 or 60 years since the Mad [48] Men era Dawn Draper days agencies have [51] basically functioned more or less [52] similarly I mean we've swapped a couple [54] of things out typically we don't meet [56] people in person anymore a lot of the [58] time our work is done over the phone or [60] maybe through a video call but agencies [62] by and large have functioned according [64] to the following six steps that I'm [66] about to show you so if you're looking [67] to start an agency to get into you know [70] service implementations the quickest way [73] for you to move forward is just [74] understanding a little bit about what [75] you what each of these steps entail now [78] I've laid the steps out as follows [80] Marketing sales onboarding fulfillment [83] delivery and retention I name these as [87] I've named them here but I want you to [88] know that depending on where you're from [90] depending on the local business [92] environment that you've come from uh you [94] may name these steps differently maybe [96] instead of marketing it's lead gen maybe [98] instead of onboarding it's uh I don't [100] know client activation or something the [102] point isn't what these steps are called [104] the point is how they work and what they [105] do so let's get into the [108] concepts essentially at the very [110] beginning of our flow on the left hand [112] side here we need a way to generate a [113] lead we need a way to get somebody from [115] not knowing about our business to [117] knowing about our business and so this [118] is where the marketing step comes from [120] you spend money on either advertising or [122] Outreach and that's basically the two [124] things that you're limited to to book a [127] sales meeting with your prospect now if [129] you don't know what I mean by sales [130] meeting this is the traditional agency [133] sales system you start by generating the [136] lead up here with marketing and you can [137] do so through a variety of means cold [139] email PPC ads SEO social media upwork [142] communities LinkedIn Twitter Outreach [144] Tik toks like whatever the hell you want [146] the point is this isn't an exhaustive [148] list I just want you to notice how they [149] all into this meeting booked shape so [152] you funnel all of these people into a [155] sales meeting in agency parland we [157] typically call this a disco call [159] Discovery call the next step is the [162] actual sales call itself and on this [164] call your job is basically just to [166] convince the prospect to want to work [167] with you so you do that on the call you [169] elucidate the benefits you press their [170] pain points I like uh doing consultative [173] sales myself which is typically more [175] question based if you're interested in a [177] good resource for that check out Chris [178] voss's book never split the the [180] difference but essentially after all [181] this happens you will send over a [183] proposal or a contract of some kind and [185] this represents the transformation [187] there's like the pre-signing and then [188] there's the post signing when they do [190] the actual signing and the the giving [191] you of the money they turn from a [193] prospect into a client now once they're [196] a client they enter the onboarding phase [199] after signing you basically kick the [201] project off by welcoming them you give [203] them a little bit of peace of mind and [205] then you take everything you need in [206] order to make the project successful and [208] you give them everything that they need [210] in order to monitor the project stay up [213] to date with the details of the project [215] you give them ways to like make change [216] request revisions that sort of stuff [218] again nothing in this process has [220] changed over the course of the last 60 [221] years this is basically how they always [223] uh how agency uh projects have always [225] worked the next is fulfillment this is [228] where you actually deliver on the thing [230] that you promised that you were going to [231] do and here you provide regular updates [233] to the client while completing their [234] project if there are any requirements or [236] additional pieces of information you [238] need you deal with it here [240] the last second last step I should say [242] is delivery where you actually deliver [244] the project this means typically you [246] have some sort of revision period or [249] revision room a lot of marketing [251] agencies for instance have a specified [253] number of revisions you know maybe one [255] or two revisions included in your [256] package and then if you want any more [257] you got to pay extra but delivery is the [259] actual Pro process of saying hey here's [261] your project here's how all this stuff [263] works thanks so much for you know [265] getting on board with us here's the [266] process if you want something changed [268] and then that last step is called [270] retention and the purpose of retention [272] is basically to regularly follow up with [274] a customer or a client and then attempt [276] to get them in your door again so this [278] retention could take a number of [279] different ways you could uh you know [282] send them some sort of like regularly [283] templated follow-up maybe once a month [285] or something like that you could work [287] with them on retainer essentially um [289] this is the the best form of retention [291] because you're retaining them every [292] single month you're receiving some sort [293] of regular money from them and that's [295] basically the point of agencies you get [297] people in at the left hand side here [298] through marketing then sales onboarding [301] fulfillment delivery retention and then [303] after you kind of come back and it's [305] just a little Loop between retention [306] onboarding fulfillment delivery [308] retention on boarding fulfillment [309] delivery so the fact that you understand [312] this and that we've spent a solid few [313] minutes on this topic now means that you [315] are substantially more prepared to take [317] the next step in your business journey [319] and that's understanding a little bit [321] about bottlenecks and what they mean now [323] I'm a big fan of this process called the [325] theory of constraints the theory of [327] constraints involves looking in that [329] pipeline that I showed you that life [331] cycle and then finding what you think is [333] the bottleneck that's preventing your [334] business from functioning let me explain [337] what I mean if you're a new agency okay [339] you have all the time and energy in the [341] world for onboarding fulfillment [344] delivery and retention I mean you're [345] basically just sitting on your hands [346] waiting for a customer to come to you [348] right so none of these are the [350] bottlenecks none of these are stopping [351] you from being able to move forward what [353] is the bottleneck for a new agency is [355] going to be your marketing and your [356] sales it's going to be really the [357] marketing at the beginning and then [358] eventually the sales as you start like [359] not being able to convert opportunities [361] because I don't know you just lack the [362] skills or something so um that is [365] basically always the bottleneck the fact [367] that you don't have client your [367] constraint is almost always sales and [369] marketing and if you really want to [370] crush it in the agency space you need to [372] understand this um if you don't solve [374] sales and marketing your business will [376] basically never go anywhere so from [378] there you know the second that you solve [380] sales and marketing you can basically [381] turn a tap on or off that delivers uh [384] interested parties to your front door [386] well now you can worry about other steps [388] now you can actually start optim in for [389] onboarding fulfillment delivery or [391] retention but the idea is you don't you [393] don't cross that bridge until you get to [394] it otherwise you're wasting a ton of [396] time and energy and I know that there [397] are tons of these courses and [398] accelerators out there that talk you [400] know wax poetic about how you need to [402] have all your systems set up before you [403] start the reality is you don't at least [405] not for uh the project sizes that you [407] probably care about right now which are [409] I don't know anywhere from like $1,000 [411] maybe up to $5,000 or so until you make [413] your first $10,000 with your agency [416] don't worry about any of those other [417] steps anybody can do this as long as are [419] consistent and apply themselves so yeah [422] you'll eventually have to optimize [423] onboarding fulfillment delivery [424] retention Etc not yet the most important [427] parts of a of a new agency are going to [429] be your marketing and your sales and [431] that's naturally what I'm going to be [432] spending a lot of time talking about now [435] if you want to crush it in the [436] automation space the simplest way to do [438] it is not actually to build everything [440] yourself from scratch uh you just copy [442] things that already work and then you [444] sell them so this is Step number two in [446] my process uh you can break the rules [448] just break them after you've learned [450] them inside and out don't try innovating [452] or building something completely new [453] until you know what works you know what [455] the customer uh Market that you're [457] tackling has a demand for and that sort [458] of stuff and so what I've done here is [460] I've just taken a screenshot from my own [461] gumroad gumroad is where I host all of [463] my Blueprints and I give them all away [464] for free that's why it say 0 so if you [467] want to look into them I'm just head [468] over to I think it's gumroad.com left [472] clicker or something or no left [473] clicker.com road.com you'll see just a [476] giant list and the reason why I bring [478] this up is because I want you to copy [479] them I want you to go through this whole [481] thing and if you're unfamiliar with how [483] automation Works literally just copy all [485] of the systems here that you think are [486] valuable I mean I you know I need to [488] change my thumbnail photos for some of [490] these but uh go through this and just [491] just take whatever you think is valuable [494] the reason why is because this is going [495] to save you weeks or months I mean I run [497] several automation communities at this [499] point where I show people how to build [500] businesses very quickly and reliably and [503] one of the biggest issues I see with new [505] automation companies is that they rush [506] to innovate they rush to rebuild but the [508] reality is if you haven't even made five [510] grand with your agency innovating is the [512] last of your concerns instead you should [514] do what other agencies do then just do [516] it a little bit better so these are all [519] things that I myself have sold I [520] validated that there is demand for these [522] products or Services um what you should [524] do is you should just copy these from me [526] or maybe another YouTuber or another [528] content creator out there make a couple [530] of tweaks if you have to um and then [533] just start selling after you learn the [535] rules after you you learn a lot of what [537] you don't know by selling these systems [538] then you can can start optimizing and [541] fixing and making them better and that [542] sort of thing so my steps here are to [545] copy three systems for me or another [546] Builder on YouTube Don't rebuild the [548] Wheel from scratch I mean there are so [550] many resources like mine available to [551] you that you just be wasting uh you know [554] breath otherwise for instance you can [556] copy my proposal generator system maybe [557] you want to copy my content repurposing [559] system then maybe you want to copy my [561] clickup CRM and then just take these [563] three systems and then that is what [565] you're going to be selling you don't [567] even have to build anything on your own [569] the most important part here is sales [570] and we just want to get you up and [571] running to the point where you're able [573] to sell and sell consistently before we [575] worry about you optimizing anything else [576] like you're fulfill on your delivery [578] remember so once you have that create [580] templates or blueprints Etc around these [582] systems you just copy mine as I [583] mentioned and that's sufficient become [586] an expert in these highly specific [587] automations and domains this is really [589] only going to take you a few hours you [591] just sort of open up each of these if [592] you're doing this in make.com like I am [594] you would literally just look at every [595] module and just understand what every [597] module does and then when you get an off [599] for a system whether it's that exact [601] same system or related system which I'm [602] going to show you how to do in a few [604] minutes you're going to know how to get [605] 80% of the way there super easily and [607] then all you have to do is just make a [608] couple little tweaks as the client [610] requested in order for you to get that [611] job done so you know I'm saying if you [614] get 80% of the way there through a [615] template what you've effectively done um [617] logically is you've 5x your leverage you [619] basically decreased the amount of time [621] it takes for you to deliver this project [622] you've also decreased the number of [623] mistakes that you could make delivering [624] this project by five which is huge in [628] addition don't rush to innovate you know [630] much more about this than most [631] businesses already you just don't know [633] that um and so your goal here isn't to [636] build an eth wonder of the world your [638] goal is to just sell numbers one to [640] seven first then once you've sold [641] numbers one to seven then you can worry [643] about making something new and you know [645] starting to to get out there and [647] innovate so step number three is and I'm [650] going to get a lot of flack for this I'm [651] sure but no fancy website no ideal [653] customer Persona no market research none [656] of that just sell you're only [658] focused here is on Revenue generating [662] activities so the cost to this step as [665] opposed to the other steps were [667] $0 is $396 this is where you're going to [670] be spending all of the money to actually [672] go out there and acquire customers and [673] this is also the most important step so [675] logically this is the step that you [676] should be spending your money on now [678] there's a lot of noise at the start line [680] of any agency or really any business um [683] improving systems exciting automations [685] right you have all these products that [686] you could design you could touch up your [688] business cards [690] almost none of that matters and if [692] you spend time doing this you'll be [694] spending time uh basically like pressing [697] buttons that don't do anything imagine [699] if you were at an arcade and you [701] wandered up to a video game machine and [703] you know you just started pressing [705] buttons and none of those buttons did [706] anything why in God's name would you [708] keep on pressing those buttons if you [710] wanted to play the game right why not [712] walk to an arcade and press the button [713] that actually makes the game start um [715] this doesn't make the game start what [717] makes the game start our Revenue gener [719] gener ating activities so let me explain [721] the only thing that matters when you're [722] starting a business is spending time on [724] Revenue generating activities and the [726] only things that are really Revenue [728] generating activities that are worth [729] doing are interfacing with the market so [731] interfacing with the market means [732] talking to customers means dming [734] customers it means uh emailing customers [737] it means recording videos for customers [739] it means getting on video calls with [740] customers talking to them over the phone [743] uh sure if you're running some local [744] agency it might mean like going into [745] their office shaking their hands might [747] mean cold calling uh you know door too [750] whatever it is but the most important [751] thing for you now that you're at the [753] start line and that you understand that [754] sales and marketing are your bottleneck [756] bottlenecks I should say is interfacing [758] with the market as much as possible and [760] just putting yourself out there as much [761] as you can because these are Revenue [762] generating activities these are things [764] that allow you to to really move forward [766] these are the buttons that you know [767] change the way that your screen looks [769] for instance the reason why is because [771] every time you interface with the market [773] what you're really doing under the hood [775] is you're learning what works and you're [776] learning what doesn't you as a business [778] owner especially probably a new one have [781] a ton of probably invalid opinions um [783] you have things that you know you've [785] learned from your family you've had [786] things that you've learned from other [787] businesses or maybe other verticals or [789] maybe influencers or or content creators [791] or TV or news media or whatever and it [794] sucks for me to say but a lot of these [795] opinions are [797] invalid all that you should really be [799] doing the only people you should really [801] be forming opinions um from are [804] customers because customers are the ones [806] that are going to be paying you money at [807] the end of the day and so so all you [809] basically should be doing is looking at [811] and talking to and dealing with real [813] customers as often as possible because [815] real customers will reset all of that [816]  in your head it's about as true [818] and objective a data source as humanly [820] possible your only uh you know your only [824] mental calculus should be you know hey [826] if I do this customers like it hey if I [828] do this customers don't like it so I [829] should do more of that first thing and [831] less of that second thing and this is [833] what this step does and this is really [834] what I talk mostly about in most of my [836] automation programs because it's as I [838] mentioned bottleneck for the vast [839] majority of people so there is so much [842] that we don't know that we don't know [844] interfacing with customers solves that [846] it's kind of like riding a bike if [847] somebody asks you hey Peter how do you [850] ride a bike you just say well you kind [851] of just get on there and then you [852] balance right customers and client [854] management and all that jazz it's very [856] similar in nature when you put yourself [858] in front of customers when you ride that [860] bike as often as possible you tend to [861] pick up a lot of it intuitively very [863] quickly so because this is really the [867] sauce here this is the meal deal that [869] cost $396 what I'm going to do next is [871] I'm going to focus on three affordable [873] High leverage Revenue generating [874] activities that you can do every day to [878] build a thriving and successful [879] automation agency these are steps that I [881] do myself these are steps that tons of [883] people in my communities do I'm going to [885] run you through some I guess examples [887] and some case studies and I'm actually [889] going to show you exactly how you can do [890] them yourself too the most powerful [892] Revenue generating activity that you can [894] do today is cold email as of the time of [898] this recording which which is November [900] the 6th at 3:35 p.m. there is no lead [902] generation method that is more [904] affordable and more accessible you can [906] generate leads you can have booked [908] appointments in your calendar for [910] something like a A fifth or a sixth of [912] the cost of anything else you can also [914] write now like in the next hour assuming [916] you wanted to and assuming you were [918] willing to spend the money connect with [919] over 500 people from the comfort of your [921] chair in your pajamas back in the day I [924] used to go cold calling and door [925] knocking I would be lucky if I got 70ish [928] people a day if you do the math you can [930] literally connect with seven times as [932] many people that I would have spent in [933] an entire week and receive very similar [936] quality results with what I'm about to [938] show you and I don't just want you to [939] take my word for it I mean I have uh [943] basically dozens of case studies from [945] people across all of my communities that [947] just start with cold email and they just [948] start absolutely crushing it um I'm not [951] going to go super into detail about any [952] of these but uh yeah people are just [954] printing money with cold email it's not [956] very hard I think this guy generated a [958] lead Within sevenes minutes which is [959] crazy this guy made 3.5k this guy signed [962] a $2,200 50 deal um and so on and so [966] forth the point that I'm making is [967] there's a lot of Leverage in cold email [969] and a lot of people don't really believe [971] that it's possible to send a cold email [972] and have somebody actually respond to [974] you but like you know I made $100,000 [976] last month I get cold emails all the [977] time and if the cold emails are good I [978] will literally respond to that cold [980] email despite the fact that there are a [981] million things buying for my attention [983] um basically every business owner is the [984] same so emails are a direct line into [987] your prospect's brain basically you [990] should take advantage of it so what I'm [992] going to show you here is some pretty [993] conservative math um these can improve [996] substantially depending on your copy my [998] best performing campaign has a reply [1000] rate that is six or seven times this [1003] about 20% or so um that's not super [1005] realistic to be honest you need a very [1007] particular set of circumstances to get a [1009] reply rate that good but um I just want [1011] you to know that I'm being [1012] extraordinarily conservative here and [1013] all the numbers that I'm showing you you [1015] have the power to do substantially [1016] better so I always recommend signing up [1018] for nine mailboxes using instantly the [1020] costs about 15 bucks a domain you need [1022] three domains for that so 45 bucks plus [1024] five bucks a mailbox you need nine [1026] mailbox that's another 45 bucks plus um [1029] 97 bucks a month I use instantly you [1031] don't have to spend 97 bucks a month for [1033] this you can also find ways to get all [1035] of these things cheaper um so that's [1037] $187 is the most money that you'll pay [1039] if you want to be a little more [1039] reasonable maybe you'll spend like a [1041] hundred bucks or something then you [1042] scrape a bunch of leads I'm going to do [1044] 3,000 just cuz um my program here the [1047] one that I'm laying out in front of you [1048] involves emailing something like 135 new [1050] people a day times 24 days so scrape 300 [1053] leads using leads rapidly it's a new [1054] service where you can pump in an Apollo [1057] um search URL into uh this service that [1059] will then scrape the leads off Apollo [1061] for you and give them to you at like 1/ [1063] 100th of the cost or something ludicrous [1064] like that that'll cost you n bucks [1066] collectively it's [1067] $196 and then here's the math like when [1070] I when I consult with automation [1072] agencies and really any any sort of [1074] business I will almost always do math [1075] that is very similar to what I'm about [1076] to show you here so if this is the first [1078] time you're hear ing this sort of math I [1079] recommend you guys uh you know pay [1082] attention and try and try and understand [1083] where I'm coming from here with this [1084] estimation if you have nine [1087] mailboxes and you're contacting 15 New [1089] Leads a day because that's about how [1091] many we're going to contact in like a [1092] two email sequence if it's 30 emails a [1095] day per mailbox but you have you have to [1096] send out two emails you can only do 15 [1098] right then that's 135 leads a day if you [1101] do 135 leads a day and you send 24 days [1104] I do Monday to Saturday then that's [1107] 3,240 leads a month it's actually a [1109] little bit more than that but let's go [1110] with [1111] 3,240 assuming you get a 3% reply range [1114] is very doable especially if you use AI [1116] customization that's 97 replies and [1119] assuming that a third of those replies [1120] are positive that's over 32 booked [1123] appointments the per appointment cost [1125] using this method is 196 divided 32 [1130] $612 if anybody here is in PPC you know [1133] if you've ever tried acquiring client [1135] through I don't know like Google ads or [1137] Facebook ads or something especially for [1139] a service that is over $1,000 which a [1141] lot of automation projects can be [1144] $612 is pretty freaking ludicrous um you [1147] know most people will spend 5 10 15 20 [1150] times that you know I think personal [1151] injury law uh PPC campaigns and granted [1154] you know they can they can pay out a ton [1156] of money uh but you know they're willing [1157] to spend hundreds of dollars for a [1159] single uh for for a single meeting we're [1161] talking like three four $500 you're [1163] getting this for [1165] $612 if you do the math and you say I [1167] don't know I have a conversion rate of [1169] 20% that means I need five appointments [1171] per close that means that to close a [1173] deal the money that's flowing out of [1174] your pocket is [1175] $30 assuming a customer lifetime value [1178] even a th000 bucks which is an [1179] underestimate I've had customer lifetime [1181] values of upwards of [1183] 167,000 well actually realistically I [1186] think my highest one's over $50,000 now [1188] but maybe you know5 $116,000 i' say [1191] that's a 33 times Roi on a th000 bucks [1193] if you just do the math and it's 2,000 [1196] then that's a 66 times Roi like are you [1199] going to get 66 times Roi on the market [1201] no obviously this is like actively [1203] managed but this is basically you know I [1205] don't want to type it up too much but [1207] the way that I see it is cold email is [1208] like a money printer as long as you know [1210] a couple of the inputs and the outputs [1211] and if you can do this intelligently you [1213] can generate much more than that 33 [1214] times rois on your marketing spend um so [1217] i' highly recommend that if you know [1219] y'all aren't taking cold email seriously [1220] that you start pretty soon okay so how [1223] do you actually go out and do cold [1224] emails I should have wrote manage not [1225] right here um the reality is you don't [1227] need to be a copyrighting God to make [1228] this work I wasn't when I started I [1229] think I've become a little bit closer to [1231] that since but uh you just need to put [1233] yourself in your prospect shoes when [1234] you're writing and creating your [1236] campaigns what would you actually [1237] respond to a lot of the time I see [1239] people write way too formally they'll [1240] say hello dear hello uh sir hello Madam [1244] um you know dear Peter right I think if [1247] people see that they basically instantly [1249] exit out of any email they instantly [1250] Mark you a Spam because that's just not [1252] how people realistically talk what you [1253] want to do is you want to talk to them [1255] as if they're like a friend of yours or [1256] something you want to talk to them as if [1258] you're texting your buddy across the the [1260] seat at the bar so right short and [1263] Punchy try and make your whole excuse me [1265] email fit into a phone screen that's [1267] really the rule of thumb avoid any sort [1268] of formality in your copyrighting um you [1271] know use contractions wherever possible [1273] I can say can sorry that's not what I [1275] meant to say cannot say can't uh you [1278] know basically just just try and cut [1280] down your email as much as humanly [1282] possible I have a whole copyrighting and [1284] offer guide by the way that you guys can [1286] check out um because I don't have the [1288] time to do this whole topic Justice in [1290] this video so if you guys want to like [1291] really really Master cold email I [1292] definitely recommend you check it out [1294] just Google like nixer have cold offers [1296] or something then use plausible [1298] deniability don't say you know I see [1300] people lying all the time when they do [1301] cold emails don't say hey Sam I walked [1304] by your business yesterday and I was [1306] looking through your storefront I loved [1307] what I saw um that stuff's and [1309] if anybody ever calls you out and it you [1311] basically just like burned that Prospect [1312] for life so just use plausible [1314] deniability um you know imply that you [1316] have some sort of relation to them but [1318] don't explicitly say that you do build [1321] an offer give something away for free [1322] guarantee them results Etc if you are [1325] emailing a person cold and they've never [1326] talked to you before in their life you [1327] do not by default have their respect you [1332] don't even by default have any of their [1333] time you need to earn it and the only [1335] way that you earn it is by giving them [1337] something you essentially have to buy [1339] seconds and the way that you do this is [1341] you give them something for free and you [1342] guarantee the hell out of it a good [1344] example is I will book you 10 uh sales [1347] appointments in your calendar in the [1348] next 30 days or you don't pay a cent I [1350] guarantee you that you're going to have [1351] 10 booked sales appointments in your [1353] calendar in the next 30 days that's huge [1355] right logically if your service is just [1357] a few thousand but 10 Book Sales [1359] appointments of them are worth like [1360] $50,000 like a lot of businesses are [1362] they're going to say yeah that sounds [1364] great let's do it you need to make it so [1365] logical that they just can't say no you [1367] don't just sell them emotionally but you [1369] just sort of lay it out in front of them [1370] and you're like well like what could [1371] possibly go wrong get in the habit of [1373] guaranteeing stuff get in the habit of [1375] guaranteeing I will build a a worldclass [1377] clickup CRM and install it in your [1379] business in the next 48 hours and if you [1381] don't absolutely fall in love with it [1382] you don't pay me a cent um when you [1384] start getting into that language you [1385] start making multiples um on you know [1387] your positive reply rates and that's [1388] what really crushes it in cold email and [1391] the last thing I'll mention is just [1392] respond to all positive inquiries in [1393] under five minutes make that your rule [1395] of thumb just set up notifications set [1396] up a slack set up all this stuff if you [1398] don't it's going to be a lot tougher for [1399] you um to to succeed and this is another [1402] one of those really low hanging fruit [1403] that I see people consistently failing [1404] at they respond to cold emails like a [1406] day after I'm sorry man if I'm talking [1408] to somebody totally cold and I don't [1411] respond to them in 5 minutes I basically [1413] consider that lead lost for the better [1415] yeah I want to say not not like 90% [1417] chance they're going to be lost but [1418] probably like 30% chance that I'm losing [1420] them if I don't respond to them in five [1421] minutes um so you can just massively [1423] improve your conversion rate just by [1425] having notifs on your phone having [1426] response templates and that sort of [1428] stuff all things that instantly in other [1429] cold email providers give you right off [1431] the bat all right so the second lead [1434] generation method the one that usually [1435] gets me a couple of people turning up [1437] their noses and saying this guys full of [1438]  is uh upwork I made over well I [1441] made almost $500,000 in earnings on my [1443] upwork profile uh the marginal cost per [1446] closed deal is similar to email it's [1447] definitely more but because of Pride and [1449] ego I find that many good business [1450] people avoid it um because many good [1453] business people avoid it that is [1454] actually your opportunity I've had many [1455] contracts that have turned in projects [1457] worth over $10,000 I have a bunch of [1460] just case studies [1462] here uh you know through maker school [1464] and through makemoney withth make.com [1466] with people just making a ton of money [1467] getting their first client using upwork [1469] reaching out and making I don't know [1470] $700 $800 in their first day or [1473] something like that um booking their [1474] first uperk client in 12 days making you [1477] know their first $1,000 through the [1478] platform and and that sort of stuff so [1480] there's a lot that you can do on uper [1482] very quickly and easily um I'm going to [1484] run you into the math again but I want [1485] you to know that this is very dependable [1487] you can wake up every day and do five or [1489] 10 of these my recommendation is five [1491] and if you stick to my program this is [1492] going to cost you somewhere in the [1493] neighborhood of another $200 in your [1495] first month so my program is to send [1497] five customer applications per day your [1499] cost comes out to about $2 per app you [1501] have to spend money on upw workk in [1502] order to actually send the application [1504] and they usually take about 5 minutes of [1505] your time when I say custom application [1507] I mean literally record a video of you [1508] solving the customer problem for them I [1510] mean literally say hey how's it going my [1512] name's Nick um I just wanted to spend a [1514] couple of minutes and see if I could [1515] solve your problem right now over video [1517] and then just work through it with them [1518] it's very high Roi if you end up getting [1520] the job you can repurpose the work that [1522] you did during that 5 minutes then if [1523] anybody clicks on your proposal in all [1525] likelihood they'll be wowed because very [1527] few people do stuff like this on this [1528] platform this makes the $2 that you [1530] spend much more worth [1532] it so mathematically five applications [1535] time 20 days is about 100 applications [1537] per month right I'm assuming you're [1538] going to send Monday to Friday with a [1540] 20% reply rate that 100 applications is [1542] 20 leads I'm assuming half of them book [1544] because the the the booking to reply [1546] rate is a lot higher on upwork um that's [1548] 10 appointments if you get a third of [1550] those appointments sign that's three [1551] projects and assuming that customer [1553] lifetime value is a th000 bucks that's [1555] about a 15 times Roi on marketing closed [1557] deal cost you 66 bucks I think if you're [1560] still with me at this point in the video [1561] you're probably now understanding how I [1563] do these cost benefit calculations um [1565] obviously there's only so much that you [1566] could know ahead of time but these [1568] numbers tend to be reasonably accurate I [1570] want to say for uh beginners or near [1572] beginners as I mentioned these [1573] substantially improve depending on your [1575] copy and these substantially improve [1577] depending on your profile my stats [1578] personally are about double this well [1580] it's not double the half booking rate [1582] that would be a full booking rate but I [1583] think you guys get my point so how do [1585] you do well on upwork well of whole [1588] Litany of uh of ways I need to find my [1591] upwork okay let's just go upwork Nix [1593] have here I bet you I'm somewhere here [1596] uh that is not me maybe I need to [1598] actually pull open another tab so why [1600] don't we do [1603] that so how do how do you actually do [1605] well on upwork well I have a simple four [1607] or five step process to doing so um I'm [1610] just going to see the public view just [1611] as if I was um you know considering [1613] working with me upwork is sort of like a [1616] search engine right it's like Google and [1618] so just like you do SEO on Google to do [1620] well you kind of need to do SEO on [1621] upwork too it's also like a landing page [1624] and so just like you need to do cro on [1625] your landing pages you need to do cro on [1627] upwork the thing is they only give you a [1629] few different ways to do the cro in the [1631] SEO and you just need to make as much [1632] use of them as you possibly can it's [1634] just a game at the end of the day right [1635] you're just playing a game with five or [1636] six different buttons so one button is [1639] your profile this right here um I chose [1641] this bright yellow color because I [1642] wanted to stand out from the background [1644] and the reason why is because I've hired [1645] on upwork before I know how many [1647] applications the average gets and the [1649] vast majority of eyes will just glaze [1650] over until they find one that just [1652] stands out so I picked a color that you [1653] just do not see in nature made that in [1655] my background um I look reasonably [1657] business casual I think I'd be better if [1658] I was looking in the camera honestly I [1660] just haven't had time to get new photos [1662] um but yeah uh you know little tiny hack [1664] might improve your proposal to reply [1666] rate by like 2% or something the next [1668] one is uh your rate I never do like a [1670] flat rate I'm never like 50 bucks I'm [1672] like 5250 5389 whatever um the third is [1676] your title you know you want your title [1677] to be optimized you want it to be as [1679] similar to the keywords the jobs that [1681] you're applying for as possible so just [1682] scroll through 10 or 15 jobs make a list [1684] of keywords and put those keywords in [1685] your title the next is you know the way [1688] that upwork works is you have an above [1689] the fold and you have a below the fold [1691] right the vast majority of people will [1694] like it's crazy they will stuff all of [1696] the important below the fold but [1699] the reality is nobody looks below the [1701] fold they only look above the fold they [1703] make the determination of whether or not [1705] to keep looking at your profile through [1707] above the fold so what you want to do is [1709] you just want to shove as much Social [1710] proof in there as seemingly possible [1711] Right my work is 50 million reads I've [1713] written for insert all these big [1714] companies here I've been featured in [1716] Popular Mechanics and Apple news right [1718] the point that I'm making is you just [1719] want to frontload your social proof and [1721] this works with anything this doesn't [1722] work just work with automation it works [1723] with all platforms um sorry all all [1726] sorts of jobs uh and all sorts of [1728] Industries the next is you want to make [1730] sure this online for messages badge is [1732] on the reason why is because upwork is a [1733] very short-term hiring platform and you [1735] know people are going to want to get [1737] hired uh people are going to want to [1739] hire and then get hired very fast so you [1741] need to play the game and you need to [1743] have like a little tab open somewhere on [1745] your computer basically um and then just [1747] alt tab back and forth through it every [1748] couple of hours if you just do these [1750] very silly sounding steps that again [1752] these aren't magic these definitely [1754] don't sound effective but they are [1755] effective uh you can print money on [1757] upwork you can make a ton so yeah I talk [1760] about these tips here and I'm going to [1761] leave it at that um but the last thing [1763] I'll mention is that in your customized [1764] video proposal either answer their [1766] question or give them something for free [1768] just say you know hey I'd love to build [1770] this out for you at no cost and only if [1771] you love it do you actually have to end [1773] up paying me we can set this up on [1774] upwork right now and I can start [1775] building the next 48 hours you know you [1777] have to build a couple reviews you have [1778] to get some status under your belt of [1780] course like any other platform but if [1782] you do this and if you do this [1783] consistently and if you send a five a [1785] day for the next 30 days or so um like [1788] mathematically you're almost guaranteed [1789] to succeed now the next uh you know [1793] simple lead generation method that I [1794] want to talk about is communities [1796] communities also offer a ridiculous Roi [1799] especially right now since Alex hosi [1800] threw his hat into school with Sam ens [1803] millions of people are joining [1804] communities I should know I run [1805] communities and they're also an [1806] extraordinarily lowcost way of [1808] connecting with uh people in your target [1810] market in like a safe way where they [1812] don't really feel threatened by you and [1814] you guys can actually sit down and have [1815] a conversation they they tend to be [1816] pretty insular so here's my [1818] recommendation here's the math join a [1820] bunch of free or lowcost communities [1822] that Target your market for instance [1823] videography companies then read through [1825] every one of these communities literally [1827] scroll all the way down to the very [1829] bottom of the of the whole search right [1831] it might take you hours but then just [1833] make a note of all of the problems that [1835] you've identified in said Community you [1837] know are people complaining about a [1838] particular software platform in your [1840] Niche are they talking about how they [1841] wish that this software platform did [1843] this are they talking about how ah [1844] customers have gotten so expensive [1845] recently or you know customers are so [1847] cheap right note down these problems the [1850] vast majority will have to do with not [1851] getting enough leads or not closing [1853] enough deals or some client management [1855] issues or some simple Software System [1856] issues and that's fine but just note [1858] them all down and then what you do is [1859] you just post in the community every [1861] single day when you create the post you [1863] solve a problem that the community [1864] members are struggling with and then you [1865] just give that away for free and you're [1867] not really giving it away for free what [1869] you're doing is you're giving something [1870] away in exchange for reputation and that [1872] reputation will help you later on down [1874] the line this is what I've done with my [1876] own YouTube uh it took me to be honest [1878] like several months before I started [1879] making any money any meaningful money [1881] aside from like a few little um uh you [1884] know pennies worth of AD Revenue but [1887] what I was doing was I was building my [1888] reputation to the point where it was [1889] sort of like a powder keg that was ready [1890] to explode and this is how I see [1892] communities as well people that do this [1893] tend to do quite well um what you do [1896] next is everybody that's reacted or [1898] responded to your post you send them a [1900] DM and in your DM you offer to help them [1903] a little bit further you say hey how's [1904] it going you know I noticed that you [1906] sent me a DM are you currently working [1907] on this right now if so like I'm more [1908] than happy to walk you through what it [1909] looks like do you want me to send a [1911] video and then mathematically if you [1913] created 20 posts per month and each post [1915] is an average of even five engagements [1917] you're getting DMS if out of those 100 [1920] DMS you book 10% of those you get 10 [1922] meetings and assuming you close 20% [1924] that's two deals and the only thing [1926] you're paying for for this is time [1927] although certainly some communities can [1929] cost money to join you don't have to do [1931] any sort of paid Community to make this [1932] work we have tons of people that are [1934] crushing it with communities in my [1936] groups and in other groups too so how do [1939] you actually do well with us communities [1940] are less rigid than other methods a lot [1942] of communities are just building [1943] relationships and then seeing where like [1945] the business Serendipity takes you but [1947] there are some things you can do to [1948] improve the percent chance of a [1949] conversion and here is what I personally [1951] recommend the first is don't just create [1953] top level posts if you're going to do [1955] this do it right spend maybe 20 minutes [1957] a day responding to comments read [1958] through the threads that are posted [1960] engage with people ask them where [1962] they're from what they want to do send [1963] DMS say hey I thought the post that you [1965] made last week was really interesting [1966] here's why um you know a lot of it is [1968] relationship based and you want people [1970] to like you so that they also engage [1972] with your post and bump you to the top [1973] of the feet the second is to give [1975] everything away in your post gatekeep [1977] nothing if you start gatekeeping things [1979] in a Clos Community um I find that just [1981] tanks your reputation when you DM keep [1983] it light as well um you know the purpose [1985] of a community is not to be sold like [1986] you don't want to sell to people in the [1988] community or make them feel threatened [1989] by it um so just offer to show them or [1991] talk to them more about your Solution on [1992] a call don't necessarily push the sale [1994] we've seen band results from that and [1996] then the last is and this is sort of a [1997] sneaky hormos level technique is when [2000] you're on the call ask them in instead [2002] of like asking them hey do you want to [2003] buy my product or [2004] service when you explain how your [2007] solution works or whatever it is that [2008] you know you guys were T chatting about [2010] all you do is you just ask them if they [2012] know anybody who'd be interested in your [2013] services this sidesteps the issue of any [2016] sort of hard sales it preserves your [2018] reputation in the community and allows [2019] you to do this like clockwork all the [2020] time the reason why is because if [2021] they're not interested then they might [2023] find some people and then refer them [2025] over to you or they'll just say on you [2026] know sorry I don't know anybody at the [2027] top of my head but if they are [2028] interested they'll say well I'm [2030] interested in this service and then [2031] voila you've got yourself people um that [2033] you can very easily convert into paying [2035] customers so sort of a logistic thing [2037] sort of a social cuy thing I think you [2039] sort of just have to be in enough [2040] communities to understand what the [2041] dynamic is there uh but I personally [2043] have seen great results with this method [2045] tons of people in my communities have [2046] seen great results with this method so I [2048] recommend it step number four is to go [2051] above and beyond as often as possible [2052] the cost for this is z dollar [2054] unsurprisingly now this is particularly [2056] important in your first few weeks [2057] building an automation agency the reason [2059] why is because it helps you get [2060] referrals which are substantially easier [2063] to both acquire and manage than cold [2065] leads logically if you get A A customer [2069] from completely cold sources you [2071] basically done the hardest thing ever [2073] you have literally done the hardest [2075] thing that you will ever have to do on [2077] the lead acquisition side of business [2079] you should be very proud of yourself [2080] indeed that means that anything that you [2082] do from then and out will be easier it's [2084] one of the reasons why I'm actually [2085] really thankful that I spent all my time [2086] going door Todo um because it taught me [2088] basically the hardest lead method that [2090] gave me the fewest results and because I [2092] was able to succeed with that I'm [2093] obviously able to succeed with anything [2095] else right but the thing about referrals [2097] are [2098] you know what most service providers [2099] think is that you know I don't really [2101] want to go above and beyond on this [2102] project like should I really make that [2104] extra video should I really add that [2105] extra feature it's like no because it'll [2107] just kind of reduce my Roi if I make [2109] $1,000 and I spend a couple extra hours [2111] to do so well my hourly rate just went [2113] down so that's pointless I want to be [2115] efficient and optimal with my time and I [2117] understand the idea here I understand [2118] you wed to optimize your Roi and your [2121] return on rate and I think that's [2122] generally positive but you're not losing [2124] that time in reality if you spend more [2127] time on a project and if you go above [2129] and beyond and you add some additional [2131] features or you just go way past the [2133] scope then like a sizable percentage of [2135] the people you deal with are going to [2136] work with you again and they're going to [2137] give you more money for more services [2139] they're literally going to probably like [2142] 25 30 40 50% more often give you like a [2145] follow-up job Andor a referral and or a [2147] five-star review the moment that you get [2149] one of these you've just acquired a [2151] client for free which is about the most [2153] valuable thing anybody can do in [2155] agencies if I jump way back here to our [2159] system this retention step if you can [2161] find a way to retain or get referrals [2164] then you'll do two things the first is [2167] that you're going to lower your cost per [2169] acquisition let's say that you know we [2171] just retained a customer for another [2173] ,000 project and we did uh we we [2175] acquired them through cold email right [2178] so we spent [2179] $30.60 and we made $2,000 on that [2182] project well now if you do the math your [2186] return on marketing spend for that [2187] customer was 66 times which is even more [2191] ludicrous in addition to that you don't [2194] just make more money uh you don't just [2197] make a higher return on marketing [2199] because your cost per acquisition is [2200] lower you tend to be able to get more [2202] money out of these people too so the [2203] math gets even better if you do a great [2205] job for somebody for $1,000 they're much [2208] more likely to the next project to say [2211] well you know what why don't we do this [2212] $2,000 project instead sure it's twice [2214] the size but now I trust you and I know [2216] you deliver good work and that's where [2217] you start getting into the crazy [2218] leverage with an agency whatever agency [2221] it is not just automation agencies but [2222] that's where you start getting into you [2224] know like the 300 times uh return on [2226] marketing spend and then you know a lot [2228] of these people tend to refer you to [2230] other people in their networks this is [2231] really where things start to multiply [2233] for you so I highly encourage every job [2235] that you do to go above and beyond even [2237] if even if you have to spend a little [2238] bit of extra time doing it just know [2240] that the person that consistently gives [2241] this sort of value is inherently [2243] eventually rewarded by the market and [2245] really just the universe so some [2248] examples and I got a really sneaky one [2249] for you um I deliver every project with [2251] a custom video I'll actually record [2252] documentation I'll be like hey how's it [2254] going Nick here this is the project for [2256] X Y andz you can use this as training [2257] for your team if you want um let's dive [2259] into how everything works and then I'll [2260] actually run through it all and people [2262] really like that because I typically [2263] don't always discuss that sometimes I [2265] give them team documentation for free [2267] that's like a big Google doc um I add [2269] additional features we didn't talk about [2271] during the scope features that are most [2272] like well you know what I figured it'd [2273] be nice for you to have this too so I [2275] just threw that in right people love [2276] that you want to know a really [2278] sneaky thing you can do leave positive [2280] reviews in your clients Google my [2281] business page without them saying [2282] anything next time you start working [2284] with somebody even if it's like a small [2285] ticket amount just look them up on [2287] Google my business and then leave them a [2289] review and say hey how's it going my [2291] name's Peter you know I'm a I'm a vendor [2292] or I'm A supplier for blank company I [2294] just wanted to let you all know that [2295] like this guy that I'm working with is [2297] killer he's extraordinarily kind and [2299] charismatic he's very communicative um [2301] just as a character reference I think [2303] that Peter is one of the best guys that [2304] you could possibly work with I can't [2306] tell you how many people I've done this [2307] on that have later just sent me an email [2310] or during a call been like by the way [2311] did you leave a review for me last week [2314] I'm like yeah I did and then that ends [2316] up Landing me the job so just go above [2318] and beyond as often as possible treat [2320] this as a step that you can optimize for [2322] um and you'll start getting [2323] substantially more referrals eventually [2325] you're not going to have to rely on [2327] these lead generation methods that I [2328] talk about although I believe you should [2330] certainly always be doing them [2331] regardless the last thing that I'll talk [2332] about is consistency and I'm I'm going [2334] to end this with this platitude because [2336] it is very important uh if you want to [2338] succeed in the agency space I should [2339] note that it doesn't actually require [2341] hard work and you don't have to be [2342] intelligent there are many people that [2343] work way less than you are probably [2345] willing to and there are many people [2346] that are probably way dumber than you [2348] the person watching this video is right [2350] now because it doesn't require hardw [2352] work intelligence it requires consistent [2355] work a good example I always like [2357] providing is building muscle at the gym [2358] now as we know I'm extraordinarily [2360] muscular and well-developed uh just [2361] about everywhere and uh you know if if I [2364] wanted to make my shoulders even bigger [2367] let's I had two options the first is I [2368] could either out for 15 hours [2372] today or I could spend 1 hour working [2375] out every other day by the end of the [2378] month I'll have spent the same amount of [2379] time in both cases well in which case do [2382] you think I'll have grown uh even sexier [2384] more Rippling shoulders uh obviously the [2386] second the reason why I'm going to get [2388] in trouble for that the reason why is [2390] because like anything you know building [2394] muscle takes time there are processes [2396] that need to occur in your body your [2398] body has to repair your muscle fibers [2400] synthesize new proteins has to digest [2403] your food and all that right the [2405] body is exactly the sorry the market is [2407] exactly the same as the body there are [2410] there is an inherent lag to processes in [2412] the market and the economy people take [2414] time to get back to you they take time [2416] to Maul over things they take time to [2418] respond to your cold emails or proposals [2420] and if you're not consistent if you [2422] instead just say well screw it I'm just [2424] going to send a million upwork [2426] applications and cold email today and [2428] and you know it's the same amount so [2430] maybe it'll work out regardless if you [2432] just do that you're not allowing the [2435] market [2436] to let you win you're not allowing the [2439] market to reward you for that [2441] consistency even if I work my ass off [2444] for those 15 hours in the gym and then [2446] you know in the other alternative I just [2447] like sort of half ass it and I work an [2449] hour every day I'm going to get way more [2450] results doing that hour every day than I [2452] ever would being like Arnold [2453] Schwarzenegger reborn or something like [2455] that for 15 hours okay so all you do is [2458] you just show up consistently for long [2460] enough if you can send more than five or [2462] 10 upwork applications a day or whatever [2463] I mean do it sure be consistent about it [2466] even if you cut that down to one or two [2468] or something if you are consistent about [2469] this for long enough eventually you will [2471] win this is just compounding over time [2473] and this is like one of the core [2474] fundamental rules of business time in [2477] the market beats time timing the market [2479] essentially all right I have one more [2481] step that I didn't talk about before and [2482] this is my thoughts on hiring no uh I [2485] guess journey to build an agency would [2486] be complete without this [2488] topic well here are my thoughts on it [2490] hiring for an agency is actually [2491] completely optional um you don't have to [2494] hire for an agency I think like a lot of [2495] people believe that successful agencies [2497] require a lot of people uh like require [2500] a lot of Staff members and I guess if [2501] you wanted to look at it from like just [2503] purely a revenue perspective that might [2505] be true but I think if you were to look [2506] at it from a profit perspective you'd [2507] see that typically bloated agencies [2509] don't really make that much in bottom [2510] line wise so I like to think that hiring [2512] free agency is completely optional [2514] especially because we've now seen a [2515] Resurgence or I guess a surge in oneman [2518] agencies sort of like my own um you can [2521] scale to very sizable numbers doing the [2523] vast majority of your work yourself or [2524] with one other person and I guess you [2526] just have to ask yourself how much money [2527] do you really want to make do you want [2528] to run a company that does $10 million a [2530] year but then you only keep 100 Grand or [2532] would you rather run a company that does [2533] $1 million a year but you keep 500 Grand [2535] I know I would definitely run a company [2537] that does the latter so here's some [2539] examples um there's myself obviously I [2541] scill to $72,000 a month with left click [2543] building hands-off grow systems for BB [2545] Founders and I want to say 95% % of that [2547] work was just me I did have a virtual [2549] assistant who I passed off some work to [2551] from time to time Brett at design Joy [2553] there's [2554] $145,000 a month completely solo he does [2557] all of his designs he does all of the [2558] agency work he does all the client [2559] management totally on his own this group [2563] here Nick and Alex at bake design I'm [2564] sure Nick is a handsome fella I could [2566] tell um they do something like 70 or [2568] $80,000 a month and it's just them two [2570] them and uh you know it's Nick and his [2571] co-founder Alex again they do designs [2574] the point that I'm making is you can do [2576] you can make a lot of money you can [2577] scale really big without necessarily [2580] compromising um on time so long as you [2582] set your business up right uh to begin [2584] with so the way that I usually recommend [2586] going about this is to get your first [2588] few customers get your first five or [2589] $10,000 in the agency space that's going [2592] to teach you a lot of fundamental client [2593] management skills that you just don't [2594] know that you don't know once you have [2596] these fundamental client management and [2597] business management skills then you take [2599] a step back and you ask yourself all [2600] right cool how can I structure my [2602] business in such a way that enables me [2603] now not just to hit5 or $10,000 but to [2606] hit $50,000 in a month that usually [2608] involves some level of productization [2610] usually involves some level of [2611] templating uh you know using Automation [2613] in your business not just selling [2614] automations uh and then you know [2616] leveraging alternative distribution [2618] streams all stuff that I'm going to talk [2619] about in uh in my next video that I [2621] record so if you do hire I do recommend [2623] doing it last focus on increasing your [2625] leverage as much as possible just using [2626] systems instead of people because the [2628] need and the expertise that human staff [2629] members can provide relative to like an [2631] AI model is decreasing I think if you [2633] were to like zoom in two years into the [2635] future or whatever it's the people that [2637] learn how to leverage themselves and [2639] maybe a small tight-nit team that are [2640] going to be the ones crushing in the [2642] future not like the big bloated [2643] dinosaurs because as we know you know [2644] technology is improving to the point [2646] where that will no longer really be [2647] possible that's that I hope you guys [2649] appreciated the video had a lot of fun [2650] putting it together if you guys have any [2651] questions about me yammering on for the [2653] last 45 minutes or so I think it's been [2655] a while uh feel free to leave them down [2656] below more than happy to get back to you [2658] same if you guys have any content ideas [2659] for me otherwise if you guys could do me [2661] a solid and if you're not already [2662] subscribed sad face emoji uh then do [2665] that now and then like the video to pump [2667] to the top of the ago I really [2668] appreciate your time have a lovely rest [2669] of the day and I'll catch you on the [2670] next vid cheers

Title: The 7-Figure AI Agency Pricing Strategy That ACTUALLY Works
[0] hey Nick here I made over $100,000 this [2] month using automation andm make.com as [4] we all know automation has a ton of [6] moving parts and the biggest and hardest [7] one for me to figure out personally was [9] pricing so what I want to do in this [11] video is I want to break down how to [12] price Automation Services effectively [15] I'm going to give you guys a simple [16] step-by-step way that you can do so and [18] I'm going to show you eight distinct and [20] exhaustive pricing methods that I and [22] many other people in my communities use [24] to price their projects if that sounds [26] good to you then stay tuned and let's [28] get into it [31] I hope you guys got a pen and paper cuz [33] we are breaking out the spreadsheet for [34] this one as per always just a little [36] Preamble this is my own process and my [38] own thinking it got me to $72,000 a [41] month with my own automation agency but [42] I'm not trying to say that this is the [43] only way that you can do things if I [45] were you I would take what works leave [47] the rest another little disclaimer uh is [49] naturally that there are many ways to [51] price uh one thing that I will let you [53] guys know right off the bat is that no [55] pricing methods are perfect like there [56] is no pricing method that is perfect in [58] every way shape or form all of them [60] actually have drawbacks and not a lot of [62] people that are talking about this are [63] going to tell you um the reality is some [65] are better than others for different [67] circumstances different offers and [69] different services that you're selling [70] so I'm going to try and get pretty [72] nuanced with it uh I don't want to just [74] give you guys a simple price this way [75] that way and that way answer because I [77] don't really feel like that's fair to [78] the concept of pricing in general so you [80] don't actually need to use all of the [82] pricing methods I'm going to talk about [84] um a good example of one is you know you [86] would not charge a percentage of revenue [87] for something not in your control for [89] instance I'm I'm going to talk about um [90] how to do percentage based pricing in a [92] minute but that's just a good example of [94] how you know some methods are going to [95] work better for specific circumstances [97] than others you probably also would [99] charge different types of companies [101] differently so you wouldn't charge a [102] small to midsize business at about 10 [104] staff members the same way that you [106] charge an Enterprise company to a [107] thousand staff members odds are they [109] also probably have their own rules and [110] regulations and you know internal [112] policies that dictate how they price or [114] how they uh uh uh work with vendors so [116] you know you're going to have to work [117] around that I'll mention that a little [118] bit later on in the video another thing [120] I'll say is that some methods work [121] better for different stages of your [122] business hourly pricing is super popular [125] especially on jobs platforms like upwork [127] and stuff like that it's very simple to [128] get started with I actually recommend [130] people that have never made money on the [131] internet to start with it but note that [133] it becomes super limiting as you grow [135] and as you scale your business I'm going [136] to cover that uh and really just to Loop [139] it all together the best agencies [141] constantly re-evaluate the best ways to [143] price to maximize their value so if you [145] want to be one of those aformentioned [147] best agencies you should probably do [149] that too [150] okay great let's dive into method number [153] one we are going to start with hourly [155] just because hourly is by far the most [157] popular I'm going to zoom in a little [158] bit here and I think I'm going to put my [160] face in the top right hand corner this [161] time just to be a little spicy so here's [163] a quick example of what hourly pricing [165] might look like you get a client on [166] upwork they want you to build a simple [168] automation from the ground up that's [170] custom to automate some repetitive data [173] entry task maybe you are grabbing data [175] from Source pasting it into a [177] spreadsheet something like that you [179] think that it's it's going to take maybe [180] four or five hours so you tell the [181] client and then they say great they [184] accept the offer you guys do all this [186] fun stuff together on the platform and [188] then the billing begins at $100 per hour [189] until the project is complete uh if the [191] client adjusts the scope or wants [193] something new you're just going to [194] continue billing them at that rate this [196] is how the vast majority of hourly gigs [198] go typically this works best for very [200] small projects uh Discovery phases with [203] high uncertainty in scope that means [205] that you know the client doesn't really [206] know what they don't know so just to [208] hedge their bets they don't want to pay [209] somebody 10,000 or [211] $100,000 uh for something they're not [213] really entirely sure that they want [215] automation agencies and Freelancers that [217] are at the start line of their business [218] tend to choose this as well um and [221] there's also some good and some bad so [222] the good between the good involved in [225] pricing on an hourly basis is that it's [227] super easy to start right if you think [229] about it hourly pricing is the default [232] everybody on planet Earth after the age [234] of five sort of understands how this [235] work how this works the calendar sorry [238] the calendar good God the clock goes by [240] one hour and every time that that [242] happens you receive a certain amount of [244] money in your pocket um or on your time [247] sheet it's very well defined it's [249] supported by all major freelancing [251] platforms just where a lot of newbies [253] get started on it's something that just [255] sort of transends you having to explain [257] it and it also appears from the client [259] perspective very low risk so these are [261] all the good points in hourly pricing [263] this is the main reason why somebody [264] might want to uh start with hourly [265] pricing just because it minimizes [267] friction let's see get up and running [269] let's you get your first a couple jobs [270] out of the way you'll notice that the [272] bad is a lot longer than the good here [274] and the reason why is because if you [276] think about it logically the time that [278] you spend building a system does not [281] accurately reflect the value that you [283] bring to an organization especially [286] nowadays with templated systems and [288] solutions like make.com Zapp or no code [292] it's the time that you spent and [293] invested learning how to build those [296] things and maybe building out those [298] templates that actually matters that's [300] what actually reflects the value you [301] bring to an organization so the point [303] I'm making is if you're really really [305] good you're going to work much faster [307] than other people and you're going to [309] make less money because of it so why [311] would you want to commit to hourly [313] pricing uh if it's not just your first [316] few gigs and if it's not just this [317] crutch because it penalizes you for [319] doing good work fast it's silly I should [322] also note that this actually can be less [324] appealing to clients sometimes [326] especially in larger projects because [328] from their perspective you know cost can [330] escalate there's no fixed uh cap to it [333] they don't really know when costs are [334] going to end things typically in the [337] contractor world go over budget and over [342] schedule as well and you know a lot of [344] clients are are cognizant of that so the [346] reason why I talk about hourly here is [348] just to show you guys that this is a [350] viable way to Price It's especially [352] powerful if you're just getting off the [354] ground I definitely took a lot of hourly [356] gigs when I got started in automation um [358] even in content writing before that um [361] even in like webdev freelancing before [363] that and it's it's totally cool because [364] you know it allows you to figure out how [366] to do client management it allows you to [368] figure out a lot of the things that um [370] you won't know until you actually find [371] yourself in some sort of contract but [374] the second that you have a couple of [375] hourly gigs it's best to uh offramp and [379] switch to one of the subsequent models [380] that I'm going to talk about in a [382] minute so now we get away from hourly [385] and now we're moving into higher value [388] ways of pricing calling these value [390] based methods they're all fixed price [392] that just means that instead of you [394] being buildt or instead of you billing [396] the customer or client based off time [398] you actually just give them like a fixed [399] amount of money and then based off that [401] fixed amount of money you can build them [403] maybe half UPF front half after the [404] Project's completed if it's like a big [406] Enterprise company a lot of the time [408] they'll want to work um based off what [410] are called Milestones or tranches which [411] is where uh you know maybe it's like 25% [414] at the beginning and then 25% after some [416] Milestone is completed 25% after another [418] one's completed then another 25% at the [420] end any that part isn't super important [422] just understand the broader concept here [424] here's how this first way of value based [425] pricing works it's called cost saving so [428] example A friend of yours runs a [430] Consulting business right now it costs [432] this Consulting business $50,000 a year [435] to pay a staff member whose sole job it [437] is is to generate reports they do [440] analyses graphs spreadsheets package [442] them in a PDF send them off to customers [444] this is extraordinarily common there are [445] a lot of Consulting businesses that pay [447] people you know between 50 to 100 ,000 a [450] year just to do like this now you [452] being a proficient automation engineer [453] that has watched all of my YouTube [455] videos you are confident that you can [456] automate this completely and save that [458] company $50,000 annually so the way that [461] you would do cost saving based pricing [463] in this manner would be to charge them [465] 25% of the savings so somewhere between [468] 10 and $155,000 why didn't I just write [470] $12,500 I don't know I guess it was a [472] little bit sleepy uh the point that I'm [474] making is what you do is you figure out [476] how much money you're saving the company [477] with the system and then you charge some [480] percentage of that money you can only do [483] this if you obviously talk to the [484] customer if you consult with them if you [487] figure out their pain points and how [488] much money uh this lack of a solution is [491] is impacting in terms of their bottom [493] line but once you know that you have a [495] ton of Leverage in negotiations uh and [497] you can charge some percentage of that [499] to help their business out so this is [501] the first method there's another method [503] in a second Revenue uplift which I'll [504] talk about but this works really really [506] well as an off-ramp or a transition from [508] Pure hourly based price [510] typically this works best with [512] automations that directly reduce [513] operating expense or they streamline [515] some sort of very resource heavy task [517] that contractor or consultant that costs [519] $50,000 a year is a good example larger [522] companies with high revenues but poor [523] margins or inefficient operations are [525] great targets here because let's think [527] about it if a company makes $100 million [530] a year and if you can improve their [532] margins by 1% you are making that [535] company a million dollars a year right [537] so they can justify spending a lot of [538] money on you [540] it doesn't really work as well in the [541] other way around like if a company's [543] making $10,000 a month let's say [545] hypothetically and you can shave 1% off [548] their margins while uh what is that [550] like a hundred extra dollars a month you [551] can't really justify too much from there [553] but I think you guys kind of get my [554] point it does take a few clients before [556] you can intuitively scope projects like [558] this a lot of the time uh one thing that [560] I see in my community specifically my [562] beginner Community maker school is [564] people really struggle with talking [566] about about money about dollars with [568] customers or prospects uh at the time I [569] should say you know they just feel like [571] it's this elephant in the room that's [572] kind of staring them down but they just [574] can't really get down to Brass tax and [576] okay so how much money is this costing [577] you oh you don't know well let's figure [578] it out right now together so if you're [581] just at the very start line of your [582] automation business your agency and you [584] haven't really figured out how best to [586] talk about stuff like that you may find [587] this difficult you may also screw up a [589] little bit you might quote either way [591] too much money or way uh too little [593] money a few times that's all right this [594] is all just part of a learning [595] experience um at least now you know what [597] this is so the real benefits here is [600] that cost-saving based pricing is not [602] tied to your time it is way more [604] scalable than something like hourly [605] which we talked about a moment ago it [607] also lets you template out your work it [609] aligns incentives between you and the [611] client what I mean by aligning [612] incentives is instead of you being [614] penalized for doing a faster job better [617] if you do a faster job better you're [618] rewarded because you just did the same [620] job and made the same amount of money in [622] a fraction of the time you can make [624] 10,000 bucks in a few hours if you build [626] it right there are a lot of systems out [628] there that do stuff like what I just [630] talked about generate reports and assets [632] and PDFs that can literally eliminate a [635] staff member like Terminator T2 style um [638] I'll be back that you know you can build [641] in just a few hours and you can charge 5 [643] 10 15 $20,000 for it right and note that [647] you know I'm charging them 25% of the [648] savings here or in this hypothetical [649] we're doing this on an annual rate so uh [653] you know in this case it's probably be [654] like a onetime build plus some sort of [656] like low monthly maintenance I'll get [657] into retainers and subscriptions in a [659] moment but uh yeah you can make a ton of [661] money in a few hours if you if you build [663] this right the bad here and there is [666] always bad as I mention no pricing [668] method is perfect is it's harder to [670] justify saving money in practice than it [672] is to making more money uh the gap [675] between the money that you save them and [677] the money you charge for them is also [679] there will always be a gap you will [681] never be able to charge like $50,000 for [683] a system that saves somebody $50,000 the [685] reason why is because you got to think [686] of it from the client perspective they [688] have a solution right now that cost them [689] 50 Grand and it works right it does the [692] thing that it's supposed to do your [694] solution might cost [695] $10,000 but there's uncertainty you [697] don't know if it's going to work there's [699] a risk on behalf of the client they [703] aren't entirely sure if you're the [704] professional that maybe you seem to be [706] there's risk on behalf of the [708] Technologies they don't know if these [709] technologies have 100% uptime they don't [711] know if there might potentially be some [713] issues with them there's costs for the [715] technology there's costs for your time [717] that might be hidden right the point of [719] making is you can never actually charge [720] the amount of money that you save you [721] can only ever charge a fraction of that [722] in context you can usually do up to [725] about half or so I mean this is like a a [727] loose rule of thumb that I'm just giving [729] you guys from my own experience here I [731] have only ever charged up to about half [732] of the savings and that was when the [734] client was extraordinarily confident in [736] me very risk tolerant we had basically [738] no maintenance cost we had basically no [740] infrastructural cost so yeah that's the [742] bad is you guys can tell this is still [744] way better than hourly pricing but no [746] pricing method is perfect let's move on [748] to the Third [750] the third major method is called Revenue [751] uplift or rather I just decided I would [753] call it Revenue uplift so now we're all [754] calling it Revenue uplift the example [757] here is you're working with an agency uh [759] you build them a cold email system that [761] you project will net them $10,000 a [763] month in sales about 120k a year so what [766] you do is you charge them a one-time fee [768] of [769] $3,000 for this system which is 30% of [772] rev and that's just to set up the the [773] system to I don't know connect the [775] mailbox to do whatever hyinks you need [776] to do in the background along with a [778] monthly man cost of $2,000 20% of [781] Revenue why did I break it up like this [783] well I broke it up like this just to [784] show you guys that at the end of the day [786] this is your business this is your [787] freelancing operation you could do [788] whatever the hell you want you could [789] charge an upfront amount for a certain [791] thing and then a monthly amount for [792] another thing um I I'm just trying to [794] show you guys you guys can be flexible [795] in the way you do these pricing uh you [797] know the these proposals I want you guys [799] to know that there are a variety of [800] options here and you can also mix and [802] match them however you like so typically [805] how does this work um typically this [806] works best with sales and marketing [808] automations that have clear attributable [809] Revenue impact what I mean by Revenue [812] impact is I mean like you know it's a [813] sales system it's a growth system it [815] does something on the front end it DMS [817] people on LinkedIn or it cold emails [819] people uh by scraping their their leads [821] from Apollo or something right it's it's [823] something involved an Outreach something [825] involveed at the front end of a business [826] and because it's involved at the front [828] end of the business you can typically [829] actually take uh you can typically [831] actually make a lot more money with [832] stuff like this right you can only ever [834] save 100% of your Revenue but you can [836] make an infinite percentage more of your [839] menue so what I find in practice is [841] beginners also find this difficult just [843] because again they don't really know how [844] to talk about money they don't really [845] know how to conceptualize what the [847] customer lifetime value is if a business [849] uh I don't know every 10 meetings they [852] close one client and the client is worth [854] $10,000 you can kind of think of it as [856] that meaning in and of itself is worth [858] $1,000 to that business right well you [860] can continue reverse engineering from [862] there to figure out how much a lead is [863] worth how much money that the company [865] would need to spend to acquire an [866] equivalent thing you you can do a bun of [868] ma a bunch of math but a lot of the time [869] I find that you know beginners just they [871] just can't because they don't have the [872] experience they don't have like the [873] business knowledge so yeah this is [875] definitely a little bit harder um it's [877] harder than uh hourly but uh maybe it's [880] about on the same level as cost savings [882] okay so the good is again this isn't [884] tied to your time it's much more [886] scalable it lets you template out your [888] work and it aligns incentives between [889] you and the client you can also make [891] 10,000 bucks in a few hours if you build [893] this right the bad is the gap between [896] the money that you think that you're [897] going to make them and the money that [898] you actually charge for the system is [900] again a product of these three things [903] and in practice I find that you can [906] charge a lower fraction of the money for [909] Revenue uplift than you can for cost [911] savings so what I what do I mean by this [913] well you know in the previous example we [914] saved a company $50,000 and then I said [917] the maximum that I've realistically [918] charged about half and you know I've [919] worked on a ton of projects here so I [921] don't really think this is just my own [922] lack of confidence I think that there is [924] some theoretical limit here and it's [925] about half um you know you wouldn't be [928] able to charge half of the equivalent [930] value that you bring to a company [931] Revenue wise that would just be crazy [933] companies also have like operational [935] costs to acquire sorry operational uh [937] cost to like uh fulfill the deal right [940] they have a lot of Revenue uncertainty [942] um they have like operational [943] uncertainty they have debts a lot of the [945] time right so if you were to charge them [947] 50% of every dollar that you made them [948] um most of them wouldn't be able to [950] survive in practice I find 30% is like [952] that theoretical limit um most of the [954] time it's less most of the time it's [955] like 10 15 20% uh but you know obviously [958] you could still make a ton of money on [959] this and I'm going to show you a few [960] alternative Revenue uplift models in a [962] moment that frame this just so that it's [964] not like a onetime fee it's sort of like [966] a distributed recurring fee based off of [969] performance okay speaking of performance [972] this one is the per outcome model now I [974] say EG meetings booked just because [976] that's the simplest way for me to [977] conceptualize this because I sell a ton [978] of cold email here's a quick example [981] you're working with an agency you build [983] them a cold email system and you project [985] just based off of I don't know the [987] volumes that you guys are going on the [988] math that you've done done based off [989] similar offers and all that stuff that [991] you're going to book them about 20 [992] meetings per month so maybe one every [994] business day or so now historically they [997] close a quarter of those so they close [999] 20 divided by four five right and the [1002] customer lifetime value of that is [1003] $2,000 so if you do the math basically [1006] what I'm trying to show you is this is [1007] equivalent to this right it's about the [1008] same thing 10,000 bucks a month over [1010] here 10,000 bucks a month over here so [1012] what you do is you pitch them that first [1014] thing and they say you know man I don't [1016] really like this I don't really think [1018] that this is feas or possible uh I don't [1021] have the money to spend up front why [1022] don't you only pay me uh or you know [1024] I'll only pay you on on results or [1026] something so what you do instead is you [1027] pivot and you charge them a per meeting [1030] rate of $150 each instead so instead of [1033] you getting that money upfront sort of [1034] guaranteed what you do is you say hey I [1036] completely understand I'm going to [1038] charge you based off of the outcome [1039] because that's how confident I am that [1041] I'm going to crush it so if you do the [1043] math on this 20 meetings times 150 bucks [1045] well that's 3,000 bucks a month that's [1046] actually a little bit more than what we [1047] were charging before and in reality um [1050] you can make a lot more money with per [1051] outcome and revenue based uh Revenue [1053] percentage based splits which I'll talk [1054] about too than you can with like a fixed [1056] price thing simply because these things [1058] scale with performance and if you're a [1059] really high performer you can make a ton [1061] of money for other [1063] businesses okay so typically you do this [1065] with projects that have quantifiable [1067] outcomes that you are super confident [1068] you can deliver this is going to be [1069] stuff like meetings booked maybe you do [1071] some recruiting automation that's going [1072] to be candidates placed the unfortunate [1075] part is beginners are going to find this [1076] very difficult to do in practice because [1078] they're just not going to know enough in [1080] order to land these deals consistently [1082] or get these booked meetings or get [1083] these candidates the kind of terrible [1086] irony is unfortunately it's usually [1088] beginners that take these projects on [1089] disproportionately because a lot of the [1091] time cheap clients will respond just [1093] like they did in my example they'll say [1095] no work unless uh you don't charge me [1097] anything UPF front only on Deal sign or [1099] something of that nature so a lot of the [1101] time you will sort of be forced to do [1103] this as a beginner especially if you [1105] have no real experience under your belt [1106] and you just want to get a case study [1108] through the uh through the gate um which [1110] I find just hilarious I mean I did a [1111] couple of these as well when I was first [1113] starting out I I had a couple of them [1115] that worked the vast majority of them [1116] did not just to be completely clear with [1118] you I've also had a few people that I [1120] work with now that charge per outcome [1123] and they make a boatload of money [1124] because they're pros at it we're talking [1125] 3040 $50,000 a month so you know it's [1128] usually like a highrisk high reward [1130] thing that you only take on if you're [1132] good okay speaking of good the good is [1134] that it's a lot easier to conceptualize [1136] on the client perspective than an [1137] upfront cost in instead of the client [1139] spending $3,000 on you basically [1141] mentally they're saying well I'm going [1142] to spend $150 on him and then he's going [1144] to generate or I will wait for him to [1146] generate results and then I'm only going [1147] to have to spend $150 on them right so [1149] you're tying it to a performance metric [1151] technically there's unbanded upside you [1152] can make as much money as you want and [1154] since book meetings are probably [1156] entirely in your control in this example [1157] you are mostly responsible for how much [1159] money you make like if you're not [1160] delivering well that's not really on [1163] them right that's on you so you could [1164] just become better at what you do you [1166] could find a more effective method to [1168] squeeze all the value out of these colde [1170] leads and you'll make more money the bad [1172] is it's not stable it's not guaranteed [1175] there's no upfront Revenue though you [1177] may feel confident there will still be [1179] some circumstances that are definitely [1180] outside of your control um you also have [1182] no deposit you have no way of paying off [1184] startup costs if you think about this [1186] specific system which is cold email [1188] system you are going to have some [1189] startup costs you're going to have to [1190] buy some domains buy some mailboxes [1192] you're going to have to I don't know [1193] maybe pay somebody to set all of this [1194] stuff up for you if you don't have [1197] something to offset those initial [1198] startup cost you will basically always [1200] be operating at a loss until some [1202] inflection point theoretically I also [1204] find just anecdotally if a client [1206] doesn't pay you something like to start [1209] a project to kick off a project they [1211] tend not to be as locked in to that [1214] project and they tend to I don't really [1216] know what it is maybe the lack of like [1218] confirmation bias or cognitive [1220] dissonance or something they tend not to [1221] believe it in as much of they haven't [1222] paid for it which is funny cuz it's like [1225] well shouldn't you believe in it more [1226] because I'm doing it all without even [1227] charging you anything [1229] but clients are funny more generally [1231] humans are funny and that's sort of how [1233] we do things the last thing I'll mention [1235] here is payment schedules can suck too [1237] this is contingent on how you set up the [1238] payments I recommend setting up your [1240] payment schedules as shortly as possible [1243] in as small interval as you can so most [1245] of the time we'll build people monthly [1247] right well if you're doing some type of [1248] per outcome based thing don't build them [1250] monthly build them weekly um send an [1251] invoice every 7 days or something of [1253] that nature that counts up the number of [1255] meetings booked and then charges them [1257] better yet put them on autopay and you [1258] actually just decide how much it is and [1260] then build them obviously it takes some [1262] time to get to the point where you're [1263] confident enough to do these sorts of [1264] Arrangements but I think you guys get my [1265] point minimize the intervals all right [1268] another pricing method here is called [1270] the hourly retainer I think that's [1272] probably the most obvious uh you know [1275] way to transition from doing something [1277] purely hourly to getting some sort of Mr [1280] here here's a quick example let's say [1282] you've been working with a law firm for [1283] the last few months you've been creating [1284] simple systems that streamline their [1287] their I don't know uh patient patient [1289] they're uh uh man what the hell is that [1292] called patient client intake good God on [1294] average you Bill around 20 hours at $120 [1297] an hour next month you approach them [1299] with an offer you say hey Mr whatever [1303] instead of you paying me [1305] $2,400 at the end of the month why don't [1309] you prepay me 20 hours at A reduced rate [1312] of $100 an hour at the beginning of the [1315] month AKA instead of paying me 2,400 [1317] bucks at the end why don't you pay me [1319] $2,000 at the [1320] beginning you're going to get guaranteed [1324] sorry you're going to get cheaper uh [1326] hourly rate for me and you know that [1327] you're going to use and and exhaust my [1330] hours anyway and then I'm going to get [1332] guaranteed work so I'm going to be able [1333] to go to sleep at night without tearing [1335] my hair out so it becomes a win-win for [1337] both of you basically and this is one of [1339] the simplest ways to go from working [1342] entirely on a project basis to working [1344] on a consistent mrr or some sort of [1348] monthly recurring basis instead I took a [1350] ton of these when I started out hourly [1352] retainers were still hourly of course [1354] but they were also monthly and it was [1357] that monthly Revenue that gave me a ton [1359] of financial certainty that calmed me [1362] down quite a bit and enabled me to look [1363] a little bit further than just like the [1365] next day ahead you know I was able to [1367] start making longer term plans for weeks [1369] months years in advance so typically [1372] what this looks like is some sort of [1375] ongoing automation maintenance some [1377] incremental Improvement to systems um if [1380] a client hires you consistently every [1382] couple of weeks or something like that [1384] then pitch them on an hourly retainer [1386] instead save them a little bit of money [1389] save you a little bit of that [1391] variability the benefit there is that [1393] it's the simplest and easiest transition [1394] to a monthly payment model it's also [1396] great for beginners I highly [1398] recommend do hourly like if I could go [1401] back in time and tell myself I would do [1403] hourly and then I would try and [1405] transition at least one client to an [1407] hourly retainer and the second that I [1408] have that I'd be like okay I'm probably [1410] good enough to now start charging on a [1411] value basis instead you can also put [1414] your clients on autopay you can [1415] effectively buy yourself that Mr with [1417] the $400 differential which a lot of the [1419] time is worth it the bad is obviously [1421] it's still hourly your value is not [1422] being ideally represented because it's [1424] not really in the amount of time it took [1425] you to build that system right it's the [1427] amount of time energy and and resources [1429] that You' built up over your lifetime in [1431] this career still not too bad if I do [1434] say so myself uh the sixth is [1436] deliverable based retainers so quick [1439] example here and let me explain why this [1441] differs a lot from the previous retainer [1444] the example is let's say you've been [1445] working with a marketing agency for the [1446] last couple of months every few weeks [1449] this marketing agency will ask you for a [1450] consultation in that consultation you [1452] guys will discuss a system that you guys [1454] are building together and up until now [1456] the way that you've been pricing these [1457] systems is using the cost saving and [1459] revenue uplift models that we talked [1460] about earlier but you really like these [1463] clients you love them they love you and [1465] you want to turn your currently oneof [1467] Revenue into monthly recurring Revenue [1469] instead so here's what you do you [1470] approach them with a deliverable based [1472] retainer you say hey Dr Peter Dr Peter [1477] for $5,200 a month you'll get a weekly [1480] strategy call with me it's 45 minutes [1483] you'll get a monthly priority plan where [1485] we lay out the next four weeks of [1487] operational priorities you'll get daily [1489] slack availability where you can contact [1491] me within 15 minutes between 12:00 to 2 [1494] p.m. anybody on your team can I'll be [1496] your QA guy I'll help train them [1498] speaking of training I'll give you one [1499] 2hour team training session maybe if [1502] they're in your city you even go to [1503] their office and do this in person on [1506] top of that I'll also give you unlimited [1507] maintenance on Old projects you never [1509] have to pay me a one-off amount to fix [1511] up an old system or something I got you [1513] for life and in addition you know how [1515] you've been gushing over my YouTube [1517] videos that I've been posting and you [1519] love that system and that system and [1521] that system I will give you one of those [1522] systems every single month and install [1524] it in your business myself um you get to [1527] pick at the beginning of the month and [1528] then by the end of the month you'll [1529] you'll have it doesn't matter what [1530] system it is however complicated it is [1532] I'll do that for you all right so as you [1535] guys see we've shifted the value prop [1537] right previously the value prop was I [1539] will spend X hours with you or working [1541] for you and now the value prop is you [1544] will get X deliverable as a result of [1546] working with me aka the $5,200 a month [1550] that you spend will net you some sort of [1552] return on your investment right so [1555] typically this works best with clients [1557] that value your systems routinely [1558] consult with you uh it's also great for [1560] longer term growth oriented Partnerships [1562] I mention inbound clients here as well [1564] cuz this has been great for me as I've [1565] started growing my YouTube channel I've [1567] signed a lot more of these because [1569] people just instinctively like and trust [1570] you um I think they probably also listen [1573] to my logic around hourly pricing [1575] they're like yeah that's right let me [1576] just pay nick uh deliverable based [1578] instead so the good here is you have [1580] super high leverage okay you have [1582] control over all of your deliverables [1584] meaning you get to pick how you want to [1585] construct your retainer you don't have [1587] to construct it like did this is just [1588] how I personally do mine you guys can [1590] Str it however the hell you want so you [1593] could build it out in a way that's like [1595] hyper leverag that takes you as the [1597] service provider like two hours a month [1599] to do right and that means that you can [1601] feasibly make a lot of freaking money [1602] you can feasibly make like $500 an hour [1604] or more consistently over a long period [1607] of time and you can also just like [1608] before put your clients in autopay and [1610] then grow your Mr the thing is it's also [1613] and I mentioned I put this in the good [1615] for some reason it's very good that this [1616] is hard for beginners because we don't [1617] want any of them taking our money uh but [1620] it's very hard for beginners to do [1622] because they have to constantly justify [1624] their cost if their systems do not [1626] deliver an Roi they will be let go [1628] eventually and that's something that you [1629] just have to know so if you're charging [1632] some sort of hourly rate or or whatever [1634] uh it's personally a lot easier to [1636] justify this right because they can just [1637] cut you off at any time on the hourly on [1639] the hourly basis and also it's your time [1642] uh that they're they're paying for not [1644] necessarily your Roi but in this case it [1646] is strictly framed as like hey if you're [1648] paying me $5,200 I want to make you some [1651] multiple on that the only thing that you [1653] deliver are deliverables obviously so [1655] this calculation of does Nick generate [1656] me more than 5.2k a month uh I just find [1659] that it tends to happen substantially [1660] more often on a structure like this than [1662] it did on a structure like this so again [1665] it's just kind of a highrisk high reward [1666] thing you can make a lot more money in [1668] this method uh if you're a little better [1669] and more mature I want to say with your [1671] business processes it's just sort of [1674] what you got to do all right now I want [1676] to talk about two alternative actually [1677] one alternative pricing B based method [1680] and then I'll cover the last one which [1683] is pretty contentious which is uh [1684] percentage of Revenue but this is a very [1687] interesting pricing method and I've seen [1688] it happen a lot more in my community as [1690] of late specifically with people that [1691] are building SAS companies using no code [1694] tools what do I mean by this I mean you [1697] know SAS companies the capital s in [1699] there stands for software you're [1700] offering software as a service right [1703] well what you can do with a lot of no [1705] code tools is you can actually build out [1706] the infrastructure for a SAS company [1708] just in your no code editor in make.com [1710] or zapier or na10 or something like that [1712] you don't actually need to do all of [1713] that programming you could have a [1715] function that you know you have some [1717] website on the front end that people log [1719] into and then they put in some uh [1722] website brief and they say I want a [1723] website that looks like this it looks [1724] like that it looks like that and then [1725] you could send that request to your make [1727] scenario that could generate you a bunch [1729] of HTML and then you could spit it back [1730] at them and then voila you basically [1731] have your own SAS it's just your SAS is [1733] through your no code platform instead of [1735] code right so per asset based pricing I [1738] find in practice tents work really well [1740] um for that and a lot of people are [1741] using that um I have done per asset [1743] pricing myself just a couple of times I [1745] personally did not find it super [1747] valuable I ran a Content editing SAS um [1750] that actually worked specifically like [1752] basically exactly like how I just told [1753] you you just put in your content then it [1754] would sort of edit it for you um and [1756] then I charge per asset there but let me [1758] give you an example here because why the [1759] hell else did I write all this stuff the [1761] example is you create a Content [1762] production system that's light years [1763] ahead of what most other agencies are [1765] doing you start selling it to content [1766] and SEO agencies on a per asset cost [1769] that means that instead of selling the [1771] system itself you sell the deliverable [1774] which is an article and then you just [1776] charge a certain amount per deliverable [1779] right so if I generate 20 articles a [1783] month as a user of your system and [1786] everyone costs 20 bucks well then I'm [1789] paying you 400 bucks you can implement [1791] this in a variety of ways you could have [1792] this be instantaneous pricing where [1794] every time you do it you need to pay [1795] although I don't really recommend that [1796] there's a reason why a lot of companies [1798] is like this credit based stuff because [1799] when you spend money that isn't like [1800] money you tend to spend a lot more of it [1802] if you've ever wondered that's one of [1804] the main reasons it's also easier to [1805] deal with on your end obviously uh so a [1807] lot of the time in practice people do is [1809] you'll pay a certain amount of money for [1809] a certain number of credits and then [1811] it's like well great now you have those [1812] credits what are you going to do not [1813] spend them obviously you know you got to [1815] buy a 100 articles in order to make it [1817] into our thing um you know you're going [1819] to find a way to spend that other 99 so [1822] typically this works best for modular [1823] saslik products where each deliverable [1825] can be separately priced and implemented [1827] this works for contents so articles [1829] blogs books um assets like PDFs white [1832] papers you can do proposal generators [1834] this way uh legal so contracts reports [1837] like I was talking about in that first [1838] or second example way back when right if [1841] instead of you charging them some cost [1843] savings based thing you in said just [1844] charge with 50 bucks flat per report [1846] that might actually make sense for [1847] people now the good here is that it's [1849] super easy to productize the initial [1851] upfront cost on the customer side of [1853] things is usually really low as well so [1855] um your deliverable costs usually a lot [1857] less than whatever the customer is doing [1859] before meaning that like as a company [1860] you can fix your costs and you can just [1862] make your your fee is a multiple of [1864] whatever it costs you internally to run [1865] your no code tool so if uh I don't know [1867] you're paying 5,000 bucks a month for [1870] software and then you generate a 100 [1871] articles it's sort of like $50 a month [1874] per in every individual article well if [1876] you charge a $100 per article you know [1877] that you're making 50 bucks on that [1879] right pretty straightforward that's kind [1880] of a example because you're [1882] probably never going to get to a point [1883] where you're spending $50 an article [1885] especially in our uh you know [1886] enlightened AI age [1888] so yeah it's the most software likee way [1890] to price it's definitely the most [1891] scalable now the downside is despite the [1894] fact that it's super scalable it takes a [1895] long time to make like good money here [1897] if you think about it the cost saving [1898] method that I talked about there you [1899] could charge $122,500 for a system that [1903] saves $50,000 you could make $122,500 [1906] today if you wanted to scale the [1909] $122,500 with a par asset based system [1911] well you need to sell 600 and something [1915] um articles right that might take you a [1917] lot longer to do so so it's a lot more [1919] scalable just like SAS companies but it [1921] takes a lot longer to grow um you're [1922] probably going to start from zero bucks [1924] every month unless you have some [1925] recurring model as well and the [1927] detriment is you also have to build [1928] infrastructure to track outputs which [1930] can be an ordeal in and of itself you're [1931] basically building like a whole other [1932] SAS app there not to mention no deposit [1935] unless you ask for one no way of paying [1936] off your startup costs and then the lack [1939] of lock in on the client usually reduces [1941] perceived value it hits your ability to [1943] like get that nice 10 15 $20,000 White [1946] Glove project price so I don't really do [1949] this to like make my money I've done and [1950] experimented with this a couple times [1952] but I'm bringing this up because I've [1953] seen it in my communities and there are [1954] a few people that are doing quite well [1955] all things considered all right now we [1958] make it to the daddy of pricing models [1960] uh this is the percentage of Revenue [1963] quick example you build this amazing [1965] LinkedIn DM plus voicemail drop system [1967] and it reaches out to people it leaves [1970] customized messages based on their [1971] profile you then hire a closer and [1974] install a closer in your business this [1976] is a salesperson that you know closes [1978] the deal your system takes very little [1980] setup time it's mostly templated and [1981] you're hyper confident that it works [1983] because maybe that's what you're doing [1984] for your own business that's how you're [1985] getting your own customers now you know [1987] of this old business acquaintance Dr [1989] Peter Who currently needs leads and who [1992] could use a system like this to scale up [1994] his business so you offer him a deal uh [1996] Hey Dr Peter I'm going to generate [1998] nurture qualify and close all of the [2000] leads using this system and all you have [2004] to do is fulfill them okay so you are a [2007] marketing company or maybe you you sell [2010] ads PPC I will generate you the clients [2013] and then all you have to do is just [2015] fulfill the clients in exchange all [2017] you're going to do is pay me 25% of the [2019] gross revenue of each deal maybe this is [2021] more money than you were paying before [2022] to get your own clients but it's [2024] consistent as hell and you know exactly [2027] how much money you're going to pay for [2028] it every time right benefits for you you [2030] can make an insane amount of money doing [2032] this you can make a crazy amount of [2034] money but you have to be really good at [2036] what you do and set things up so [2039] typically Revenue generating automations [2041] where there's a clear correlation [2042] between Automation and income work so [2044] this is almost always going to be [2045] something on the front end it's going to [2045] be sales right because we're doing a [2047] percentage of Revenue the good here is [2049] that you have super high earnings [2050] potential technically they're unbounded [2052] Partnerships like these are how you make [2053] the multi6 figure revenues I think if [2055] you look at anybody that's like between [2057] my Revenue range and maybe like a [2058] million and a half a month or something [2060] they basically all have some sort of [2061] partnership based thing going on where [2063] they will produce some insane uh [2066] leverage on the front end and then just [2068] take some cut on the back end you can [2070] kind of think of this like this is what [2070] a lot of affiliate people do as well [2072] they take a percentage of the sale [2073] attributed to the lead that they [2074] generate um and so on and so forth if [2077] your systems are good and you trust the [2078] people you partner with you can print [2079] money you can also use very strong [2081] offers in this way to sell clients for [2083] your own company because you handle [2085] everything and the customer pays zero I [2087] mean think about the offer right I think [2088] Alex porosi talks about the perfect [2090] offer and it's like we'll do everything [2091] for you it'll cost you $ Z we'll take [2094] like a certain percentage and if it [2096] doesn't work and you don't make this [2097] much will even pay you right it's like [2099] the perfect offer well you actually get [2100] to use the perfect offer um logically [2102] speaking you would have to be very silly [2104] to say no to something like that at face [2105] value it's like hey I only make money [2107] when I make you money therefore there's [2109] zero risk why the hell not that said you [2112] do have to make sure you trust the [2113] people so you should have a strong [2114] venting process if you do this now [2116] here's the bad the bad is you may not [2120] always have total control over the [2122] outcome here so you also don't get paid [2124] anything upfront right unless you [2126] structure it in a way where you do and [2128] some people do right like the growth [2130] partner model who was popularized by [2131] this one guy that I used to follow on [2133] Twitter somebody in the comments will [2134] know uh does this where like you I don't [2137] know pay 10 or 15 or 20 grand up front [2138] or something like that and you get like [2140] 7% of the revenue as well so you can [2142] offset this but you know just speaking [2144] percentage of Revenue you don't get paid [2146] anything up front which could impact [2147] your ability to deliver this at scale [2148] especially if it has high costs and [2151] again you have to be very good at your [2152]  in order to make this work if [2153] you're not good at your your your [2155] service if you're not confident that you [2156] can deliver what it is that you're [2158] promising you're not going to make any [2159] money and it's just going to be all cost [2161] for you similarly to what I talked about [2163] before with the per outcome model [2166] unfortunately I find a lot of beginners [2168] get stuck here because they pitch some [2172] offer to somebody and then they say I [2174] don't want to do it that way I only want [2175] to do it if uh when I make money you [2177] make money so let's do it that way if [2178] you're that confident about your service [2179] you might as well right which I [2181] understand the idea but obviously that [2183] doesn't really help you get your agency [2184] off the ground if you're a total newbie [2186] right so again I ially it's a lot of [2188] newbies that try this stuff fail and [2190] then are like I'm never doing percentage [2191] of Revenue again but it's it's just a [2192] time and a place thing you just have to [2193] be skilled enough you have to be um [2195] obviously you have to have like this [2196] good uh a good Network in order to make [2198] this stuff work and you have to trust [2199] the people uh that you you partner with [2203] so obviously the big question is now [2205] which one is best typically my rule of [2206] thumb and you can do this if you believe [2210] in the stuff that I've been telling you [2211] guys about over the course of the last [2212] few months and if you don't you don't [2214] have to but typically my rule of thumb [2215] is if you're a total newbie the fastest [2218] way to go from that total newbie to that [2220] expert that I talked about [2221] earlier is to go hourly it is well [2224] established it's a very easy transition [2227] from a 9 to5 it's the way that the vast [2228] majority of the corporate world works so [2230] it's not going to be uncomfortable for [2231] you it's not going to be uncomfortable [2232] for the client all you're looking to do [2234] at that first stage is to make your [2235] first few bucks in the internet we [2237] minimizing friction just go hourly it's [2238] super [2240] straightforward after you get your first [2241] few clients and maybe one of those [2243] clients is an hourly retainer or [2245] something begin charging based on value [2248] remember I talked about two value based [2249] methods there was cost savings or [2251] Revenue uplift cost savings is going to [2253] be better if you're working with large [2254] businesses with small margins and then [2257] uh Revenue uplift is going to be better [2259] for small businesses with large margins [2260] tend to be a lot hungrier let's combine [2262] this with some type of retainer or [2263] subscription based pricing for added [2265] leverage so that you're not restarting [2266] from zero every month maybe this is like [2269] clients 1 to three maybe this is like [2271] clients 3 to 10 or 3 to 15 or something [2274] and then if you become a professional [2275] and you become confident your ability to [2278] start experimenting with per outcome or [2280] per percentage [2282] based um sales methods also combining [2287] with retainers or subscription based [2288] pricing for leverage and this is how I [2290] know assuming you've found that Golden [2293] Goose sling henling golden eggs or some [2296]  like that whatever the saying go [2298] this is where you can start scaling up [2300] your Revenue extraordinarily quickly [2301] you'll eventually find some button on [2304] the internet that you press and every [2306] time you press you make dollar you'll [2308] just start spamming that button like [2309] crazy with a model like this um and you [2312] know you'll you'll start making a lot [2313] more money awesome I really appreciate [2315] you guys' time if you guys have any [2316] questions about any of the pricing [2317] models that I mentioned just drop them [2318] down below I'm on a YouTube comment [2320] binge right now and I'm responding to as [2322] many of these puppies as I possibly can [2324] otherwise if you do me a big favor like [2327] subscribe please I think that there's a [2329] big chunk of y'all for whatever reason [2331] that aren't maybe it's just cuz uh I'm [2333] blowing up a little bit right now or [2334] something like that and a bunch of new [2335] people are seeing my content

Title: 5 Automations You Can Sell Today For $1,500 To $10,000 (Copy)
[0] hey everybody Nick here in the last [1] three months I've made almost [3] $300,000 with 94% profit margins using [6] Automation and make.com and this is [8] pretty nuts to me because up until just [9] a couple years ago I used to struggle [10] selling automations that were more than [11] like $500 the main reason for that is [14] because I just didn't know what to sell [15] I didn't know what systems were valuable [17] to business owners I didn't know what I [18] could put into a business and have [20] produced some sort of Roi and I know [22] many of you guys are in a similar [23] position so what I want to do in this [24] video is I want to cover five extremely [26] in demand High Roi automations that you [29] can build and sell today for between [31] $1,500 and $110,000 a pop if that sounds [33] like something you guys want to do stay [34] tuned and let's get into [37] it all right so we're breaking out the [39] slideshow again before we start I want [41] you guys to know that this is my own [43] process and thinking it got me to 72k a [45] month but it is by no means the only way [47] to get out there and do things so if I [49] were an automation uh freelancer or an [51] agency owner watching this video I would [52] take whatever makes sense to me and just [54] leave the rest no hard feelings and as [56] per usual no gatekeeping I'm just going [58] to show you guys everything and even [59] give you a whole systems that you could [60] sell so first and foremost what makes a [63] high Roi automation well in my view [65] there are four components the first is [68] that it needs to solve a dire hot button [71] business need it needs to be something [73] that improves the lives of the business [75] owner you're targeting I'm going to use [77] the term business owner a lot by the way [78] because I Target SMB small to midsize [80] businesses if you're targeting [81] Enterprise you might want to think of it [82] as stakeholder decision maker the second [85] component is there needs to be a clear [87] deliverable so there needs to be either [89] a document or an email or a CRM or a [91] line item on a spreadsheet or uh I wrote [93] email twice here apparently sucks a suck [96] uh basically your automation has to [97] create something and it needs to be [99] visible to customers I'm going to talk a [100] lot about that in a second the third is [102] you need to be able to deliver it using [104] templates or apis the reason for that is [106] because if the service that you're [107] delivering is unscalable if it's a thing [110] that does not scale you will never be [112] able to break out of like the five to [113] maybe $10,000 millu that a lot of [115] automation agencies and other types of [117] agencies to be honest tend to struggle [119] with and the fourth is that it's [121] platform agnostic what I mean by that is [123] you can build the same flow on three or [126] four software platforms you're not [127] reliant on just one software platform to [130] fulfill your need if you are then it [132] gets a lot harder to work with people [134] that might not have those software [135] platforms or aren't willing to install [136] them in your business now I want to [139] cover every single one of these in [140] detail because it's very important that [141] you understand these principles before [142] you actually get into the real systems a [145] couple of these are going to be very [146] interesting to you guys indeed so it [149] solves a hot D hot dire it solves a dire [151] hot button business need super hot [153] buttons uh simply put businesses will [156] always pay more solutions to problems [158] that are pressing so if the problem is [159] pressing right now they're willing to [161] pay a lot more than if it's something [163] that maybe they see in the future maybe [164] that they're forecasting but uh that [166] isn't exactly facing them at the moment [169] what is a pressing problem I Define it [171] as anything that impacts your ability to [173] generate Revenue save money or free [177] founder time again if you're working [178] with Enterprise people that might be [179] decision maker time stakeholder time [181] Department time something like that but [183] the important part here is I always see [185] every business problem in this lens I [188] look at it through these three factors [190] and if it doesn't impact one of these [192] three factors odds are it is not a [193] pressing problem it's to be frank [195] something that I just don't need to [196] concern myself with if I had two [199] automation agencies right and I just [200] spun up both and one targeted problems [204] that impacted your ability to generate [206] Revenue save money or free up founder [207] time and then the other ones I don't [210] know targeted other problems maybe like [212] how sexy your website looks or customer [214] satisfaction levels even which I guess [216] would contribute but not as directly [219] which agency do you think would do [220] better would obviously be the ones that [221] care more about generating Revenue [223] saving money or freeing founder time [224] because that's a lot of the time what [225] the business owners care about as well [227] right now the more urgent the need is [229] for any one of these three factors the [231] easier the sale and also the more money [232] that you'll be able to charge for an [234] automation when a business is actively [236] losing money or potential customers due [238] to inefficiencies for instance um [240] they're almost always willing to pay a [241] percentage of the money that they are [243] losing to rectify a problem and they're [245] often willing to pay more if it's [247] rectified quickly if there's some sort [248] of rush for it which is one of the [250] reasons why you need to be able to [251] template out these systems which I'll [253] cover in a moment so here's some [255] examples um maybe you have a whole team [257] of fulfillment staff at your content [258] marketing agency and they're just [260] waiting around kicking rocks doing [261] absolutely nothing because there are no [262] clients if that is the situation then [264] your need is more sales it's more uh you [267] know it's to generate Revenue [268] essentially another example might be [270] your support team for your SAS product [272] is overwhelmed with inquiries and [273] response times are lagging this is [274] leading to Major churn churn means that [276] you are impacting your ability to [278] generate Revenue so in this case your [279] need is more customer support uh and the [281] third example is maybe you run an agency [283] and your ability to process invoices [285] blows you don't have a good system for [287] this you routinely forget to follow up [289] with people or send invoices or collect [291] on payments um you know so on and so [293] forth your need is now a better invoice [295] process so the way that I see it is that [297] every single day that one of these above [299] problems generate Revenue save money or [301] free found or time is not solved will [304] cost a business in some way technically [306] this is referred to a lot of the time as [307] an opportunity cost it's not a direct [309] cost not like money is physically [310] flowing out of the bank account but you [312] consider it as lost Capital that [315] businesses were unable to make or recoup [317] as a result of not having these systems [318] in place so I'm saying we have a [320] theoretical sum of $1,000 right maybe [323] it's a $1,000 a day so it's about [324] $30,000 a month when you build an [327] automation that solves this problem that [329] is costing $330,000 a month an [331] opportunity cost you are in essence [333] making them that $30,000 in opportunity [335] cost back and your value is not aent [337] engineering agencies you get to charge [339] some fraction of the total amount that [341] you're paying that you're that you're [342] making them um as the cost of your [344] system so if you are making them $30,000 [348] in either generating Revenue saving [349] money or freeing founder time well now [351] you can charge some fraction of that you [352] can charge maybe a third of that maybe a [354] quarter of that or something along those [355] lines you could actually feasibly and [357] confidently charge $10,000 a month for a [359] system that makes a business $30,000 a [361] month and there's nothing wrong with [362] that I do it all the time the second [365] important component here is that your [367] automation needs to produce a clear [369] deliverable now the best automations [371] always produce tangible outputs what I [373] mean by tangible outputs are things that [375] like the customer can see that the [376] customer can almost feel hell maybe they [378] can print it out and look at it on a [379] piece of paper uh documents emails CRM [382] systems project management systems [384] assets you name it as long as it's [385] something that's a little more physical [388] then uh you're on the right track [390] the reason why is because systems [391] processes flows whatever you want to [393] call them they are by Nature immaterial [395] they are like software infrastructure [397] right you're shuttling data between one [399] module and the next where the hell are [401] these modules somewhere in the cloud [402] where the hell is the cloud I don't know [403] so your goal is to turn your system from [406] this blackbox vague thing into a [410] concrete thing that your client can [411] actually imagine touching and can [413] imagine feeling the value for this is [415] because they also tend to produce [417] immediate results the result being the [418] deliverable which is a lot easier to [420] quantify on the customer side of things [422] in terms of how valuable this is and [424] they also let you as an automation [425] agency or a freelancer claim a very [427] straightforward win it's like well what [428] did you do for me in the last month well [429] I generated you 3,000 of those right [432] that's tangible that's something you can [433] hold and assign value to uh and the real [436] value is that that makes transitioning [438] your relationship that is typically [440] starts off as like a one-off into a [441] retainer a lot easier and that's really [443] where the Leverage is in this business [445] model so I give you some examples here a [447] PDF generator system that produces a new [449] asset like a white paper a quote [450] estimate proposal whatever every time a [453] form is filled out that is tangible [455] that's something that produces a [456] deliverable at the customer and you can [458] track uh comprehensive CRM that your [461] client can navigate through click [462] buttons on upload stuff to interact this [465] is tangible this is something that the [467] customer can see on their screen they're [468] going to interact with it every day [469] there are buttons to click forms that [471] need to be filled out and that sort of [473] thing the third might be a cold email [474] system that generates an email for you [477] every time you get a new lead or a slack [478] notification for you or maybe all of [480] those two plus a CRM entry uh whenever [483] somebody responds to that email we're [485] essentially turning something that is a [487] little vaguer and a little more process [488] oriented into a deliverable for you and [490] your client to look at so even if your [492] system doesn't need deliverables in [494] order to work should underline this you [496] can often modify your system to include [498] them which greatly increases your [500] perceived value um and it just greatly [502] improves uh you know the the amount of [504] money that you can charge essentially [505] for said [507] system Okay the third big component [510] again is that you can build it using [511] templates so the best automations are [513] ones that you can put together quickly [514] using templates because it minimizes [516] your work it's going to minimize your [517] cost of goods so going to minimize the [519] number of opportunities for things to go [520] wrong and it lets you generate a [522] tangible return on the client investment [524] pretty quickly the more templat it is as [527] well the higher the leverage onid system [528] that just means that you can build a [530] system like one time and then you'll [532] only ever have to modify it um moving [534] forward and the modification is like a [537] fraction of the time it took you to [538] actually build it right like if I build [540] a system that does that PDF proposal [542] thing and then the only thing the only [544] step that I have to swap out is I just [545] have to swap out which template I'm [547] using that might take me like five [548] minutes or something right I copy the [550] blueprint that's 99% of my job and then [552] I just jump in change the ID of a [554] template press enter and deliver the [555] system that's extraordinarily High [557] leverage I don't have to build out a [558] $2,000 project every single time I can [561] build out a $2,000 project once and then [563] I can do maybe half an hour of work to [565] like wrap a nice bow on it and deliver [567] it to the client the theoretical ideal [570] system and not one that I have [571] personally built myself not one that I [573] basically see anybody build but if you [575] think about the theoretical ideal is a [577] system that is entirely deliverable [579] through API calls alone I.E you would [581] receive a payment that would trigger [583] some automation that you've set up and [585] then that flow that automation would [587] actually build out the whole client [588] deliverable in a Flash right the whole [590] client system uh I've experimented with [593] a couple of variants of this and we were [594] just talking about this in maker School [596] actually but you know you get a new cold [598] email client well then you make a few [599] API calls automatically buy some domain [601] names automatically idate some copy [603] automatically add that to some templates [605] automatically get some leads right you [607] can do a lot of this stuff completely [609] autonomously and that's the ideal system [612] it's very difficult to attain [614] practically you usually have to do some [615] manual service whether it's Consulting [617] with the client or reassuring them that [619] you're okay or recording videos for them [621] as deliverables but this is sort of like [623] the aim that we should get to as [624] automation agencies so I give you some [627] examples here like a CRM template that [628] you've already built once it's perfect [630] for the client industry and all you do [631] when you get a new client is you just [632] copy and paste it in their environment [633] voila done maybe you make a couple edits [635] but you guys get my point B might be a [638] series of blueprints that you import and [639] the client make.com environment that you [641] only make minor tweaks to afterwards [643] this could be that proposal generator [644] system thing that I've shown multiple [646] times on my channel um that you know you [648] just got to swap out the specific [649] template easy third might be some sort [652] of creative brief right maybe it's a [653] website generating automation it's a [655] little brief that asks questions you [657] know what colors do you like what styles [658] do you like what do you want on the site [660] they click a button and then that [662] triggers a flow that generates a whole [663] Business website and now you're selling [665] websites more so than a particular [667] system but I think you guys get my point [668] it's a templat [670] flow the fourth and last major component [673] is it needs to be platform agnostic what [675] need is too strong of a term but you're [677] a lot better off if it is platform [679] agnostic unless everybody on planet [680] Earth uses the platform like Google [682] Sheets or Google Docs or something like [684] that but ideal automations are ones that [686] don't depend on a particular software [688] platform to fulfill because this lets [689] you work with a variety of clients not [691] just those that have your stack [693] pre-existing or willing to pay for it [695] this makes it a lot easier to get your [696] first few jobs especially if you haven't [698] I don't know if if you're not at the [699] point where you're making five or [700] $10,000 a month yet um increasing the [703] the scope of the total client base that [705] you could work with uh is is very I mean [708] I would highly recommend it allows you [710] to get very simple and easy jobs on jobs [712] platforms like upwork Fiverr [714] freelancer.com that sort of thing and I [716] give you some examples down here like a [717] proposal generation system built in in [719] such a way that it works regardless of [720] platform maybe you typically do it with [722] pandadoc like I do but I don't know you [724] put a module in between that just maps [726] all of the same data fields that you [727] need and then all you really have to do [728] is just drag and drop you know Panda do [731] and hot swap it with docky sign or [732] something or maybe it's a cold email [734] system that works with all the major [735] providers you have like an instantly [737] module then you have a smart lead module [738] you have like a hey inbox module I think [741] there are a couple of these platforms I [742] don't know if that was the right one um [743] but I think you guys get my point all [746] right so let's actually look at the [747] automations that I've been building up [748] to here um before we dive in I want you [751] guys to know these are real systems that [752] are actually being sold successfully [753] today through cold email my automation [756] communities they're being sold through [757] upwork uh social media DMS uh and more [760] and you guys can build these systems [762] exactly as they're written I'm going to [763] show you guys flowcharts um or you guys [765] can produce variations of them they [767] fulfill all of the requirements above [768] and they're also built in such a way [769] that you can modify them to do so so [772] maybe you know I have a couple of CRM [773] templates you could swap those for um [775] click up to notion hypothetically I've [778] also talked about blueprints for [779] literally all of these systems they're [780] scattered throughout my YouTube channel [782] I'm going to include a link to my [783] gumroad here which is just like a place [785] that you can find all of my blueprints [787] compiled over the course of the last [788] eight months or so so feel free to poke [789] through there this is the first time [790] that you're watching or interacting the [792] first few times that you're watching or [793] interacting with my content you guys are [794] going to see a big library of blueprints [796] that you might be able to use and then [799] all of these simply because I use [800] make.com can be created using make.com [803] and I have created them using make.com [805] but you can also put them together with [806] an equivalent no code platform like [807] zappier or na10 you could theoretically [809] just just write all the stuff in code as [810] well although I obviously would not [812] recommend it because there's a lot more [813] leverage in no code all right let's get [817] into these actual systems here and I'm [818] cognizant of the fact that I'm cutting [820] this off a little bit um I'm going to [822] move my head in posts just so you guys [824] could still read everything the first is [826] a copy and paste industry specific CRM [830] this is a quick example of what this [831] might look like in clickup as you guys [833] can see this is separated into a variety [835] of [836] fields statuses I should say top leftand [839] Corner says template creative agencies [841] so this is a template that we sell to [843] creative agencies specifically these are [845] like ad agencies that whip up um ad [847] creative they do like videos they do um [850] you know like art and design and that [852] sort of stuff and essentially we've [853] split the CRM up into one two three four [857] five steps there's an intake step where [859] somebody books a meeting with you then [861] there's sorry an intake step where [862] somebody comes into the system there's a [864] meeting booked step where somebody books [865] a meeting with you there's a proposal [867] sent step where we send a proposal to [870] them post meeting uh closed lost which [873] is where somebody does not take action [875] within I believe it's 14 days or we [877] manually mark them as Clos lost and then [879] there's a closed one stage um and this [881] is set up in such a way that you can [882] very easily just connect this to a [883] project management system starts some [885] automatic onboarding which is another [886] system I'm going to show you guys in a [887] second uh and basically just like leaves [889] you open for for simple upsells so this [892] system I built in clickup but to give [894] you a description it's a CRM with the [896] bells and whistles customized to a [897] specific industry that you pre-built [899] ahead of time and that you're tackling [901] maybe you're tackling creative agencies [902] but maybe you're tackling I don't know [904] law firms maybe you're [906] tackling uh what else we got here [908] dentists maybe you're tackling um I [911] don't know like some sort of retail [912] business some sort of content influencer [914] creator some sort of um Professional [916] Service MSP I don't know the point is [918] you find your Niche and you build these [920] CRM specifically for that Niche that [922] solve a lot of those problems that that [923] Niche is suffering from you break the [925] stages into a flow that makes sense for [927] that particular stage right like if I'm [929] selling uh I don't know flowers and I [931] run a flower shop well my pipeline's [933] probably going to be a little bit [934] different than if I sell ad creative [936] right like a creative agency so you know [938] you by building this will demonstrate a [940] pretty deep and thorough understanding [942] of the niche uh which is a great leg in [944] sort of foot in the door that allows you [946] to build out other systems for them [947] later on in terms of the specific [949] problems that they suff that they solve [951] uh this solves the following hot button [953] needs it solves the fact that I'm [954] disorganized as hell it solves I have no [957] idea where my calls or appointments are [959] it solves I have no standardized way of [960] following up with leads it solves I'm [962] not making enough money it solves I'm [963] bleeding Revenue all of these right can [965] be framed in the context to generate [967] Revenue save money or save founder time [970] it also produces a clear deliverable [972] which is the system itself which you can [973] click into you can explore you can [974] organize you can also attach a few of [976] the systems I'm going to talk about [977] later to the CRM sort of as add-ons [979] that's the reason why I put this one [980] first um and then you can add extra [982] deliverables like templated assets [983] templated PDFs um I don't know things [986] resources that you send to the customer [987] automated videos whatever the hell you [989] want you can create templates very [991] easily and clickup that allow you to do [993] this copy and paste thing um you can [994] also build this in three to four major [996] project management platform so you can [997] build this in clickup but also notion [999] and Asana and Trello you know obviously [1001] the tools that you're going to use are [1002] going to be different in your Niche [1003] there are also a lot of very industry [1005] specific crms that you guys can co-opt [1007] and then build on top of using their [1008] apis right like law firms typically have [1011] their own little CRM stack for instance [1013] but I wanted to make this simple and [1015] accessible to you guys and I want you [1017] know you can sell this from anywhere [1018] from one .5k all the way up to $10,000 [1020] or more a US fixed price and that's with [1024] no add-ons or anything it's really just [1025] about the need of the customer as I [1027] mentioned how urgent that need is how [1029] you position yourself your Authority how [1032] quickly you build out the system as well [1033] and also some white glove stuff like uh [1036] your your customer support your customer [1037] service your ability to consult and that [1039] sort of stuff you can also charge an [1040] hourly rate to implement this or build [1042] this from the ground up although [1043] typically if you charge an allery rate [1044] for this you're going to make a lot less [1045] than if you go fixed price um and then [1046] you can also charge a monthly [1047] maintenance fee so you could charge like [1049] $500 to $1,000 to like maintain this or [1052] uh give somebody some sort of retainer [1053] with a fixed number of hours to just [1055] make little tweaks to it as necessary [1057] people will usually want to make some [1058] changes to copy and paste crms that you [1060] give them not because they think that [1062] it's a copy and paste CRM but because uh [1064] you know business owners typically just [1066] have their own slightly different way of [1067] doing things so might be as simple as [1069] renaming a couple of these stages it [1071] might be as simple as adding one or two [1072] additional ones this is about as [1074] minimalistic and to be honest about [1076] effective as you can get with one of [1077] these small to business small [1078] medium-size business um crms but you [1082] know a lot of the time people are going [1083] to want to use you to make changes and [1085] you should definitely be charging for [1086] that so that's system number one not bad [1089] hey system number two is a copy and [1091] paste industry specific content [1094] production system now the diagram that I [1096] have here I built in Whimsical it's a [1098] visual flowchart tool the reason why I [1100] built this in Whimsical is because I [1101] wanted to make this platform agnostic I [1103] didn't want to have to build out 17 [1105] different uh platform uh scrapers and [1107] tools and then Give Them All to You [1109] blueprint wise as awesome as that would [1110] probably be for all y'all that would [1111] take me three years so what I've done is [1114] I've put this together in Whimsical I [1115] have blueprints that show a very [1117] particular content production system you [1118] can very easily piece this together [1119] using the blueprints um on my gumroad [1122] but let me run you guys through this [1123] from top to bottom basically we need a [1125] way to scrape content that has already [1126] been produced on social media platforms [1128] so this is stuff like YouTube Twitter [1130] Instagram LinkedIn some other data [1131] source um appify or some alternative [1135] there are a variety sorry with appify or [1138] an alternative a variety of scraping [1139] tools that allow you to do this stuff [1141] that allow you to automate like pulling [1143] uh Channel's most recent 50 videos or [1146] something but the idea is you use this [1148] as the trigger or the entry point to the [1149] rest of the flow you scrape things like [1151] the titles of videos the transcripts of [1153] videos the descriptions maybe you scrape [1156] comments you scrape a bunch of stuff [1158] okay and then what you do is you filter [1160] out the invalid posts based on the title [1163] topic or some other column some of these [1165] posts will be invalid like when you [1168] scrape some things with um appify or for [1170] sorry Instagram or LinkedIn for instance [1173] sometimes you get a column that has [1175] keywords right maybe you're just looking [1178] only for Content that has particular [1179] keywords or something or maybe you're [1181] not looking for Content that contains [1182] another keyword so you filter it based [1184] off of some procedural elements is what [1186] I'm trying to say now you have a list of [1189] remaining posts what you do is you [1191] iterate through each of these and then [1192] you feed the titles the transcripts the [1195] descriptions or whatever the hell else [1197] data points you want into a large [1198] language model that's what llm stands [1200] for basically chat gbt gbt 40 uh Claude [1204] 3.5 or one of the Alternatives and then [1207] you use that llm to come up with some [1210] take on the content some variant of the [1212] content or if you really want to be [1214] parasitic you just have it rephrase the [1216] title or rephrase uh the the meaning of [1219] it anyway what you do is with that [1222] output you add the result to a Google [1224] sheet or your content Pipeline and then [1225] you use that to generate a bunch of [1227] metadata like uh as I mention titles [1229] excerpts keywords maybe you have an [1231] outline maybe you have a hook section if [1232] you guys watch my recent video here with [1234] the YouTube scraper this is sort of what [1236] I'm referring to you there and then at [1238] the very end this is optional but you [1239] can use all of that metadata to feed [1241] into a large language model and then [1243] create a bunch of new content as well so [1245] if you guys have seen my videos on my AI [1247] content gener this is basically what my [1249] AI content gener does that last step I [1251] feed in a brief which has like a title [1254] it has keywords it has some other [1256] additional pieces of information and [1258] then I go through through a flow that [1259] uses artificial intelligence to create [1260] Google Docs create outlines produce [1262] section text and ultimately end with a [1264] highquality article the point that I'm [1266] making is this is a system that is [1268] entirely doable and sellable right now [1270] all you need to go do is just piece [1272] together a couple of the systems on my [1274] gumroad and then voila you now have um a [1277] Content production system that you could [1278] sell from anywhere from $2,500 to [1281] $15,000 or so so this solves a couple of [1285] hot button needs as well um the main one [1286] is that I have no clue where to start [1288] with content I have no freaking ideas [1289] Nick I have no standardized production [1291] process my current production process is [1292] too expensive or my current production [1294] process costs too much money I guess [1296] both of those are the same thing but hey [1298] what are you going to do I was a little [1299] tired when I wrote all this the point [1301] that I'm making here is each of these [1302] impact uh your ability to generate [1304] Revenue your ability to save founder [1305] time or save money um and a system like [1308] this effectively addresses all of them [1310] it also produces a clear deliverable [1312] that's the actual content that you're [1313] creating right so that might be a Google [1315] doc could be a line and a spreadsheet [1317] you could hook this up to create like a [1319] video clip using transloaded or Banner [1321] bear or something like that uh you could [1324] create a Twitter post the point I'm [1326] getting at is it is a deliverable it's [1328] something the customer can see and feel [1329] put in their hands and ultimately feel [1331] happy with you can also take the core ID [1333] and just modify it into whatever you [1335] want by swapping out this beginning step [1337] and then swapping out that end step so [1339] you could swap out uh the platform that [1341] you're scraping right so maybe it's not [1342] YouTube like in my YouTube comment [1344] scraper it's something else and then you [1347] could swap out that last part here so [1348] instead of it generating like uh text [1351] blog post maybe it generates a video [1353] with Banner bear the way to template [1356] this is using blueprints in make [1358] alongside maybe some templated Google [1359] Sheets or something with little content [1361] pipelines you could just prepare this [1362] ahead of time it might take you like an [1364] hour or something to get all the [1365] infrastructure in and then now you have [1367] a template that you just copy and paste [1368] every time you do a service delivery and [1370] as I mentioned anywhere from 2.5 all the [1372] way up to 15K and that's fixed price no [1374] add-ons um as well as you could charge [1376] an hourly rate to implement it or make [1377] tweaks the big caveat here that I've [1380] personally faced and a few people in my [1381] community have faced as well is a lot of [1383] the time if you're selling to small [1384] business owners you know they don't [1385] really understand like the limitations [1387] or the technical realities these models [1388] so they usually have some requests about [1390] like changing the tone of voice or [1392] changing I don't know like uh adding [1395] really detailed citations and whatnot [1396] and you can certainly do this but it's [1398] typically not as easy as just like oh [1399] okay let me just make one tiny fix and [1401] then everything's solved right AI is [1402] flexible AI produces flexible outputs [1404] you're never going to be 100% satisfied [1406] with content like this but I think you [1407] can realistically get to 90 to 95% [1409] satisfied which is often uh much better [1412] than whatever the people were were doing [1413] anyway uh you can also charge a monthly [1415] maintenance fee for this you could [1416] charge 500 ,000 May $1,500 a month to [1419] maintain or make improvements to this [1421] this could be a very easy segue into a [1422] retainer product as I've talked about [1424] before so that is system number two [1428] system number three is a no warm-up [1430] industry specific cold email system in [1433] this cold email system what we're [1436] basically doing is we're setting up [1437] infrastructure that is capable of [1439] sending on day one if you guys have seen [1441] my previous email videos you'll know [1443] that a lot of the time you have to wait [1445] you have to warm something up for 14 or [1448] 21 days or something of that nature and [1450] it takes absolutely forever that's a big [1453] chunk of your ability to generate [1455] results quickly for clients just [1457] disappearing right well the cool part [1459] about this is there are now a few tools [1461] out there one of which being instantly [1463] that allow you to purchase pre-warmed up [1465] mailboxes and basically start sending [1466] within 24 hours uh and this is [1469] personally uh what I am going to switch [1471] to selling primarily just because there [1472] is so much leverage and value in being [1474] able to whip up a campaign like this [1476] within a day you could go from not [1479] having any you know a client not having [1481] a single lead in months to you [1483] generating them 15 20 30 40 leads in a [1486] day depending on the volume that you [1487] work with them on obviously any who this [1490] is what the flow looks like we buy [1491] domains using instantly pre-warmed or an [1494] alternative let me just show you guys [1495] this if you guys haven't done this [1496] before this is just an instantly account [1499] that I have set up here if I click add [1500] new you'll see there's a pre-warmed [1502] account section this is relatively new [1504] as of the time of this recording which [1505] was uh October the 30th 2024 you can [1508] actually just click this button and you [1509] can buy pre-warmed [1513] domains and then in addition to that you [1515] can actually buy pre-warmed mailboxes on [1518] those pre-warmed domains now these do [1520] have names that do not exist so I mean [1523] Heather is definitely not somebody in my [1524] company neither is Claire or Kayla so [1527] you have to be willing to sort of play [1528] fast and loose with the rules maybe you [1530] forward all emails from Kayla to Nick at [1533] left click can you say hey how's it [1534] going I'm picking up for Kayla thanks so [1535] much for getting back to me let me solve [1536] this problem for you but it's still a [1538] very quick and easy way you can get up [1540] and running with uh with this that [1541] shaves off a lot of time anyway that is [1545] step one step two select a predetermined [1547] number of mailboxes maybe 9 18 27 [1549] however many you want to wake uh you [1550] want to spin up the third is scrape [1553] however many leads you want some [1554] standardized amount using a platform [1555] like Apollo anyil finder leads rapidly [1557] you I'm talking about this is if we're [1559] doing this manually there are also [1560] automated ways that you can set up [1562] systems to do this for you if you're [1564] using something like leads rapidly which [1565] is the cheapest lead provider that I've [1567] been able to find and so far results are [1568] pretty good it's uh $3 per a th leads as [1571] of the time of this [1573] recording then I don't believe they have [1575] an API but if you're using like Apollo [1576] any mailf finder there's systems out [1578] there that uh you can set up that I have [1580] recorded videos on that will enable you [1581] to do this mostly autonomously mostly [1583] automatically so maybe you know every [1585] time you get a customer you get uh 27 [1587] mailboxes which is a sending volume of [1589] about like 900 a day or so and then you [1591] scrape I don't know 5,000 leads for the [1594] first week let's say what you do then is [1597] you feed every biography of the person [1599] whose lead info you just got from the [1600] previous step through a large language [1603] model to customize the very first line [1605] of the Outreach the way that you do this [1607] is you know you'll feed in like a [1608] LinkedIn bio for instance or like a [1610] Facebook bio Instagram bio or maybe like [1612] the the customer website a prospect [1614] website and then you'll say something [1615] like create me a customized on line [1617] introduction that you know is formatted [1619] exactly like this and then you'll use [1620] some best practice formatting and then [1622] instead of your email saying hello name [1624] I am Nick I would like to work with you [1626] on blank now it's hey Peter loved what [1628] you were writing last week in your blog [1630] post about X Y and Z I'm totally on the [1632] same page man I just wanted to reach out [1634] and and tell you something really quick [1635] obviously which email you're more likely [1637] to respond to the second one and then in [1639] a templated way you could put together a [1641] swipe file with all of your best [1643] performing offers assuming that you run [1645] this for a long period of time and then [1646] you can just copy and paste the exact [1648] writing or copy of that maybe make a [1650] couple of little changes to the way the [1651] offers are framed um but just use them [1653] from client to client and in that way [1655] you can get a fully up and running [1656] functioning email system with basically [1658] no drawbacks in to be honest less than [1660] 30 minutes this is something you could [1662] charge maybe $10,000 or more for I've [1665] seen people charging up to $10,000 um [1668] for a system like this although they [1669] typically charge lower and then they [1670] have some per lead fee or per percentage [1672] revenue on closed deal fee uh the last [1675] thing you do is you dump dep positive [1676] replies in a slack and pre-formatted [1677] email to Cent but yeah this solves a ton [1681] of hot button needs the main one is [1682] obviously we're not making enough money [1683] Nick our leads have dried up man our [1685] sales people are sitting around all day [1686] doing nothing our fulfillment team is [1688] sitting around all day doing nothing [1689] both of which you have to pay for [1691] another is just like founder chaos [1693] founder uncertainty we have no [1694] consistent way of generating business [1696] that isn't referrals I hear this all the [1698] time and last is that our current way of [1700] generating business is too expensive you [1701] can essentially solve all these problems [1703] simultaneously the step or the next [1706] point is that it produces a clear [1707] deliverable the clear clear deliverable [1709] like actually this system doesn't really [1710] produce a clear deliverable so you have [1711] to you have to hack it to make it [1712] produce a clear deliverable the way you [1714] do this is by you email um the person [1717] that is handling the leads and you [1719] should probably CC the decision maker [1721] that you did the work with too just to [1722] be safe sort of show your work and show [1724] your results you should also slack [1727] notify you should add to spreadsheets [1728] you should add to their CRM you should [1730] do all that stuff [1731] simultaneously you can use artificial [1733] intelligence to only filter out the [1734] positive replies so you know if you run [1737] campaigns a scale you're going to a lot [1738] of people going to be like I'm not [1739] interested leave me off the list [1740] unsubscribe immediately how dare you [1742] spam me I'm reporting you to 700 [1744] government authorities you know you [1746] don't really want your customers to see [1747] that right so I recommend having some AI [1749] filter that you pass all of the replies [1751] through and then have the AI categorize [1753] it as a positive reply or a negative [1755] reply it's a positive reply then you [1757] know forward it over to the customer [1758] they'll be pretty happy about it as you [1760] test the offers and copy you can save [1762] the best ones add them to a swipe file [1763] and pull all of your copy from said [1765] swipe file for future campaigns you can [1767] template out in richment flows using [1768] blueprints Etc I mentioned that down [1770] here so it's very templat and the last [1772] is that you could sell this as I [1773] mentioned here from 1.5 to 10K fixed [1775] price you can also charge an hourly rate [1777] to implement this although I personally [1778] wouldn't recommend it in this case um [1780] you can charge maintenance or management [1781] fee to like not just maintain the system [1783] but even like uh respond to emails on [1785] somebody else's behalf you could hire [1787] Outreach managers to do this work for [1788] you you could look for lower cost of [1790] living places um combine their ability [1793] to respond with chat gbt or templates or [1795] make an Arbitrage on their on their time [1797] essentially [1799] uh you could also charge a per lead fee [1801] every time that you book uh a meeting in [1803] the customer calendar you charge them [1804] like 100 bucks or 200 bucks or something [1806] like that depending on the size of the [1808] service it's going to be very worth it [1809] for them and last but not least you [1811] could charge a percentage revenue on [1812] deals closed although you have to have [1814] confidence that the customer has the [1815] ability to close deals because if you [1817] think about it you are now making your [1819] income contingent on something that you [1820] do not have the control over so only do [1822] that if you're pretty confident in their [1823] sales skills so yeah that's this system [1826] as I mentioned I'd highly recommend [1828] using instantly for this but you can set [1829] up the same sorts of flows using smart [1832] lead which is another major email [1833] provider vast majority of cold email [1835] platforms will have the functionality [1837] I'm talking about here sending for [1838] multiple mailboxes there are also a few [1840] resellers now that will do the instant [1842] day one setup um none of them are coming [1845] to mine at the moment but I will add a [1846] couple of them down in my YouTube [1848] description so feel free to take a look [1849] at that if you're looking for [1850] alternatives to instantly the fourth [1853] system is a copy and paste proposal [1855] automation system now I've talked about [1857] this a lot on my channel and uh maybe [1860] some of you guys are like well Nick [1860] didn't you just mention this in the last [1861] video I did when I was like seven make [1863] automations that make me all this money [1865] but that's because this is [1866] extraordinarily valuable and it's [1868] nowhere near reaching Market saturation [1871] it is insane how in demand this is [1874] despite the fact that I've been talking [1875] about this and hundreds of thousands of [1876] people have seen this for the better [1878] part of the last seven or eight months [1879] these copy and paste proposal automation [1881] systems are so valuable especially small [1885] small mediumsized businesses that are [1886] making maybe less than 15 20K where the [1889] founder or the business owner themselves [1891] is still jumping on those calls because [1893] you can massively save a Founder time [1896] using a system like this you could shave [1897] off 20 30 40 minutes a call um and this [1900] is a big point of Leverage for people so [1902] this is how it works essentially what [1904] you do in order to set this up is you [1907] will have a big list of proposal [1909] templates somewhere on a pandadoc or [1912] docy sign or whatever proposal software [1913] platform you're [1914] using and then you will make minor Chang [1918] es to these depending on what client you [1920] have so maybe they have their own [1921] proposal template that they want you to [1923] rebuild in your platform that's cool you [1924] can do that that's the one work that [1926] you'll actually really have to do here [1927] maybe they have some Google Slides [1930] template they want you to modify that's [1931] fine you could you could you know copy [1932] and paste that stuff into pandadoc or [1934] doys sign and then work with that but [1936] the point is you select proposal [1939] templates depending on whatever the [1941] client offer or service is then what you [1945] do is you copy a template that you use [1947] that created for a form and this is a [1949] very simple form um that I have set up [1951] previously that you basically just fill [1953] out I'll even show it to you guys right [1955] now they just ask some very simple [1957] questions that allow you to log client [1961] details I wish I own nick.com the [1964] outcome of the call a one- sentence [1967] description of their business whatever [1968] their problem is whatever their solution [1970] is uh what platforms or Services you're [1972] going to use how long the project will [1974] take how much you want to charge them [1975] right if this is like a 2hour sorry this [1977] is like a half an hour phone call I'm [1979] sure you guys can imagine you can fill [1980] this out while they're talking so you [1982] can have their proposal ready to go by [1983] the time you send [1984] it so what you do is you just copy one [1986] of those or something that I've seen a [1988] lot of people in my community now do is [1990] they say screw typing I don't want to [1992] type at all I'm just going to use a [1993] meeting recorder bot and they actually [1996] have that the end of the meeting trigger [1998] on automation that takes the transcript [2000] from the meeting recorder bot and then [2001] summarizes it and pairs it down until [2003] you get exactly what they talked about [2004] and then they feed that into AI instead [2006] so you feed this into your large [2008] language model you generate Jason with [2010] specific proposal sections that are like [2012] hey this is the problem you're suffering [2013] from this is the solution that that you [2015] want this is how we're going to do the [2016] solution based off what we talked about [2017] here's a brief scope right you [2019] pregenerate all of that fun stuff and [2021] then if they have different packages [2022] maybe select from a list of packages you [2024] populate their proposal sections and you [2026] just automatically send to the prospect [2028] right away I also recommend sending a [2030] customized email alongside the proposal [2031] for Max effect this is uh somewhere [2034] around here my actual flow um I mean [2037] this is just a copy of a copy so I [2039] haven't used this one in quite a while [2040] but this is basically exactly what the [2043] way that it works that I just described [2044] you get a discovery call forry on type [2046] form you then use it to generate a big [2049] proposal this proposal um I believe I'm [2051] generating in Json [2054] format let's see here yeah we're [2056] generating this in Json format problem [2058] pitch solution pitch you might have [2060] different structure to yours so you [2061] obviously have to play around with it we [2063] even generate Milestones timelines then [2064] we send the proposal using pandadoc what [2067] you would probably want to do is you [2068] want to dump this into some set variable [2070] module that's before your UH document [2073] module step and then that way you would [2075] just feed the results of that module in [2078] to your platform and then you could just [2081] hot swap you know better proposals [2083] pandadoc whatever okay so this is a CRM [2086] Standalone this is a CRM add-on or [2088] Standalone system that leverages [2089] templates and AI to create highly [2091] customized looking proposals for your [2092] clients as I mentioned um it solves a [2094] bunch of hot button needs the biggest [2096] one is probably like hey man our [2097] proposal rates sucks um sales admin has [2099] taken me forever our sales teams just [2101] wasting their time doing proposals [2102] rather than jumping on a calls um [2104] systems like this will increase your [2106] average deal size since they'll increase [2107] the perceived work that goes into every [2109] proposal uh our leads have dried up our [2111] fulfillment team is sitting around all [2112] day doing nothing proposals take way too [2114] long or way expensive right now again [2117] these solve the ability to generate [2118] Revenue the ability to save money and [2120] the ability to maximize founder time the [2122] benefit here is it also produces a very [2124] clear deliverable like the proposal [2126] which you can email text add to a spread [2127] sheet or add to a CRM you guys can [2129] obviously take the core idea and apply [2130] it however you would like the benefit [2133] here is you can also do this in three or [2134] four major proposal platforms you do [2135] this in pandadoc you do this in better [2136] proposals you do this wherever the hell [2138] you want really if you use the approach [2140] that I talked about earlier where you [2141] put a little set variables module [2143] between the AI step and then the [2146] proposal generator step or the proposal [2149] platform module then you can obviously [2151] just drag and drop a different module as [2153] necessary might take you five minutes [2155] realistically in terms of price seen [2157] this sold anywhere from 1,500 all the [2159] way up to 5K fixed price that's no [2161] add-ons as well as you could charge an [2163] hourly rate to implement this or make [2164] tweaks you could um charge a maintenance [2166] or management fee management might be [2168] like producing new proposal templates or [2170] I don't know Outsourcing to designer [2172] something of that nature but people are [2174] selling this stuff right now as we speak [2175] I think somebody just sold this exact [2177] system a couple days ago in um I don't [2180] remember which Community but one of my [2181] two the last system I'm going to talk [2184] about here is a copy and paste new [2185] project onboarding system and this is [2187] probably like a more intensive one to [2189] fulfill but I also think that it's one [2191] that potentially gives you the most [2192] leverage in the customer business the [2194] way that this works is this is an [2195] onboarding system that triggers when you [2197] start a new project or close a deal [2198] basically you will you know shake hands [2201] with the customer they'll send you some [2202] money through an invoice and then you'll [2203] track to see when that invoice has been [2205] paid the second that it gets paid you [2207] receive an event that event triggers a [2209] flow where you will template stuff out [2211] for them you'll template out Google [2212] Drive you'll template out Google Docs [2214] you'll template out whatever asset they [2216] need maybe some create a brief or a [2218] welcome doc or whatnot you could use [2220] artificial intelligence at every step [2221] here to customize the assets that they [2223] get as well you could have time trackers [2226] you could basically build out a project [2229] management flow where instead of you [2231] having to hire a project manager you [2232] could just rely on a system like this [2234] that's super organized just do it all [2235] for you so the way that the system works [2238] from a bird's eye view is basically [2239] we'll have that trigger that I mentioned [2241] right payment trigger maybe a form is [2242] filled out and then what happens after [2243] is you'll create a templated Google [2245] drive folder or Dropbox folder whatever [2247] it work organizational folder system [2249] you'll then create a bunch of Google [2251] docs for various use cases like content [2254] uh add copy Etc maybe if you're a [2256] creative agency you need to I don't know [2259] you have like a Google doc or question [2261] list that you send to the customer and [2262] then they have to like fill in the [2263] information or something right so what [2265] you do is you create a Google doc using [2266] the information that you got from that [2267] payment trigger and maybe your project [2269] management or CRM system that Google doc [2272] is customized you can even send it to [2273] the customer and you play anyway you [2274] place all the stuff in the folder to [2275] keep it organized then you pass the [2277] project details to a large language [2278] model and have it generate JavaScript [2280] object notation with specific sections [2282] the sections here are going to be for [2284] your various um assets that you're [2286] generating so maybe you know you [2287] generate some ad copy automatically [2289] based off of the website of the customer [2291] that you scrape using make or zapier or [2293] something maybe you pre-t template out [2295] uh an ad campaign based off of a [2297] template that you've matched or [2298] something right like maybe you have a a [2300] list of five or maybe you have a big [2301] swipe file with five different uh [2303] industry categories and then every time [2305] you get a customer from an industry you [2307] go into that industry category and then [2309] you copy the swipe files and then you [2311] use them as inspiration to pre- template [2312] out all the ads there's a variety of [2314] ways that you guys can automate the hell [2315] out of this right I'm just giving you [2316] some ideas here afterwards you add it to [2319] your project management system or sheets [2320] and then finally you send a customized [2322] email or notification to your [2324] fulfillment staff and or the client for [2326] maximum effect uh ideally you know you [2328] do this whole thing in like 30 seconds [2330] or something and then you send them [2331] something that's just so insanely [2333] customized that the customer goes holy [2335]  I'm working with real professionals [2336] here so systems like this are great I [2339] use them all the time I use them in uh [2341] one second copy right now so uh this is [2344] a good example of a system like that [2346] sort of a simpler system but essentially [2347] what I'm doing is every time we get a [2349] new project we're searching for the [2351] project folder creating a new project [2353] folder creating a Content brief template [2355] that's one of the assets that I talked [2357] about we are then uh creating a harvest [2360] um time tracking entry and we're kind of [2362] connecting this to our own database and [2364] our own infrastructure right so you guys [2365] can do something really similar with [2366] your own boarding system this solves a [2369] variety of hot button needs mainly the [2370] fact that onboarding takes forever that [2372] your margins suck that everything's [2374] disorganized it takes forever to find [2375] stuff where the hell is that file that [2377] Lucy promised me last week projects [2379] always go over budget or delivery scope [2382] basically having a system like this just [2383] makes all of that a little bit better it [2385] works in my experience as a lift where [2388] everything is just now 5% easier you get [2391] jobs done 5 or 10% faster you get to [2394] take on 5 or 10% more jobs you have to [2396] hire 5 or 10% people it's just a way to [2399] economize everything um and people tend [2402] to like this quite a lot it also [2404] produces a clear deliverable which is [2405] that record that we just talked about in [2406] your project management system it uh [2409] produces those assets it produces [2410] folders you can change this however you [2413] like whether you want to use Google Docs [2415] Google Drive Dropbox paper whatnot you [2418] could build this on three or four major [2420] file and time tracking platforms and [2422] then you can sell this from anywhere [2423] from 1K to 5K USD fixed price no add-ons [2426] obviously depending on whether this is a [2428] much more comprehensive or intense [2430] onboarding uh system maybe you need to [2432] do more than just generate a few simple [2434] assets like I talked about using [2436] AI you guys can charge more than that [2439] but generally speaking you know people [2440] assign project management of lower [2442] importance to sales so if you're [2444] building a project manager you'll be [2445] able to justify a lower price than let's [2446] say a CRM you can also charge an Aly [2449] rate to implement this make tweaks and [2450] you can also do a maintenance or [2451] management fee so that in a nutshell are [2454] five systems that you could sell [2455] starting today for between ,500 to [2458] $10,000 you guys have everything that [2460] you need on my YouTube channel my gumra [2463] to actually get out there and start [2464] doing it I think the tertiary benefit of [2466] this video is that hopefully it gives [2468] you guys who are currently running your [2469] own businesses some ideas and systems [2471] that you can Implement there as well if [2473] I knew what I just to told you guys at [2476] the beginning of my automation career I [2477] probably would have been able to reach [2479] my 72k a month in two maybe three times [2482] as fast as I did I probably could have [2484] made two to three times as much money as [2486] well um and yeah I guess all I'm trying [2489] to say is a lot of the time you just [2490] need somebody that's um been there done [2493] that just to guide the way a little bit [2494] and I'm hoping that this video has [2496] helped you guys do that if you guys have [2497] any questions or anything like that feel [2499] free to drop them down below I am on a [2501] comment responding spree right now I [2503] spent 5 hours the that a SM like 180 [2505] it's pretty Bonkers but I'm going to [2507] keep on doing it till I Keel over from [2509] exhaustion uh otherwise please like [2512] subscribe do all that fun YouTube stuff [2514] and I'll catch you on the next video [2515] thanks so much for the time cheers

Title: 7 Make.com Automations That Make Me $200,000/Yr (Steal Them)
[0] hey my name is Nick and in the month of [1] August I made over $100,000 using [3] Automation and make.com I did this [5] through a combination of coaching [7] Consulting making shitty jokes on [9] YouTube and Building Systems and in this [11] video I want to talk about seven of [13] those systems that collectively make me [15] over [16] $200,000 per year these are super high [19] Roi systems that essentially form the [22] core of my business operating system and [24] I'm going to share them all with you as [25] well as attached blueprints so you guys [28] can take what's been working for me and [29] then copy and paste it into your own [31] business if that sounds like something [32] you guys want to do this is the video [33] for you stay tuned and let's get into [36] [Music] [37] it all right let's make this super quick [39] the way this video is going to work is [40] I'm going to start by talking about some [41] of the rationale behind the automation [43] then I'm going to show you the scenario [46] in make.com and to walk through every [47] module uh some of these scenarios are [49] extraordinarily long so in those cases [51] I'm not actually going to walk through [52] every module but I'm going to show you [54] guys the logic so you guys understand [55] what I'm doing and at the very end of [57] every automation I'm just going to run [59] through maybe some ways you you'll need [60] to adapt this for your own business if [62] you're not in the exact same business [63] model as I am but I want you guys to [65] know that you guys can implement the [66] same tools and tips that I talk about [68] here in basically any industry whether [70] you're a plumber HVAC guy uh or you're a [72] freaking astronaut I don't actually know [74] about that one but anyway without [76] further Ado let's get into it the very [77] first system I want to talk about is by [79] far the simplest system and it's just [80] the new systems audit request to email [82] automation that I set up a few months [84] ago essentially the problem for this is [87] I run a automation company it's called [89] left click and about 4ish months ago I [91] started really taking off in terms of My [93] Views in terms of the number of people [94] that were wanting to book meetings with [96] me um consult consultations coaching [98] calls that sort of thing and you know I [100] I have this website here right and it [102] has a funnel where you can click to book [103] an intro call but essentially after a [105] while I was just getting so many of [106] these requests that it just didn't [107] really make sense it wasn't really [109] feasible for me to do them myself so I [111] started allowing a lot of these to just [112] fall through the cracks and these were [113] pretty big job requests these were like [114] 2,000 bucks 3,000 bucks um I think one [118] was $177,000 or something that along [120] those lines so these are pretty freaking [122] big jobs right but I just can't I just [124] can't do them all because I couldn't [125] really justify um spending time on this [128] when I personally think that the [129] building a brand aspect of things for me [131] at the time anyway was a lot higher [133] leverage so yeah instead of me just [135] allowing these to fall through the [136] cracks so what I ended up doing [137] strategically was I found myself a [138] referral partner somebody who I like [140] trust respect who can do these jobs for [142] me to a similar level of quality to me I [145] mean I think that I'm definitely one of [146] a kind but uh you know to a good enough [148] level of quality that I wouldn't feel [150] bad referring these projects out and [152] then I said hey this is you this is your [154] business it's your brand I want no [156] association with it all you have to do [157] is just pay me 15% for every job that [159] you finish um so I'm sure you guys can [161] imagine you know I'm getting about one [164] between one and two requests a day I get [166] a higher number of requests when my [168] videos take off obviously like recently [170] and a lower number of requests when I'm [171] not really posting consistently but it [173] averages out at about maybe like one to [174] two requests per day you know if every [177] one of these projects is hell even like [178] $2,000 or something right that's 60k a [181] month 60k a month times [183] 15.15% is still [185] 7.5k now I'm not actually making 7.5k [188] because not all of these are closed but [189] as I'm sure you guys can imagine um this [191] adds up over time and I've already made [193] quite a hefty sum with this simple [194] referral system so I'm going to show you [196] guys what mine looks like here um it's [198] very simple and you actually don't even [200] need three of these modules um but [202] what's important for this system isn't [204] necessarily the way that it's laid out [205] it's the logic behind it so what we have [208] is we have a little type form set up [210] wrong form uh when somebody wants to [212] work with me they click that button on [213] my website and they get taken to this [215] link this link asks a bunch of [218] questions what's your website URL can [221] you explain your company into sentences [223] can you do this can you do that what's [225] your current monthly Revenue how do you [226] acquire new customers how do you produce [228] or fulfill your product or service [230] what's the best way to get a hold of you [232] so you can see we are really getting [234] them to give up their whole life and [235] then finally anything extra you'd like [237] to share before we wrap this up um [239] essentially way this works is you know [240] you fill out this form and then you get [242] a choice to book a calendar meeting with [245] um Yours Truly or rather with my company [246] I should say um and that's really where [248] the magic of the system happens right [250] like obviously the vast majority of [251] people that are on my website they [253] probably watch my videos and they want [254] to book with me um but I I can't book [256] with them physically that said I don't [258] really want to say no to money obviously [260] um unless it is just so overwhelmingly [262] low Roi that I have to uh and this [264] system allows me to juggle both so [267] here's how it works we get the result [269] that we just um you know completed then [271] we sleep we sleep for 4 minutes exactly [274] the reason why I sleep for 4 minutes is [276] because I want you to put yourself in [277] the shoes of somebody that's filling out [278] this form if I were hypothetically to [280] respond instantly you know you just [282] filled out this massive form that asked [285] you tons of information about your [286] business you love the work that Nick [289] does on his channel you really like the [291] idea of working with him and stuff like [292] that essentially I provide White Glove [294] service with the perception of [295] extraordinarily high quality right like [297] mid to high four figure or five figure [299] service you don't necessarily just want [301] to be autores to so I provide a 4-minute [303] delay so that I provide like I give [305] myself plausible deniability that was me [307] or it was a machine um but it's not in [309] the realm of like okay this is [311] definitely a generated territory it's in [312] the realm of like holy man this guy [314] has really good service to get back to [315] me in just four minutes all right so [318] here's where the actual system itself [319] starts let me just show you guys we then [321] have a type form list responses module [323] if you don't know why split it up like [324] this it's just because um I want this to [326] be the trigger but I actually want to [328] grab all the data from here just so I [329] could tested as easily as clicking run [331] once you know when I list responses [332] through type form what I'm doing is I'm [333] just going through all of the responses [335] that I've ever received and then just [336] selecting the the most recent one right [339] um so this is just a quick and easy way [340] for me to test without necessarily [342] having to do all the of filling [343] out the type form anyway we get all the [345] data right from the form like that I [347] would have just filled out this is just [348] an example when I did two minutes ago [350] and then we have the set multiple [352] variables let me actually rename this [353] for the benefit of you [355] guys then we have a set formatted [358] datetime module here and and all this [360] does is it feeds in the date so format [362] date and then it adds 3 minutes to this [365] submitted ad date before formatting it [367] in this very particular structure um [369] which I will run right now to show you [371] guys what happens if I run this module [372] only and then we just select now as the [375] date what we're doing is we're taking [377] the date today and then we're just [378] formatting in in in text basically as a [381] string and the reason why we're doing [382] this is because of a very Nifty email [385] hack that I'm about to show you that [387] makes it seem so much more human written [390] so I have this smart referral module [391] here and basically the way that it works [393] is I will take that this message and [395] I'll email it to myself and then I'll [396] email it to the um person that just [398] filled out the Forum and I think really [401] here's the Magic in the system um it's [402] just the way that the copy was written [404] reew request from company notice that [407] it's a re it's not like the first email [409] it seems like a reply this is important [411] because we want people to think that [412] this is like buried in a reply then I [414] say hi name Nick asked me to reach out [417] to you we just got your audit request a [418] moment ago for blank I'm example his [421] automation partner and I do all of our [422] Audits and scoping I'm going to spend [424] half an hour later today going over your [426] submission and putting something [428] together before our call just want to [429] say I'm looking forward to meeting you [431] and learning a little bit more about [432] company name talk soon example now [435] you're probably wondering wait what the [436] hell Who the hell's example well example [437] is my referral partner it's not me I'm [439] not actually doing any of this [440] management stuff I don't want to be [442] involved in this I want them to own [443] literally 100% of the stack and I want [445] this to take 0% of my time and make me [447] 50% of the money the magic here is in [450] this forwarded message section what I [452] did is I actually recreated a forwarded [454] message basically so that it appears as [457] if this is a forwarded message that I [459] sent to my referral partner and that my [461] referral partner is now following up on [462] for me so it makes it seem as if I'm [465] really on top of my essentially and [467] then I message my referral partner with [468] a message and then I message my referral [471] partner with a message I send my [472] referral partner a message that [473] acknowledges the fact that I'm not [475] actually able to do this job right now [477] but asks them to take it on for me check [479] this out new build request for name to [481] example name I have the date time here [483] so Tuesday October 29th at 5:44 right it [486] says Hey example just following [489] up blank from blank so Peter from left [492] click filled out a build request form a [494] moment ago but is he know I'm slammed [495] you are incredible at these do you mind [497] checking in with them and saying hi if [499] they end up needing automation help I'll [500] give everything a look over before you [501] start working together thanks Nick okay [504] so what have I just done here well I've [505] basically given the person that I work [507] with plausible deniability that you know [509] they have my approval which they do and [511] you know I trust this person I look over [512] their work reasonably often but more as [514] like a coach not necessarily as you know [516] somebody that's working together on a [517] partner project and then afterwards um I [521] I pass off the request and I make it [523] seem super customized so that my [524] referral partner you know has basically [527] my support as overtly as possible [530] without me necessarily like jump having [531] to jump on a call and say Hey you know I [533] really want to do this but I need to [534] refer you to this guy um and I do it all [536] kind of surreptitiously so that the [538] person on the other end of the line [540] right and everybody or the vast majority [541] of people actually read through this and [542] they see this um but but I give myself [544] total plausible deniability uh it's just [546] like a very organic naturally passing [548] this off and this has worked really [550] really well so far the benefit here is [553] you know I kind of had a couple choices [554] here and I'm still thinking about the [555] best way to do this but I could have [556] spun up a new agency or I could have [558] added a bunch of people to left click [559] and I could have just like worked with [560] them and have them fulfill all of my all [561] of my jobs right but I don't really want [564] to do that because that takes a ton [565] of time it also takes like a fair amount [567] of resour like fair amount of my [568] resources it takes energy there's risk [570] sure I might be able to charge more [571] money retain more people but I just I'm [573] focusing on the YouTube stuff right now [575] this is my highest priority so I can [576] just make 15% of anything I'm happy and [579] basically what I do is I just I pass [581] this off and then it's not my brand [582] anymore and I don't have to be liable [584] for any of the successes or failures but [585] I get to claim the wins when I when I [587] get them right so that's how this system [589] works um it's pretty clean um what we [592] obviously get then is we get a booked [594] calendar meeting with my automation [596] referral partner and then the prospect [598] um and then you know we also get [600] plausible deniability I'm not usually [601] fored or cced in on any of those emails [604] I don't have to deal with them or [605] anything like that essentially what I'm [606] trying to say is it's clean as hell [608] which I'm pretty happy about now I'm [610] going to export this as a blueprint for [612] you guys let me just connect this [614] here then export this um and then you [617] know just give you guys unfettered [619] access to it so you guys can copy and [620] paste this into your own flows as well [622] now how you might want to use this if [623] you're running a business model that's [624] maybe a little bit different um well I [626] mean you know there's kind of like the [627] straightest line way to do this this is [629] basically basically a prepackaged [630] product that you could just bring up to [631] people you could say hey how's it going [633] I know you're getting way too many leads [634] I want to take them off your hands and I [635] want to take them off your hands [637] completely autonomously without giving [639] you any risk whatsoever um and I'll just [641] pay you 15% of whatever money that they [643] pay me this would work if somebody's [644] like really drowning in gigs like I am [646] um probably content creators and [647] influencers and stuff like that would [649] probably be like the first audience that [650] I would Target for that or right you [652] could just reach out to people in your [654] network that already work with you or [656] that know you or like you uh and you [657] could sort of soft pitch a system like [659] this just a way for you to share leads [660] you could set this up on your end when [661] you need to give leads to them they [663] could set this up on their end when they [664] need to give leads to you uh and so on [666] and so forth but yeah obviously this [668] works really well for a digital agency [670] um it works well for like local service [672] agencies as well uh I think if you're [674] doing this for a local service ageny [675] you'd probably want to do all this over [676] SMS rather than necessarily email so [679] that whole forwarded message section is [681] a little bit harder you could also [682] forward into like a group chat or [683] something like that and just have that [685] group chat number say that it's your [687] your big guy but it's not actually your [688] big guy just throwing some ideas at the [690] wall and seeing what sticks here but uh [692] yeah that is the first system the second [694] system is automatic payroll management [695] for hourly rate contractors I [698] essentially have figured out a way [700] alongside my business partner and my [702] prior company um to completely automate [704] something that used to have to require a [706] whole finance department to do so we run [708] a Content writing company called one [709] second copy it's content writing with a [711] Twist we are the 1% of writers so you [714] don't have to get high quality articles [715] and posts just 3 days the way that this [717] company works for context is we char [719] between 8 and 9 cents a word on average [721] I guess some of our contracts are like [723] 12 cents a word but any it's about like [725] 9 cents a word um which means if [726] somebody wants a thw article written how [728] much do we charge somewhere around 90 [730] bucks right and then the way that our [732] business model Works underneath the [733] scenes behind the scenes is we will pay [736] our writers an hourly rate to do the job [738] and we just Bank on the fact that like [740] if we pay them an hourly rate and then [742] we get paid for a fixed price rate like [744] we're going to make a little bit of [744] money so let's say somebody gives us a [747] thousand-word article we multiply that [749] by 0.09 that's 90 bucks and let's say it [751] takes a writer two hours at $20 to do [754] that means that we make 50 bucks right [756] pretty solid um and that's about what [758] our margins are I scaled this to $92,000 [760] a month uh way back in I don't even [763] really remember I think it was March or [765] something like last year maybe the year [766] before um man time has passed really [770] quickly uh but basically when chat gbt [772] came out obviously because you just have [773] ai rate all your we lost a fair [775] amount of interest in this business and [777] uh it's still chugging along I just [778] don't really think it's the highest [779] place so I could put my time so I don't [780] really actively manage this anymore [782] regardless this is still a major problem [784] right at the end of the month or [786] actually in our case we do two payment [787] periods we do one on the um 1 and one on [789] the 16th every time a payment period [791] comes out how the hell you know if I [792] have 20 contractors that I'm juggling [794] how the hell do I know exactly how much [796] to pay them that task used to be a whole [798] finance department in of itself that you [800] might pay like two three four $5,000 to [802] do because you know their time entries [804] coming in every single day there time [806] sheets that need to be corroborated [807] there there are a bunch of things that [808] need to be filed or invoices that need [810] to be created and managed and stored and [812] all that stuff well what we did is we [814] created a simple um payroll system which [816] isn't really a payroll system since it [818] deals with contractors but it allows us [820] to do all of this stuff completely [821] autonomously it then cues up payments in [823] our payment processor which is wise and [825] then all we do is we just click a button [826] every single time that we want to fire [828] off one of the payments here's how the [829] system works we use a Time tracking [831] platform called [832] Harvest Harvest is great um basically [834] you get a little Chrome extension in the [835] top right hand corner of your browser [837] and then you just click it anytime you [838] want track time you select what the the [840] project is the task is so every time we [842] receive a new article at one second copy [844] let's say it's X ways to um or X make [847] automations that make me y doll right um [850] I would I would be able to log that [851] really easily through my Chrome [852] extension and then I just it's just a [854] timer I turn it on when I work and then [856] I turn it off when I'm done this gets [858] logged to your profile in Harvest and [859] the benefit there is now we can interact [861] with Harvest using their API so the very [863] first part of the system and I [865] unfortunately can't show you guys too [866] much behind the scenes just because [867] there's a lot of payment information [868] here but the very first module is the [870] list active users I'm not actually going [872] to run this puppy but basically the way [873] this works is this just returns every [875] user in my whole workspace so logically [878] it's time for payments we scheduled this [880] to run on the 1st and on the 16th when [883] it's time to go we list every single [884] user in our whole [886] workspace the next thing we do is we [888] just do some math to set the pay period [890] dates this is just a way that we can get [892] the current date whether it's the 1st or [894] the 16th essentially and then what we do [896] after this [899] is we will get a user record user record [902] just tells us something about the user [905] we then list the pay period time entries [907] this is pretty nifty but essentially um [910] every user has a giant list of time [912] entries that they have filled out [914] between those periods and we can see we [916] can actually filter them based off of [918] the from and the two date right so we go [921] from the first to the 15th at 11:59 p.m. [924] or from the 16th to the last day of the [926] month at 1159 p.m. then we sum all of [930] those hours up the way that we do so is [932] we just add hours use the numeric [934] aggregator sum function which you can [936] find right over here is a very quick and [938] easy way to get a sum of like a big [939] array of numbers this is um an [941] aggregator and an iterator this an [942] iterator this is an aggregator that's [943] why the gray BB behind it and then at [945] the end if the number of hours summed up [947] is not equal to zero basically if [948] somebody actually tracked a little bit [949] of time we'll generate a contractor [951] invoice in pandadoc now what is that [953] look like you ask it looks like this we [955] have very simple format where it says [957] from from name from email to once I can [959] copy Nicholas D and uh then we have the [962] actual service along with the line item [964] rate the invoice number the date the due [966] date all this stuff the way that this [969] works is what we're doing is we're [971] preena the invoices for our team members [974] and then we're getting them to sign off [975] that this is something that they created [977] using like a templating service [979] essentially that way um you know they [982] sent us this invoice and then when they [985] sign off on the invoice that's the [987] trigger for us to send them their money [990] we handle that in the second scenario [991] here the second scenario watch is a [993] completed pandadoc when it's completed [996] we get the invoice details from the [997] document which you can do just by um you [999] know when you get a document you [1000] basically get all the data in all these [1002] yellow fields which is pretty [1004] sweet where am I then we have a little [1006] air table set up that includes every [1008] team member and then their hourly rate [1009] we don't store that in our usual project [1011] manager clickup just because of uh [1013] privacy we don't want every other team [1014] member to be able to see how much every [1015] other team member is getting paid um I [1017] love transparency but you know kind of [1018] stops over there and then uh what we'll [1021] do is you know every contractor [1023] typically we work remotely so all of [1025] them get paid in like different rates [1026] right some of them get paid in CAD other [1028] gets paid in G GBP others get paid in [1030] USD others get paid in uh I don't know [1034] all sorts of currencies so what we do is [1037] we will switch the currency type we'll [1039] then perform a currency analysis we'll [1041] convert it using the currency converter [1042] module this is a pretty awesome module [1044] by the way I don't know if you guys have [1044] ever screwed around with this but um it [1046] just uses the European Central Bank [1048] Exchange R to find exactly how much [1050] money it is in the specified currency [1052] and then what we do is we use wise as [1054] our bank so uh well not our bank but our [1056] like payout Bank the bank that we hold [1058] funds that we use to to pay staff [1060] members so we will automatically create [1062] quotes and then do transactions and [1064] transfers in Wise and then what this [1065] ends up doing is it just cues up a [1067] transaction where all we have to do is [1069] like look it over and click one button [1070] and then voila all the payments are [1072] taken care of completely um so this [1074] changes you know the amount of work [1075] somebody would have to do on a weekly [1076] basis to keep all this running from like [1078] I don't know maybe like 10 hours a week [1081] or something like that to like less than [1083] 30 seconds a week we just look over [1085] everything click one button and then [1086] we're done um this is one of the reasons [1088] why I think that automation can add such [1090] a ridiculous amount of Leverage [1091] specifically to finances uh to like the [1093] financial industry accounting [1095] bookkeeping and that sort of stuff [1096] because a lot of the time data is just [1098] it's not flexible really it's just like [1099] numbers right then you can like add up [1101] numbers sum numbers divide numbers [1102] perform routine mathematical operations [1104] on numbers and currencies pretty in in a [1106] pretty standardized format so yeah [1108] that's system number two saves me a ton [1110] of time energy and money system number [1112] three is also for the content agency as [1113] you guys could see it's pretty long it's [1115] quite the Behemoth so I'm not going to [1117] go through every single module here um [1119] what I'm going to do is I'm going to [1119] explain how the system works and if you [1121] guys want to learn more about this you [1122] guys can just check the blueprint but [1124] essentially the way that our business [1125] the content writing company operates is [1127] we have a um clickup CRM or clickup [1130] project manager here and inside of [1132] clickup we template out projects using [1135] client records clients are obviously all [1138] different with what they want they all [1140] have different style guides they all [1141] have different writing requirements they [1143] all have different requests uh AI [1145] detector score thresholds they all have [1147] like different everything right and so [1149] what we do is we use clickup built-in [1150] templating [1152] features and then we use that in [1154] conjunction with make.com to [1156] automatically template out the uh like [1159] Google drive folder I really got to turn [1161] that off the Google drive folder um the [1164] Google Doc uh we add them to harvest [1166] automatically we add them to a dash [1168] dashboard tracker we do a bunch of math [1170] and finances and budget tracking and [1172] stuff like that we just do all of this [1173] stuff completely autonomously under the [1174] hood so let me show you how this works [1176] basically um in our clickup we have [1179] executive assistants that will create um [1182] client records here and then use them as [1184] templates to turn them into article [1187] records so I wanted to add an article [1189] for example company and I wanted to call [1191] it xm.com automations that make me [1196] y I don't actually know if this is going [1198] to be the title of the video so don't [1199] butcher me if it isn't but essentially [1201] um it will automatically pull all of the [1203] data from that client so we'll get the [1205] style guide of the client we'll get the [1207] writing guidelines we'll get the [1210] writer's checklist um there's some [1212] article specific information which is [1214] usually filled in [1216] here make sure to do XYZ we then have a [1219] writer to check off section this is sort [1220] of like a checklist that the writer [1222] themselves will finish I'll show you [1223] that in a second then we have some [1224] context about the client and then some [1226] AI detector scores um a lot of the time [1228] I guess this part client wants us to [1229] post a screenshot of the AI detector [1231] score because I think they want it under [1232] five or something like that obviously [1234] all clients are different in how low of [1236] an AI score that they want some some [1237] guys want five some guys are totally [1238] cool if it's 50 but as we scroll down [1240] here further we have a bunch of custom [1242] Fields with like data including the [1243] Harvest client ID um you know we store [1246] data from Harvest in here we store data [1247] from Google Drive in here Google Docs [1250] basically we just use clickup as like [1251] our source of truth and that's just [1253] where we put the IDS of every other [1254] platform we use just for easy access any [1256] then what we do is we add a due date and [1259] then we add a Target word count and then [1261] let me just turn on the scenario the [1264] Behemoth uh and then we just change the [1266] status to ready what ends up happening [1269] when you change it to ready is it starts [1270] a flow and clickup that sends a web hook [1272] over to our scenario that then updates [1275] the status for us to creating project [1277] folder um processing and all that stuff [1280] and then logs the execution in the [1282] comment that actually includes a link [1284] like if I click on [1285] this it actually includes a freaking [1288] link to the task execution link so we [1290] could see what's going on in case [1292] there's like a debug error or something [1293] it's one of the coolest things that I [1294] think anybody can do then what we do is [1296] we go through a little bit of a flow [1298] here to create a Google drive folder the [1300] reason for the Google drive folder is it [1301] just allows us to obviously store all of [1303] the data that we create for this client [1305] in a specific Google Drive then we will [1307] actually go and create a Google doc as [1309] well this Google doc um uses templating [1312] functionality to um take the style that [1316] the client wants so a lot of the time [1318] some sty are like bolded inter you know [1321] uh 26 point right other ones are maybe [1322] helvetic canu um the point I'm making is [1325] you know clients typically want things [1326] delivered in in different [1328] ways and then we have a bunch of [1330] additional steps here where we basically [1332] just add these links to the Google or [1334] sorry to the clickup record in [1336] particular we'll also add them to [1340] harvest and then we'll actually add them [1342] to our dashboard as well where we always [1344] keep track of the word count the total [1345] word count that we basically done the [1347] revenue from the project we multiply it [1349] by the rate and the estimated hour uh [1351] the estimated um uh number of words and [1355] then uh we set the budget apply the the [1357] budget to harvest and then we even add [1358] users to the specific projects as well [1361] so there's a lot that goes on under the [1362] hood here um obviously feel free to take [1364] a look at this on your end but [1366] essentially what you end up with after [1367] all of this stuff is said and done is [1369] you end up with a project I just need to [1370] make sure this is still good to go [1373] believe this is now done right yeah we [1376] you we have a project now where if I [1377] scroll through here um you know we can [1379] see XM make.com automations [1382] that make me y per year right this is [1386] now in the queue or in the content [1387] pipeline um that all of the rest of our [1389] staff members can see and this is the [1391] pipeline that our staff members work off [1393] of basically so all they do now is they [1395] give this a click they scroll down and [1398] then what they do is they like check out [1400] the project folder they click on the [1403] Google [1405] Doc right they start tracking their time [1408] in Harvest cuz everything is now hooked [1409] up perfectly um and yeah this is just a [1411] much easier and simpler way to do that [1413] actually you guys could see back here [1415] there should be a uh little Harvest link [1417] here which allows you to you know do [1418] that time tracking automatically so [1420] pretty cool pretty seamless um and this [1422] system here the way that this works and [1424] why this is valuable is because this [1425] basically completely takes over um like [1427] a project management role we have all of [1429] these things automatically done we don't [1431] need to hire an additional project [1433] manager to like do all of the [1434] organizational stuff because it's just [1436] done in clickup we have we have [1438] everything organized in folders [1439] perfectly oh jeez it's going to do [1440] another thumbs up won't it okay I'm not [1442] going to do that we have all of the [1444] folders organized in clickup uh we have [1447] everything in like Google drive with a [1448] big hierarchy we have all of the budgets [1450] applied to the projects we know exactly [1452] what our cogs are basically at every [1453] minute in time we know what our margins [1456] are right we have dashboard [1457] functionality everything like that we [1459] basically just replace the whole project [1460] manager in my content writing agency so [1463] project managers uh in like constant [1464] agencies are typically referred to as [1466] editors but essentially we managed to [1467] save anywhere from like $3,000 a month [1469] up to $5,000 a month just by not having [1471] one of them here uh which is beneficial [1473] and you can do the math on how much [1475] money that that would save you all right [1476] got a system that's very specific to [1478] school.com now I've been using this in [1480] my business since I launched my [1481] communities and it's been hyper valuable [1483] um basically a big problem in my [1485] community makemoney withm make.com is [1488] look at this number over here in the [1489] right hand side it says 400 members [1491] right uh basically the value of this [1495] is school doesn't have a weight list [1497] feature buil in there's no way to create [1500] the a cap of 400 and then to have people [1503] apply to a weight list and then when one [1505] person leaves have somebody else [1506] automatically come in so uh about gosh I [1509] guess like four or five maybe even six [1511] months ago no I guess it was like four [1512] months ago I was having to do all that [1514] automatically I would actually have to [1515] wake up every morning and I to check to [1517] see what the number or member count was [1519] and if it had dipped below 400 I'd have [1521] to go through my stripe and find the [1523] last person and then invite them [1524] manually to my group I counted up the [1526] amount of time that this took me it was [1527] anywhere between between like 45 minutes [1529] like an hour and a half every single day [1530] cuz sometimes people would leave in the [1532] middle of the day and then a new spot [1533] would open up right um it was more so [1535] just the stress of making sure that this [1536] number was always 400 or 4001 or 4002 it [1539] fluctuates from time to time depending [1541] on whether I invite like assistants in [1542] and that sort of thing um but I decided [1544] that you know I had enough of it and I [1546] said screw it I'm going to build my own [1547] system that mans this for me the way [1549] that this works is we have this um it's [1551] a scraping database essentially but uh [1553] I'm going to leave the two first columns [1556] here as small just cuz that contains [1557] like uh you know information of the [1559] people that have signed up but [1560] essentially every time somebody signs up [1562] for a wait list and in this case I at [1565] sheet two here which is only tracking [1567] annual memberships but um we have one [1569] for monthly memberships as well [1570] basically anytime somebody signs with a [1572] weit list for monthly or an annual [1573] membership we have this amount column [1574] which tracks the amount of money that [1575] they paid we have a payment method ID [1577] column which tracks the payment method [1579] then we have a weightless date [1581] column and then every time that they [1583] come in what I [1585] do is I run this scenario here which [1588] will automatically build them and then [1590] it will invite them to school assuming [1593] that there is a spot open in my group if [1596] there's no spot open in the group it'll [1597] just automatically turn off so that was [1600] a very clear explanations let me just [1601] show you guys this a little more [1602] practically as you can see we have a ton [1604] of Records here with a bunch of [1605] different statuses some are paid some [1606] are trialing some are paid some requires [1608] payment method basically when you want [1610] to sign up to my program you go to make [1612] money withm make.com and then you click [1614] join Weight list [1616] here and then you fill out you know your [1619] information here right you add your card [1620] number uh what happens when that that [1622] occurs is you know request gets sent [1624] over to a web hook that tracks all of [1626] the stuff now the issue is sometimes [1627] people put in the wrong card number or [1629] sometimes their card number doesn't have [1630] any their card doesn't have any funds in [1631] it right um so what my system does is it [1633] accounts for that by intelligently [1635] checking to see whether or not that card [1637] has funds available by making a small [1639] little transaction uh and then assuming [1640] that the transaction uh you know goes [1642] through it proceedes down a pretty [1644] logical pipeline of following up with [1645] them sending them invoices automatically [1647] or manually [1648] um you know sending them emails to be [1650] like hey how are things going you know [1651] have you taken a look at this invoice [1652] yet basically it allows us to extract [1654] the vast majority of value of the weight [1656] list members even if their cards don't [1658] necessarily work while also just [1659] completely taking care of the whole [1661] weight list feature so um this is the [1663] scenario in uh this is one of the [1665] scenarios anyway this is the one that [1667] actually does my weight list management [1668] totally autonomously and I'll run you [1669] through how it works basically what I'll [1672] do is every hour I'll ceue up a HTTP [1676] call to my own community's page on [1678] and what happens when you do an HTTP [1680] call to your community is you end up [1681] with this big long chunk of [1684] HTML now somewhere buried in this HTML [1688] is the member [1690] count believe it's like right over here [1693] or maybe yeah so it's right over here [1695] and it's always basically in the same [1696] place which means you can easily parse [1698] out this data right you know that the [1699] span is going to be at the beginning [1701] we're going to have a three-digit number [1702] unless I have 301 people leave tomorrow [1705] or something like that and then we have [1707] a less than symbol with an exclamation [1708] point and then like two dashes like [1710] basically the point that I'm making is [1711] you can very easily parse that data [1712] consistently right so I parse this data [1714] and then I get to see whether or not the [1716] member count in this case I was doing [1717] 402 because I had a couple of assistants [1719] that were part of the group these [1721] assistants I obviously weren't I was not [1723] getting them to pay me or anything like [1725] that they were just people that were [1726] creating content for me and that sort of [1727] thing but essentially you know if the [1729] member count is below 4002 I proceed [1732] with the rest of my flow the very first [1734] thing I do is I will search all of these [1736] rows for anything with a status of [1738] trialing trialing uh is just the term [1740] referred to when you sign up to a [1743] subscription but you know you haven't [1744] fully been build yet and I think it's [1746] stripe specific if it finds [1748] something then I'll go into stripe and [1750] I'll retrieve the customer I'll then [1752] create an invoice item this invoice item [1754] will be for my community I'll then [1756] create an invoice I'll then finalize my [1758] invoice then I'll confirm the payment [1760] intent this actually charges their card [1762] then next I have um sort of two routes [1765] here I have a paid route and then a not [1766] paid route this chart can fail that's [1768] why I have a resume module attached to [1770] it if it fails what I'll do is I'll [1772] update the status from you know trialing [1774] to trialing manual invoice or trialing [1776] follow-up one or something of that [1777] nature depending on the specifics of [1779] what the error message [1781] was if it's a manual invoice I'll then [1783] follow up with them I'll send them an [1784] email basically saying hey bro how's it [1785] going you know I saw that you tried to [1787] fill out this thing uh I saw that it [1788] didn't work here's a manual invoice that [1790] I'm sending you um immediately if you [1792] can just take care of this I will add [1793] you to the group right after um and in [1795] that way like a big issue that I had at [1797] the beginning is people would sign out [1799] for this uh plan which is you know it's [1801] not a low amount of money it's like [1802] almost what $1,500 something like that [1804] for a yearly subscription so it's a fair [1806] amount of money people obviously [1807] committed to it they wanted to get in [1809] but then something would happen their [1810] card details wouldn't be right or maybe [1812] there'd just be some issue with uh I [1814] don't know the card balance they didn't [1816] have enough money to pay that one time [1817] they need to reload their balance or [1818] some something of that nature and then I [1821] would find out about the next day and [1822] then I'd be like oh you know hey [1823] man here's a manual invoice that should [1825] help top you up but you know after the [1827] whole 24 hours have gone by either [1829] they're sort of I don't know worried or [1831] they have like some sort of self-doubt [1832] that's comeing or or maybe their spot [1835] has been taken and there's just no more [1836] room in the group right whatever the [1838] point is um I had a much lower [1840] conversion rate on the people that [1841] entered in card information for cards [1844] that didn't work when I switched over to [1846] this method where I could instantly [1847] notify people with a manual invoice the [1849] second that there was some failure um my [1852] my rate shot up from what it was [1853] previously which is maybe like 40% of [1855] those actually ended up paying to [1856] something along the lines of 70 80% and [1859] the people that don't pay via manual [1860] invoice this time also get followed up [1862] with consistently so what I'll do is you [1864] know I'll check this sheet and then if [1866] it still says followup one then it [1868] follow up again right and then [1869] eventually some of these records go to [1871] rejected uh which is just where the [1873] person doesn't want to work with me at [1875] all um but this is a pretty cool and [1876] simple way to manually sorry to [1878] automatically to automate a large [1880] portion of the manual process that I had [1882] before um and it's this autonomous [1884] weightless management system so I know [1886] not everybody here runs a school [1887] Community probably very few of you and I [1888] know very even fewer of you probably [1891] implement some sort of like strict [1892] weight list at a certain number of [1893] members that you need to build using [1895] stripe I'm still going to include this [1896] blueprint though because I think it's [1897] just important for you guys to get [1898] visibility to How I build these flows [1900] and if anybody's any questions about [1901] that just let me know my next system is [1902] one of the highest Roi systems that I've [1904] ever built uh I believe at this point [1906] has probably inspired like several [1908] hundred other similar systems so if [1910] you've already heard of this sort of [1911] flow I wouldn't be surprised but [1913] essentially what I do is I will use a [1915] type form as an input during a sales [1917] call I'll fill out a couple of quick [1918] little pieces of information about the [1920] prospect during said sales call then I [1922] click a button the second that I've [1923] click the button it'll actually go [1924] through use AI to generate a proposal [1926] generates milestones and timeas and then [1928] even generates a whole Panda do um [1930] proposal for me which looks really clean [1932] so I'm going to run you guys through [1933] what my system looks like from top to [1935] bottom essentially what I have here is I [1937] have a discovery call form when I am [1939] selling the client first thing I'll be [1940] like hey man so sorry your name was Nick [1943] right what's the best email for you Nick [1944] left click. okay thank you great and [1946] that was left click right okay beautiful [1948] and then I will track the outcome of the [1950] call right if the outcome is that I want [1951] to send in a proposal what I need to do [1953] is I need to paste in a one sentence [1955] description of their business so maybe [1957] left click is an automation firm that [1960] specializes in cold email Outreach [1963] systems what's the problem right now [1967] left click is trying to grow their [1970] YouTube they're using scripts and let's [1974] just say a [1976] teleprompter in order to do so but it's [1979] costing them a ton of time and energy [1982] managing script [1984] writers they don't like this because [1986] it's pricey takes a long turnaround time [1991] and the quality of their scripts tend to [1993] be pretty low because they [1996] work with more affordable contractors so [2000] basically somebody will tell me these [2002] problems that they're suffering from and [2003] I'll just write them down I just made [2004] this up right but um I'll write them [2006] down just as they're doing it I write [2008] this down as bullet points I could write [2009] this down basically however I want the [2011] point is I just do it while I'm on the [2012] call with them to maximize the um the or [2014] minimize the friction make it just [2015] really quick and easy for me the next [2017] question is proposed solution so um they [2020] want a streamlined content generation [2023] system that [2025] automatically writes whole scripts for [2027] them they want a way to put in an [2031] example script and then have the script [2035] let's say alongside this is an actual [2037] project I bu funnily enough uh alongside [2040] a brief with title keywords Etc and then [2045] have the [2045] script emulate said [2049] example while being different enough to [2053] realistically record a video [2056] on they then want a way to I don't know [2061] format this so they can upload it to [2064] their parrot [2065] teleprompter app AK a gole Google [2069] doc cool so I've actually done this [2072] exact system what are the platform [2073] Services you'll use during development [2075] Google Docs because um parro accepts dox [2081] natively hypothetically um let's do type [2084] form because it's simple and pandadoc no [2088] sorry not pandadoc and GPT 4 o because [2091] it's the best um and most affordable AI [2094] content writing tool out there right now [2097] how long will the project wait take two [2099] weeks how much you want to charge them [2101] $3,895 any additional cost from [2103] platforms let's just say 50 [2105] bucks great then I'll actually submit [2107] this and what happens after I submit [2109] this is I feed into my flow which [2111] actually goes and then it creates a [2113] Google doc basic sorry a panda using all [2115] this information and it actually just [2118] ran a second ago so Discovery call form [2119] entry then pulled out the details of my [2123] forum and then it passes through an AI [2125] generation step which generates the [2127] proposal [2129] this step looks like this um I'm using [2131] an old actually GPT 4 model here I'm not [2133] using the newest one but we're an [2135] operations agency that builds Outreach [2136] system CRM System project management [2138] systems no code systems and Integrations [2140] below as a loose scope turn that scope [2141] into a high quality proposal in Json a [2143] client or Enterprise to write in a [2144] Spartan no FR stone that applies [2146] intelligence we are then feeding in a [2148] bunch of [2149] Json and then getting a couple of [2152] examples here so use my user assistant [2155] um you know Jason design p pattern which [2157] I just talked about in my previous video [2159] if you're un familiar with that then [2160] just um go back one video and I'll [2162] explain it all before I finally feed in [2165] the brief which is business description [2166] problem solution and [2168] tools it then generates the output and [2170] then I parse it in [2172] Json and I will show you guys what this [2174] looks like in a second but in addition [2176] we have the Milestones the timelines [2177] that we generate this is just a quick [2178] and easy way for us to seem as if we've [2180] scoped this project maybe a little more [2182] than we actually have uh we parse the [2184] Json there too and voila we have a bunch [2186] of timelines and then we actually go [2187] through the um the the pandadoc step we [2189] create the document in pandadoc so [2192] that's pretty cool uh let me see if I [2194] could find this document [2199] somewhere should be right over [2204] here and this is what the end result [2206] looks like streamline content generation [2208] for left clicks YouTube growth so it [2210] even picked a title for us which is [2211] pretty nice for left click nive by left [2213] click next this is because I used my own [2215] business name but then we have a big [2217] problem page here with some specific [2220] issues that uh essentially are [2223] Enterprise level paraphrases of the [2226] exact problems that I entered earlier so [2229] your current script writing process is [2230] inefficient and costly at left click [2232] you're relying heavily on script wrri St [2233] content for your YouTube channel this [2234] approach isn't just costly it's also [2236] timec consuming due to Long turnaround [2237] times occasional quality issues it's [2239] clearly this approach isn't scale well [2240] it's not the most effective use of your [2241] resources number two you need a new [2242] approach you seeking an Innovative way [2244] of producing scripts one that replaces [2245] human involved with automation Solution [2246] that's sufficient cost effective [2247] delivers high quality results how do we [2249] do it I'll build you a tailored content [2251] generation system using gbt 40 this AI [2253] content writing tool is widely regarded [2255] as the best most reasonably priced on [2256] the market you'll be able to input an [2257] example script and a brief including [2259] title and keyword and the a will [2260] generate a unique script so that it [2261] aligns with the example but includes [2263] ample variations for distinct video [2264] content next I'll create an automator [2266] workflow that saves scripts to Google [2267] Docs right pretty sick um right now the [2270] way that I set this up is just to save [2272] this as a draft not necessarily send and [2274] then what I'll sometimes do is I'll [2275] actually go and I'll pull from a bank of [2277] um uh like Whimsical images that I've [2280] pre-saved for different templated [2282] products I didn't do that in this case [2284] um but there something that you can do [2285] as well and then you know this is a [2287] templated proposal so I have a bunch of [2289] case studies I have a timeline section [2291] here and then down here I have the [2292] pricing pricing includes the dollar [2294] amount that I quoted earlier along with [2296] a price for the software fees um I don't [2299] actually charge the software fees [2300] obviously I just pass them through to my [2301] customer and my customer pays for them I [2303] then have a little contract set up with [2305] an agreement which is quite quite nice I [2307] like to thank [2308] so this system does this all [2309] autonomously um at the very end I even [2311] go as far as sending an [2313] email that says hey Nick I just sent [2315] over a detailed Services proposal for [2317] left click a moment ago on pandadoc for [2318] clarity the platform charges section is [2320] approximate these refs paid to the [2321] vendor so any price changes or taxes are [2322] out of my control that said they should [2324] be fairly accurate as of today upon [2325] signing or receive a payment request the [2327] first 50% deposit directly in app the [2328] sum under of this amount afterwards we [2330] can book a Geoff call and I'll begin in [2332] Earnest if you have any other cues let [2333] me know enjoy the rest of your day [2334] cheers Nick if you got that along with [2336] the proposal that's that customized from [2338] somebody within 5 minutes of finishing a [2340] call with them and you're planning on [2343] working with them for Automation [2344] Services you'd probably be at least a [2345] little bit impressed right that's sort [2347] of the way the system works so it's hard [2350] for me to say exactly how much [2352] attributable income I have made because [2353] of this but it's definitely been a few [2355] hundred, there was a point where I was [2357] banging out five or six of these [2358] proposals a day my calendar was just [2360] call after call after call after call [2362] and if you were doing this in a manual [2364] sort of format there was no way you'd be [2366] able to stick to even [2368] half the quality of a proposal system [2370] like this while also maintaining volume [2372] like that right so this sort of allows [2374] you to get Best of Both Worlds and um [2376] you know I've shared this sort of system [2377] before I'm going to copy over the [2378] blueprint and then share it with you [2380] guys again here um but you can uh VAR [2383] the system or you can implement the [2385] system in any sort of business the only [2387] requirement is you need to have some [2388] sort of sales call as long as you have a [2390] form that inputs structured info though [2391] and then you use gp4 to expand that or [2393] summarize that or take that to the next [2394] level you're basically good all right [2396] this next system is simple and easy [2398] hiring system that I've built out in [2399] clickup I've talked about this from time [2401] to time but I've never really given it [2403] um it's due diligence I would say and [2404] what I'm going to do in this videoos to [2405] show you how this works so I'm [2407] hypothetically hiring for a role here uh [2409] of video editor and what I've done is [2411] I've set up a pipeline and clickup that [2413] allows me to track incoming applicants [2416] the way that this works is uh we have a [2418] couple of different type forms the first [2421] type form is the General application [2422] form what we do is we go on upwork or we [2425] go on I don't know indeed or something [2428] of that nature and then we just copy and [2429] paste this form link and then people [2431] will go on to this form link and then [2433] they will read through it fill out their [2435] information and then that'll add them to [2436] our clickup so first and foremost it's [2439] not necessarily like the make.com [2440] scenario that's the the magic here um [2442] but there are there's a fair amount of [2444] juice just in the way the application is [2445] set up that I should run you guys [2446] through as well this saves us from [2448] having to have like somebody to do HR [2450] because we can just very quickly skim [2452] through qualified applicants and deal [2453] with them automatically it also allows [2455] us to get a slightly cheaper rate [2456] because applicants will self- select [2458] their prices which I'll talk about as [2459] well so the first question is what role [2461] are you applying for this way this form [2463] is General we don't necessarily need to [2464] swap out the link we just use the same [2466] form link for everything then who is [2468] Nick SAR this is me hiring for my own [2469] company so um what I always recommend [2471] you do is give somebody a breakdown of [2472] your business and tell them to browse [2474] their Channel or their website for [2476] context uh you want to make them think [2478] that obviously they're going to be [2480] tested on this and some respect that [2482] this is important information they need [2483] to know you don't want to scare them but [2484] you do need to make sure that somebody's [2486] actually going to spend the time to [2487] filled this proposal or filled this form [2489] that they've at least done enough due [2491] diligence to tell you roughly what your [2493] business is about then we have contact [2495] details and then the most important part [2496] is the portfolio so before proceeding [2498] we'd like to see some examples of your [2499] work if you don't have portfolio you can [2501] put one together in Google doc or Google [2502] Drive and then link it here if you do [2504] this make sure the sharing settings are [2505] on you would be surprised at how many [2506] people leave the sharing settings off we [2509] then are hiring in a variety of regions [2511] Canada US Philippines Australia EU and [2513] then other so we ask for that then we [2515] have a start date which is the soonest [2516] they're able to to begin some weekly [2518] availability which is important because [2520] sometimes we want people that work more [2522] sometimes we want people that work less [2523] and sometimes we want them to be [2524] flexible and then we have an hourly rate [2526] the desired hourly hourly rate in USD [2529] the reason why asking for an hourly rate [2531] is so important is because most people [2534] will compete with themselves most people [2537] will see this and then if they were [2539] planning on charging $25 they charge 24 [2542] it's a very small very very small [2544] Improvement to your margin but it's an [2546] improvement on the less like using that [2548] previous example if somebody is about to [2550] charge 25 and then they see this and [2552] they're like oh jeez you know they're [2553] probably going to be comparing rates um [2555] and then they put $24 in here you've [2557] essentially just made 4% on your payroll [2559] costs and if your payroll costs are I [2561] don't know 30% of your business like [2562] many companies are that's four time 30 [2565] you basically just improved your margin [2566] by a whole 1.2% for free so this costs [2569] you nothing to include um you're going [2571] to include this on like the job platform [2573] anyway but logically speaking just [2575] having people put their hourly rates in [2577] here is just a great way to shave off a [2579] few percentage points um and then just [2581] like keep your business as profitable as [2582] possible also to imply that like this [2584] isn't the sort of company we just going [2586] to come in and slack off look at the [2587] clock and then get a paycheck um you [2588] know we want people to put their best [2590] foot forward and actually earn the money [2591] that they make the reason why I may seem [2594] a little bit jaded and hard about this [2596] is just because I've ran basically a [2597] Contracting Agency for several years now [2599] and there are a lot of people that will [2600] just try and ease you like uh you know [2602] automatic free paycheck remote work can [2605] be difficult like this The Sweet Spot is [2607] not pretending like you are looking over [2609] their shoulder the entire time while [2610] they work but to have systems that [2612] essentially allow you to M obtain that [2614] same amount of information if you really [2615] wanted to any who after they fill out [2617] this form we have a next step section um [2620] at these next steps what happens is we [2622] we add them to the sheet right and then [2625] what we can do is we can change their [2626] status from new applicant [2627] to um I don't know like request trial [2633] what happens when we move them to [2634] request trial is I will send them [2637] an [2638] email using this scenario here this [2642] scenario catches a web Hook from clickup [2644] clickup allows you to send web hooks [2646] anytime that you change the status we'll [2648] then get the task and then we'll send an [2649] email the email will look like this game [2652] to do a paid trial hey blank we really [2654] like your portfolio I'd love to have you [2655] put together a paid trial clip for us [2657] blows a link to a form which explains [2658] the trial gives you a brief and tells [2659] you to upload the finished product [2660] remember to invoice us when you're done [2662] then we have the form you'll notice that [2664] we're adding a bunch of custom [2665] information to this form including the [2666] location the rate the email and then the [2668] task ID um this actually ends up [2670] customizing the form and makes it a lot [2672] easier for us to deal with later then we [2674] change the status of the task to reflect [2676] the fact that you know we just sent them [2677] a trial request we're waiting for them [2679] to do the trial and then the trial [2681] actually looks something like this now [2682] this is for a role that we were hiring [2684] called [2685] automator first thing we ask them is to [2687] track their time using clockify another [2688] time tracking app if they reach a [2689] two-hour Mark and have yet to finish the [2691] pie shoot us an email before you [2692] continue this just ensures that because [2694] you know we do a paid trial approach we [2695] want people to show us their actual work [2697] not just like jump on a call with us and [2699] you know sell us on themselves before we [2701] actually know what they're capable of um [2704] we're going to pay them for this right [2705] but I don't want to pay somebody 15 [2707] hours for a project that I don't end up [2708] using so I say if you've reached two [2711] hours and you haven't done yet send us [2712] an email and if they send us an email [2714] I'm basically saying all right well [2715] you're not a fit because this project [2716] shouldn't take you more than two hours [2718] your task is to create a simple make.com [2720] email [2721] autoresponder here's a brief of your [2724] position and sort of like the context [2726] I'm asking for some business bus [2727] knowledge here then record a loom video [2731] I actually record a loom of walking [2732] through their system that's what I [2733] request how much time did this take you [2735] I don't request a blueprint by the way [2736] because a lot of companies will do this [2738] they'll just try and farm blueprints off [2739] of people which is very silly how much [2741] time did it take you and then nice work [2743] time to send us an invoice what happens [2744] after that step [2746] is you know when they fill it out um [2749] I'll catch the form fill in this [2752] scenario then after it's um caught I [2755] will go back and click up edit [2758] and then I'll thank them for the trial [2760] video and tell them to send an invoice [2762] their status will then change to review [2764] trial I'll then review their trial which [2766] exists in a a column called trial video [2769] URL over here then if it's good enough [2771] I'll actually go onboarding and I'll [2773] either jump on a call with them really [2774] quickly or I'll just add them to my [2775] slack immediately and then start working [2777] with them this is a much higher Roi much [2780] faster way of doing hiring I'm not [2781] wasting hours of my life talking to [2784] people that seem like they're great but [2786] I just have better sales skills than the [2787] actual skills I'm looking for you know [2789] if I'm hiring a sales role then that's [2790] awesome but most of the time I'm not [2792] hiring a sales role so doesn't really [2793] make sense for me right you can adapt [2796] this sort of system to any industry [2797] whether it's uh you know some local [2799] Services business whether it's digital [2801] remote whether you're hiring SAS staff [2803] members software Engineers the point is [2805] just always going to be the same you [2806] essentially start with some sort of [2808] application form which standardizes the [2810] data and then um you select People based [2812] off their portfolio based off their [2814] skills and then give them a trial that [2815] allows them to show you EX exactly what [2817] they're actually going to be doing in [2818] your business um not just you know [2819] talking off your ear but yeah that's [2821] another really high Roi system saves me [2823] thousands of dollars every single month [2826] on wasted hires um people that are like [2828] low Roi inefficient um and you know on [2831] like having a staff member that actually [2832] needs to check all the stuff which is [2833] pretty sweet all right the last system I [2835] actually just showed it in the previous [2836] video but since I have now found so much [2839] ridiculous value in it um I think this [2841] video or sorry the system which [2843] essentially is like a video idea creator [2845] for YouTube I think this is probably [2847] going to make me or save me the most [2849] amount of money moving forward just [2850] because opportunity costs is my big [2851] problem um and it's been quite difficult [2853] finding video ideas that actually work [2855] to be honest any who if you haven't seen [2857] my last video this is the way that it [2858] works um I essentially will go through [2860] my YouTube channel and then I will [2861] scrape every single comment that has [2862] ever been left on my YouTube I do that [2865] using a platform called appify which [2866] gives you $5 in free credits that's [2868] equal to about 2,000 YouTube comments [2869] right up front we will then filter [2871] through all of the appify data set items [2874] if it's a real comment AK if the length [2875] is over like five characters or [2877] something we'll then feed it into gp4 [2879] with a prompt [2883] like we're looking for Content ideas [2885] below is a YouTube comment on one of our [2886] videos your task is determine if the [2888] comment is relevant and if includes [2889] questions inquiries or suggestions that [2890] we can use as idea for future video [2893] return the results in Jason using the [2895] following format so basically what this [2897] does is it allows me to um very quickly [2899] and easily go through all of my comments [2902] and then just identify which ones [2903] request or suggest or inquire about you [2905] know something that I could use is a [2907] Content idea after we've verified right [2909] if the status is true then we continue [2912] down this route and then I have another [2913] model that actually creates a hook in an [2915] outline um this hook and outline is not [2917] amazing it's not perfect or anything but [2919] it helps eliminate like the blank page [2920] syndrome that is so common anytime [2922] you're doing content creation afterwards [2924] it adds this to a Google sheet here and [2927] I'm going I'm currently going through [2928] this Google sheet myself you can see we [2930] we've done about 2,000 so far I still [2931] have another 5,000 or so content ideas [2933] to go through I just didn't want to you [2934] know spend like 40,000 Ops that one uh [2937] that one day um but then I just go [2939] through this and then I pick out the [2940] ideas that make sense to me the ones [2942] that I want to answer and this [2944] essentially becomes my content calendar [2945] moving forward which is pretty high Roi [2947] so the way that you can change this is [2950] depending on whatever business model [2951] you're running whether it's like a video [2953] business like mine maybe you're writing [2955] like blogs maybe you're doing some sort [2956] of like Photo business stuff on [2958] Pinterest um you can scrape whatever the [2961] data sources that you're competing on so [2962] if you're competing on medium maybe you [2964] could scrape medium posts if you're [2965] competing on you know as I mentioned [2967] Pinterest you could scrape Pinterest [2968] comments you could pass them through a [2970] filter just like this you could identify [2971] whether they're asking for something or [2973] whether they they they basically contain [2975] an idea that you could use to do [2976] something with and then you could use [2977] them um feed in a couple of rules like [2980] how to create an effective title or [2981] effective piece of content but then you [2983] could use them to like train um a model [2986] like in context train a model to come up [2989] with ideas titles hooks outlines hell [2992] even whole pieces of content if we're [2993] just talking text and photo um pretty [2995] soon you'll be able to come up the video [2997] content too I mean I'm sure you guys can [2998] imagine if I trained like a haen model [3000] or something like that on me obviously [3002] it wouldn't be anywhere near as [3003] expressive and it would probably be even [3004] more uncanny valley than I am but you [3006] know if I had an outline and a hook and [3007] a whole script and I had to read it off [3009] it would actually do like a pretty [3010] passable job right now so yeah obviously [3012] video is is one thing um that is [3014] probably not going to be fully [3015] surmounted for the next few months but [3017] uh this is this is a good and quick and [3019] easy way that you can get up and running [3020] with a system like this all right I hope [3022] you guys appreciated that video had a [3024] lot of fun putting it together these are [3025] the seven m automations that [3027] collectively make me over $200,000 a [3030] year and you can find every single one [3031] of their blueprints Down Below in the [3033] description just check out the gumroad [3035] if you guys like this sort of content I [3036] also do tons of coaching and Consulting [3039] on how to get your very first customer [3041] with a make.com or automation business [3043] uh you can check that out it's also in [3044] the description called maker school um [3047] otherwise you guys could do me a big [3048] solid leave a comment down below for my [3049] comment scraper to pick up and then turn [3051] into an idea next week uh like subscribe [3053] do all that fun stuff for the YouTube [3054] Alo and I'll catch you on the next video [3056] oh

Title: How This Infinite Content Idea Machine Scaled Me to 28K Subs
[0] hi my name is Nick in the last8 months [1] I've earned almost 30,000 YouTube [3] subscribers and the way that I did it [4] was one always being consistent but more [7] importantly two always having a super [9] high quality Bank of basically infinite [11] content ideas that answer exactly what [13] my customers and fans want to know so in [15] this video I'm going to show you how you [16] can build a system that enables you to [18] do this to generate a massive list of [20] content ideas super quickly using a low [23] code and no code platforms like appify [24] and make.com we're going to do it live [26] I'm going to build it in front of you [27] and at the end of it you're going to [28] have a system like that too stay tuned [30] and let's get into [33] it so here's how the system is going to [35] work we are going to start by scraping [37] YouTube video comments it is a super [40] underutilized gold mine for Content [42] ideas because this is basically exactly [43] what the market in a particular Niche [45] wants right A lot of the time comments [47] that I receive under my videos are stuff [48] like Nate can you please do a video [49] about X well there people are asking me [51] to do a video about X odds are X is [53] pretty important right so we're going to [54] start by scraping YouTube video comments [56] this going to be your own video this [57] could be somebody else's video this [58] could be the top Creator in the space [59] whatever we're then going to pass it [60] through an AI filter that will look for [63] Relevant questions or queries or [65] suggestions uh this is you know people [67] formatting things in the form of a [68] question can you do a video like this or [71] maybe as a throw-off comment like hey [72] I'd love it if we could see some videos [74] like this we're then going to grab all [76] of those um concatenate them and then [78] format them as content titles uh topics [81] or blog posts this really depends on [82] whatever type of content you want to [84] produce in my case I'm doing YouTube [85] videos and then as we see here there's [88] sort of like a dash line in my whimsicle [90] it's just a flowchart tool if you're [91] unfamiliar with it by the way um where [93] we could extend this to one more step [94] and then actually generate the content [96] automatically now I'm not actually going [97] to be generating the content [98] automatically because I do find in [99] practice it is hard to generate high [101] quality talking head content um I know a [103] lot of people here have left comments on [105] my recent videos being like I'm pretty [106] sure you're a robot sick AI tool bro uh [109] but no I am actually human at least for [111] now until I continue the cybernetic [113] augmentations and get mantis blades but [115] uh I will let you guys know when that [116] happens for now I'm going to be looking [118] to um basically do the first two or [120] three yeah the first three steps going [123] to stop right at the end there CU this [124] is a system that I'm actually using for [125] myself and I'm going to show you guys [127] how I'm going to use it for myself too [128] in terms of the platforms we're going to [129] use for this we're going to use appify [131] appify is sort of like a web scraping [134] store that you can sign up to where tons [136] of people around the world have spent [137] all of the time energy and leg work [139] actually building out systems to scrape [141] YouTube comments scrape Instagram scrape [143] Facebook LinkedIn feel free to just head [145] over to ay.com store if you want to [147] check out a few um I now have a referral [151] link to appify but I was not always [152] affiliated with them I just really love [153] these guys that said I'm not chilling [155] there are a variety of other you know [156] great scraping platforms stuff like that [158] you guys can use to feel free to use [159] whatever you guys want as your trigger [160] step but this is what we're going to be [161] uh working with and then um we're going [164] to use a YouTube comment scraper [166] basically from this and we're going to [168] get the output here in this no Cod tool [169] make.com that's going to enable us to [172] iterate through every single one of [173] these comments then after we've iterated [174] through we can set up like a prompt [176] Pipeline with artificial intelligence to [178] filter through and then and decide [180] whether or not these comments are worth [181] keeping or worth feeding through the [183] rest of our enrichment Pipeline and then [185] at the very end what we're going to do [186] is we're going to set up uh like a [188] couple of additional prompts basically [189] just refine it improve the quality and [191] then since I'm doing YouTube videos [192] maybe I'll even have it like trying to [193] help me come up with a hook or something [195] so that's the system in a nutshell as [196] you guys can tell not super crazy [198] complicated but if it's your first time [199] using um scraping systems like this you [201] know I can definitely see how it might [202] be intimidating I'm going to walk you [204] guys through it as if you have zero [205] knowledge um let me just take a drink of [207] this very interesting purple liquid [211] thank you purple liquid okay so we're [214] going to jump right into appify first [216] I'm going to show you guys how to do [217] this we're going to use this YouTube [219] comment scraper what we want is this one [222] right over here this alternative YouTube [223] data API has no limits or quotas I'll [226] tell you why it's because they are not [228] abiding by the YouTube TOS they're [229] scraping the hell out of it I'm going to [232] cancel my changes here and basically the [233] way that this works is um you know you [235] have to sign up to app ify make an [236] account uh they give you $5 in free [238] credits I think so I'm on a paid plan [240] obviously with $200 a month of limit but [243] uh you know the $5 should do more than [245] 2,500 comments which should be [247] substantial for you to get up and [248] running with some content idas I don't [249] know how many content idas you can [250] generate for500 comments but probably a [252] fair amount and basically the way this [254] is going to work is we need to pump in [255] our direct video URLs so that's just [257] YouTube links that are formatted like [259] this youtube.com/watch SLV equals some [262] custom uu ID and then uh we set the [266] maximum number of comments we want to [267] scrape so actually just for demonst of [270] purposes why I go to 100 and then what [273] we want to do is we want to find just [274] one of my videos here let's do one that [276] has a fair number of comments the future [279] of automation one that was pretty spicy [281] and we'll um you know I just click got [283] the sharable link but if I paste this in [285] notice how that's not actually the link [286] I had to go one step further and then [289] voila we have this and then all we have [290] to do is we just go down to save and [294] start and this will this will actually [296] start the run so as I mentioned you're [298] going to get $5 in free credits when you [299] sign up to appify so the actual run is [302] not going to cost anything until you hit [304] uh 2,500 but there are also some other [306] things to keep in mind if it's your [307] first time using this platform uh [308] basically what appify is is it it spins [310] up web servers elsewhere and those web [312] servers are responsible um for actually [315] going out and building that scraper um [317] and then we have a little usage [319] parameter which is the number of dollars [320] that it's basically costing you to run [322] these things so I believe I was scraping [324] 100 right awesome and we just pumped in [326] the video and as we see now we have 100 [328] comments and some of them tell me that [331] I'm authentic and other ones say that [332] I'm a massive piece of um so what [334] we're going to do is we're going to pump [335] all of those comments into one tight [337] little funnel and that funnel is going [339] to essentially tell us which one of [341] these uh you know are recommending other [344] content insights so this one for [345] instance will be fun to see what this [346] video will look like in hindsight thanks [348] for the precious info I wonder what [349] industry leader should I follow to be [350] ahead of the curve like you from this [352] lovely guepe um that might actually be a [354] pretty good video right like the top AI [355] content creators in the space or the top [357] industry leaders in AI to follow that [359] don't actually [360] give you maybe people that have [361] actually made [362] money um I don't know maybe you know it [365] extract some data from this and tell you [367] that like why SAS and API based [369] businesses will no longer be needed in [370] 2025 right these are these are sorts of [372] the things that we're going to [373] automatically be generating titles for [375] um and the value here is I mean if you [377] just have like a great Google sheet full [378] of high quality continuities that people [380] are actually struggling from the quality [382] of the things that you produce will be [383] way higher than if you just trying to [385] fulfill some search need or some other [387]  like that so great now that we [390] figured out how applify Works what we [391] need to do is we need to go to make.com [393] we basically need to find a way to [394] extract this run so the way that I'm [395] going to set the system up is I'm [397] actually going to trigger it in appify [398] and I'm not going to trigger it all the [399] time I'm just going to trigger it like [400] whenever I need content ideas so maybe [403] once a week or something and then [404] whenever it finishes I'm going to build [405] the flow at make.com so it catches that [408] uh completion and then it grabs the data [411] from it and then proceeds with the rest [412] of our flow easiest way for us to do [414] this is all we need to do is just type [416] appify here what we want is we want [419] watch actor runs from there we'll need [421] to create a hook so I'm going to go in [423] there and then create a [426] hook and let's just say finished YouTube [430] comments scraper let's spell finished [432] correctly then the actor that we're [434] going to be choosing will be YouTube uh [438] comments scraper just make sure you're [439] using the right one so in my case it was [440] streamer you- comments- [443] scraper I'm going click save and I'm [446] going to click okay and so now what we [448] have is we have something that is [449] capable of watching that specific actor [452] if you don't have appify connected [454] you're obviously going to have to go [454] through the connection step where you go [456] maybe get an API key or maybe it's [458] through ooth but let me actually show [459] you what this looks like in practice so [460] we just finished the run right um let me [462] go back in time and just maybe set the [464] maximum number of comments to 10 and [465] then just run this one more time just so [466] we could actually see this work um live [469] the reason why I do this is because you [470] know a lot of the time if you're [471] unfamiliar with these platforms kind of [472] looks like magic right why why is it [474] that you start something over here and [475] then all of a sudden you get the results [476] over there well this is just a quick and [478] easy way for me to validate and show you [480] guys uh what's sort of going on under [482] the hood so we just fir up the scraper [484] it is now getting our data usually takes [486] around 1 minute to start seeing results [488] it is now actually going and finding [490] said data and as you see we now have a [493] an event essentially that's come through [495] a web hook that has hit our make.com [497] scenario and it says that our status has [499] succeeded the question is though where [501] do we get that data I'm not seeing it in [503] any of these variables right meta stats [506] what have you well in appify it's buried [508] underneath another step called get data [510] set items so what you have to do in [512] order to make this work make sure you're [514] on the right account is you have to feed [516] in a variable called defa default data [519] set ID this one right over here and so [521] this is now going to pull the actual [523] items from the data set that correspond [525] to the specific one that that was run [527] and applified the reason why is because [528] you can actually add to different data [530] sets you have sort of the the ability or [533] choice to do so so this is just a quick [535] and easy way for us to um or sorry for [538] appify to kind of give you a lot more [539] Flex ability what we want is we want to [541] you know because I just ran this and I [543] don't basically want to have to run this [544] every freaking time um what I'm going to [546] do is I'm just going to go and paste in [547] the actual data set ID which I just got [549] here I went to storage and then I went [551] data set ID I copied that over and I'm [553] actually just going to run this one [554] module on its own just because I want to [556] I want to show you guys what that looks [557] like so I'm going to right click press [559] run this module only and now we're [561] actually going to get all of that data [562] the same data that we had earlier when [564] we ran it in appify the thing is now [565] though it's just accessible to us in [566] make.com we can now obviously glue it [568] together with a bunch of other so [570] um that looks pretty [572] good uh looks like we got 10 results yes [576] we got a whole 10 results um for the [580] purposes of this video why don't I go [581] back to the second run sorry the first [584] run because I know I think I got 100 [586] responses back here right okay great and [587] I'm going to go to storage and then I'm [588] actually going to copy this one just [590] because I want to get the one with 100 [591] because that'll just enable us to do [593] more with it now we're going to run it [596] again and voila we have all 100 [598] responses beautiful [600] okay so because I don't actually want to [602] waste 100 operations and make every time [604] I do this I'm just going to set the [604] limit to 10 I'm going to delete this ah [607] actually no I'm going to keep it let [609] just put it on top here so it doesn't [610] keep on shunting me over to the right uh [612] and now we're actually going to build [613] out the rest of our flow so the very [615] first thing I want to do really quickly [616] just scanning through the data is I want [618] to make sure that when I do this all of [619] the data is correct like I'm not wasting [622] tokens or operations on stuff that is [624] not necessarily valuable again I'm doing [627] this on my own videos but you guys can [628] do this um on other people's videos too [630] there's no reason why not okay comments [633] that have let's say under a certain [635] number of of characters I probably don't [637] need to feed in so people that are just [639] like no or BS or whatever I'll probably [641] be able to filter a few of those out um [643] just in that way the reason why is [644] because I kind of already know that AI [645] is going to say hey man this is not uh a [647] comment that includes any sort of [649] content idea and my idea is I want to [651] build this system out to be as efficient [652] as possible I don't want to feed things [654] into AI if the comments are not of [656] sufficient length or sufficient value or [658] whatnot [659] so yeah I think uh that's a pretty [661] simple rule we can Implement what else [663] am I seeing just off the top of my [666] head [667] um we got to make sure that the length [669] isn't too short obviously [672] but [673] yeah cool okay so stuff like this would [676] be can you make a video about the basic [677] business skills that everyone should [678] know and resources to it yeah that's [680] pretty good I wonder what else we could [682] feed into the AI let's see [686] here the future of automation after 2024 [689] so what I'm thinking we're going to do [690] is we're going to feed in the title of [692] the video and then we're also going to [693] feed in the comment that we've [696] received uh and that is going to help us [699] that's going to help give the AI a [700] little bit of context when we set up our [701] filter all right so that's what we're [704] going to do let's go to open AI [706] now let's do create a [708] completion and if you guys are [710] unfamiliar um you know we're going to be [713] using a very specific type of structur [714] data in this video called Json JS n [716] JavaScript object notation I'm going use [718] the gbt 40 series of models for this set [721] max tokens to 496 and then I'm just [723] going to scroll down here and then go [725] response format text I'm going to go [727] Jason object parse Json response as well [730] um if you don't know how Json works or [732] JavaScript object notation works it's [733] just a form of structured data that will [735] essentially enable us to prompt this and [736] then receive the the outputs as like [738] formatted data that we can use in the [740] rest of our flow without having to take [741] additional steps so I'm going to go to [743] message content here um I'm going to set [744] a system prompt I'll just say you are a [746] helpful [747] intelligent content writing assistant [751] and then underneath I'm going to add a [752] message as a user and I just need to [754] test this out first like I don't [755] actually know if this use case is going [757] to work right um well obviously I did [759] before I made the video because I did [761] some tests but I'm just trying to be as [762] accurate to what your guys actual [764] building experience would be if you guys [765] were trying to build a flow like this [766] right so you always want to make sure to [768] test the flow before you spend the time [770] and energy building it out you just need [772] to make sure that it works at least some [773] proportion of time you know make sure it [775] works at least half of the time with [776] your shitty prompt and then you can [777] spend the time and energy necessary to [779] refine that and make it better but you [781] know the big issue I see is people will [783] will typically invest a lot of time and [784] effort into something that is Half Baked [786] they don't even know if it's going to [787] work so iteratively testing as you [790] approach a completed system is very [792] important and um you know inm make.com [794] appify whatever a big theme that you'll [796] see me do is I'll run something I'll [797] look at the outputs and only if I'm [798] satisfied with the outputs will I build [800] the next thing so that's what we're [801] going to be doing here uh off the top of [803] my head I'm going to say something along [805] the lines of below is a YouTube comment [809] on a video your task is to determine if [813] the comment is [815] relevant um hold on a second we are [820] looking for Content ideas below is a [823] YouTube comment on one of our videos [826] your task is determine if the comment is [827] relevant and if it includes any [830] suggestions let's do questions inquiries [833] or suggestions that we can [835] use as an idea for a future video Let's [839] do [840] that [842] return [844] um the result in Jason using the [847] following [848] format Jason is all curly bracket based [851] so I'm going to write this out in Jason [853] again we are just inventing our own [855] format here um there's no like I'm not [858] picking this I'm not choosing from a a [861] set number of formats I'm just like [863] pulling the out of my ass for lack [865] of a better word um so the term that [867] we're going to be looking for here is [869] uh okay return the result and Jason [871] using the following format uh let's do [875] status [877] succeeded or false or [881] maybe success or [885] failure um what else do we [889] need content [892] idea let's do content [894] title actually let's do content idea [897] we'll do [901] um true or false content uh let's [905] actually do sorry Boolean content idea [908] string and then what else do we need [910] here I mean we could like get a bunch of [913] metadata we could say like [919] outline um I'm saying Boolean string and [922] and string just because I want to inform [924] it as to what sort of stuff to generate [926] Boolean just refers to true or false [928] although I am techn wrapping this in [929] string characters um but that's okay I'm [931] going to be training it after then what [933] I'm going to do is I'm going to provide [934] an actual example of the input uh which [937] is going to be like video title and why [939] don't we actually just take stuff [941] directly from this data set let's just [944] zoom out go back [949] here let's see [951] here that is [955] definitely cool [960] oh now this is a really interesting [961] comment let's do this one from De Deft [963] uncut thank you Deft [968] uncut oh man okay so the comment is [971] going to be here and it's going to be [974] this then the video title uh was it like [977] the future of automation or something of [980] automation after 2024 awesome and then [984] we want the a assistant now to generate [986] us an output so I'm just going to use AI [988] to build build out my own pattern so or [991] my own response pattern let's see the [994] result status true content exploring the [997] role of humans in the age of automation [998] that's actually pretty good I like it um [1000] then we have an outline brief overview [1002] of automation advancements post 2024 how [1004] automation is Shifting employment [1005] paradigms what it means and why it's [1009] significant obviously other cool I [1011] mean the outline is fine I'm not really [1012] going to worry too much about the [1013] outline I just wanted to show you guys [1015] that you could generate multiple [1016] different types of data as an output [1019] still we can totally use this as um our [1022] training data now so now that I'm going [1023] to you know now that we just outputed [1025] something I'm going to actually add it [1026] back in I'm going to do it as training [1030] data uh although it does have a bunch of [1032] these like back ticks and I don't [1034] really want to deal with them so why [1036] don't I just go content idea exploring [1038] the role of humans in the age of [1042] automation we'll go content idea [1049] okay let's actually just leave the [1050] outline we're not going to have one [1052] we'll go status and then we'll go true [1055] Contin exploring the role of humans in [1056] the age of [1058] automation [1063] um maybe content ideas actually that [1065] would be really interesting maybe we [1068] have three content ideas generated for [1069] every comment that's positive I really [1071] like that yeah let's do [1073] that exploring the role of humans in the [1075] age of [1076] automation um humans uh [1081] uh will humans be relegated to curator [1087] roles and then let's [1091] do living in a postcar city economy [1096] something like that I don't know I'm [1097] just trying to have it come up with [1098] interesting okay great now that we [1100] are going to generate an output [1103] containing let's do content ideas we'll [1105] call this an [1107] array um [1109] now that we've sort of given this AI an [1111] example of what we want from it we've [1113] actually given it a video title and then [1115] we have the the output for a positive [1117] response I kind of want to get one for [1119] negative response too um so that's what [1121] I'm going to look for next I'll go user [1123] and then I'm actually going to go back [1125] into our output here and I'm going to [1129] see if there's anything at all that we [1130] can do with authentic [1132] guy so first we're just going to see if [1134] this instinctively understands what I'm [1136] asking for um the video title is again [1139] the future of automation after 2024 and [1143] then the comment is going to be [1145] authentic [1146] guy then up here I'm going to provide it [1148] some additional [1152] context I'll say if the content idea if [1157] the comment contains a Content idea [1160] return status [1162] true [1164] and add content ideas to the content [1168] ideas array if the comment does not [1173] contain a Content idea return status [1176] false and leave content ideas [1179] empty this should be not overwhelmingly [1182] complicated for the model let's see how [1184] this runs now we should get a false we [1188] should get nothing inside of contentas [1190] beautiful [1191] awesome so I'm just going to now I mean [1195] my model already kind of understands [1196] this but that's all right we'll go [1198] assistant [1199] we'll go false and then we'll just leave [1200] this as an empty [1203] array um and now that I've done this let [1205] me just see if my formatting is all [1207] right okay great now we can actually add [1208] our own real data and I just have to [1211] plug in my laptop before it you know [1213] completely shuts down on us one [1217] sec where the hell is that cable okay [1221] great beautiful um yeah and now we're [1225] actually going to put in our data so [1226] what we want is we want video title and [1229] the value that we want for video title [1230] is title wrap that in quotes and then we [1232] want the actual comment we want comment [1236] and then if you guys remember back to [1238] what I was saying that we we wanted to [1239] set up a rule I'll just say real comment [1243] and we'll Define a real comment as [1245] something that has a [1249] length [1250] of um over oh geez I don't know let's do [1255] like five or so maybe greater than five [1259] I mean I do want to filter out just like [1260] the few letter comments five five sounds [1263] sufficient okay great now what we can do [1267] here we'll just say [1269] filter and create content idea what we [1273] can do here is now that we've created [1275] content ideas we can actually use an [1276] iterator iterate through them and then [1278] generate the outlines that way instead [1280] so this is going to be a lot [1282] better than what we were doing before [1285] but what I have to do is I just have to [1286] check that length of content ideas [1289] is greater than [1293] zero um because I don't want to be [1295] iterating over something empty you know [1296] odds are oh and actually we should do [1299] status is equal to [1301] True um we don't want to be iterating [1303] over something empty obviously um and [1305] then what I'm going to do next is just [1307] off the top of my head it' be cool if we [1309] added this to a Google sheet right we'd [1311] want the outline to contain all of the [1313] information including like the comment [1316] on that parent that contains [1319] the comment sorry uh uh the parent [1321] comment as well so we could look back at [1323] the at the comment itself so I'm going [1325] to go to sheets. new and then I'm going [1328] to create my own little spreadsheet here [1330] and uh what are we going to need we're [1331] going to need if you think about this [1333] we're not going to need status because [1334] odds are anything in that sheet will [1336] already have um a status true right [1339] we're not going to make it past that [1341] until the status is there but why don't [1343] we have like a date [1345] added that'll help [1349] why don't we have a Content [1353] idea we'll go actually no we'll go [1357] parent comment and we'll go content idea [1360] then we'll go [1363] outline then what I'll do as well is [1365] I'll have like a [1367] feasible maybe I'll have like my own [1369] column that I can score content ideas [1370] with so I'll say like content or maybe [1372] I'll do like score and then it'll be [1374] like out of five this is just going to [1375] be a quick and easy way for me to like [1377] set up my own content calendar for [1379] YouTube um let me think about [1382] this I've set up a much more primitive [1384] system than this but I just want to make [1386] sure that uh you know the stuff that I [1388] build and actually show you guys is [1389] something that I actually end up using [1391] um because I think that's just way more [1392] interesting like if you guys see me [1393] build the actual infrastructure that I [1395] use in order to create more YouTube [1396] videos I mean how valuable is that right [1400] this is everything that I would be [1401] thinking of while I design this in [1403] actuality um and I really like my Google [1406] Sheets to be inter with this nice blue [1408] theme [1409] so chalk that up to my [1411] OCD let me think about some oh you know [1414] what we could even generate a hook why [1415] don't we generate a hook and an outline [1417] okay I'm going to paste the outline here [1419] we'll do hook here and we'll do outline [1422] then we'll do [1424] rating the rating will be out of [1428] 10 maybe 10 point rating um I'm going to [1431] go through and then rate my content [1432] ideas after this runs and then that way [1435] I'm just going to like have a sorted [1436] list of content ideas that I think will [1437] have high impact and be high quality [1440] okay great now that we've done this uh [1441] why don't we do this as well we're going [1443] to iterate through all these comments [1446] are going to be real so I can remove [1447] that filter that came along let me say [1450] create hook and outline and now what we [1453] can do is we can actually feed in some [1454] hooks now I just had a great call with [1457] um really bright guy that taught me how [1460] to write some pretty high quality hooks [1462] so I'm going to say you are helpful [1463] intelligent content writing assistant [1465] and now I'm going to like have it [1466] generate me Hooks and outlines [1469] your task is to generate highquality [1471] engaging Hooks and outlines for Content [1477] ideas you'll receive a Content idea in [1481] Json in your task and you'll return it [1486] in the following [1487] format we're going to say [1490] hook and then we're also going to say [1493] outline nice that looks great to me okay [1496] sweet so now I'm going to do is I'm [1498] going to build out our next prompt and [1500] the way that I'm going to do it is I'm [1501] going to use the training examples that [1502] I had in the previous one there's no use [1504] rebuilding the Wheel from scratch right [1507] I really like these [1509] ideas so what I'll do is I'll feed in [1513] this object we'll go content idea and [1516] we're just going to do one at a [1522] time um what we need to do here if you [1524] think about [1525] it is we need to make sure that these [1528] content outlines are engaging we also [1530] need to make sure the hooks are high [1531] quality the issue that a lot of people [1533] have with these are they don't follow um [1535] Alex Orosi what I just talked about with [1537] this um YouTube consultant was [1540] maximizing the perceived value of the [1542] first 30 seconds and Alex rosi has this [1544] strategy that he uses where he says a [1546] proof [1548] um process or something [1553] proof let me just Google this really [1556] quickly proof promise and plan okay so [1559] yeah we need to use um Alex Hero's proof [1562] promise and plan however if you think [1563] about it if I were just to tell the AI [1565] hey use the proof promise plan idea it's [1567] not really going to get this because [1568] odds are it's not trained on a data set [1570] that includes Alex rosi talking a lot [1572] about this so instead what I'm going to [1573] do is I'm going to try and show it what [1574] the proof promise and plan is so maybe [1578] what we'll [1579] do actually the very first thing we'll [1581] do is we just need to run this and see [1582] what it what it generates us right so [1584] user Contin living in a post scarcity [1585] economy [1589] oh um last [1595] thing you're creating content for Nick [1599] sarif you run several successful [1601] Automation and content businesses some [1604] key case studies and social [1608] proof um let's do Nick made over 100,000 [1614] USD in August [1617] 2024 next Nick runs a Content writing [1620] agency that's scale to [1623] $92,000 per month Nick runs an [1627] automation agency that's scaled to 72 oh [1631] I do not know the specific figures so [1633] we're just going to leave it at that um [1636] Nick has been featured in Popular [1638] Mechanics um Apple [1641] news let's do this and let's go fifth [1644] nick uh what was that other cool thing [1646] that I was talking about at the [1647] beginning of this video ni has almost [1649] 30,000 subscribers on YouTube okay great [1653] so let's just let this run now and let's [1656] see what it comes up [1660] with I don't like this hook at all so we [1663] need to use um proof principle and [1665] promise we need to teach it how to use [1667] this hook [1669] properly so what I'm going to do is I'm [1671] going to go assistant and we're going to [1674] output and then uh I had some hook that [1677] I just copied for this video that I just [1680] put together a second [1682] ago let me see here no maybe it was over [1688] here yeah it was totally over here okay [1691] great so this is a hook that I just put [1693] together beautiful and then why don't we [1695] just make this really easy we'll say [1697] content idea [1699] um how to generate infinite content [1702] ideas for YouTube I don't actually know [1704] the title of this video yet but I'm just [1706] going to paste this in [1714] make.com and appify [1718] awesome um now we need an outline as [1720] well so I need [1723] to come up with some sort of outline for [1727] this why don't I start with um [1732] hook then I do some sort [1736] of intro uction to the software [1739] platforms I love how meta this is then I [1743] do [1746] um testing the comment [1750] scraper then I [1753] do I'm using new lines here because I [1755] want to space it out um back sln is just [1758] a new line character that make [1760] understands and that AI understands and [1762] it just enables me to stick all the [1764] stuff into Json without necessarily [1766] compromising the formatting if you had a [1767] bunch of like actual new lines like I [1769] put a bunch of enter keys in Jason it [1770] won't work uh and then the fourth [1773] is say building out flow then the F the [1778] fifth is let's just do like wrap up cool [1781] that looks pretty good to me should be [1784] fine now we're going to add another one [1788] and what we want is uh we want another [1790] content idea which I'm going to get from [1793] here then we're going to do this um [1798] top seven basic business skills you need [1802] to know in 2025 let's do [1806] that go back over here and then I'll go [1808] content idea just paste that puppy and [1811] now we're going to see how it does on [1813] our new [1818] set I don't like the ready to Future [1820] proof your business strategy I really [1822] don't like when it comes out with stuff [1823] like that so what I'm going to do is I'm [1824] going to have it [1826] say use a spon No Frills tone of [1830] voice minimize [1833] flamboyancy weird or uncommon verbiage [1839] Etc I'm going to run this one more time [1843] now make sure that prompt looks nice and [1846] sexy for [1849] us um I don't like this one [1853] more make sure you use Nick's social [1858] proof in the hook this is [1862] essential we'll say something like [1865] that one final test [1873] here cool um that actually looks pretty [1875] reasonable oh it even comes up with like [1877] the skills themselves pretty nice all [1880] right now what I'm going to do is I'm [1881] going to put together a Google sheet [1882] which we have here just going to copy [1884] the ID of this Google sheet by taking [1885] the top of it I'm going to go to sheets [1889] we'll go add a [1891] row I just need to make sure I'm in the [1893] right account and then I'm just going to [1895] enter this manually but you know if you [1896] were to do this um you could also just [1898] look through Google Sheets the sheet [1900] name is going to be sheet one it's going [1902] to go a to zed and then what I'm doing [1904] is the date added has to be now right [1907] the parent comment if you think about it [1909] is going to be let's see here what would [1912] the parent comment be this [1915] one um content idea you know I guess [1919] there' be three no no the content idea [1921] would be added on every individual row [1923] it would [1924] be this one here I think it' be four. [1926] value I believe it's called I don't know [1928] though because I haven't actually run [1929] the iterator yet um hook would be easy [1933] enough be hook and then outline this and [1937] then rating I would leave blank awesome [1939] this actually now looks pretty [1941] sufficient why don't we run this on a [1942] tiny test set of 20 comments no let's do [1945] 10 comments well if you think about it's [1946] gonna be 30 rows yeah let's do 10 [1950] comments let's run this puppy let's see [1952] if there's anything broken [1959] here um I don't like the formatting [1961] issues so let me just fix these nice [1965] then I also don't like how big this is [1966] so I'm just going to minimize [1969] this going [1972] to make the content idea much longer so [1975] that I could see it [1980] and then what we should probably do if I [1982] don't want it to keep on like screwing [1984] up the formatting I should probably do [1987] this there we [1990] go cool and now I have a big wonderful [1994] beautiful list of content ideas and [1997] outlines and [2000] ratings so I'm just going to let this [2003] keep on running till it [2005] stops so you can see we're through eight [2008] right now we filtered out two of them [2010] that were [2017] irrelevant and you know these content [2019] ideas aren't all perfect I see why tech [2022] companies need Leaders with both [2024] business and Technical expertise this is [2025] obviously not the right tone of voice [2027] for my channel I don't really write like [2029] this but as I'm sure you guys can [2031] imagine you know I'm going to touch up [2033] the title Generations that the titles [2034] are much more similar to the titles that [2036] I come up with and in this way you can [2039] very easily come up [2041] with like a scalable flow that enables [2044] you to just pump in any channel you want [2046] add in your own case studies and your [2048] own value and then come up with uh [2051] basically an infinite amount of content [2053] for whatever specific platform you want [2054] to do so in my case I'm doing YouTube [2056] Right which is why I'm structuring in [2058] this way but maybe what you do is you [2059] actually first generate the outline and [2061] then maybe you want a blog post now [2062] you're what you're going to do is you're [2063] going to take this and you got another [2064] column called blog post and then it's [2066] just going to go through every heading [2067] and actually write the whole thing for [2069] you any uh what I'm going to do is I'm [2071] going to let's just minimize the parent [2074] comment because in hindsight that column [2075] isn't super important to me let's [2077] minimize the hook well actually let's [2078] make it a little bit longer we'll [2079] minimize the outline that's what I [2081] really need and then I'm going to I'm [2082] just going to rate this now out of 10 so [2085] review of AI voiceover tools for video [2087] creators in August 2024 I surpass [2088] $100,000 Mark in a single month by [2090] mastering essential business skills look [2092] at at 2025 the skills are becoming even [2093] more critical let's dive into these top [2095] seven basic business skills we need to [2097] stay competitive [2098] I think that's a [2101] seven oh look it even did some math on [2103] me that's really nice I haven't ever [2105] framed my experience as 160k a month [2108] combin thank you gb4 uh you know maybe [2111] this one's a [2115] six maybe this one's a five oh I like [2118] this [2120] one yeah I could see that one being a [2123] really good video honestly [2128] I don't really like this [2131] one seems all [2135] right maybe this one's here maybe this [2137] is that this is that whatever and then [2139] what you do is you set a [2141] filter so you say you know I don't want [2144] anything that's less than a [2146] five and then oops I think I said I want [2149] everything that's less than a five I [2151] don't want anything that is less than [2154] A5 and then voila all of the videos I [2157] have are now things that I've personally [2158] rated at over five I can actually go [2160] through and then add them to rather this [2162] might as well just be my content [2163] calendar but I can add this to my [2165] content calendar and actually like start [2166] the start the Practical production [2168] process of it so what I'm going to do [2169] here is I'm going to save this blueprint [2172] the one thing that I'm going to do um [2173] that's different is I'm actually going [2174] to add one additional step I'm going to [2176] add a set variables module here for you [2179] guys the idea being that you will put [2181] your social [2184] proof and uh one more thing here [2190] we'll do social proof [2196] here we'll say social proof [2199] Direction then down here we'll say tone [2202] of voice [2204] Direction and what you're going to do as [2206] well is you're just going to put in [2207] whatever the tone of voice that you want [2210] is so I'm G to go down [2213] here and then I'm actually just going to [2215] replace this with tone of voice [2216] Direction [2220] uh and social proof Direction so social [2222] proof direction will go over here and [2223] then tone of voice direction will go [2224] down over here and then you're free to [2227] come up with more training examples if [2228] you want in this [2229] blueprint no problem at all but now if [2232] you think about it all I have to do is I [2235] have to go to this [2237] spreadsheet which contains a giant list [2240] of all of my YouTube videos so every [2242] link that I've ever come up with [2244] basically then I just go back over here [2247] to to YouTube comment scraper go to bulk [2250] edit I paste all these puppies in I set [2253] the total number of scraper scraped [2254] comments that I want at like 100,000 I [2258] think that's 100,000 and then I click [2260] save and start and then if I do this [2262] which I'm not going to do right now but [2263] if I do this this is going to go through [2265] every single comment that's ever been [2266] left on any one of my YouTube videos [2267] it's going to pass this through that [2269] filter and it's going to use it to come [2270] up with ideas you can imagine how um [2272] there are other things that you could do [2273] with this as well you could batch you [2275] know five rows at a time and feed this [2279] into another AI flow that automatically [2282] picks the best piece of content or the [2284] best title that was generated based off [2286] of a bunch of other examples that you [2288] give it and then this way maybe you just [2290] um automate all of the parts of the [2292] content except the highest Roi parts for [2294] you which is where you actually sit down [2296] and you know touch up the hook or touch [2298] up the outline or touch up the script or [2300] in my case maybe just sit down and [2301] actually record a video on it all right [2302] I hope you guys appreciated that video [2303] had a lot of fun putting it together as [2305] you guys can see it's actually pretty [2306] simple to put together systems on this [2307] as long as you know a little bit of [2308] prompt engineering a little bit of [2309] make.com little bit of no code tools if [2311] you guys want to learn more about that [2313] sort of thing and if you want to learn [2314] how to actually package all that [2315] together in a business and sell it to [2316] people check out my uh no code low code [2319] how to start your automation business [2320] Community called maker school where I [2322] guide you through basically a day-by-day [2324] 30- step plan that turns you from Zero [2326] to Hero and allows you to bootstrap an [2328] automation company from scratch [2329] otherwise if you guys could do me a big [2330] solid leave a comment down below with a [2332] future video idea that you want so I'll [2335] have something to feed into this system [2336] for tomorrow um like subscribe do all [2339] that fun stuff and I'll catch you on the [2340] next video thanks

Title: 3 ChatGPT Prompt Engineering Hacks You NEED to Start Using
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here so [2] I've been using chat GPT and really the [3] whole GPT Suite of models since 2019 uh [7] way back with gpt2 and I've used them in [9] every single business since so as I'm [10] sure you can imagine I've you know [12] compiled a big list of tips and and [15] techniques that enable me to get the [16] most out of my prompts what I want to do [18] in today's video is talk about what [20] those are so I'm going to be sharing [21] three chat GPT prompt engineering hacks [23] that going to help take your prompts to [24] the next level they're also going to [25] help you get away from just simply [27] copying and pasting prompts and outputs [29] to from the chat GPT window which I [31] think a lot of businesses are [32] unfortunately limited to today um I'm [34] going to help you position Chad GPT more [37] as a component of your business [38] something that can work autonomously in [40] the background while you're not around [41] so if that sounds like something you [42] guys want to improve learn how to do and [44] Implement in your own companies stay [45] tuned and let's get into [46] [Music] [48] it so I got a number of hacks for you [51] we're going to start with the chat BT [52] window in and of itself and I'm going to [53] show you how to use chat GPT outside of [56] this little box as well using a no code [58] tool called make.com but without further [60] Ado or Fanfare let's get into the very [62] first prompt engineering hack which is [64] to transition to using structured data [67] over unstructured data this is by far [70] the biggest hack what I'm going to do is [72] I'm going to show you guys how to use [73] four types of structured data [74] specifically the first being markdown [76] the second being CSV the third being uh [79] XML and the fourth being Json and [82] understanding each of these will also [83] enable you to stack them on top of each [85] other so that you know instead of you [87] just prompting once and then getting one [89] output you can prompt once and then get [91] 20 30 or even 50 outputs that'll enable [94] you to basically multiply your leverage [95] with chaty BT so let's get into the [97] first one let's get into markdown so [98] what I have open here is I have the chat [100] GPT window many of you are very familiar [102] with this by now we're specifically [104] using the chat GPT 40 series of models [106] and hypothetically I uh my name is Peter [110] and I run a peanut store and I want to [113] come up with blog posts about peanuts [115] right so maybe what I would say my the [118] the unenlightened Peter I should say [121] would write something like write me a [122] story about peanuts and as I'm sure you [125] can imagine Chad gbt does a pretty good [127] job it writes a story about [129] peanuts wow lovely oh Elias thank you [133] very much okay great so we got a cool [134] story about peanuts um maybe what we [136] want to do is we want to I don't know [138] take this and then use it to update a [140] Google doc with the whole story so this [142] is my story and we got to write uh we [145] got to write the title obviously so [147] peanut peanuts in [150] Groundswell a [154] story the [156] change maybe a single golden peanut [160] plant uh maybe want to add some [163] image I'm just adding a bunch of [165] additional formatting and context [167] because uh I don't know I'm just trying [168] to like take this blog post the next [171] level in conclusion right okay cool so [174] we've now done a tiny bit of work to [176] turn the output of chat GPT into [178] something that maybe we can actually put [179] on our blog right right um so what we do [181] now is maybe we're on WordPress or maybe [182] we're on webflow or something we just [184] copy this puppy and then paste it in [186] this is how the vast majority of [187] business owners are currently using chat [189] gbt and while it's still faster than [190] what we were doing before you're missing [192] a great opportunity to multiply your [194] leverage using structured data so what [197] we're going to talk about first is [198] markdown formatting and what I'm going [199] to do is I'll show you rather than tell [201] you if instead of just saying write me a [202] story about peanuts like [204] this I say write me a story about [206] peanuts except use markdown ATX format [210] very formatting and make it interesting [212] let's just do that what you'll see is [214] before what we got when we prompted was [216] we got text that's one level of data now [220] what we get when we prompt is we get [221] text but we also get hierarchy we get [224] headings we get subheadings we get [227] quotes we get chapter headings we get [229] sub subheadings we get bullet points [232] lists we get basically everything now if [234] I copy this and I paste this in so you [237] can see oops sorry I copied the code I [239] should actually copy the whole story up [241] here I'm just going to go all the way [243] down here now we actually get like a [245] fully formatted story that's basically [246] good to go from the get-go so why did I [250] show you this example first because the [252] vast majority of people are only [254] prompting chat gbt and then getting one [256] thing they're only getting the data that [257] they asked for but chat gbt inherently [260] understands formatting it understands [261] structure what you can do is you can [262] actually save yourself a ton of time by [264] getting into output structured data that [265] includes the formatting instead so next [268] time instead of you just you know [269] getting a story and copying and pasting [271] it into a window have it actually [272] generate something in a format that [275] enables you um to go one step deeper and [277] actually you know like generate headings [279] generate subheadings generate quotes and [281] that sort of thing if you guys want to [282] learn more about U markdown formatting [285] there's this great cheat sheet from the [287] markdown guide guys and basically what [289] markdown formatting is is instead of [291] just outputting like the text that we [293] were doing it's actually putting text [295] plus a layer of hierarchy on top of it [298] so for instance if I go back to my [299] document this is the title right let's [301] go down here let's say I wanted to add a [303] new heading well what I'd do is I'd [305] write dollar sign space and then would [307] turn into a heading dollar sign dollar [310] sign space is a heading two dollar sign [312] dollar sign dollar sign space heading [313] three if I wanted to um quote something [317] or maybe bold something I just wrap it [320] in these little asterisks right I think [322] if I were to underline before and after [324] it'll italicize so I'm not going to [326] teach you guys everything about markdown [327] formatting all I'm going to show you [329] guys or all mean to do here is just give [330] you guys a gateway drug into the value [332] of adding additional structure to your [334] text and not just making it like you [336] know text in text out sort of deal but [338] actually having it generate something a [339] little more interesting um cool so [341] that's marked down formatting let's talk [343] a little bit about the next rung up on [344] the ladder which is CSV let's pretend [346] that I have a simple tasks let's make a [349] new Google sheet and I want to I don't [351] know generate like a list of video game [355] characters you know what most people [357] will do is they'll use a level one [358] prompt like this generate me a list of [360] video game [362] characters with uh names um skills um [368] let's [369] say physical descriptions [373] Etc what it'll do is it'll out put me [375] this list Rook Ashburn cybernetic [378] mercenary Lara Thornville all right and [380] what I want to do is you know I [382] basically have to copy and paste this in [385] right Rook Ashburn he's I don't know a [389] role he's a cybernetic mercenary his [392] skill is he's dual wielding pistols and [396] all this stuff and you know I go through [398] this whole process and it takes me [399] freaking hour just to like make this [400] spreadsheet well what's really cool is [402] if you use structured data in the form [403] of a CSV or a comma separated value file [405] you can save yourself a ton of time if [408] instead of this I'm just going to get [410] the same prompt to open up a new window [411] just because I don't want that previous [412] prompt to be um influencing this I'll [415] say generate me a list of video game [417] characters in CSV format I'm pasting [420] this [421] into into a Google sheet use columns [426] like name [428] skill physical descriptions Etc couple [431] more I'm just going to have it go ahead [434] and generate me something all right and [436] what we see here is we actually it looks [438] like it's generating actually like real [439] characters like Lara Croft and geralt of [441] Rivia and so on and so forth so um [443] you'll notice that it's doing so in a [445] very specific format this format is [447] dissimilar from what we had before where [449] we had like that nice structure to it [450] right what we have now is we have um [452] this little uh three-letter acronym up [455] top CSV and what we're getting is we're [456] getting a a list that's basically more [459] or less written in a very particular [461] format that Google Sheets and other [463] spreadsheet tools just understand [464] intuitively so if I take this now and I [466] just copied it all and if I just paste [468] this in okay you'll see that it's all [470] just sort of on one column but if you go [472] to data and then you go split text to [474] columns voila you've just made yourself [476] a spreadsheet and you've done it in like [477] 2 seconds so I'm sure you can imagine [479] you know for business purposes this [481] might be great um for storytelling [482] purposes this might be great for [483] teaching purposes this might be great [485] you can actually go one step further [486] than this if instead of this we generate [490] another prompt and we say generate me a [492] list of video game character CSV format [494] let's do just do 10 for [498] now and then we say output the data as a [502] CSV file I can [504] upload then we press enter what chbt [508] will do now is it actually go in and [510] then it will basically write a bunch a [512] big code [514] Library first it's going to write down [516] the characters of course Dooms Slayer [518] being the goat and then it's going to [521] give us a file that we can download let [523] me just close this and the cool part is [526] now we have a file that we can download [527] well now we can you know pretend that [529] this is just totally new we just go file [530] import upload and drag and drop this the [534] variety of settings here I'm just going [535] to use a pen to current sheet and then [537] voila we have the same data basically [539] basically that we had previously we just [540] have it nice and and structured and uh [543] you know in a file format so I show you [545] these two simple ways to add structured [548] data to your workflow because I just [549] want you guys to like you know if you're [551] unfamiliar with a lot of the technical [552] tools out there if you don't know how to [553] use this practically in your business [555] these are basically like the gateway [556] drugs to better and higher levels of [558] structured data what I'm going to do now [560] is I'm going to show you guys sort of [561] the backend I'll show you guys how to [563] use this stuff in actual business [564] applications using a simple no code tool [567] called make.com so make.com is I'm sure [569] you guys know if you watch my Channel [571] with any regularity is probably one of [573] the most powerful and simplest and easy [575] tools to get up and running with this [576] stuff as humanly possible you just drag [578] and drop a bunch of modules and there's [579] built-in support for um these artificial [581] intelligence workflows so if I go to [584] open Ai and then go create a completion [586] or create a prompt what I can do is [588] instead of having to interact with chat [589] GPT through you know this window here um [593] and having to you know go on their [594] website and sort of deal with the [595] limitations of uh formatting I can [597] actually create the exact same prompt [599] but I can do it inside of this module [602] window so for instance if I go back to [605] my previous prompt about peanuts [607] okay I say write me a story about [610] peanuts I'm just copying and pasting [611] this prompt then I add a user prompt [613] with the message content write me a [614] story about [615] peanuts then if I run this what's [617] happening is I'm now bypassing the chat [619] GPT website and I'm outputting or I'm [621] creating um you know I'm having to [624] generate text uh directly and so I just [627] asked to generate me a story about [628] peanuts and now we we have this data [631] basically accessible to us [633] using um you know this no code tool [637] which I can then let's say I wanted to [638] do that other example create a Google [639] doc right I just create a Google doc [641] create a [642] document I say this or peanut story [646] let's say and then I just paste this [649] in and sorry I'm just so fast sometimes [653] it bugs out okay so now we're creating a [656] story and we're actually just having it [657] create the Google Doc for me [658] automatically supposed to be having to [660] do that copy and pasting bollocks that I [661] was doing before so the Google Doc will [665] have a little link next to it this link [668] will look like this and what we've done [670] now is we basically just created a [671] simple flow that enables us to [672] automatically procedurally generate [674] Google Docs using some prompt um as you [676] could imagine this can be [677] extraordinarily valuable uh you don't [679] just have to stop at Google Docs maybe [681] you wanted to hook this up to your [682] WordPress you could do that very easily [684] maybe you wanted to do the same thing [685] for I don't know webflow um Wix right [689] maybe Squarespace whatever wherever the [691] hell your website is hosted there's a [692] way for you to automatically add content [694] to that now the real value in this comes [697] when you stack multiple layers of [698] structured data together so what I want [700] to talk about next I want to talk about [701] a simple way to generate structured data [704] using XML XML stands for extensible [708] markup format extens sorry extensible [711] markup language um the value in XML is [714] instead of you just outputting one thing [716] so instead of you just asking it to [718] write a story and then having it output [719] a story you can have you can ask it to [721] Output a story but then you can also [723] have it to Output a bunch of additional [725] data alongside that story so not just [726] the story of you can have it output a [728] specific variable called title another [730] variable called excert maybe another one [731] called summary maybe another one called [733] keywords another one called I don't know [735] let's say you're a teacher maybe every [736] story you generate you want to have a [737] list of questions to ask little kids at [739] your class hey uh what was the theme [741] what's the moral of the story what are [743] some things that the main character [744] could have done differently basically [746] you can convert what we had previously [748] into an extraordinarily simple um data [752] structure that allows you to just use it [753] in actual business applications so [755] you've never used XML before this is a [757] very quick and easy example but [758] essentially you this is like a catalog [761] in the month of spring we have a title [763] called Garden sales and we have a line [765] in our catalog called outdoor tools then [767] we have a new page with the caption [768] goodbye winter with two items one's [770] gardening gloves the other's potting [771] soil this is XML format and it may look [774] a little bit scary to you if you've [775] never used it before this's another [777] example for like a hospital right name [780] first John last fiser visit number two [782] date whatever problems headache uh if [784] you've never used anything like this [785] might be a little bit intimidating for [786] you but I'm going to walk you through [787] what this process looks like and then [788] I'll show you how to stack this with the [789] markdown approach that we were using [791] previously so okay we're currently [794] outputting just text right why don't we [796] open up this prompt here instead say [799] write me a story about [800] peanuts output in XML [804] format use the following structure what [807] we want is we wanted to Output a story [810] inside of the story we want a title then [813] we want the text actually we want the [815] excert let's do that it'll be easier [817] then we want the keywords maybe we want [819] to generate a bunch of keywords then we [821] want um the [824] text then we want questions for kids [830] even then what else do we want we want [833] uh current date [837] maybe uh I'm just trying to think of [839] anything else that might be interesting [840] title exert keywords text questions for [843] kids current date maybe like author bio [846] or [848] something [850] cool make something up for author [855] bio we'll go back here and we'll go here [858] awesome so now I'm going to have it [860] generate [861] this and output our XML and let me just [864] show you how much more data we are [866] capable of getting than just the text [869] okay so if we just think about this [871] logically previously what we did when we [872] said write me a story about peanuts is [874] we gave it one prompt to give us one [876] answer right it wrote me the story about [877] peanuts but now we're saying write me a [879] story about peanuts and it's generating [880] us tons of different data types it's [882] generating us a title then it generates [884] us an excer IT generates us a list of [886] keywords generates us the whole story [888] then it generates us questions then it [890] generates us the date it generates us an [892] author bio that's fictional um as you [894] can imagine if you want to use this in [895] any sort of business or Enterprise or [897] industrial application when when you [899] have chat gbt generate you this data in [901] the structured way um you can now do [903] things with all of this different data I [905] mean if you think about it previously [907] you know you might have had a staff [908] member in your business or maybe you're [910] doing this yourself who would be tasked [911] with generating content using chat gbt [913] and then having to manually pasted in [915] every freaking time to like a WordPress [917] thing well now what you can do is you [918] can generate all of the fields for this [920] and then automatically connect to [921] Wordpress to to upload it for you um so [923] this can save you a ton of time you can [925] basically automate most of I want to say [927] like a a simple content business or a [929] marketing business just using flows like [931] this so let me show you how to actually [933] turn this into something useful in [934] make.com it's pretty simple um you know [937] now that we outputed this XML there are [940] a couple things we need to do the first [941] thing we need to do is we just need to [942] get rid of this um whatever these three [944] little tags are well actually no not [946] necessarily let me just go over here to [948] um XML what we need to do is we just [951] need to parse the [952] XML I'm going to not do any data [955] structural just feed this in what [957] parsing refers to is parsing just turns [959] it from a format that um you know [962] includes those little tags into one that [964] we can understand and interact with more [965] readily using computers so sorry we [968] received an error there probably because [969] we outputed these three little back [971] ticks yeah we outputed these three [973] little back ticks if you [975] say write it in XML if you um ask chat [980] gbd to generate you something that's [981] structured data in the top LEF hand [983] corner you see there's these three [984] little letters here this acronym that [985] says XML this is just chat gbt's own [989] language basically that they use to show [991] you what language the code is in so [993] that's what these three little back [994] ticks are for uh if you're trying to use [997] um XML or Json like I'm going to be [999] talking about in any other application [1000] you have to get it not to Output that so [1003] don't output any back back back um [1007] XML your first [1010] character should be this all right we're [1014] going to run this again now and uh it's [1016] not going to generate us those back [1017] ticks we're then going to feeded into [1019] this XML [1021] module and if I click on this XML module [1024] you'll see that now we have the data [1025] structured in a way that matters title [1027] excerpt keywords questions for [1031] kids current date author bio right even [1034] have information about this author which [1036] is pretty crazy so you can do a number [1037] of things with this you could send this [1039] data off to Wordpress you could create a [1041] Google doc with it again and that sort [1042] of thing what I want to do now is I just [1043] want to show you how to stack this with [1044] the approach that we had earlier [1046] remember how earlier we were generating [1048] um markdown well the text is no longer [1050] marked [1051] down so we're going to tell it um text [1054] should be in markdown ATX [1058] format now it's going to generate it in [1061] markdown in order to make markdown work [1063] what we need to do is we need to [1064] transform it into HTML so let me just [1067] grab this text transform it into HTML [1070] then I'm going to create a Google doc [1072] that's going to have this HTML and in [1075] terms of the title we're just going to [1076] call it the actual title [1080] and now let me run our whole flow which [1082] is basically if you think about it like [1083] a Content generator tool um that takes [1086] us input chat [1088] GPT creates five or six different data [1092] types parses the markdown into a [1094] language that is just compatible with [1095] Google Docs and this is sort of one of [1097] those like if you know you know things [1099] and then creates the document in Google [1100] Docs so if you think back to our very [1102] first [1103] example you know we had to manually copy [1105] and paste this peanut story in but if [1107] you think about what we're doing now is [1108] we're is generating all of this stuff [1110] automatically and it's automatically [1112] inside of the Google Doc it's [1113] automatically formatted the way you want [1114] to and that sort of thing the title is [1117] customized right we we can automatically [1118] pull that title without having to do any [1120] sort of shenanigans um there's just a [1122] lot more leverage this way we're just [1123] making one prompt and that prompt is now [1125] doing 10 things for us as opposed to [1126] just one thing okay so in a similar vein [1129] to XML we also have another cool uh data [1132] type which is called Json Json is very [1135] similar to XML it's just instead of what [1137] we had earlier let me just show you an [1139] example [1142] here instead of [1146] this so you see here what we do is we [1150] use um a format that relies off curly [1154] braces so you see how this title says [1157] title The Adventures of Pur the peanut [1159] close title what we do now is we can [1161] actually save a few tokens and just go [1165] like that right that's equivalent if you [1167] wanted to put the excert in there as [1168] well you go go excert then you'd go join [1170] Percy the peanut on his journey through [1173] the farm wonderful you wanted um [1176] keywords right there's other formats for [1178] this probably be an array and then [1180] inside of the array you'd have peanut [1182] Adventure the farm friendship and you [1186] know you can go so on and so forth you [1188] can continue proceeding in that in that [1190] way before uh until you write the whole [1191] article now I'm not going to do all this [1193] manually I'm just going to get AI to do [1194] it because I mean I'm working with AI I [1196] want AI to do something for me might as [1197] well have ai for my crap as well so I'm [1201] just going to take this whole story as [1203] we know it I'm going to go back to chat [1204] gbt and I'm going to say convert this [1207] from XML to Json I'm going to paste this [1210] in this is now going to take the text [1212] and then just turn it into that [1213] beautiful Json format that I showed you [1215] earlier you'll notice that it's still [1216] using markdown in order to create the [1218] text content and it's added a couple of [1220] additional levels to us that um to the [1222] text which typically just works a little [1224] better with Jason um but now our data is [1227] extraordinarily structured it's not in [1228] that XML format and it's definitely not [1230] in that text format if I wanted to [1232] modify the actual Source prompt I would [1234] say write me a story about peanuts I put [1235] in Json use the following structure um [1239] I'm going go back here and say put me a [1241] schema for [1246] this sorry [1249] simpler it should say um I don't know [1252] like [1252] title [1255] string schema probably not the right [1257] term I'm just looking for [1259] a simple value like this okay great so [1263] then I'm going to paste this [1264] in we're going to say text should be in [1268] markdown format make something for aob [1270] don't output any Json your first [1271] character should be a curly brace [1274] awesome we're now just going to Output [1276] this chat GPT module one more [1279] time and as you see the text is now [1282] going to be nice and structured in Json [1285] as opposed to XML this is actually going [1287] to save us some tokens that's one of the [1289] valuable reasons why people like using [1290] Json as opposed to XML um different [1293] models tend to work better with [1294] different things so like Claude for [1296] instance tends to work better with XML [1297] just because that's how it was trained [1299] um chat gbt tends to work better with [1300] Jason interesting how that works right [1302] now huh anyway what I'm going to do is [1304] I'm actually going to parse this Json [1305] same idea basically all of these no code [1308] tools have a a way that you can parse [1310] the data with and then I'm just going to [1312] convert this same thing uh we'll call [1315] this text into markdown and then I'm [1317] going to use [1319] um the markdown to [1322] create a Google doc same as [1325] before in this way we've now completely [1328] transformed the way that we were [1329] interacting with AI and we've turned it [1331] from I don't think this worked because I [1333] probably didn't feed in the right [1334] variable name right yeah sorry I got to [1336] use story. text. content so let's [1340] actually go back here and then go [1342] story. [1344] text. content um anyway what what I was [1348] saying was uh now you're interacting [1350] with AI in in probably like a 5 to 10 [1353] times as leveraged way and then you know [1354] if you start combining with no code [1356] tools like mate.com and so on and so [1357] forth become substantially more powerful [1359] I think the reason why this wasn't [1360] popping up is because I don't have a [1362] variable called name yeah I don't so I [1364] needed to go to Title Here which is [1366] underneath story going to run that a [1369] third time as I'm sure you can imagine [1371] there's a little bit of debugging that [1372] you need to do when you build a [1373] dedicated solution like this but third [1374] times the charm guaranteed there you go [1377] mucking around thank you Google Docs uh [1380] and now our output is another lovely [1382] story with a bunch of structured data [1384] including the title and the excerpt and [1385] the keywords and that sort of thing the [1387] second prompt engineering hack I have [1389] for you is to use user assistant [1391] response pairs now if you guys are [1393] unfamiliar with what I mean by user [1394] assistant response pairs we just need to [1396] go back one more step and we need to [1398] learn about uh some basically like [1400] academic terminology for how AI models [1402] output text there are basically three [1404] types of prompts available today there [1407] are zero shot prompts [1409] one shot prompts and then like many shot [1411] or few shot prompts now a zero shot [1414] prompt is just when you have the AI [1416] model do something for you without [1418] giving it any examples of what you want [1419] it to do this is the vast majority of [1422] prompts that I currently see I run a [1424] community called maker school and [1426] another one called makemoney withm [1427] make.com where I help people do prompt [1429] engineering stuff like this for business [1431] applications for clients for their own [1432] companies that sort of thing and the [1434] number one issue I see with AI models [1437] with the AI models that people are using [1438] are that when they prompt them they just [1440] say hey do this thing for me the issue [1442] is when you just ask the AI to do [1444] something for you without giving it any [1446] examples it just has to come up with [1448] with everything on its own it doesn't [1450] understand the guard rails for the [1451] prompt that you're asking for it doesn't [1453] understand what is an appropriate output [1454] and so on and so forth so I have a graph [1456] right over here and as you guys can see [1458] there are various lines on this graph [1461] the blue line here is for zero shot the [1464] orange line is for one shot and then the [1467] green line is for 32 shot AKA they [1469] provided 32 examples and then assessed [1472] accuracy um accuracy is that vertical [1475] axis and then parameters is the [1477] horizontal axis you don't really need to [1478] worry about that this just shows as [1480] models tend to get more intelligent um [1482] there becomes more of a difference [1483] between the examples you provideing the [1484] results that you get any who so what [1486] we're seeing if we average out these two [1488] blue lines is you know if you provide [1489] zero shot um these two models opt and [1492] GPD they tended to work around 70% of [1494] the time if you on the other hand [1496] provided one example these two models [1498] started working like 73 74% of the time [1501] then you've read 32 examples they [1503] started working maybe 77 78% of the time [1506] so the really interesting part about [1508] this is the distance between zero and [1510] one shot is approximately equivalent to [1512] the distance between one shot and 32 [1514] shot and that should tell you something [1516] basically the highest Roi or the biggest [1518] bang for your buck is just providing a [1520] single example if you provide a single [1523] example you will improve the quality of [1524] your output prompt uh from your prompt [1527] by as much as if you provide an [1528] additional 31 examples somewhere in that [1530] neighborhood anyway obviously this is [1532] going to depend on exactly what it is [1533] that you are doing what you're asking [1535] the model to do and you have to take [1537] into account token considerations as [1538] well you don't want to spend a million [1539] billion dollars by having 32 prompts 32 [1542] additional examples in every prompt but [1545] this just goes to show how much value [1546] there is in making your prompt or [1548] turning all of your prompts from zero [1549] shot into at least one shot so that's my [1551] rule of thumb always include at least [1553] one example of what you want the model [1554] to do before you actually train it or [1556] have it run on your real data so if [1558] you've never done any sort of like few [1560] shot prompting before let me give you a [1561] quick example I'm going to pretend that [1563] we have a task um sanitize the following [1567] name the task is you know I send a lot [1571] of cold emails right as part of my [1573] business model and I get a lot of the [1575] data from my c emails from LinkedIn the [1577] unfortunate thing about LinkedIn is the [1578] vast majority of people on that platform [1579] for whatever freaking reason tend to put [1581] emojis in their names so they'll say [1583] Nick sarth microbiologist PhD whatever [1586] and then they'll have like a little [1587] bunch of emojis about microscopes and [1589] stuff um so let let me actually just [1591] show you an example of [1592] this we'll put a microscope [1595] here we'll say [1598] PhD we'll do something like that so you [1600] know a lot of names look like [1602] this let's say what I want is I wanted [1604] to Output my name in Json or if I just [1607] say sanitize the following [1609] name you know it's going to return as [1610] Nick S I don't want it as Nick s but [1613] hypothetically let's say sanitize the [1615] following [1616] name and then what I [1619] do sorry is I go Nix [1622] PhD maybe input [1625] output first name Nick last name sarf [1631] and I give it an example of what I [1634] wanted to do and then I say Peter [1636] withing [1638] CEO maybe I [1641] add you can learn a lot about somebody [1643] just based off their Quick Pick Emoji [1645] tool [1646] huh anyway [1648] so this is the the the next input now [1651] I'm going to send it and we're going to [1652] see what the output is and voila right I [1655] don't like the fact that it said here's [1656] the sanitized output so maybe what I'm [1657] going to do now is I'll say this and [1661] maybe we have another example maybe it's [1665] Sarah [1667] Connor right now maybe we just go [1671] output and now it's just going to [1673] generate me to Json if we take this and [1676] put this in like a business application [1677] you know I'm sure you guys can see the [1679] more examples we provide the closer and [1680] closer and closer it gets to what we [1681] want um you can then start adding the [1684] examples that It produced into the input [1686] of the next example um but you know as [1688] as we proceed in this way I'm sure you [1689] guys can tell um AI tends to get smarter [1692] and more accurate and better just like [1694] that F shot prompt graph showed earlier [1696] where basically the more examples you [1698] provide the higher up it gets in terms [1700] of accuracy as I'm sure you guys can [1702] imagine right I'm just prompting this [1703] manually through chat gbt if I were to [1705] use a procedural tool like I had here it [1707] gets a lot easier and this is where I [1709] start getting into user assistant [1711] response pairs so sanitize the following [1715] name as you see in chat BT's API the way [1719] that you do this is you tell the model [1721] whether or not this is a user prompt or [1722] an assistant prompt so this is a user [1725] prompt this is me it's me saying [1726] sanitize the following name what you can [1728] do though is in the API you can simulate [1731] the responses from the assistant to have [1733] it act as if you produced some sort of [1737] output so I'm going to provide actually [1740] I'm going to do this in two steps we'll [1741] go user that's where you tell the model [1743] what you want it to do then you go user [1745] and then you provide it the actual input [1747] and then everything after that is just a [1748] user assistant response pair okay so [1751] look at how streamlined and clean this [1753] is [1762] now now if I go down and add one more [1765] user prompt and then I add this Sarah [1767] Connor thing [1770] it will be perfect basically every [1773] time first name last name Connor right [1776] uh as I'm sure you can imagine you could [1777] add some data source at the beginning of [1779] this flow have it just feed a bunch of [1780] names and then have ai automatically add [1782] those names to a spreadsheet or [1783] something really the um the sky is [1785] Limitless here with structured data and [1788] user assistant response Pairs and chat [1789] gbd all right the last but most [1791] important prompt engineering hack is to [1793] test and iterate your prompts the vast [1796] majority of the time when people come up [1797] with a prompt for chat PT the way that [1799] they do it is they'll prompt and then [1801] it'll output something and they'll be [1802] like I don't really like this and then [1804] it'll change it a little bit and they'll [1805] be like I want it more like this and [1806] then it'll change it again and so on and [1808] so on and so forth until you have what [1809] you want the issue is that's not really [1811] reproducible from a business perspective [1813] right you can't actually take that and [1815] then use that out to to to build out a [1816] system or use that to you know create [1818] one of those autonomous sort of worker [1820] bees um um in your company if you were [1822] to copy and paste that whole prompt into [1824] something like make.com or uh some other [1826] no code tool the number to you would use [1828] would be crazy and it's also just not a [1830] very reliable way to get the result you [1832] want what I'm going to do here is I'm [1833] going to show you a much more reliable [1835] way that allow you to test your data [1837] constantly so that basically what we're [1839] going to do is you're going to design a [1840] test set and then you're going to score [1843] every prompt on the basis of how many [1846] positive results you got from the test [1848] set so maybe the first runaround you get [1850] 65% the second run you get 70% the third [1853] run after you change your prompt again [1855] you get 80% the fourth run after you [1857] change your prompt again you get 90% [1859] right eventually you reach a point where [1860] you're satisfied and then you can stop [1862] but what I'm going to do here is you [1864] know pretend that we have a simple task [1866] the task is we're going to feed in as [1867] input an icebreaker sorry we're going to [1871] feed as in as input a LinkedIn [1874] bio okay I'll say give me example five [1879] example LinkedIn bios in the form [1882] LinkedIn bio bio goes here and what I [1885] want to do is I just want to um create a [1888] customized DM that I could send to [1891] people and then use that DM um basically [1894] like I can I can Source the [1896] customization of the DM from the [1897] LinkedIn bio what I mean by that is if [1899] the LinkedIn bio says I'm passionate [1900] about Innovation and Leadership and [1901] creating high value in um in high stakes [1904] environments or something along that [1905] those lines I want our customization to [1907] say something like hey Peter I know [1909] you're really passionate about [1910] Innovation that's really important to me [1911] too I care a lot about providing high [1913] value to things thought I'd just send [1914] you a quick message the idea is we just [1916] want to Source information from some [1917] public available data source have ai [1919] rewrite that for us in some way that [1926] matters what I'm going to do is I'm just [1928] going to get the data [1930] myself and what I want to do is just use [1932] that data as part of my training set so [1935] I'm going to go over [1937] here and the specifics of how I'm [1939] building this out aren't super [1945] important so you don't need to know how [1947] to parse the Jason or whatever just know [1949] that I'm finding a list or I'm getting [1952] I'm creating basically a list of these [1954] LinkedIn bios right now and then what [1956] I'm going to do is I'm going to iterate [1957] through this list of LinkedIn [1959] bios um the value here being that after [1962] I iterate through them I'm going to feed [1963] them into Ai and I'm going to have ai [1965] you know create me an icebreaker so uh [1968] I'm going to say use the provided [1970] LinkedIn biography to write a [1974] customized oneline introduction [1979] in Json format I'm going to say generate [1983] me two [1986] more these are just going to be my [1989] examples so um I'm then going to use my [1992] training [1993] data which will look like [1995] this and then I [1999] want follow the format loved X reminds [2004] me of Y thought I'd reach [2006] out this tends be a good format to use [2008] for this sort of thing so what we want [2010] is we wanted to Output um an icebreaker [2012] I wanted to [2014] say [2016] loved hearing [2019] about your AI experience reminds me of [2023] my own company I work at my own company [2028] left [2029] click thought I'd reach out awesome this [2033] is now like a customized LinkedIn uh DM [2036] basically [2037] we're going to do the same thing for [2039] this exact same idea just going to go [2043] over [2044] here and I'll say [2048] loved [2050] learning about your work with [2056] analytics reminds [2060] me of the [2063] dashboard I set up for a project last [2066] month thought I'd read out [2069] awesome okay and now the last thing [2072] we're going to do is we are just going [2073] to feed in the Linked In bio of an [2077] actual example and we're going to have [2080] it output um you know the [2083] examples procedurally what I'm going to [2086] do now is I'm going to show you guys a [2087] quick way to take this data and then use [2090] it to score progress over time so I'm [2093] going to make a new sheet I'm just going [2094] to call this um let's say prompt tracker [2099] I'm going to have three columns in the [2099] spreadsheet one's input the other's [2101] going to be output and the other's going [2103] to be pass what I'm going to do is I'm [2105] going to connect the spreadsheet to my [2109] make.com flow and what the idea of this [2113] is I have to find this so just give me [2116] one sec prompt [2118] tracker the idea of the spreadsheet is [2121] I'm going to provide the [2123] input which is here I'm then going to [2126] provide the output as well which is [2128] going to be here and then in the pass [2130] column what I'm going to do is I'm [2133] basically going to manually go through [2135] it and then just rate whether or not [2136] it's good or not whether or not it's [2138] what I [2139] want so don't mind the Bolding and don't [2143] mind the fact that this is in Json here [2145] when realistically it doesn't need to be [2147] if the input is this profile and the [2149] output is this am I happy with it let's [2151] say yes the input is this profile and [2155] the output is this am I happy with this [2157] no [2158] if the input is this and the output's [2160] that am I happy with it let's say yes [2162] let's say no and let's say yes all you [2165] need to do now in order to figure out [2166] quantifiably and quantitatively whether [2168] or not this prompt is all right is you [2169] just count up the number of passes did [2171] this output the thing that I wanted to [2172] Output right so maybe we have another [2175] column here called [2176] prompt and maybe we have score and then [2179] score is just one two 3 out of five so [2183] three out of five is also 60% right The [2185] Prompt that I used in this specific case [2187] I'm just going to copy and paste this [2189] from [2190] here and it scored 60% which is pretty [2194] reasonable what I'm going to do now is [2195] I'm going to change a prompt and then [2197] I'm just going to run it again and then [2198] if it scores better I'll know that my [2199] prompt is probably better if it scores [2201] worse I'll know my prompt is probably [2202] worse right I'm actually doing this with [2204] data granted I'm only doing this with [2206] five rows if you really wanted to be [2208] super super consistent precise about it [2210] you'd probably do it with like 500 rows [2212] well no I think realistically a good [2213] middle ground is like 10 maybe 15 but as [2216] I'm sure you guys can see we can out [2217] ifia test and iterate on our prompts and [2220] we do so with like science basically [2221] instead of just trying trying something [2226] um thought I'd reach out why don't we [2229] say make the prompts [2239] engaging nice these look a lot better [2241] already so maybe now it's y y y YX and [2245] now what I know is that my score is 80% [2249] right let me just score this specific [2253] prompt right and over that time uh you [2256] know as you go on maybe now you have [2259] another five and another five and [2260] another five and it goes from 80 to 85 [2261] to 90 to 95 by the time you end up with [2264] like your final prompt you will have [2265] quantifiably determined that it is the [2267] best prompt for the job so I understand [2270] that you know what I built out here is [2271] very simple and I also understand that [2273] if you don't have experience with [2273] make.com maybe it looks a little more [2275] complicated or maybe it just doesn't [2276] look super relevant to [2278] but you don't need to have experience [2280] with any sort of tool in order to build [2281] a spreadsheet like this you could just [2282] do this yourself you could do this using [2284] the chat GPT window um there are [2286] basically many ways to to iterate on [2287] these prompts the last thing I'll leave [2289] you guys with is if you guys want a [2290] really good prompt engineering guide [2293] head over to anthropic tocom and then [2295] just go to um prompt engineering over [2298] here I'll include a link in the [2299] description this is a high quality [2301] prompt engineering overview and doesn't [2303] talk about all the same things that I [2304] talked about you know I think I talk [2305] about things that are a little bit more [2306] relevant a little bit more universally [2308] understandable but it does dive really [2310] deep into the various ways that you can [2311] manipulate um prompts using things like [2314] Chain of Thought using things like U [2316] multiple prompting they probably talk [2318] about prompt caching here they talk [2319] about prefills uh to basically improve [2321] the quality of your output so once you [2324] have a spreadsheet sort of like this [2325] where you're scoring things if you [2327] implement the tips and tricks that are [2328] talked about in this anthropic prompt [2330] engineering article you know instead of [2332] being stuck at maybe 80 to 90% which is [2333] probably the peak where most people can [2335] realistically get AI to you'll be able [2337] to push past that go all the way up to [2338] 95 96 97 hell maybe even like 99% or [2342] more the likelihood that you'll get to [2343] 100 is pretty low um the benefit of AI [2345] is that it's flexible but ai's [2347] flexibility is also its biggest drawback [2349] you think about it like you know um [2352] accuracy of a calculator is 100 but [2354] flexibility of a calculator is like zero [2356] right you can't ask a calculator hey [2358] make me a meal plan for the next week [2359] it's not going to do a good job but you [2360] can ask AI it so uh you know if you [2363] think about like uh I don't know like [2366] like a graph with calculators on one and [2367] then AI on the other end uh those are [2369] basically the two diametrically opposed [2370] things you trade off a little bit of [2371] accuracy for flexibility and that's just [2373] sort of how AI works I hope you guys [2375] appreciated the video I had a lot of fun [2376] putting it together this actually the [2377] fourth time that I'm recording it [2378] because the first three times my OBS [2380] kept on crashing so rip on that but it [2383] is what it is if you guys uh have any [2385] questions just drop them down below I [2386] get most of my video ideas from you at [2388] this point in time and uh I believe this [2390] video is actually because somebody asked [2392] me to do one on prompt engineering three [2394] maybe four weeks ago so that's that I [2396] can do that for your idea as well [2398] otherwise please like subscribe um do [2400] all that fun stuff that pumps me up join [2402] maker school or makemoney withth [2403] make.com we just hit over 500 people in [2405] Meer school and I'm continuing to [2406] obviously increase the price uh to [2408] represent the increased demand so if you [2410] want to get in at a low price definitely [2411] get it now and yeah I'll just catch you [2413] on the next video thanks so much

Title: The Future of Automation In 2025 (Prepare Now)
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here I'm [1] going to take a departure from the usual [2] sort of video that I do today and I'm [4] going to talk a little bit about the [5] future of automation there are some [7] changes that are coming automation is [8] going to evolve as an industry and I [10] feel like it's my responsibility as a [12] content creator in the space to at least [13] bring this up to let a couple of people [15] know what I'm seeing happen over the [17] course of the next few years so if you [19] guys want to insulate and prepare [20] yourself for a couple of the changes in [22] the industry if you guys want to jump on [23] some new market opportunities before [25] they even materialize this is a video [26] for you stay tuned and let's get into it [31] all right so probably the biggest change [32] coming down the pipeline are AI agents [34] if you're unfamiliar with the term agent [36] just refers to like agency like autonomy [40] decision-making ability basically right [42] now llms are text in text out but in the [45] future maybe it'll be a model that can [47] you know browse your computer click [49] buttons um Converse over the phone [51] essentially just do things for you so [53] let me be abundantly clear um AI agents [56] as it currently stands today are a [57] marketing gimmick they don't actually [59] exist everybody on YouTube and writing [62] white papers and making LinkedIn posts [63] about this [ __ ] um they're just like [65] jumping on the hype train and what [67] they're really doing is they're just [68] connecting like the output of one API [70] call to the input of another API call [72] and they're slapping the word agent on [73] it and they're getting a million billion [74] likes so I'm not going to lie to you uh [77] most of these flows do not really work [78] that well I'm sure there are some [80] exceptions uh but in general like these [82] are nowhere near as powerful as actual [84] AI agents are going to be people start [85] talking about AI agents to you over the [87] course of the next couple months and [88] about how it's totally changed the game [90] I would be a little bit skeptical but if [92] you're watching this video in 2025 2026 [94] uh I think we will probably have ai [97] agents as they are conceptualized to [99] become today um and you know when that [102] when that happens uh the economy is [104] going to change quite fundamentally and [106] I also think that obviously us as [107] automation providers our day-to-day is [108] going to change too so there's some [110] there's some goods and some bads um [112] basically right now the reason why a [114] agents don't exist is because you know I [117] just want to make this super clear you [119] know these these agents are chaining [121] together actions right so it'll be like [124] hey scrape this data and then summarize [127] it or something if you think about this [129] conceptually what most people believe is [131] let's say your am models are 80% [133] accurate or 80% successful maybe 80% [136] reliable whatever the term is but but [137] they're 80% right if you chain two of [140] those together so model module number [143] one and module number two and you [144] connect them right um and they're both [146] 80% reliable or 80% accurate the [150] resulting accuracy of that whole flow is [152] not 80% it is 64% because it's not like [156] additive or something like it's [157] multiplicative right if you're 08 and [160] then you're 08 the end result of that is [161] 08 time 08 which is 0 64 if you were to [164] add I don't know another 20 modules in [166] that flow every time you send the output [169] of one module into as uh you feed in the [172] output of one module as the input of [173] another module the quality of your [175] output is just going to decrease [177] drastically and that's why right now [179] these models don't really work but [181] eventually there comes a point when you [183] know that accuracy goes from 80% like [185] 85% to 90% to 95% to [189] 99.999% where the reduction in quality [192] or accuracy from the output of one thing [194] into the input of another becomes [195] essentially meaningless or negligible at [197] best and when that happens you will [200] essentially have like takeoff velocity [202] for a agents you'll be able to build out [204] arbitrarily complicated flows and then [207] give the AI agent that agency [210] to make the decision on how how far to [212] to push that flow so you know AI models [215] are quickly going to go and very quickly [217] I mean like in the next couple years [218] they're going to go from what they are [219] right now which are isolated API calls [221] where you just send text and receive [222] text and that's about it to these [225] extraordinarily comprehensive systems [227] which to be frank are basically going to [229] be equivalent to or better than most [231] staff members today um and when that [234] happens as I'm sure you can imagine the [235] work that we provide is going to have to [237] change um it'll necessitate changing [240] and so I see both a good and a bad I see [242] a good in a short term and a bad in a [243] long term and I'll talk about both but [246] uh the good is that like I want you guys [249] to think about Chachi BT when Chachi BT [251] came out if you look at like the just [253] the search volume for AI or for [255] automation or whatever right around the [257] time that it became clear that AI could [259] do more than just go beep boop yes no [261] and actually like talk to you um the [263] interest and the demand for the services [265] that we provide shot way the hell up so [267] there's a massive spike in demand for [269] automation as a service essentially um [272] and that was with chat gbt now if you [273] think about it like most businesses use [275] chat gbt extraordinarily limited today [277] right they will copy and paste the [280] output of chat gbt 500 times over the [283] course of their day and then they'll [284] slap the word AI on their company and be [286] like we're AI uh we're an AI sandwich [288] shop right because we use freaking chaty [291] BT as our input and our output we just [292] copy paste everything the difference [295] between a business that uses chat gbt [296] like that and one that doesn't is not [298] massive like in terms of their line in [300] terms of their productivity it's maybe [301] like 30% or something so uh it's still [304] capable for the non- aai business to [305] compete with the AI business and that's [307] actually what's happening that's what a [308] lot of businesses are like right but [310] when AI agents hit the floor like when [312] they make it out onto the production [314] line and people understand the value and [317] the power of these things you will not [320] be able to compete with an AI agent [322] enabled business if you do not have an a [323] agent in your company the difference [325] will not be 30% it'll be [328] 3,000% and because capitalism does what [330] capitalism does there's simply no room [332] for companies that do not have the sort [335] of artificial intelligence as a [337] foundation of their business what that [339] means is just like when we saw that [341] spike in interest and demand with chaty [343] BT we're going to see the exact same [345] thing when a agents hit the mainstream [347] we're going to see so much demand for [349] People Like Us automation service [351] providers to build out flows that [353] incapsulate and take advantage of a [355] agents that it's going to be nuts like [357] think about it this way what do you [358] think an average business owner would [361] rather do would they [363] rather pay their current staff member [367] $60,000 a year who has to eat sleep rest [371] use the bathroom take breaks take [373] vacations take maternity leaves hell if [376] you fire them you need to pay them [377] Severance their rules and restrictions [380] regarding how hard you can work them the [382] things you can get them to do the ways [383] that you know you both need to address [385] each other the questions you can ask do [386] you think they'd rather pay $60,000 a [388] year for that [390] or do you do you think that they'd [391] rather pay somebody like us or an AI [394] automation agency $2,000 a month to just [397] maintain an AI agent flow well obviously [401] they're going to pay us $2,000 a month [403] even if the the AI agent provider maybe [406] open AI comes out with an AI agent [407] offering um in in a year and they charge [410] I don't know a ridiculous amount and it [412] ends up being $10,000 a year for this [414] business even if all is equal they would [417] probably still choose the AI agent over [419] the person just because of the fural [421] complications and the fact that you know [423] if it works at equivalent quality it's [425] going to work 100 times faster because [426] doesn't have to do any of those things [427] that I mentioned and you know it's using [430] silicon it's not biological right [433] so the demand for services like ours in [435] the short term and when I say short term [437] in the next couple years is going to [440] explode the bad news is and I guess bad [444] depends on your point of view but the [446] bad news is when these models get so [449] Advanced and developed and they get to [450] the point where they can do the things [452] that you know most people need an [453] average staff member to do or like a [455] low-level or mid-level employee to do [457] like eventually they're going to get so [458] good that they just do our job too like [460] you'll be able to just hire an AI agent [463] you know install it on your computer and [465] it will make all of the connections [466] between your platforms it will connect [468] your Google Sheets to I don't know your [470] your LinkedIn account and it'll [472] automatically uh summarize stuff from [474] another guy's web page parasite SEO it [477] it'll automatically cold email and cold [480] call people on your behalf right it'll [482] basically be able to do all the stuff [483] that we were planning on implementing in [484] their business anyway but I'll be real [487] the reason why I'm sort of hedging my [488] bets and saying this is not necessarily [489] terrible it's just because I mean when [491] they can do my job they can do anybody [493] else's job too so I believe that on a [495] deeper more fundamental level this is [497] going to change our economy quite [498] drastically and we're probably going to [499] need new rules and controls within like [502] the market in order to account for AI [504] agents I don't know what that would be [506] but if you talk to anybody that's really [508] deep in the space that's been working [509] with Technologies like this for several [511] years that's seen the exponential [513] progression of how quickly AI is taking [515] off basically all of them believe what I [518] am telling you right now which is that [520] you know when when something of that [522] magnitude hits like whether or not I am [526] capable whether or not I can compete [527] with a agents that can do my job that [529] sort of ceases to be meaningless um [531] despite capitalism doing what capitalism [533] does like our our whole economic system [535] will probably have to change pretty [536] fundamentally uh if we are to continue [538] living without just blowing ourselves up [540] or who knows maybe we'll blow ourselves [541] up at that point though doesn't really [543] matter right at least we made our B so [545] the point that I'm making is over the [546] course of the next couple of years um [548] you know a agents are going to be a [549] tremendous opportunity for us and so if [551] you think about it strategically from my [552] perspective I'm learning as much as I [554] possibly can about a agents today I'm [556] building out flows that include AI [558] agents today and even if they're just [561] about there even if they don't actually [563] work I know that when the technology [564] improves it'll just be a drag and drop [566] sort of deal I'm uh developing my a [569] skills I'm developing my understanding [570] of artificial intelligence more [571] generally just because I know that you [573] know over those next few years there are [575] going to be so many small to mids excuse [578] me small to midsize businesses as well [580] as like Enterprise level companies that [581] will need somebody with my exact skill [582] set to turn this AI agent thing which is [584] on the cusp of of release and and [587] Effectiveness into something that can [588] actually you know 5x their bottom line [590] so I'm going to be making a ton of AI [592] agent videos over the course of the next [593] few months to help illuminate this but [595] if I were in your shoes I would [597] absolutely start picking up a agents on [599] your own I would learn about the space I [602] would learn about how people are [603] misusing the term how it's sort of a [605] marketing gimmick right now uh I would [607] read up on AI i' become more or less as [609] proficient as I possibly can be because [611] this is going to be like if you thought [613] that AI automation um agencies were a [616] gold rush back you know 2022 until 2024 [619] like the the the demand for this is [621] going to absolutely explode the second [623] the first like viable AI agent hits the [626] market which maybe it'll be like late [627] 2024 maybe it'll be like mid 2025 who [630] knows but that that period there is [631] going to be the one that I'm personally [632] preparing for and I recommend you do to [634] so let's talk a little bit shorter term [635] than that um another big change that I'm [637] seeing happening and that I think will [639] will continue to happen is the demand [641] for scrapers as we know it will decrease [643] uh today right now scrapers are very In [645] Demand right there are a million in one [647] things that you can do with the average [648] scraper you could scrape social media [650] posts compile that in some structured [651] data source then manipulate every cell [653] and then use it for a cold email [654] campaign you could scrape tons of data [657] off of I don't know like publicly avail [659] databases you could scrape stock [661] information charts basically the whole [663] idea is you convert that into some sort [664] of structured data and now it's in some [666] like format that you can just send off [667] to a million platforms so scraping is [669] super mega valuable um but if you think [671] about it as well in order to build a [673] scraper you sort of have a couple [675] options one you could use a third party [677] platform something like appify or [678] Phantom Buster or something that's [680] already done the leg work and putting [681] together the scraper but that tends to [682] be very inflexible so if you want to [684] like build a scraper of any meaningful [687] uh Power or like Renown you typically [688] have to build yourself and that includes [690] stuff like um HTML like Dom manipulation [693] Json maybe even like a little bit of [695] JavaScript basically you got to know [696] your [ __ ] in order to make it work right [699] now the issue with building these [700] bespoke scrapers is typically the way [703] that they work is they um go off the Dom [705] or the document object model and you [707] know they can work and they you know you [710] can build a scraper in 10 hours that [711] scrapes a million records a day or [713] something but if the Target website that [715] you're trying to build a scraper for [717] changes even slightly even if they like [719] I don't know add a single character to [721] one of the elements or something that [722] you're pulling data from your entire [724] scraper is going to break and then you [725] basically have to go through figure out [726] what the reason for that failure is and [728] just rebuild the whole damn thing I mean [730] sometimes this is a Fast Fix sometimes [731] this is a long fix but the point I'm [733] making is they're pretty fragile and in [736] the future that will no longer be the [739] case because of the disruptions that [741] we're seeing with AI agents um claw [743] computer use uh being the most recent [746] example of this and so on and so forth [748] so you know models like Cloud's computer [751] use and a couple of the other ones whose [752] names aren't coming in right now show us [753] that this will no longer be necessary [754] you're not going to have to invest a ton [757] of time energy and resources into [759] building a custom bespoke scraper that [760] scrapes only this website you'll [762] actually just be able to give the model [764] instructions in human language you know [765] say something along the lines of hey I [766] want you to go to linkedin.com and then [768] I want you to find posts that are [770] related to AI Automation and then I want [771] you to you know click on every one of [773] their profiles and then extract the [775] first name last name the company that [777] they work for see if you could find the [778] company domain and then pump all that [780] stuff in nemil finder give me the result [782] so you're not going to have to build out [783] this whole thing that does all that and [785] you're not going to have to do any [786] coding you're not going to have to [786] connect any modules together you're just [788] going to give AI that one instruction [790] it'll go and do it obviously it's going [791] to be slower it's not going to be [792] anywhere near as fast as a bespoke [794] implementation right it's sort of like [796] the difference between working I don't [797] know like on assembly or something [799] versus working all the way up in um you [802] know like like python or whatnot uh when [804] you're really low level obviously the [807] the trade-off is sort of speed to like [808] well speed of processing versus speed of [811] implementation but still um that's going [813] to be enough for the vast majority of [814] people um and even if they have to pay a [816] lot more per unit in order to do the [818] scraping like let's hypothetically say [820] some future version of CLA computer use [822] costs I don't know like uh $5 an hour or [826] something and it can only get you like [828] 100 results or whatever A lot of the [830] time people are still going to rather do [832] that because the cost comes per hour as [834] opposed to hire somebody like you or I [836] where we might charge them $5,000 to [837] build that system and and you know have [839] it all up front so I think the trade-off [842] in the near- term will be do I want [844] something that runs um you know super [847] super quickly that I could just get [848] going immediately and then I don't have [849] to I don't have to waste any time I just [851] say Claude go do this thing for me and [853] then it goes and does it that costs me a [854] little bit more or do I want to spend a [856] ton of time effort and resources on [858] having like an AI guy like Nick sarif go [861] out there and build the system for me [863] and over the course of you know the next [864] few years more and more people are going [866] to shift to the former and you know [867] scraper is sort of as a service offering [869] are going to be nowhere near as in [871] demand there's just really not going to [872] be anywhere near as much value in them [874] so what I would do if I were in your [876] shoes is I would extract as much value [877] of scraping now you can make a ton of [878] money building scrapers if you know just [880] like a few lines of cod a little bit [882] about https basically if you just watch [884] my tutorial videos and you've seen me [885] scrape stuff in make um you know you can [888] you can charge thousands of dollars for [889] those flows with no issue so I would try [891] to extract as much value out of these [893] scrapers as possible before something [895] like an advanced version of cloud [897] computer use hits the market um and then [899] I would also start preparing myself for [901] the eventuality where that just stops [902] being super important I would you know [905] again experiment with agentic workflows [907] start learning a little bit more about [908] how all of that stuff works under the [909] hood because odds are that's what a lot [911] of people are going to be asking for um [913] and then yeah just be prepared to you [914] know be able to charge less money [915] because the perceived value of a scraper [917] is going to go down as well I might also [919] look into how um security U controls on [923] websites are going to change like you [924] think about rate limits today well man [926] think about rate limits in like a year [928] when everybody in mom is running CLA [930] computer use like models to like go out [932] and I don't know scan Expedia tickets [935] and compare them right things are going [937] to be quite different so knowing a [938] little bit about that is probably worth [939] insulating yourself as well the third [941] big change that I see coming is business [943] skills are going to be extraordinarily [945] more valuable than technical skills now [947] I know that I just wax poetic for like [949] 10 minutes about how you need to learn [951] more about AI agents you need to learn [953] you know more about how to use CLA [954] computer use and that sort of stuff and [956] I stand by that but more generally [958] speaking [959] business skills are going to become [961] extraordinarily more valuable than any [963] sort of code or programming knowledge [966] because in the future it's going to be [967] way easier for you to be a salesperson [970] that uses AI to do your engineering than [972] an engineer that uses AI to do your [974] sales sales involves people right so let [977] me explain right now like today knowing [980] how to code is super valuable even if [981] you know a little bit about Json and [983] HTTP calls and like some API stuff and [986] you're a no code engineer you're [987] basically 10x in your Leverage right [989] that's one of the reasons why a lot of [990] the people choose to work with me [991] instead of the competition for instance [993] just because I can sort of speak the [994] technical side but you know I also speak [996] the business side but the reality is [998] most of the time companies are forced to [999] choose between somebody that either [1001] knows business really well or knows like [1003] engineering really well you get these [1005] Engineers of these you know top five [1007] Fang companies that get paid out the ass [1010] 300 400 $500,000 a year uh for their [1013] technical knowledge but these guys [1015] couldn't tell you why the hell they're [1016] building something if you put a gun to [1017] their head um I see this a lot myself [1020] cuz you know I'm now um you know [1021] entering the coaching space more heavily [1023] and I'm doing a lot more Consulting and [1024] coaching for people that are in my my [1026] business vertical that are asking me [1028] Nick how can I improve my business and [1029] that sort of thing how can I grow my [1031] automation agency and you would not [1033] believe the disconnect that I'm seeing [1034] from a lot of people that have that as a [1036] background that are like super engineer [1037] focused that are now trying to learn [1039] sales for the first time it is way [1041] harder for like an engineer guy to learn [1043] sales than it is for a sales guy to [1044] learn engineering which is really [1045] interesting huh anywh who um [1049] yeah uh so that that's kind of the [1051] trade-off that most businesses have to [1052] make because no code means like you [1054] don't need to become an engineering [1055] professional a lot of the time no code [1056] guys are kind of in the middle and then [1057] businesses really like us and that [1058] actually allows us to usually charge [1060] more money at least from a freelance [1061] perspective than um you know like a [1063] freelance software engineer or something [1065] like I'd say the vast majority of [1066] freelance automation Specialists make [1067] way more money than freelance software [1069] Engineers the value of a freelance uh [1071] software engineer is like very hard to [1073] see and conceptualize it's usually just [1074] like a bunch of scripts and some Docker [1076] container and some server somewhere [1078] right whereas the value of an Automation [1079] and no code guy super easy because you [1082] actually can see the flow like when I [1083] run it I see the little circle go up and [1085] go you know from Google Drive to Panda [1087] do to email right it's just a lot more [1089] visible to the small business um [1091] audience but enter AI obviously AI is [1094] already helping programmers boiler plate [1097] code you know write common functions um [1101] autocomplete and stuff like that it's [1102] also helping non-technical people like [1105] to write quick little scripts to do [1106] things for them answer question s in [1109] like no code scenarios debug things if [1111] we just like extrapolate this over the [1113] course of next years frankly you're not [1115] going to need much technical knowledge [1116] at all to start a business like this I [1118] mean you're going to need to know [1119] obviously how to drag and drop a module [1121] across the screen you're going to need [1122] to know what these platforms do but [1124] that's about the extent of it like [1125] you're going to need to know more about [1126] the tools themselves than you're going [1128] to need to know about how to um you know [1131] you know about like the technical [1132] underpinnings of them so um knowing how [1135] computers work I think will always give [1137] you an edge because our society is built [1138] on computers these days but that edge is [1140] just going to decrease over time um and [1142] instead what will increase in value over [1144] time is just knowing business [1145] fundamentals knowing how to talk to [1147] people knowing how to identify customer [1149] pain points um knowing how to enter a [1152] new market the way that I see it is you [1154] know if you have a little bit of like [1155] business operations knowledge if you're [1156] capable of asking the simple questions [1158] like hey uh what are your bottlenecks [1159] right like what's the shortest line path [1161] to growth why aren't you making Revenue [1162] what do people actually care about you'd [1164] be surprised at how much of the time you [1167] know I see these people build out Mass [1168] of super crazy sophisticated sales and [1171] marketing flows that are just so [1173] insanely detailed and intricate and then [1175] and you know they come from this [1176] engineering background and it's this [1178] engineering mind with 500 modules and [1180] steps and that sort of thing but then [1182] like they don't follow up with the [1183] client two hours before the call to [1185] confirm that they're on their calendar [1187] and like they're losing like 50% of the [1189] business right like if you just don't [1191] understand these business fundamentals [1193] um it's so much harder for you to make [1195] it in this industry today um if we [1197] continue extrapolating the future that [1199] trend is only going to increase so the [1201] point that I'm trying to make is you [1202] know if you think about it from iers [1203] like what what should you do in the [1204] scenario you should improve your [1205] business skills as much as you humanly [1207] can for every unit of time that you [1209] spend learning how to do like an HTTP [1212] call or something you should be spending [1213] two or three units of time learning how [1215] to do marketing learning how to do sales [1216] learning how to talk to people jumping [1218] on calls with people even if you don't [1219] necessarily think you could sell them um [1221] because that is going to be the key [1222] point of Leverage over the course of the [1223] next few years it's going to be not [1224] necessarily your knowledge of the topic [1226] it's going to be your ability to sell [1229] somebody on your knowledge of the topic [1231] all right more generally the fourth [1232] thing that is going to change is focus [1234] will become increasingly difficult to [1236] cultivate and at the same time life will [1238] continue to disproportionately reward [1239] those who can focus so today I firmly [1243] believe and I think Alex rosi has a [1245] whole bit on this but like people can't [1246] focus for [ __ ] the vast majority of [1248] people they can't focus on a single [1249] thing long enough to make it work um [1251] there are just so many demands for our [1253] time and it's not necessarily our fault [1256] for this although you know not like [1257] totally determinist or anything like I [1258] think you do have control of your free [1260] will but if you think about like the [1261] average person it's really like the [1264] average person's attention versus [1266] billions of dollars and a dozen or more [1269] countries working constantly with a [1271] concerted effort to extract as much [1273] value away from your brain as humanly [1274] possible to suck up your attention as [1276] best they can so it's really [1278] logistically in feasible for the average [1280] person to like keep fighting this stuff [1281] forever and you know what ends up [1283] happening is they typically fall to the [1284] lowest common denominator they lose the [1286] ability to focus um and you know they [1288] toally just dopamine scroll through IG [1291] reels or Tik Tok for 5 hours a day not [1293] really doing anything the way that I see [1295] focus is I see it as a force multiplier [1296] for both talent and ambition many people [1299] have talent and ambition don't get me [1300] wrong many people are incredibly [1301] intelligent and they want to achieve [1303] great things but that in and of itself [1305] is not sufficient for you to succeed you [1307] know you can have the ladder and that [1308] can be great but if you don't have the [1309] form if you don't have the focus then [1311] you can't make anything out of the [1313] ladder so I see this trend is increasing [1316] because AI is now entering the for [1319] um a lot more heavily than it was before [1320] uh we're seeing you know a lot more [1323] synthetic content which I'm going to [1324] talk about in a minute as well um I'm [1326] seeing you know the ability for these [1330] pretty monolithic companies to like [1331] demand your attention and to manipulate [1333] your attention is is only increasing I [1335] think the average person is also just [1337] losing the ability to like self-regulate [1339] stuff like dopamine orgic impulses [1341] anyway I didn't mean for I don't mean [1343] for this to be like a philosophy thing [1345] or like my own personal philosophy on [1347] Focus but the point I'm making is um if [1349] you think it's difficult to focus now [1350] it'll probably be continuously more and [1353] more difficult over the next few years [1354] so if you have the ability to cultivate [1356] even a tiny bit of focus today um you [1357] should cherish it and you should [1358] continue building it um you know if you [1361] build your ability to think and work [1362] without any sort of distraction if you [1365] can I don't know get to a point where [1367] you can sit down and work excuse me work [1369] on something I have mad hiccups right [1371] now that came out of nowhere uh if you [1373] can build your ability to work on one [1375] thing and one thing consistently for two [1377] or three hours [1379] you're probably somewhere in like the [1380] top 1% of global Focus already which [1384] enables you to do you know two three [1385] four times more output than than a lot [1387] of the people that have talent and [1388] ambition but but don't necessarily have [1390] the focus so yeah my recommendation here [1393] and just in terms of actionables because [1394] I always like to drop some at the end of [1395] of each one of these is to minim [1397] minimize the exposure that you have to [1400] stimulus build a very Mindful and [1403] meaningful life don't just fall into the [1406] inertia of tools Technologies and our [1409] culture you know you don't necessarily [1412] need the brand new phone Gadget nor do [1414] you have to be connected to 25 different [1417] social media apps I mean I don't have [1419] Instagram for example on my phone anyway [1421] have it on my computer for business [1423] purposes ostensibly um but you know be [1427] aware of the tools you're using and make [1429] sure that you are using the tools the [1431] tools aren't using you um you know [1433] routinely spending a few hours Eng [1434] grossed in something like automations or [1436] watching long form content like myself [1439] I feel is a push in the right direction [1441] sort of against that that loss of focus [1443] so keep that up as much as you can all [1445] right number five is the majority of [1447] content on the Internet is soon going to [1449] become synthetic and people and [1451] companies are going to want systems that [1453] enable them to join that party as well [1456] what I mean by this is today the [1458] majority of the content available on the [1459] Internet is obviously created by humans [1461] for humans right um a lot of the time [1463] you follow a person even if you follow a [1464] company you follow the person at that [1466] company the brand representative the [1467] face you follow icons or politicians or [1470] whatnot um you know when you laugh at a [1472] meme you're laughing at a person's meme [1474] right but over the course of the next [1475] few years that's going to change pretty [1476] drastically we're already seeing AI [1478] start doing things like making really [1479] engaging music AI is now capable of [1481] obviously making video um still quite [1483] short form video but some of those [1484] videos are hilarious picture Will Smith [1486] eating a bunch of noodles right over the [1488] course of the next few years that is [1489] only going to increase and it's going to [1491] get to the point where AI is now is [1493] quickly going to venture into like human [1495] culture a lot more heavily and so in I [1498] don't know 2028 the vast majority of the [1500] memes that you laugh at might be AI [1501] memes the songs that you listen to might [1503] be AI songs the entertainment you [1505] consume might be AI entertainment um the [1508] point that I'm making is it'll [1509] fundamentally change the economics of [1510] content production and you know as with [1513] before AI agents entering the four and [1515] then and then companies not necessarily [1517] being able to compete if they did not [1518] have that functionality um you know [1520] content is a Marketplace too so [1522] companies that don't enable this sort of [1524] AI production of content um they will [1527] they won't be able to compete either [1529] meaning they're going to be looking for [1530] people like us to enter that marketplace [1532] with and buildout systems that enable [1534] them to multiply their content [1535] production and and that sort of thing [1539] so so the way that I see it is sort of [1541] like entering a worldclass bodybuilding [1543] competition um unequipped right without [1545] doing any sort of steroid or any sort of [1547] supplement or or anything like that [1549] you're just some dude and you're working [1551] really hard but then like you look to [1553] your you look to your right and there's [1554] just some 8 foot five tall HGH guy and [1557] there's just nothing you can do to catch [1559] up right that's sort of like the mental [1561] calus that companies going to have to [1562] make so I see a lot more companies [1563] getting into content production systems [1565] content curation systems um you may be [1568] having like a person that's still [1570] planning the content or something or or [1572] like a face of it but then automatic [1574] systems that turn that one piece of [1575] content into 50 or 100 or or 200 [1578] different pieces of content um I'm [1580] currently working on this for my own [1581] business as well so this is somewhat [1582] topical but um yeah my recommendation to [1584] you would be to learn how to build [1587] systems that create or repurpose or [1589] Syndicate or curate content um and learn [1592] that now rather than in a few years when [1594] it becomes really in demand because [1596] companies are going to need the stuff [1597] they're going to want the stuff um as [1599] the number of synthetic post to organic [1603] post as that ratio increases um very [1606] quickly you know this is naturally going [1608] to be a place that a lot of companies go [1609] to to compete I want to say synthetic [1611] post by the way I don't just mean like [1612] AI art or funny Will Smith past to [1615] eating memes or whatnot I I also just [1617] mean like posts that were posts that [1620] that weren't necessarily made by humans [1621] but maybe like the idea was initially [1623] human but then you know was like [1625] expanded or summarized I mean stuff like [1628] podcast versions of articles that are [1630] written I mean stuff like you know a [1632] white paper turned into a five-part [1634] article Series right um just as the [1637] amount of content on the internet [1638] continues to increase it'll eventually [1640] outpace consumption well I think it's [1642] already outpacing consumption and as it [1643] outpaces consumption uh basically you're [1645] going to have like a limited uh number [1647] of eyeball [1648] um on way more stuff and so you know the [1652] the market economics or rather the [1654] forces of play will demand companies [1656] that want to be relevant in the content [1658] sphere to use AI to generate large [1661] portions of it all right the last big [1663] change that I see coming is distribution [1666] will become the primary Moote not [1668] software and not people um if you know [1670] you know this is something that I think [1672] Mark Anderson talked about a few years [1674] ago um he was a lot more you know na [1677] nent what's the term he was a lot more [1679] farseeing than I am because this is just [1681] a realization that I myself have come to [1683] maybe like the last few months but if [1685] you're in familiar with the term mo mo [1687] basically describes a business's ability [1690] to maintain its competitive Advantage um [1693] the vast majority of Moes right now in [1695] businesses let's say like an average SAS [1697] company is the software and it's the [1699] people so if you have an amazing [1702] software company and this amazing [1704] software app the thing that allows you [1706] to maintain your competitive Advantage [1707] is the the software itself it's the [1709] infrastructure it's the code basically [1711] right if you have a YouTube channel like [1714] mine um or maybe like uh mostly [1717] solopreneur style automation business [1719] like mine you know the the Moe is is you [1721] it's the person right I mean I'm good at [1724] talking and great at no code stuff which [1726] is why so many people follow me this is [1728] similar to software in so far that it's [1730] just like it's something unique about [1732] the business that allows it to stand out [1735] so the ability of software and people to [1738] maintain the moat is changing very [1739] drastically and over the course of the [1741] next few years software people these [1743] sort of unique developments that will no [1745] longer be the moat at all in the average [1747] business um the Moe in the average [1750] business is going to be distribution [1752] instead why because if you think about [1754] it AI is going to enable you to make any [1757] software you want at the click of a [1758] button do you want WordPress 2.0 are you [1761] dissatisfied with us well then um all [1763] you do is you enter a little prompt in [1765] and say make WordPress but make it a [1766] little bit better and I want you now [1768] want you add that and all of a sudden [1769] you have a bespoke customized [1771] instantiation of the entire WordPress [1773] platform at your fingertips do you want [1776] um I don't know a super Charming [1778] handsome devil to be your YouTube guy [1781] right well you'll be able to do so [1782] you'll be able to ask AI to like create [1784] you a little talking head and then just [1786] have that talking head do your videos [1788] the point that I'm making is that the [1791] intrinsic ability of software to [1793] maintain mode and the intrinsic ability [1794] of people to maintain mode is is [1796] basically going to disappear and instead [1798] said the number one most important thing [1799] for a business in order to maintain its [1801] competitive Advantage um the number one [1803] thing is going to be its distribution [1805] instead basically like it's pre-existing [1807] um channels to to to you know sell its [1810] product or service what do I mean well [1814] um the ability to get eyeballs in your [1816] product or service is basically it that [1818] means your email lists uh your [1821] subscribers uh you're following on like [1823] LinkedIn or Facebook or Instagram [1825] YouTube uh that's your reputation in [1827] communities it's your relationships on [1829] the internet uh your current client list [1831] for instance is pretty big that's your [1832] distribution Channel as well vendors [1834] suppliers that sort of stuff that is [1836] going to end up being like the moat of a [1838] business if it isn't already um way more [1841] so than like the software that the [1842] company built or the proprietary [1845] database architecture that uses or [1847] something of that nature um and what [1850] that means for us is you know I don't [1853] want to obviously I'm biased here what [1855] that means for you is because [1857] distribution is ass to be the only Mo [1859] that really matters if you think about [1861] it like your job your responsibility [1863] over the course of next years is to [1864] build distribution as quickly as you can [1867] that means build a brand it means build [1869] an email list it means build a community [1871] it means build your reputation basically [1873] build as much of that as humanly [1874] possible because the economic value that [1877] you bring to the table I hate to be the [1879] one to break it to you but that will [1880] soon be essentially meaningless in the [1882] light of AI the thing that will continue [1884] to be meaningful are the relationships [1886] that you have with people uh your [1888] Authority your ability to sell a product [1890] even if that product isn't necessarily [1892] Superior to everybody else as long as [1894] you have a Channel of people that like [1896] trust and respect you you you'll be able [1898] to sell it whereas the other guy that [1900] might have an even better product than [1901] you that doesn't have that customer list [1903] he he won't so you know my honest and [1906] Earnest advice is to everybody that's [1908] watching this try and build some sort of [1910] Channel um of distribution on your own [1912] and that doesn't have to be what I'm [1913] doing here on YouTube you could try like [1916] short form platforms and stuff too you [1918] have to jump on Twitter or whatnot you [1919] could build I don't know you could you [1922] could start a blog you [1923] could um you can join a bunch of [1927] communities and just build a strong [1928] reputation there you could you know um [1932] attempt new business models that uh [1934] frontload quantity or or volume as [1937] opposed to necessarily deal size and [1939] then use that to build up like a big [1940] Client List that you could remarket to [1942] over the course of next years the point [1943] I'm making is as long as you're focus on [1945] distribution as opposed to like having [1947] some super crazy special product or [1949] service over the course of that period [1952] uh you're going to do a lot better than [1954] the people that you know don't [1956] understand this concept so distribution [1958] is definitely going to be the main moat [1960] in the future and I see that coming I [1963] see that already almost here today but I [1965] see that definitely coming into the four [1967] with AI and if you think about it as [1970] well you know logically there's no [1973] better time than today to build a brand [1975] or to build a distribution Channel [1977] because we just talked about how the [1978] majority of the content on the internet [1980] was going to be synthetic a moment ago [1981] right I mean can you imagine trying to [1984] compete in five years when the value of [1990] you know uh distribution is shot way the [1992] hell up so everybody's trying to do it [1994] and then you're also competing in a [1995] marketplace with 100 times the content [1997] 100 times the voices you're competing [1999] against artificial intelligence it's [2001] almost like that old do the best time to [2003] plan a tree is 20 years ago excuse me [2006] the second best time is today um the [2008] best time to build the distribution [2009] channel was definitely 20 years ago um [2011] but the second best time is today it [2012] will never be easier to build [2013] distribution than today meaning that you [2016] you probably should even if it's [2017] something that you only do a little bit [2019] every day a lot of the time um the [2020] requirement distribution I found isn't [2022] necessarily in how frequently you post [2024] content or how frequently you engage [2025] with people it's simply it's a [2027] permissive thing where if you just do it [2029] a little bit for a long enough period of [2031] time um that will eventually compound it [2032] to some sort of success so yeah let this [2035] be let this be your sign let this be me [2038] recommending you heavily to build some [2041] distribution um just because the [2042] marketplace is going to grow very very [2044] saturated very quickly because of volume [2046] all right if you guys just listen to me [2047] Yap for the better part of the last 45 [2049] minutes thank you very much I appreciate [2051] it if you have any questions about my [2053] visions of the future I'm not exactly [2054] Nostradamus but I'm pretty sure most of [2056] these things are uh I don't want to say [2058] they're trivial but I mean I think you [2059] could probably extrapolate most current [2060] changes and arrive the same conclusions [2062] uh as I have just drop a comment down [2064] below I'm more than happy to walk you [2066] through my own thought process and maybe [2067] we could chat if you have any [2068] disagreements with me on that I'd love [2070] to um talk about that as well otherwise [2072] if you could do me a big solid like [2074] subscribe do all that fun stuff that the [2076] YouTube algorithm loves me for uh I will [2079] catch you on the next video thanks so [2081] much really appreciate your time

Title: THIS Simple Automation Made Me an Extra $12,853K (Copy-Paste)
[0] what is going on everybody how many [1] times you kicked yourself for not [2] following up on an unpaid invoice well [4] over the course of the next 20 or 30 [5] minutes I'm going to show you a super [7] simple system in make.com that I will [9] build alongside you that does all of [11] that invoice followup automatically that [13] sounds like something you guys want to [13] learn how to do for yourselves stay [15] tuned and let's get into [18] it so I initially got this idea from my [21] community a Luke Stillwell in maker [23] School said please record a video on the [24] invoice chasing process my thought was [26] to have a Google sheet that was updated [28] weekly with outstanding invoices from [29] QuickBooks that email to myself removes [31] those that have been paid and then [32] updates a field for those still unpaid a [34] column that can have a manual input to [36] delay if the client has agreed payment [37] terms with you then maybe another [39] scenario runs after that sends a [40] different email depending on the weeks [41] that it's been outstanding escalating [43] serious of the copy with each week then [44] creates a letter before action on the [46] fourth week uh it looks like in his case [48] he's in the UK so he says UK legal [50] letter before legal action so the system [52] that I build in a minute is not going to [53] be exactly that system but it's going to [54] be pretty dang close and dare I say [56] it'll actually be even simpler than the [58] system that Luke is proposing while [59] doing substantially more to actually [61] collect on your invoices in like a [62] customized and personalized way so I [64] have a make.com scenario window open [66] here it's called automatic invoice [67] collection I haven't done anything with [69] it and over the course of the next few [70] minutes I'm going to show you exactly [72] how we're going to make this work at [73] scale and just why it's so effective [75] this is really like um Beauty in [78] Simplicity I would say uh and this is [80] one of those flows that you can build in [81] like five or 10 minutes uh that can [83] yield you an additional 10 15 $20,000 a [86] year if you're like the average agency I [88] work with so the very first thing that [89] you need in order to make this work is [90] you need a way to list the invoices in [93] your system so if you're using stripe [95] for instance use use the search uh [97] search invoices module which I'll show [99] you in a second using QuickBooks there's [101] like a search or a filter invoices [103] module whatever platform that you are [105] using that does invoices um will have [107] some way to list all of the invoices and [109] then just like pull them pull them all [111] out for you usually complete with [113] statuses now I'm trying to make this [114] video as general as seemingly possible [116] so I'm actually going to show you how to [117] do this using a Google sheet instead but [119] concept if you think about it and if [120] you're a make.com beginner this is the [122] exact same thing um you know when you [123] pull data from stripe or some API or [125] some third party service you're just [127] getting a list of basically uh rows with [130] a bunch of columns so for instance I'll [132] get uh uh you know one row with date [134] sent and that date sent will be equal to [136] this invoice number it'll be equal to [138] this company name equal to this doesn't [139] really change the fact that we're just [140] dealing with keys and values uh [142] regardless of how we're accessing the [143] data so let just show you guys a quick [145] example I'm going to pretend that we're [146] using stripe what we want is I'm just [149] going to type invoice uh and we want the [151] search invoices and you know stripe [154] specifically asks for customer ID [155] subscription ID status collection method [157] blah BL blah so uh for the purposes of [159] this I'm just going to select open as my [161] status just because that um means in [163] stripe speak that the invoice has yet to [165] be paid then I'm going to right click [167] and press run this module [169] only this is going to return me a 100 [174] strong list of invoices that are [175] currently open now I'm not going to [176] scroll down here because I have actual [178] customer information I'm not using a [179] sandbox or a test environment I'm [181] actually using my own business but as [183] you could see we're receiving a lot of [184] the same sort of information that we [186] were pulling from the Google sheet that [188] I showed you guys earlier we got like [189] invoice numbers uh you know account [191] names amount do we have uh I don't know [195] billing subscription uh created time [199] right which is similar to like the scent [200] date over here the point that I'm making [202] is this is just the same sort of data [204] stripe actually gives you way more [205] Fields than I include in my example [207] which would help you personalize your [208] email substantially more but you don't [210] need anything special in order to make [212] the system work the only requirement is [214] that you have some way to list your [216] invoices and if you think about it even [218] if you don't you could also just create [220] one you know instead of using stripe or [221] QuickBooks you just create a Google [222] sheet hypothetically any who with all [224] that out of the way let's actually go [226] through pulling our data from our Google [229] sheet [230] instead I'm just going to select my [232] account here which is Nick left click. [234] we're going to use the search rows [235] module then what I want is I want this [238] one called invoices [241] so there we [243] go sheet name is going to be sheet one [246] you get that information the bottom left [248] hand corner of the [249] screen table contains header sure I'm [252] going to leave this filter blank for now [253] but we are going to use it in a second [255] and then I'm going to leave limit blank [256] as well and then sometimes this little [258] red icon stays um simply because [261] make.com is a little buggy if you're as [262] fast as I am ha okay great and then I [265] ran this module and I got a bunch of [266] similar data date sent invoice number [268] company name right again this is just [270] the same thing that we got from stripe [272] just a little less detailed so cool we [275] have a list of invoices now the question [276] becomes what do we do with them well let [278] me run you through exactly how the [279] system is going to work conceptually [280] what we're going to do is every day so [284] every 24 hours early in the morning 7 [286] a.m. 7:30 something like that whenever [288] you think that your clients that have [290] yet to pay your freaking invoices are uh [292] online or most likely to respond this [295] scenario is going to run and what it's [296] going to do is it's going to check the [298] date that you sent that invoice and then [301] it's going to compare that to the [303] current date it's then going to subtract [305] the two and then we're just going to see [308] if the resulting number is like 7 Days [311] 14 days 21 days 28 days 35 days right [316] we're basically just going to check to [317] see if it's been a certain amount of [319] time since we sent that invoice and if [322] we have then we're going to send an [323] email sounds simple right as I mentioned [326] it is extraordinarily so so if you've [330] never worked with dates and times in [331] make.com before um I will show you how [334] this works as just a quick little [336] example [338] here but basically if you think about it [342] we have a column here called Date sent [344] right we also have the current date [346] which is October 23rd this looks to me [348] like it's September the 1st or something [349] like that so let me just run this [351] scenario and actually let me just set a [353] limit on the number of rows that I'm [355] going to return because I don't want to [356] burn through 5 million operations we'll [359] just do [360] five and basically what it's doing is [362] for every single row that is pulled [364] which right now is just the first the [366] the fifth it grabs that date and then it [369] inserts it in date sent what we need in [370] order to make this work like the way [372] that make.com handles date manipulation [374] and stuff if you guys remember from my [375] last video is uh you know we need to [377] convert this into a standardized format [379] so what we're going to have to do is [380] we're going to have to go parse date [382] basically and the way that we're going [383] to parse this is we're going to have to [384] use these little date time tokens you [386] see these y y y y mmdds we're basically [389] just going to to convert this date sent [391] into a datetime format by putting in the [394] equivalent so 20249 is y y [398] yy-mm-dd right it's like the 1st of [400] September [401] 2024 and now if I run this we actually [405] get the date in like a much more [407] sophisticated kind of a deeper format [408] here um that now says September 29th [411] 2024 11 p.m. and if we Mouse over this [413] you see there's this tiny little tool [415] tip that pops up that says 20249 d10 t06 [421] 00000000000000 Z that's make.com sort of [424] internal datetime format okay so now [427] that we've done this the question is um [429] how do we compare this to the current [430] dat like for instance it's currently [432] Wednesday October 23rd what we want to [433] do is we want to send an invoice if it's [435] been hypothetically seven days since [437] that last invoice has been sent right we [440] basically just want to follow up every [441] week well the simplest and easiest way [443] for us to do this is going to be do to [445] do a little bit of date time math if [446] you're unfamiliar with how date to time [448] math Works uh that's okay I'm going to [450] run you through it in this and we're not [451] actually going to use this module well [453] who knows maybe we will use this module [454] the whole time but basically what we [456] need to do is we need to subtract [458] now and then we need to subtract now [461] minus the date that we just calculated [463] back here I'm going to run this [466] again now what you end up getting is you [468] end up with this long number this number [471] represents the number of milliseconds [474] between the two dates and that's why [477] it's going up the further back in time [479] we go remember this first entry was [480] September the 1st this one is the [482] longest number because it's obviously [483] been the most days since September the [485] 1st this is September the 3rd so it's [487] smaller September like the 5th or 9th or [488] something the question is how do we [490] convert this into something that [491] actually matters to us um well there's a [493] very simple formula that I use because [495] this is in milliseconds all you have to [498] do is I'm going to add brackets around [502] this expression so that it evaluates [503] first before I do this next part but [506] we're going to divide this um you know [507] there are a th milliseconds in a second [509] right so if I do this and then I [511] run well now I have my answer in terms [514] of [515] seconds but I don't really want it in [517] terms of seconds hypothetic I just want [518] in terms of days that's the simplest way [519] so I'm going to divide this again how [521] many seconds are there in a minute there [522] are 60 seconds in a minute so now my [523] answer would be in minutes how many [525] minutes are there in an hour 60 how many [528] hours are there in a day 24 okay so now [531] if I run [532] this the answer is going to be the [534] number of days since that last entry so [538] uh as we see this invoice was sent 43.69 [541] days ago to be honest that's quite a [542] while ago I'm not really super um you [545] know I probably should have made this [546] sheet like the examples in the sheet [547] just start here in October but whatever [550] uh okay great so now that we have that [552] the last thing I'm going to want to do [553] is I'm just going to want to round this [554] because I don't like the point whatever [556] like I just want to do this on a daily [558] basis right so if I do this on a daily [559] basis you know maybe today I don't know [562] the math is going to work out so that [563] it's like going to be 7.3 it's not going [564] to equal 7even I just like ranting these [566] numbers for Simplicity and now this last [568] number will be 44 because 43.69 that's [571] going to round up to to 44 right okay [573] I'm going to go to the scenario editor [575] now and I'm going to say every day what [576] I'm going to do is we'll choose 7:30 [579] a.m. so now the scenario is going to run [581] every day once at 7:30 a.m. it's then [583] going to calculate the distance between [586] the number of days since the invoice was [588] sent and today let's see days since [592] invoice sent let's do [595] this and now that I have this now I can [597] proceed with the cool part of my flow [599] which is the actual sending of the [600] emails it's crazy how valuable a flow [602] like this is a single flow like this can [604] literally make you tens of thousands of [605] more dollars a year you'd be surprised [607] at how many invoices go unpaid [609] especially companies that do like net 30 [611] payment terms net 60 payment terms this [613] just eliminates the headache it does it [614] all autonomously for you so what what [616] I'm going to do here is I'm going to add [617] a router and then all I'm going to do is [619] I'll say condition date sent equal to oh [623] sorry actually we're not going to do [624] that there um I'm I'm going to add the [626] let's just do an email draft for now [628] because I'm I don't actually want to [629] send these emails but what I'm going to [631] do is I'll go here to this route between [633] the router and then the email module and [635] then I'll say 7even days so I'll say [637] date sent sorry days since invoice sent [641] then I'll go numeric [643] operator equal to seven if it's been [647] seven days and only if it's been seven [649] days we're going to proceed with this [650] route so I'm going to use this just as a [652] sole example [655] here I'm also going to just list all of [658] the uh values in my spreadsheet and I'm [661] just going to go to my spreadsheet and [662] just see if there's anything with 7day [664] distance okay so there's nothing because [666] it's talked the 23r I'm just going to [667] change this here so it says uh 16 so [671] this last one here should technically [672] you know equivocate or equal uh 7 days [675] which which will allow it to [677] run what I'm going to do here is I'm [679] going to go folder this is just a sort [681] of a way an unfortunate way that um the [684] created draft module works you have to [685] select a folder and if you want it to [688] pop up in your drafts you actually have [689] to go down and select drafts which is [690] annoying two I'm just going to go select [693] the email address here which was [695] hypothetical email it doesn't actually [697] exist uh I'm going to now just create [700] some copy variations because I'm going [702] to want every one of these emails to be [703] different and to seem a little bit [705] different uh to seem a little bit [706] personalized and customized so my first [708] title for my very first invoice fall [710] it's just going to be checking in I'm [712] just going to say something really [714] nice like hey [717] Michael hope you're doing well just [719] wanted to check in on the invoice I sent [723] over last week let me know if you had [727] any questions thanks [730] Nick now if you guys are not in the [733] service industry space you're watching [734] this video you're like H that seems like [736] a pretty basic email how is this going [738] to get us you know 5 10 15 $20,000 more [741] this year well a lot of the time [744] unfortunately um the reason why you [746] don't get your invoices paid on time is [747] either sheer chance or it's just like [749] neglect or naivity really um business [752] owners are extraordinarily busy and you [754] know if you don't push them to pay the [756] invoices when they said that they were [757] going to pay the invoices a lot of the [758] time they won't so this is going to be [760] our very first message it's going to be [762] super simple we're going to customize it [764] obviously um and then as we go on you [766] know we're not going to increase this [767] well we're going to increase the [768] severity a little bit we're going to [769] sort of put the pressure on a tiny bit [771] nothing super massive or super scary um [773] but enough that you know they know that [774] they owe us okay I'm going to click run [777] once it's not going to go through every [778] single one of these it's then going to [780] calculate obviously the number of days [782] since oh gez I guess because it's a [784] little bit late that one technically [786] evaluated to eight days so why don't we [787] go 17 here hypothetically we're going to [790] pretend that this invoice is sent on the [792] 17th okay now that I ran that as you see [795] we fed in 20 different rows but none of [798] them had the right number of days since [800] invoice sent so we actually only ended [802] up sending a single [804] email the email copy is hey Maria hope [806] you're doing well just wanted to check [807] in on the invoice I sent over last week [809] let me know if you had any questions [811] that should we [813] have I'm going to include this blueprint [815] down below as per usual if I go over [817] here to [820] drafts so you can see we actually have [823] that example right over here so looks [825] pretty harmless looks pretty nice [827] nothing super major and that's all right [829] now that we built out the logic for one [831] we can very easily build out the logic [832] for all of them as I mentioned [835] extraordinarily simple system that's [837] going to be our second that's going to [839] be our third that's going to be our [841] fourth you can really build as many of [843] these as you want you could do you could [844] do 10 if you wanted to and so actually [847] that's that's what I'm going to [848] do well I'm not going to do 10 but I'm [850] going to [851] do uh let's do [854] six if they don't pay me by the 42nd day [857] that I've followed up with them then [860] we'll worry [862] about [864] um you know taking this into our own [866] hands basically [869] sorry that was actually 21 days so we go [871] 21 here we'll go 28 [876] here we'll go 35 [879] here and now if you think about it [881] logically this just means that you only [882] ever need to do this once you literally [884] just make one scenario you write all of [886] these emails once and then you just hand [889] it off to your system to do for you um [891] there is one more component that you're [892] going to need to this you're going to [893] need a way to know when your invoice [894] status changes but uh yeah that's [896] basically all you need so let me [899] actually update this now um because [903] we're using a Google sheet we have [904] access to a special piece of [905] functionality called a filter and the [907] filter allows us to only pull records [909] that have a status overdue so I added [911] this because some invoice platforms do [913] this overdue stuff not all of them will [915] uh but some of them do if yours don't do [918] like overdue status specifically you may [919] have to figure this out in other ways [921] maybe there's like an invoice balance [923] total or something like that you know if [924] that equals zero um then odds are they [927] paid if that equals not zero then odds [928] are they haven't so I'm going to only [930] extract the overdue [932] ones and then let me just see has there [934] been anything okay anyway I'm pretty [936] sure there have been some at least at [938] some point but what I'm going to do now [940] is I'm just really quickly going to go [941] in and I'm going to write all the emails [942] and I'm not going to do this on camera [944] because I don't want this video to be [945] like an hour of me just doing [946] copyrighting but if you're interested in [948] downloading the scenario for yourself [949] all you have to do is just export or [951] sorry import the blueprint and you'll [953] have access to all of that copy all [954] right so invoice copy has now been [956] updated we have six fantastic invoice [959] templates ready to go let me show you [961] how this works in practice so I'm going [963] to pretend it is 7:30 in the morning [965] today um and I'm going to click this run [967] once and just look at how quickly and [969] easily anybody is followed up with when [972] they're at one of these 7-Day intervals [974] looks like we did three uh we did one at [976] 42 days another at 35 days and the last [980] was at 7 Days let's go to my drafts [982] let's just see what we got [984] here so we would have sent one to Lisa [987] that was the month [989] we would have sent one to Christopher [991] that was a month as well then we would [993] have sent one to Maria after exactly one [996] week all right so we're almost done this [998] system uh the system is a two-parter if [1001] you think about it because we have a [1002] data source or a data store um if you [1005] are using I don't know something like [1007] stripe for instance when you do the [1009] search rows or when you when you um [1011] search for the invoices it will [1012] automatically be updated the second that [1014] the customer pays it right so you're not [1016] actually going to run into this issue [1017] where you're going over and sending a [1019] follow-up to somebody that's already [1020] paid an invoice but in our case right [1021] we're going to be using Google Sheets [1023] since we're using Google Sheets to track [1024] this stuff all we need to do is [1026] basically when a new invoice payment [1028] comes in let's say through stripe or [1030] something like that we have to catch [1031] that invoice payment and we have to grab [1033] the email address of the row and then we [1035] need to go and update the status field [1037] from maybe overdue to paid or something [1039] like that the reason why this is going [1040] to work is because if you think back to [1041] our Google sheet initially this is only [1043] going to be pulling in records that have [1045] a status equal to overdue right so [1047] pretty straightforward stuff [1049] uh I'm going to very quickly template [1051] out what that might look like for [1059] you of course there are a variety of [1061] ways in which you can get that payment [1063] we might use Stripes watch events I [1065] might [1066] do an example here just called uh [1070] invoice payment received we're going to [1073] go down [1074] to payment intent and what we want is we [1077] want payment intent succeeder in stripe [1080] that just refers to the payment actually [1082] having gone through and when this [1084] happens right I mean this is a a watch [1085] events module but I'm just going to [1088] replace it for the purposes of [1089] demonstration with a set multiple [1090] variables module one of the rows is [1093] going to be called uh the uh well I [1096] guess that's just the receipt email what [1098] you're going to want to do actually [1099] you're probably going to get the [1100] customer ID which is over here and then [1102] from the customer ID you can use Stripes [1106] um get a customer or retrieve a customer [1109] which will then give you their email [1110] address I'm just going to presume that [1111] we already have their email address here [1113] let's hypothetically say that Maria is [1116] very prompt and she just did that we're [1119] going to watch events when the event [1120] comes in we're going to grab the email [1122] of that [1123] record and then we are going to go to [1125] our [1127] sheet uh first we're going to search [1132] rows what I'm going to do here is I'm [1135] just show you guys another way to update [1136] the spreadsheet in case you are unaware [1138] of to do so we just paste that in I type [1141] sheet one bada bing bada boom pretty [1144] fast right the row that I'm going to [1145] want to be checking is or the column is [1147] going to be F so I'm going to say f is [1149] equal to that email address Maria the [1152] reason why I'm doing this you guys will [1154] see in a [1155] second but if I were to run this and I [1158] were to pass mjackson infinity. example [1161] into this Google sheet filter it'll [1163] retrieve This Record but you'll also [1165] know that it retrieves something very [1166] special for us which is the row number [1168] by retrieving the row number we now have [1170] the ability to update a specific [1173] cell so I'm going to go update a cell [1176] and then going to do the same thing I'm [1178] going to enter this manually and then go [1180] sheet one the cell that I'm going to [1183] update if you think about this is always [1184] going to be [1186] H and then I'm going to put in the row [1189] number so [1190] h21 for for just a sanity check if we go [1193] to H we go down to 21 that row would [1196] return overdue and what we're doing is [1198] we're updating from overdue to [1200] paid so now if I just pretend I got the [1202] web hook what you'll see is that overdue [1205] will be paid which now means that the [1208] next time that I run my email scenario [1210] or the next time it runs by itself I [1212] should [1214] say this one right [1216] here it will no longer pull in Maria and [1219] just for a sanity check I'm going to do [1222] the rest you'll see that we pulled the [1224] bottom two rows but we didn't pull Maria [1226] if I check my emails again you know [1228] we'll see Maria was the one that I ran 5 [1230] minutes ago but there's there's no Maria [1231] now uh so yeah that is in [1234] and so yeah that is how you build easily [1238] the simplest invoice collection system [1240] possible in make.com but don't let its [1242] Simplicity fool you it is also [1243] extraordinarily powerful it blows my [1245] mind how many issues people have in [1248] business are due to simple Serendipity [1251] or simple uh very simple explanations [1254] like you know the person's just busy the [1255] person just forgot the person just [1257] doesn't have a top of mind and just just [1258] how much Roi you can get by focusing on [1260] eliminating these super low hanging [1261] fruit like you know making sure that [1263] your invoices are always top of mind for [1265] customers if you've done work for [1266] somebody you should definitely always [1268] make sure that you get paid for it it's [1269] one of the reasons why I think net 30 [1271] net 60 net 90 terms are so silly uh you [1273] know in the digital era there's no need [1275] for any of that waiting ideally you do [1277] the work you get paid immediately if you [1279] guys appreciated that video let me know [1280] down below if you have any questions [1282] about the system more than happy to [1283] answer them um as always I'm going to [1285] leave a blueprint in the description [1287] thank you very much for watching like [1288] comment subscribe do that fun stuff and [1289] I'll catch you on the next one cheers

Title: How I Made $102,514 Last Month With Automation (Copy Me)
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here so [1] title of the video I made [3] 10251 14 bucks the other month and I [6] wanted to give you guys a comprehensive [7] breakdown of exactly how I did it in [9] this video including a detailed [10] walkthrough of my stripe uh the strategy [12] I used to come up with the products and [14] the services that I sold I wanted to [15] give you guys a look into the daily [17] step-by-step actions you need to take to [19] actually make money like this which I [20] feel like a lot of people leave out uh [23] and I also want to talk about the [24] principles and the the the mindset [26] behind what I think is necessary in [28] order to make this amount of money [29] consistent before anybody accuses me of [31] being a trust fund kid my family was [32] bankrupt for the majority of my [34] childhood so I consider this video [36] basically my obligation to help give [38] back to kids that may be in a similar [39] situation to where I was growing up so [42] this is going to be a realistic look at [43] what it takes in order to make this [44] amount of money specifically in the [46] service agency and then the coaching [48] space if this sounds like something you [49] guys want to learn more about [50] potentially figure out how to do for [51] yourselves then stay tuned and let's get [53] into [56] it all right so the way this video is [58] going to work is I'm actually going to [59] give you guys like a line item by line [60] item breakdown of all of the various [62] Revenue sources that went into that [65] $2,514 I'm going to share my strategy [68] behind it the products and services that [70] I sell the various like deliverables [71] that I need to maintain on a daily [73] weekly or monthly basis in order to like [75] make that money um and basically you [77] guys are just going to get my unfiltered [78] thoughts on everything top to bottom so [80] the first thing I'm going to show you [80] guys is just my stripe um the reason why [82] is because in videos like this this is [83] what people expect to see at the [85] beginning uh as you can see I processed [87] 97,7 7860 [90] through stripe it was almost double when [91] I processed the previous period and this [93] is all from August the 1st to August the [95] 31st I have various Revenue spikes I now [98] have some Mr which uh was pretty new to [100] me because I wasn't processing a lot of [102] that stuff through stripe I have about [104] 200 new customers although keep in mind [106] that a lot of these are weight list uh [107] customers that aren't actually active [109] I'll get into that later same thing with [111] active and then new subscribers and [113] stuff like that so never in my life did [115] I think I would be almost seeing like a [116] sixf figure stripe amount on a monthly [118] basis and that kind of blows my mind but [120] let me break down exactly what went into [122] that money all right so my first big [123] Revenue Source here was my automation [124] agency which yielded me [127] $2,614 cents in the month of August if [129] you're unfamiliar with my automation [131] agency maybe you're new here um it's [133] called left click. and our whole pitch [135] is we build hands-off growth systems for [136] B2B Founders so we help you find the [138] perfect offer we help you automate your [140] lead acquisition and solve your project [142] management woses all while scaling your [143] B2B business to a figures um if you [145] click this button you will book an intro [147] call with yours truly uh you have to [149] fill out you know like a little form [150] here to run through some questions about [152] your business and that sort of thing and [154] now uh we also offer when I say we I say [157] that Loosely it's really just me and a [158] virtual assistant right now uh but we [160] offer um you know some standardized [163] retainer packages that you can actually [164] just purchase with a click so previously [166] you know I did call only now you can [168] just buy this um with just uh just one [170] click on a little stripe page so yeah uh [173] I'll run you through everything that you [174] guys need to know about this business [175] basically I set this up um I guess this [179] would be like 2022 now right around the [181] time that chat GPT came out the reason [183] why is because I noticed that well one [186] um I was running another business which [187] I'll show you guys the revenue for in a [189] second but I was running another [190] business that depended on people not [192] really knowing about chbt and not really [194] understanding AI so when AI came out [196] right when chaty BT hit the books and [198] everybody was like holy crap I can just [200] have ai write my now uh I was a [202] little bit lost and I was pretty scared [203] to be honest I was like oh Jesus like my [204] Competitive Edge is gone so me and my [206] business partner at the time we asked [208] ourselves Hey listen you know if our [210] current business is declining because of [211] AI is there any business that would take [213] off because of AI and this is the first [215] one that came to mind it was helping [216] people Implement um Automation and AI [218] flows into their businesses to help them [220] like increase their leverage right fire [222] their staff members that sort of thing I [224] don't say that because I'm evil like I [225] don't want people to fire their staff [226] members as I have so commonly been [228] accused of um but you know this is a big [231] thing that most business owners are [232] thinking about how do I get rid of Staff [233] replace them with robots at a tenth of [235] the price right so anyway I started out [237] doing most of my lead sourcing through [239] um upwork primarily uh the reason why is [241] because that was just the simplest [242] upwork is like the simplest and most [244] straightforward place to go to if you [245] have no established portfolio no real [247] history um I had sort of a unique [249] approach because I would record a [251] customized video of me solving the [253] problem that they listed on their [254] proposal I usually take me like three to [256] five minutes and then I just give them [258] the whole video and sometimes I'd even [259] give them the system that they asked for [261] in The Proposal obviously this [262] assassinated me being really good at [264] automation systems which I consider [265] myself to be you know one of the [266] foremost experts on a particular [268] software platform which is called [270] make.com um but that that crushed it I [272] did really really well on upwork in just [274] a couple of months and yeah that helped [276] me build like a lot of foundational I [278] want to say client management knowledge [279] in the space so that's my recommendation [281] anybody that is in automation agencies [283] or wants to you know learn how to do [284] this sort of thing uh the number one [286] most important thing for you is just to [287] get some clients under your belt the [288] second that you understand like the real [291] scope of one or two projects you are so [293] much further ahead than everybody else [295] that's just spinning their wheels [296] thinking about how to build the perfect [298] business any who um um after that I [301] looked into cold email because I was [302] using that quite heavily for my content [304] business which I'll again get into in a [306] second and uh I ran a number of offers [308] that didn't really work they didn't [309] really make any money um until I found [312] one that did that was specifically [313] selling the same system I was using to [315] sell them so I was selling them on a [317] cold email system using cold email uh [320] and from there my Revenue was able to [321] scale all the way up to about $722,000 a [324] month a little bit over um and that's [326] where I peaked and immediately after [327] that I started thinking about other ways [329] that I could scale my income even [330] further which is what sort of takes me [332] to today with YouTube and stuff like [333] that so if I break this down into actual [336] services that I provide here's more or [338] less what it looks like the first thing [339] I provide is Consulting so I'll provide [341] both one-off Consulting and then I'll do [342] Consulting as part of my monthly [344] retainers and what I mean by Consulting [346] is you know a business owner will come [348] to me with a problem and the problem to [349] be honest the vast majority of the time [351] is I'm not getting enough business I [352] don't have enough leads I don't have [353] enough throughput through my Pipeline [356] and then they just ask me Nick what [357] would you do in my shoes how do you [358] think you would solve it and so as you [360] can imagine um this has got to be one of [362] the most interesting careers that you [364] know you could possibly pick I'm not [365] meaning like you know what's it like de [368] uh deoe you know I'm not I'm not talking [370] about that kind of consulting which I [371] think is just super unnecessary and [373] Bloated most of the time uh where people [375] just hire Consultants to justify some [377] managerial decision I'm talking about [378] like real boots on the ground Consulting [380] of like a small to midsize business like [381] how do I go from $50,000 a month to [383] $100,000 a month Nick what would you do [385] it's got to be one of the most [386] interesting things in the world so I [388] will you know ask them everything about [390] their business I'll learn whatever I can [392] I will often times create documents or [394] resources like road maps or step-by [397] steps or Sops or simple systems that [400] I've seen work really well at the other [401] businesses that I've consulted with um [404] and you know in that way I basically [405] become stronger every time that I get a [407] new client because I learn you know [408] either a new vertical or a new problem [410] set or a new limiting belief on behalf [413] of my client and that sort of thing so [415] Consulting is pretty awesome I'm a big [416] fan of it um it's probably one of my [418] favorite parts of the job I'm sure you [419] guys could tell but I really like [420] talking I will never shut the up [423] I'm kidding um so that's that the second [426] thing I do is I do one-off automation [427] projects so um when I say one-off [429] automation projects I mean like I will [431] build out systems using this platform [433] make.com for companies and this is like [436] primarily the the first few months of of [438] my automation agency where this is [440] mostly what I was doing so you know [442] somebody would be like hey Nick I want a [443] system that scrapes a web page or [445] something and then uh I don't know helps [447] me update some database and I would [449] build out a scraper that would scrape [450] the web page maybe every day or every [452] week or something like that then it [454] would send a request to some server [455] which would catch it then upload it to [457] the database pretty simple stuff um this [459] is a simple four module system that I'm [460] just using internally for my own [461] business it runs once an hour scrapes [463] the member count of my community make [465] money with make.com and then cues up a [467] message but yeah as I'm sure you can [469] imagine these can grow more or less [470] arbitrarily complex now the issue with [472] one-off automation projects just before [474] I continue is well there are two uh the [477] first issue is you're treated as a [478] builder [480] not like a strategy person or like a [482] partner like when you do one-off [484] automation products most of the time [485] people sort of already know what they [487] want from you and then they just give [488] the project to you and they're like hey [489] I just want somebody that can do it [491] basically like I've already done the [493] blueprint I just want you know a pair of [494] hands to go out there and actually build [496] it out um and this is okay and you can [498] still make a ton of money with it right [499] like I I made a ton of money doing [500] one-off automation projects nothing [501] wrong with it whatsoever um at one point [504] my hourly rate went from like before it [506] was maybe like 100 bucks an hour to all [507] the way up like 400 bucks an hour just [509] building like a couple systems dragging [511] and dropping modules across the screen [512] it's incredible but like if you really [515] want to unlock actual leverage you can't [518] just be a builder forever you need to [519] scale past the building and you need to [521] scale into like strategy and like [524] partnership and so one-off automation [526] projects make that really difficult [528] that's problem number one problem number [529] two is the cost per acquisition on one [531] of these one-off automation projects can [532] be pretty high like if a one-off [534] automation projects for a cold email [535] system which is something that I very [537] commonly build it's like I don't know [538] $2,000 or something like that if the [540] cost per acquisition for that is $200 [542] then I'm basically giving up 10% of the [544] project every time I win one right so [546] I'm only ever making 90% on that project [549] um you know this is just sort of how it [551] is these are Big projects these several [552] thousand dollars worth so typically you [554] need to pay a little bit more in order [555] to acquire so I thought long and hard [557] about how I was going to beat this and [558] what I and my business partner ended up [560] coming up with was uh was monthly [562] retainers it's not like we [563] revolutionized you know consulting or [565] anything or the automation agency space [567] retainers are obviously well known as a [568] business model but but if you think [570] about it monthly retainers allow you to [571] go from being just some guy that builds [573] to like actually taking that step [575] towards being a partner or being a [577] consultant or a strategist because [579] instead of somebody just handing you [580] something and saying okay now do it you [581] say hey what are your goals your goals [583] are this okay over the next few months [585] here's how we can get there we can build [587] this system we could build that system [588] we could build that system and then they [589] start trusting you a lot more obviously [591] it becomes substantially easier to [592] upsell your services and you also get [594] pretty sticky because if you think about [595] it like your fingers are sort of in [596] every pot right like if you're on a [598] monthly retainer or you're probably [599] building out systems for their crms [601] you're building out systems for their [602] project management systems uh PMS you're [604] building out uh systems for like I don't [607] know their onboarding right their email [609] you have access to everything right A [610] lot of the time people don't really want [611] to let you go because they're just like [612] well that guy that guy kind of runs my [613] whole business so this is where my [616] monthly retainer option comes in and [617] this is where um I started selling these [619] like fractional coo packages that were [622] anywhere from like $4,400 a month to [625] right now where there $6,900 a month so [627] I have a pretty strong retainer base and [629] this is is just one of the reasons why I [630] feel honestly pretty good on like a [633] day-to-day or week- toe basis I'm never [634] like concerned about my money because I [636] know that like no matter what as long as [637] I continue doing good service for these [639] customers um I'm I'm good uh in terms of [642] my actual like day-to-day service for [643] monthly retainers um I do a weekly call [646] so it's like a consulting or strategy [648] call in the strategy call I will cover [650] everything that I've done in the last [651] week then I'll cover uh sometimes I'll [653] cover like current news if it's industry [655] relevant um and then I'll cover like [657] proposed systems for the next week and [659] then a lot of the time this just ends up [660] being like me helping them solve hot [662] button problems as well with my [663] Consulting knowledge as I mentioned [665] earlier so that's part of the the [666] monthly retainer um in the past I [668] offered like an hourly package so I [670] might do something that equates to about [672] 100 bucks an hour so maybe you buy 40 [674] hours and then you get sorry you buy you [676] spend $4,000 you get about 40 hours or [678] so um I move I've moved away from that [680] just because I don't really like my [682] value Being Framed in terms of hours I [684] much prefer my value Being Framed just [686] in terms of like my business [687] relationship there's that old adash with [689] the Plumber where like the plumber will [691] I don't know like come to some woman's [693] house and then he'll make one knock and [694] then it'll fix the woman's pipes and [696] he'll be like that'll be 500 bucks and [697] she's really pissed off at him because [698] she's like you just spent 5 Seconds why [700] am I paying you 500 bucks for 5 seconds [702] obviously the moral of the story is [703] you're not paying me for the 5 Seconds [704] you're paying me for the years it took [705] me to get to the point where I could [707] solve your problem in 5 seconds uh so [710] yeah I don't really like framing my [712] services in terms of hours anymore but [714] I'm not going to lie to you guys it's [716] the easiest way to get started with an [718] automation agency and if you get started [719] with a monthly retainer if like you work [721] with somebody on an hourly basis to [723] start it's so easy to transition to a [725] monthly retainer because you say well [726] listen I'll give you a discount on the [728] $50 an hour and now you only pay me 40 [730] but then you just got to buy like you [732] know 50 hours prepay or something like [734] that uh so yeah that's uh that's more or [736] less it in a nutshell there three [737] services Consulting oneof Automation and [739] the monthly retainers the second Revenue [740] source that contributed to the $12,000 [742] was my content Agency 1 second copy [744] which yielded [747] $2,296 now if you're unfamiliar with my [749] cont content agency this is our website [751] uh we essentially do books blogs and [753] magazine articles for I mean like [755] agencies uh mostly SAS companies fintech [757] companies at this point I would say um [759] and the way that we do this is we [761] operate like an internal like content [763] pipeline in clickup that uh will assign [766] work to people as necessary template out [769] tasks and then the writers will use [770] artificial intelligence to help sort of [772] bootstrap themselves right a little bit [774] faster and better and really like the [776] value prop here is we do an Arbitrage on [779] like usually the projects that we get we [781] charge a flat uh per word rate on so we [783] will charge like n cents a word right [785] nine or 10 cents or something like that [787] I I'm not even really involved in the [788] day-to-day management anymore so I have [789] to check okay so eight cents a word now [793] I think most of them is probably nine [794] cents a word um so we'll charge N9 cents [797] a word right so somebody wants a [798] thousand-word article then that's 90 [800] bucks um but then the way that most [802] other agencies will do it is they will [804] hire writers and then pay them a [805] fraction of that and they'll say well we [807] charge 9 cents a word we're going to pay [808] our writers 5 cents a word then we're [810] going to make 4 cents a word right um [812] and that seems pretty cool but the real [813] trick to one second copy was when we [815] moved away from paying writers on a perw [817] basis and we move towards paying them on [819] an hourly basis instead hourly payments [822] for payroll like if you run um any sort [824] of business that has staff or or [826] contractors or whatnot uh a lot of [828] people consider that dangerous because [830] you know products can quickly go over [831] scope but if you're smart about how you [834] train your staff and if you implement [836] systems that allow projects to or Force [839] projects to be UND scope constantly [841] sorry under uh under budget constantly [844] um then you avoid that and you can [845] usually make multiples on what you would [847] have paid a contractor for a fixed price [848] job if that all sounds like magic to you [851] let me just put it this way um for that [853] $90 article if we paid our writers you [856] know $50 for that we would have made $40 [859] right as opposed to that if we instead [861] just paid one writer at $15 an hour and [863] it took them two hours to do the job [865] then it's only costing us 30 bucks and [867] then we make 60 bucks instead of 40 [868] bucks so it's basically 1.5x the profit [871] so the second that we started [872] implementing this we brought in [873] artificial intelligence obviously and [875] that made our writers write even faster [876] and even better and so we were able to [878] like you know basically just make [879] multiples and multiples on this hourly [881] rate uh to fixed price differential and [884] I think that was really the key to this [885] business it wasn't even my idea it was [886] my business partner's idea who was [887] brilliant at like process um management [890] and Sops and that sort of thing so in [892] terms of services the biggest one is [893] obviously content writing and that's [894] sort of like top dog we also do like SEO [897] optimization sometimes people will give [898] us articles that have been written by [899] other people or articles that have been [901] written by Ai and then we'll just turn [902] that into an SEO optimized article now [904] the biggest like point of value sort of [906] like how this business Works under the [908] hood is through a pretty complicated [910] pipeline that we built out forever ago [912] so that is not page that I wanted to [914] show you guys there you go um basically [916] the way this works is this is a pipeline [917] built in clickup that automatically [919] assigns incoming tasks to writers based [922] off of a templating system so you'll [923] come in and then I don't know you'll go [926] over here and then you'll make a new [928] task and you'll just call it [931] like uh left click I guess we don't have [936] anything for left click one second to [937] copy so you have anything for that um [941] nordvpn okay cool maybe we'll do [943] something for like nordvpn or something [944] like that when you give this button a [946] click what it'll do is it'll actually go [947] and it'll template a bunch of tasks um [950] with like the client tone of voice the [951] client uh I don't know like the the the [954] style guide the brief and all that stuff [956] um so it's a pretty autonomous system we [958] also have an app now [960] which unfortunately was not working very [962] well in the month of August at all we [963] had to do a ton of refunds sorry I think [965] it's like app. one second copy right [968] yeah there you go uh where you you sign [970] into to your app and then instead of you [973] having to do this sort of thing through [974] like uh instead of us having to do this [976] manually we'll just click this add [978] content button you as a client will [980] share whatever piece you want with us or [981] whatever brief and then it'll [983] automatically be added into our pipeline [984] for us which is obviously a lot more [985] preferable because we have no management [987] costs we have no issues you provide the [989] same style brief every time you know [991] it's a lot simpler um I'm not going to [992] lie this is a massive pain in my ass to [994] build uh I would not consider myself a [996] super fantastic developer or anything [997] like that uh this probably took me like [999] several weeks of just I don't know face [1002] down constantly smashing my head against [1005] the keyboard trying to make this work I [1006] don't even remember what I built this in [1008] it's probably NEX or nujs or [1010] something yeah it was n which uh I mean [1013] I love n it's really cool but man it was [1014] that a pain in the ass I did not know [1016] how to develop a full stack app until [1018] that point in time I used a bunch of [1019] like really hacky workarounds which I [1021] would not recommend um so you know [1023] looking back it was great to have an app [1024] and the app was making up a sizable [1026] portion of our Revenue at one point but [1027] realistically that that wasn't really [1029] the juice um the juice was the pipeline [1031] which is you know totally manageable [1032] through people uh but yeah so we started [1035] out this business primarily through um [1037] upwork again uh I want to say like [1040] probably more than half of our initial [1041] Revenue came from upwork for the first [1043] few months and then we branched out into [1044] providing um sample articles to people [1047] using artificial intellig for the most [1049] part this was way before most people [1051] knew that artificial intelligence was [1052] capable of writing pieces so obviously [1054] we had a ton of perceived leverage there [1055] we would say Hey you know do you want [1057] like an article written by an [1058] award-winning journalist that's been [1060] published in all these fantastic places [1061] we'll give you one for free and if you [1063] like the quality then we can talk about [1064] working together further and if you [1066] think about it like back in 2021 nobody [1068] knew what chat GPT was GPT 4 wasn't even [1071] a thing right people were like oh wow [1072] that's like that's actually pretty [1074] intense okay sure give me one and we'd [1076] ask for a keyword we'd ask for a title [1077] they'd give it to us and then we just [1079] pump that straight through [1080] gpt3 make a couple of edits obviously we [1083] had humans in the loop and then we'd uh [1085] we'd send that back and the reactions [1087] that we were getting from that marginal [1088] cost which is like I don't know five [1089] bucks a sample were crazy we had I don't [1092] know I think it was over like a 10% [1093] response rate on our cold emails and we [1095] were sending them on Mass using a [1096] platform called [1097] outreach.io I don't know if [1100] outreach.io is still like the main no I [1102] don't think this is like a a good or the [1105] best cold email platform nowadays I [1106] think you probably do much better if [1108] you're using something instantly or [1110] smartly but at the time yeah Outreach [1112] was pretty sick and the really cool part [1114] here was we built out a system that [1116] would um take as input an email reply so [1119] every time somebody replied to one of [1120] our emails we would categorize that [1122] email and then if it was a sample [1124] article so if they said yeah I want to [1126] do the sample here's the keyword we [1127] would automatically take that instantly [1129] and then assign it to a writer in the [1131] queue using artificial intelligence and [1132] this was like years before anybody else [1134] is doing any of this which you know [1135] we're pretty proud of because we [1137] basically like built the building block [1138] that now people do on a daily basis um I [1141] mean that's like a feature that tons of [1142] these cold email platforms now provide [1144] and charge a fair amount of money for so [1146] yeah it was like basically completely [1147] autonomous completely hands off for [1149] quite a while and that email system [1150] allowed us to scale to $90,000 a month [1152] where we peaked um as you can see now [1154] you know we are a far cry from that but [1156] it's just part and parcel um I saw the [1158] writing on the wall for this business [1159] quite a while ago and it's not [1161] necessarily that I don't believe that [1162] this business can still grow I just [1164] think that um you know per unit time [1167] invested in terms of my effort it'll [1169] grow less than the other things that I'm [1171] now building all right Revenue Source [1173] number three is school it generated me [1176] 6,968 25 in the month of August so this [1180] is obviously the biggest Revenue Source [1182] it's also the new kit on the Block [1184] product that I launched and I'm going to [1186] get deep into the strategy behind this [1188] I'm going get deep into how I you know [1189] operate and manage my product and really [1191] just give you guys a behind the scenes [1192] of what operating you know 60,000 or [1194] almost $61,000 a month School looks like [1196] so if you're unfamiliar with school it's [1197] a community building program um [1199] communities are actually relatively new [1201] business model I don't want to say [1202] they're new but they've been popularized [1204] quite recently um and schools probably [1206] like the largest community provider [1207] right now just because Alex horoi who is [1210] also a very big um guy in like the [1212] service agency and the coaching space [1214] recently invested a fair amount of money [1215] into it although I believe it was [1216] initially originally built by Sam ovens [1219] who um exited consulting.com a few years [1221] ago too so obviously a lot of Heavy [1223] Hitters here and they banking on [1224] communities being a big thing um I think [1226] when they you know showed a bunch of [1228] interest and they started launching bu [1229] of these promotional things school as a [1230] concept in community is a concept blew [1232] up even more but basically the main [1234] value proposition of a community well I [1236] guess there are a couple but one of the [1237] main value propositions is it's like a [1239] group of entrepreneurs for the most part [1241] that are working on the exact same thing [1242] as you that share resources share wins [1245] and share losses openly so instead of [1247] you just having to blindly search you [1249] know through the solution space of how [1250] to grow one of your one of your [1251] companies whether it's an agency or [1253] photography business or whatever they're [1254] all sorts of communities you get to [1256] leverage other people's wins other [1257] people's failures and then usually like [1259] a course or program Creator like myself [1261] will compile a bunch of resource and [1262] just centralize everything for you so [1265] you know that's one of the value props [1266] of this community um I set it up because [1269] way back in March right after I launched [1271] my YouTube channel it started growing a [1272] little bit I started having a bunch [1274] people being like hey Nick I think you'd [1275] be perfect for a community have you [1277] considered launching community and I was [1278] like the hell's a community man I didn't [1279] even know so I had to start doing a [1281] little bit of research and then I looked [1283] into what went into building the [1284] community and I was like man that [1285] sounds like a ton of work you know have [1287] to manage this thing every day I have to [1289] it's like it's like turbo Reddit or [1290] something for making money I was like it [1292] sounds cool but I don't know I'm just [1293] going to stick to my YouTube videos so I [1295] kept doing that for like another month [1296] and then April came by and I had a bunch [1298] of other projects for my um for my [1299] automation agency that took up a fair [1301] amount of my time and then may came by [1305] and somewhere around miday or whatever I [1306] think the number of comments I was [1307] getting per YouTube video like if I got [1309] 10 comments per YouTube video because I [1311] was much smaller back then like five of [1313] them would be hey Nick are you gonna [1314] make that freaking Community or what so [1315] I was like geeez well I guess I have [1317] market demand for it but I don't know [1319] like I I don't know if I can really do a [1320] good job on this to be honest and as [1322] you'll see doubt is a pretty major part [1324] of what enabled me to make the 100K um [1328] but uh yeah you know I ended up like [1329] going and joining a few other people's [1331] School communities I ended up just like [1332] looking and seeing what the main value [1334] propositions were there and I noticed [1335] that the vast majority of the people [1336] that had school communities they didn't [1338] really get the value of these things I [1340] think they didn't really conceptualize [1342] the value in in in the way that people [1344] would would understand like if I go to [1346] this about page here [1349] like there are a few value props right [1351] but the simplest value prop is you get a [1353] bunch of templates you know they're the [1355] best templates they save you tens of [1357] thousands of dollars they save you [1358] hundreds of hours you just copy and [1360] paste these templates in your system [1361] you'll get what like the best and the [1362] brightest in the space you're doing I [1364] saw that very very infrequently um [1367] weekly office hours nobody was offering [1369] something like this where it was like [1370] Hey you know once a week you're going to [1371] get all the information that you need or [1372] you're going to get like a personal [1373] private QA with me so I added that um [1376] courses right so I think some people [1378] were offering courses at the time but I [1380] like to think that my course was of [1381] substantially higher quality than most [1382] other communities and then you know the [1384] last value prop was the networking with [1386] a group of ambitious people in your [1387] space one thing that I noticed that a [1389] lot of these communities did wrong is [1390] they just like didn't really moderate [1392] and I I think they kind of LED through [1393] like I don't really know what I want to [1395] call it um and I'm mindful of my words [1397] here but there's a lot of ego involved [1399] in like the making money process I want [1401] to say or like the owning your own [1402] business and it almost contributed to [1404] this culture of I don't know it wasn't [1406] like fear or anything but it was like [1408] this culture of you not being open to [1411] sharing what's going on in your business [1413] so I solved this by making my community [1416] cap really low I said that I'd cap it at [1418] 400 members it would never go a single [1420] person above 400 the reason why it's [1421] 4001 here is I just have like an admin [1423] in the course that's you know help or [1425] the community that's helping me moderate [1426] it but you know when it's a much smaller [1428] nit Community obviously people feel a [1430] lot more comfortable sharing I also uh [1433] just shared like I probably over shared [1435] a lot of my own life what was going on [1437] with me um I think the way that I wrote [1439] all the messages and all the copy made [1440] it clear that like yo this isn't like [1441] some I don't know some Finance bro [1443] Community where it's like everybody [1445] here's tough and we're all big boys you [1447] know uh I I wanted to make sure that [1449] anybody could join I wanted to make sure [1450] that anybody that joined felt [1452] comfortable just talking about what's [1453] going on in their business sharing it [1454] without fear that like they're adding [1456] competitors or whatever and yeah you [1458] know I think I to be honest I think I [1460] did a really good job there are [1461] obviously some benefits to that as well [1463] um you know I was able to upsell my [1465] coaching here so for instance you can [1467] get one-on W uh video consultations with [1470] me you know 15 minutes 295 30 minutes [1473] 500 60 Minutes 870 and people started [1475] taking me up on this when I started [1476] using my community as like the mid-level [1479] funnel and then I Pro started providing [1480] discounts to members of the community [1481] which helped incentivize that um there [1484] obviously other benefits as well if you [1485] think about this in terms of like [1486] broader business infrastructure one [1487] thing that I didn't realize when I [1488] started this coaching space is there are [1489] multiple levels to the stuff so you know [1492] like the bottom level you're usually [1493] looking to turn people that have never [1495] really you know won a client or don't [1497] really know what they're doing in [1498] business and turn them into the sort of [1500] person that runs a business and then [1501] sort of like at the second level is [1503] you're turning somebody that runs a [1504] business into somebody that like crushes [1505] it at business somebody that makes [1507] hundreds of thousands of dollars a month [1508] for instance um and so you know I [1511] miscalibrated a little bit because I [1513] made a general purpose community that [1514] just solved everybody's problem and [1515] everybody's complaint uh but you know [1517] obviously it still ended up being hyper [1519] profitable especially because this Niche [1521] is just growing as quickly as it is too [1523] so what's been really interesting for me [1525] over the course of the last few months [1526] is is my Revenue has transitioned from [1527] primary early agencies Right Where I Was [1530] capping out at 72,000 to now the bulk of [1533] my income coming from school like my [1535] agency income um in August was7 [1538] something thousand and my school income [1540] was $60,000 it's about 1.5 times as much [1543] and seeing the transition there from [1546] primarily like providing services to [1547] people with some outcome to helping [1551] people like grow their own businesses [1554] has probably been the most fulfilling [1555] thing that I've ever done to date so [1557] that's impretty sick I really like it um [1560] in terms of the actual services that I [1562] provide as part of uh makemoney withth [1564] make.com and my other community now [1565] which called maker school which um I [1567] think is more granular targeted to that [1569] uh new entrepreneur sort of audience I [1572] provide daily QA so literally every day [1575] I will come on here and then I will [1577] scroll through and then I will open [1579] every single notification that I get and [1581] then I will try and answer every single [1583] one that I can um sometimes I can't [1586] answer every single one because [1587] sometimes the C the questions that I get [1589] are like pretty intense like people want [1591] me to I don't know solve like a business [1594] problem that like would create a system [1596] that they could sell for $3,000 or [1598] something sometimes I do it anyway just [1599] because it's like good practice for me [1601] and I always like to keep my skills [1602] sharp um because there's just so many [1604] different Industries these guys work [1605] with like some work with e-commerce [1606] businesses which I don't work with other [1608] people work with uh like security [1610] businesses Healthcare businesses uh but [1612] for the most part I will go through and [1613] answer as many of these as I can usually [1615] in like a couple of hours and then [1616] assuming that I answer all of these [1617] questions um then you know I kind of [1619] leave it for the day and then the next [1621] day I'll I'll go on I'll just repeat the [1622] process um that's the very first thing [1625] that I do which is probably like one of [1627] the more valuable things I'm being [1628] honest just the daily QA accountability [1629] and that sort of thing the second thing [1631] is I'll do loom roasts so I'll go on the [1634] community let me just look up roast and [1637] I have a couple of different um threads [1639] here one's called a roast your agency so [1641] what happens is somebody will post their [1643] Agency on this website sorry on this um [1646] link and then I will go through it all [1647] and record a pretty detailed video just [1649] giving them my detailed [1651] thoughts while clearly not having a [1653] shirt on um over Loom as I you know [1656] break down the agency break down what I [1657] would do break down why I think they can [1659] improve their copy or something like [1660] that and I think the real point of value [1662] here is most people do not have anybody [1664] in their life that's just willing to [1665] give some to them straight like [1667] most people are going to send their [1668] first website off to their friends be [1670] like go guys I'm building an agency what [1671] do you guys think and the guys that are [1674] receiving that they're your friends and [1675] they don't want to hurt your feelings [1677] obviously and they also have a vested [1678] interest in maintaining the Friendship [1680] so most of the time they're going to be [1681] like dude that looks great nice job keep [1684] going right but I'm not like that I just [1686] tell people earnestly what I think um [1688] and I've offended a fair number of [1689] people if I'm being honest I remember [1692] one time I roasted a guys agency then he [1694] quit the community like within five [1695] minutes of me delivering that rust so [1698] whatever but the main value prop here is [1700] you know I'm just I'm just going to tell [1701] you exactly what I think about this all [1702] the time because I don't really have a [1704] vested interest in like being your [1705] friend or anything like that I obviously [1707] would like to be your friend if Poss [1708] possible and I think I'm a lot of [1709] people's friends now but you know the [1711] the whole point of this is for me to [1712] give you exactly what you need to grow [1714] and most of the time people want to get [1716] where I'm at right so uh they take my [1718] opinion as gospel probably like 70 80% [1720] of the time I want to say and it hits a [1722] lot harder when it's from somebody that [1723] you look up to um which enables them to [1725] make the changes faster than you know [1727] waiting a year or something for the [1728] market to have to show it to them [1729] instead so I do upwork roasts I'll roast [1732] people's upper profile I'll do agency [1734] roasts so I roast people's [1736] agencies um I do copy roast so people [1739] will send me like cold email campaigns [1740] that aren't performing well or that [1741] might be performing well and they'll be [1743] like Nick what would you do to make it [1744] better and this usually takes up like [1745] another half hour or so of my day um so [1748] you know at this point we're maybe at [1749] like an hour and a half or something [1750] like that maybe two hours I want to say [1753] then every Wednesday at 9:00 a.m. Mt [1755] I'll do a weekly office hour and this is [1757] definitely the key point of value for a [1758] lot of people in the group um when we [1760] started our turnout was a lot higher [1762] than it is now I think our very first [1764] turnout was like 70 or 80 or [1766] something and basically way that it [1768] works is people will go over here and [1770] then they'll ask me [1772] questions oh sorry that's the recording [1774] one [1775] sec let's [1779] do this one here so people will ask me a [1782] ten of questions so you know hey um is [1784] there any pre-work data prep you do to [1786] create new automations is it beneficial [1788] to create separate YouTube playlist for [1790] different niches what's the best way to [1791] go about doing market research right [1793] I'll just take those questions live and [1794] then I'll just answer all of them on my [1796] on my video call um just for [1798] organizational purposes I'll usually [1799] mute everybody on the call and then I'll [1801] just like make it so that we can't see [1803] their faces or them picking their noses [1804] or something um and then I'll just [1807] screen share and then run through the [1808] questions question by question and then [1809] at the end um I have a little space open [1812] where I think it's 15 minutes of the [1814] hourlong call if you are unable to ask a [1817] question ahead of time in the weekly [1819] office hour thread you can actually just [1820] come straight to the zoom and just ask [1821] your question directly and I'll answer [1822] it so a lot of people find a ton of [1824] value in this um I think that this is [1826] probably one of the more valuable parts [1827] of the community it's obviously one of [1828] the parts that takes a lot of you know [1830] my time and preparation I don't just [1831] spend the hour on the video I'll [1833] actually like do a little bit of prep [1834] work ahead of time maybe like half an [1836] hour or so just walking through my head [1838] hm like is this the best way that I [1840] could answer this question I don't just [1841] want to do it off the top of my head [1843] because sometimes I don't know to be [1844] completely honest another point of value [1846] here and another thing that I have to do [1847] is I have to make programs so um I say [1850] 14-day agency here and maker School 14 [1852] day agency was my first iteration of [1853] this which later transformed into maker [1855] school but essentially if you go to [1857] classroom in tool you'll see that there [1859] are a bunch of these modules that you [1860] can choose so the weekly office hour [1862] recordings you know we record every [1863] weekly office hour for instance and [1864] posted here but more importantly we have [1867] the blueprint library and stuff like [1868] that more importantly um we have these [1870] courses or these programs and so here's [1872] a program right here called 14 days to [1874] build your agency this is my first [1875] program and what I do is I put a bunch [1878] of information like in text and then [1880] I'll also record um like a video usually [1882] a very very long video walking people [1884] through how to do everything that they [1886] need to do in order to build out their [1887] automation agency so you know the idea [1890] is this just multiplies my leverage a [1891] little bit so that I no longer have to [1893] be um present all of the time I don't [1895] actually have to physically be on a call [1896] on that Weekly office hour in order for [1898] people to like continue making progress [1899] and moving forward and then the idea is [1901] they do this right maybe they do like [1903] one two three a week or something like [1904] that and then if they have a question [1906] about it then they ask me in the weekly [1907] office hour I solve that question I [1909] solve their problem and then they can [1910] come back and like continue making [1911] progress so a lot of people made uh a [1914] lot of agencies with this program after [1916] I built this program I was think about a [1918] better way to do it because I noticed [1919] that the number one issue was just the [1920] accountability and I ended up settling [1922] on a new structure called maker school [1924] which is basically like a daily [1925] accountability program where I will [1927] actually go through and then I will walk [1930] people through like everything that they [1932] need to do on a daily basis I'll say Hey [1935] you know on day one do this and then do [1937] that on day two do this and then do that [1939] I'll show them everything that they need [1940] to do in like a little loom video um so [1942] in terms of the production Val is pretty [1943] straightforward for you to make for me [1945] to make I did have like lock myself in [1946] my room for like a week but you know is [1948] what it is um and now that's offering a [1950] ton of value and what I've done since [1951] then is I actually made a new community [1953] called maker school and maker School [1956] actually just surpassed uh make money [1958] with make.com in terms of number of [1959] members but basically maker school just [1961] like takes that one program and then [1963] just makes that like I I charge [1965] specifically just for that program and I [1967] charge a much lower amount on a monthly [1968] basis than what I'm doing for uh [1970] makemoney withth make.com yeah I realize [1972] I'm rambling on a little bit but um [1974] that's another point of value next one's [1975] called Fireside Chats so I work with [1977] with one of my automation Partners his [1979] name is Santi santi's awesome I love [1981] this guy and he's taken it upon himself [1983] to build out um after somebody in the [1986] community asked for it like a fireside [1990] chat sort of like Q&A session where we [1993] take people from our community that are [1995] really good at stuff like this guy Carl [1996] here who you know was running a $100,000 [1999] a month PPC agency and then they will [2002] come on and then basically do their own [2003] weekly office hour with a QA session as [2005] well so we have had all sorts of people [2008] in here we've had people in automation [2010] we've had people in paperclick ads we've [2011] had people that have been consultants [2012] for decades we've had people that have [2014] built out SAS companies using make.com [2016] and that's another really big point of [2017] value and what I really like about this [2019] too is if you think about it from my [2021] perspective the rest of this community [2022] stuff like it's pretty bottlenecked on [2024] me right it's it's based around my time [2026] it's based around my personality and [2027] whatnot obviously people like me a lot [2029] which is why they're in my community but [2031] this is the first thing that I built [2032] within one of my structures that is not [2035] actually dependent on me like I'll show [2036] up and I'll try and motivate people and [2038] encourage them and you know thankk them [2040] profusely for for doing one of these fir [2042] side chats but I didn't actually deliver [2043] the presentation it's not actually me [2045] and so in this way I'm slowly increasing [2047] the amount of Leverage in this community [2048] which I think is pretty cool and I'm [2050] open to even expanding fireside chat so [2052] maybe we have like two per week or [2053] something like that uh I'm just [2054] currently waiting for a little more [2055] demand the key thing that worked really [2057] well with this community was this member [2059] cap of 400 um you know I know a lot of [2062] other communities out there have been [2063] launched by people in the automation [2064] space and they're typically uncapped and [2065] so they grow pretty explosively if I'm [2067] being honest uh that's cool but with [2070] this community I really wanted to keep [2071] that tight-knit feel and I also like the [2073] idea of a cohort of people that start [2074] off as sort of beginners and then over [2076] over several months become better and [2077] better and better and that's actually [2079] what happened we've had a number of [2080] people that have come in and they've [2081] been making like $2,000 a month and you [2083] know now they're making 20 30 $40,000 a [2086] month so it's crazy seeing that [2087] Evolution for one if you think about it [2089] strategically from my perspective I'm [2090] also sort of ensuring myself customers [2092] for future products that I build by [2093] doing this because you know these people [2095] that have made this massive progress if [2097] I were to launch let's say a higher [2098] ticket product that might be I don't [2100] know like 10,000 bucks a month or [2101] something like that and it's just like [2102] unfettered access to me five calls a [2104] week you know I answer all the questions [2105] I help you build out the systems I over [2107] theh shoulder consult whatever the [2109] coaching setup is um you know the [2112] equation in people's minds is well when [2114] I paid Nick 20 bucks a month he [2115] delivered $2,000 a month worth of value [2118] when I paid him $1,000 a month he [2119] delivered $20,000 a month worth of value [2122] or $200,000 a month I bet you if I pay [2124] him 10K he'll deliver me $2 million a [2126] month worth of value or something like [2127] that right and obviously this is all um [2131] uh prefaced upon the notion that I can [2133] actually deliver that value but uh I got [2136] to say like when I started this I [2137] definitely doubted my coaching abilities [2139] a little bit I mean it was the first [2141] time that I'd done coaching not [2142] Consulting but over the course of the [2144] last few months I've become [2145] substantially more confident in it I've [2146] definitely realized just how valuable [2148] having somebody like me look over your [2150] shoulder you know like clap you on the [2152] back every time you win or guide you to [2154] the correct answer if you make a mistake [2157] really is so after putting in this 400 [2161] member cap though um obviously if you [2163] think about it from my perspective like [2164] I'm not making as much money because I [2166] can't grow past 400 members so I did two [2168] things in order to make more money with [2169] this community the first is I started [2171] increasing the prices so instead of it [2172] being like I think we started at 28 or [2174] $38 or something um instead of just [2177] keeping it at that every 10 or 20 or 30 [2180] members or maybe 40 members back then I [2182] would increase the price by I believe [2184] $10 and so it ended up capping at $128 a [2186] month so1 28 time 40 right that's uh I [2189] don't know about 50,000 but not all of [2192] these members are paying the $128 a [2194] month most of them are somewhere between [2196] probably the average like 98 or [2197] something like that but after I got this [2200] you'll notice this big red notification [2202] has been staring me in the face for you [2204] know the last 45 minutes there are [2206] currently 452 other people that want to [2208] get into this community um if I were [2210] just to let them all in and then they [2212] all paid $128 or whatever obviously [2214] that' you know bump up my Revenue by [2215] another 100 Grand which is pretty [2217] awesome right but then I would also be [2219] kind of destroying my credibility a [2220] little bit and then I would also be [2221] defeating the whole purpose of this [2222] community so I like to think that the [2225] decisions that I'm making here are [2226] principled they enable me to provide [2229] one-on-one support to all the people [2230] that are currently in I'm not just [2232] running like a cash grab and just [2233] looking to let as many people in as [2235] possible to like squeeze it for a few [2237] months and get the hell out like you [2238] know I think some other people might be [2240] but the benefit to this um just to bring [2242] it all around is you know when you have [2244] 752 people that want to get into your [2245] community like it's very impractical [2247] that of them are actually going to be [2248] able to make it in right I mean our turn [2250] is really low um I think it's like one [2252] every couple days realistically so I [2254] mean that's like 15 20 people a month [2256] something like that if that so you know [2259] how many months would it take to get [2260] through 750 people like 30 seven or [2264] something like that which is three years [2266] it's not very practical for a lot of [2267] these people to get in but every now and [2269] then there'll be somebody that you know [2270] is pretty well establishing business [2272] that wants to get in regardless and they [2273] were like Nick how much money do you [2275] want me to pay you to let me in right [2277] and I was thinking about it from a [2278] strategic perspective so what I ended up [2280] doing was I created I should preface [2282] this with the fact that um there's no [2284] way for school to automatically handle [2287] weight lists or there wasn't when I came [2289] up with this so I actually had [2291] to make my own system called makemoney [2294] withm make.com with my own little [2295] landing page that actually took um [2298] instead of monthly payments annual [2299] payments and the idea was if you pay [2301] annually I'm going to bump you to the [2302] front of the weit list the average [2304] annual weit time was something like [2307] let's see here well now it's only uh 3 [2310] days I need to update this it's no [2311] longer 3 days I think it's like 4 days [2313] or something like that but essentially [2316] um you know this now represented a way [2318] where I could price differentiate and [2320] people that wanted to pay me a ton more [2321] money like 12 times the money at least [2323] in the first month or 11 times the money [2326] or something like that could now do it [2328] and I could substantially improve my [2330] short-term Revenue which is awesome [2332] obviously one of the biggest um problems [2334] with communities as well is churn and so [2336] this helps mitigate a lot of as well [2337] which is valuable to me so yeah another [2341] thing is I find people that pay the [2342] annual plan are also substantially more [2344] committed they're a lot more engaged [2347] they're obviously a lot I don't want to [2349] say they're a lot more ambitious out of [2350] necessity because you know they just [2351] tend to have more money for sure but [2354] they they do tend to be more ambitious [2355] as well which is quite nice and then [2357] from there you know they end up winning [2358] disproportionately more and then they [2360] get a bigger return on their investment [2362] and then other people in the group are [2363] like oh how the hell would that guy do [2364] it and it's like that guy paid annually [2365] H right and then it sort of starts [2367] flywheel which is quite beneficial from [2368] my perspective all right my next big [2370] Revenue Source well big is a relative [2372] term uh but my next Revenue Source was [2374] gumroad for [2376] $1,613 48 so gumroad is just a platform [2379] where um you can basically host digital [2382] products and then have those digital [2384] products managed for you and then sold [2386] or something so this is my gumroad for [2388] that month of August and the vast [2390] majority of my income came from a few [2393] blueprints that I put up basically the [2395] way this works is like if you go to any [2396] one of my YouTube videos they'll be like [2398] a gumroad [2399] link and I think uh I don't even [2402] remember where this gumroad link is I'm [2404] just trying to like get the link [2406] directly in my browser but I'm just [2408] going to click here instead so let's [2410] just sort this based off [2411] Revenue oh I think that'll be [2414] descending yeah basically way that it [2416] works is after I'm done with a video um [2418] I come up with uh usually like a [2420] blueprint or something or some sort of [2421] lead magnet and then I will add that to [2424] my YouTube description just as a link [2426] and then by me doing this [2427] um I'm basically showing people like hey [2430] you know I'm giving you all this stuff [2430] for free just click this link and then [2432] you'll download it but then what's [2434] really interesting and I think when I [2436] really realized that I had like product [2438] brand fit or something or or brand [2440] Market fit was I uh I made it free and [2443] then I said you could get this for free [2445] you don't have to pay anything um you [2447] can also donate if you want to and then [2449] you know people have now donated over [2450] $1,000 for this I think in just the last [2453] few months which is pretty crazy $690 [2455] for that one $224 for that one right um [2459] so it's a lot of these people just [2460] opting in to paying me money which is [2461] pretty cool um and that makes me feel [2463] freaking amazing because I'm like wow I [2464] must be offering a disproportion amount [2465] of value for people to do that the [2467] reason why I came up with this is [2469] because um the way that I was doing [2471] blueprints before was simply inefficient [2473] I didn't actually think that I was going [2474] to make any money off this but like you [2475] know some people make $1,600 a month and [2477] that's their whole income and I get to [2478] make that basically completely passively [2480] through gumroad or just sick yeah [2482] previously you had to download um [2483] blueprints through like a a Google Drive [2486] Link or something and it was just really [2488] impractical and you could see all the [2489] Json and all the code so all I did was I [2491] moved to gumroad because I thought it'd [2492] be a better experience for other people [2494] not necessarily because I thought that [2495] there was some Grand strategy that would [2496] enable me to make more money all right [2498] um the next source of Revenue was [2501] YouTube ads which made me $1 [2504] 17239 in August so yeah YouTube ads are [2507] obviously pretty awesome um I will say [2510] my YouTube Revenue has tanked recently [2513] the reason why is because well I think [2515] the reason why is because I tried [2516] updating all of my YouTube videos at [2518] once and I went through like 70 videos [2521] and just like all tabbed super quickly [2524] and I think what happened is I like [2524] loaded a ton of ads something like that [2527] and then me loading that ton of ads like [2529] crushed me um H I don't know why that [2533] says [2534] 846 oh hold on so it's not that I [2536] generated 846 in August it's that the [2539] payout from I bet you this is what [2541] happened the payout from uh July [2545] probably hit right yeah okay so pay to [2547] July hit and you can actually see when [2548] the revenue tanked right I was making [2550] $114 a day on YouTube ads which is you [2552] know over 3,000 bucks a month then all [2554] of a sudden they call it [2557] their content warning or something [2560] invalid traffic warning I don't know um [2563] I'm not going to speak ill about YouTube [2565] since obviously they built my whole [2566] business but I definitely did not have [2568] any invalid traffic there guys uh any [2571] who so yeah YouTube ads made me $1,723 [2573] 195 um the reason I'm I'm making that [2576] money is obviously because I my videos [2577] that just means that I show ads so if [2579] you're watching this with an ad blocker [2580] thank you you probably helped me make a [2582] few sense in just the last couple of [2583] minutes um I very much appreciate it and [2587] yeah I sort of tested between monetizing [2590] my videos and then not and what I found [2591] was really interesting was I think [2593] YouTube was boosting monetized videos or [2595] something because the videos that I [2596] monetized actually ended up with [2597] slightly more views than videos that I [2599] didn't monetize not entirely sure why I [2601] don't know if you call this a corrupt [2603] practice if you want they're obviously [2604] just getting their bag but for me it was [2606] even less about about the monetization [2608] aspect and it was just more about me [2609] getting the views and getting the reach [2612] um so I'm obviously happy to make $1,700 [2613] a month through YouTube no issues there [2615] my last Revenue source for the month of [2617] August was affiliate Revenue which made [2618] me [2629] [Music] [2637] partner stack um impact or something and [2640] then some of them pay out 30 days other [2642] ones pay out like 60 days and I think [2644] like companies can come up their own [2645] freaking payout procedures so it's [2646] actually this is very difficult for me [2647] to calculate the [2649] 9379 but this comes from platforms like [2651] instantly um appify uh make.com Phantom [2655] Buster right these all have affiliate uh [2658] links that I now include in my YouTube [2659] descriptions and I also include as part [2661] of my community signups so when somebody [2663] comes into my community particularly my [2664] lowest ticket Community maker school you [2666] know they don't really know what they're [2667] doing for the most part so they're going [2668] to sign up to whatever software platform [2670] I put in front of them as long as I make [2671] sure that it's affordable and it's high [2673] quality um and so that's what I've done [2675] I basically built it like an onboarding [2676] flow where people will sign up to my [2677] affiliate platform and then I get a [2679] little chunk of that money every single [2680] month so obviously very cool and I like [2683] it all right so now that we finished [2684] with the whole financial breakdown I [2686] just want to talk about a couple of [2687] principles um particularly principles [2689] and then maybe some mindset because this [2692] is probably my favorite part of YouTube [2694] videos that I used to watch that did [2695] stuff like this where people would just [2697] so I go through the revenue and break it [2698] down as I'm sure you guys could tell I'm [2700] not like the typical YouTuber and so far [2702] that I don't really make everything [2703] super polished and you know probably [2705] hasn't been as uh pound-for-pound as [2707] efficient TimeWise as some other videos [2710] but that's actually one of the one of [2711] the principles that I want to talk about [2712] so I'm just going to run through guys [2713] I'm going to run you guys through my own [2715] mindset here and you know what I think [2717] has enabled me to hit like a sixf fig [2719] monthly Revenue the first is not to fear [2721] doubt but to embrace it what I mean by [2724] this is okay the month of August for [2726] instance I had no idea that offering [2728] annual memberships was going to work I [2729] was actually really scared I was on a [2731] walk with a really good friend of mine [2732] just a at a park here in Calgary and I [2735] was like man I have this massive problem [2736] where all these people are on the wait [2737] list and there's just no way they're [2738] going to get in and he's like well you [2740] know some of these people are probably [2742] willing to pay you whatever it takes to [2743] get in because that's just the value [2744] that they ascribe to you that they [2746] assign to you so you should find a way [2748] to you know um you should find a way to [2750] like offer different payment tiers that [2751] product differentiate that allow you to [2752] do that and I was so hung up on that I [2754] waited like two weeks and I was like [2756]  should I do this can I do this I [2758] was really worried honestly I think that [2760] a lot of the time people on YouTube or [2762] people that make these large seemingly [2764] large amounts of money for a lot of us [2766] uh definitely a lot amount of money for [2768] me you know they they seem like they [2770] sort of have it all figured out right [2771] and it's like oh that guy is just super [2773] mega confident and he understands [2775] everything strategically and he has like [2776] a 700 step plan or program and sometimes [2779] this is true sometimes you have these [2780] like genius masterminds that make these [2782] giant ass plans and they somehow [2784] actually work um but I think in reality [2786] that typically does not happen that [2787] definitely did not happen in my case [2788] basically what occurs is I heavily doubt [2791] myself and I think that by doubting [2793] myself and my abilities I actually end [2795] up producing a slightly higher quality [2797] product than if I did not doubt myself [2798] entirely so you can call this a pursuit [2801] of perfectionism or you can call this [2803] like a desire to do really well by your [2804] clients or Goodwill or whatever the hell [2807] but in my case every time that I've just [2808] embraced the doubt and I've said I [2811] really don't know if this is going to [2812] work it I'm going to do it anyway [2814] the results tend to be substantially [2816] better than I think if I had just like [2817] went ahead with either the status quo or [2819] if I had been super confident this going [2821] to work um ahead of time I know that [2824] Elon Musk talks a lot about this and I [2825] think elon's become quite the [2826] controversial figure recently but um you [2828] know I don't think that changes anything [2830] to do with the business that he's done [2832] in the past he talks a lot about doubt [2834] and how everybody always thinks that you [2836] know entrepreneurs are necessarily super [2837] crazy and confident and cool and they [2839] have it all figured out but like he's [2841] actually always scared and uh I think [2843] about that a little bit as well I [2844] wouldn't say scared is the right term [2845] but there's definitely just this big [2847] field of uncertainty in front of me most [2849] of the time when it comes to business [2850] and every time that I've just stepped [2852] through that uncertainty regardless I've [2853] usually made some big uh Revelation or [2856] broken some big Plateau so anytime that [2858] you feel yourself pushing in a direction [2859] of uncertainty there's this old stoic [2862] aphorism that says the obstacle is the [2863] way if that's the obstacle and if you [2865] sense an obstacle you should probably [2867] just go there anyway it's almost like a [2869] signpost saying hey man this is where [2871] success lies the second thing I want to [2873] talk about is just focus on Revenue [2874] generating activities there are so many [2876] activities that I was doing on a daily [2878] basis that were not Revenue generating [2880] like I want to say the vast majority of [2881] the activities that I was partaking in [2883] up until maybe seven months ago well [2886] maybe seven months ago isn't the right [2888] term maybe like a year ago we're not [2890] Revenue generating [2891] activities you know I would still make a [2893] fair amount of money because I was [2894] focused on a lot of activities and some [2897] of them happen to pan out [2898] disproportionately but ever since I [2900] started like restricting my scope to [2902] maybe top three top four top five daily [2904] actions which usually involves either [2906] some type of daily Outreach some type of [2908] content creation some type of sales call [2910] some type of getting on the you know [2912] getting on the phone with your clients [2913] or something of that nature um my [2915] revenue and my profit have both [2917] skyrocketed so you know as a key part of [2919] maker school um I get everybody to focus [2921] on daily revenue generating activities [2923] I've actually like restricted the number [2925] of things that you can do on a daily [2926] basis I've purposely slowed the program [2929] down and I say like okay all you do [2931] today is you apply to 10 jobs on this [2933] platform you you know uh create three [2935] cold email campaign offers and then you [2938] you know make a a piece of content on [2940] this community for instance um I I [2942] artificially restrict these because I [2944] want people never to get overwhelmed [2947] with all of the various pieces of [2948]  involved in being a business [2950] owner and an entrepreneur I only want [2952] them to focus on things that are like [2953] disproportionately Revenue generating [2955] like you know Outreach sales content [2957] creation that sort of thing so if I [2958] could offer you one piece of advice this [2960] would definitely be it ever since I [2961] started focusing on Revenue generating [2962] activities like my hourly rate has shot [2964] way the hell out the last thing is just [2965] to talk openly about what you're you're [2966] doing I'm obviously a little biased here [2968] but again just like every time I've [2970] stepped through that wall of Doubt I've [2971] succeeded every time that I just talked [2973] openly about where I'm at whether it's [2975] like my Revenue whether it's my [2976] uncertainty about the future whether [2978] it's about my strategy whether it's [2979] about my plans I've always succeeded [2981] more because of it so you can also think [2983] about this video as me being kind of a [2984] little bit biased right I know that [2986] every time in the past I've talked [2987] openly about what I'm doing I succeed [2988] more so I'm like H maybe I should start [2990] talking openly about what I'm doing [2991] again maybe I'll succeed more I don't [2993] think this is going to directly drive me [2994] money but I think this just builds a c [2996] cure of Goodwill it builds a culture of [2998] positivity builds a strong culture of [3000] reputation and you'd be very surprised [3002] at just how many people out there on the [3003] internet have fat stacks and they're [3005] willing to pay somebody that they like [3007] trust and respect that's it for me if [3009] you guys have made it to the end of this [3010] video y'all are freaking Troopers I love [3012] every last one you thanks so much for [3013] watching if you have any comments or [3015] questions just

Title: Make.com: Dates & Times Masterclass
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here and [1] in this video I'm going to show you [2] everything you need to know about dates [4] and times in make.com I'm going to teach [6] you how to parse dates format dates add [9] and subtract dates do funky math with [11] them I'm going to run you through how [12] make.com handles and represents dates [14] under the hoods literally everything you [16] need to know about dates and times is [18] going to be in this video so if you [20] struggle with dates and times and [21] make.com before or you just want to [23] brush up your skills and this is the [25] video for you let's get into it [27] [Music] [30] so here's a brief outline of everything [32] that you are going to learn in this [33] video first I'm going to teach you [35] everything you need to know about Unix [37] time it's a standardized datetime format [39] developed in the 1970s and it's one of [41] the ways that make.com deals with dates [44] I'm also going to show you how make.com [46] represents dates under the hood I'm [47] going to show you the differences [48] between their various string and [50] datetime formatting options I'm then [53] going to teach you how to parse dates [54] I'm going to teach you how to format [55] dates and then I'm going to show you how [57] to add and subtract dates which is a [59] point of contention for many people and [61] something that I personally struggle [62] with for a while then I'm going to run [64] you through every single date time [65] function on the platform so you know how [68] to manipulate dates add seconds subtract [71] hours and more or less everything you [73] need to know about it and then last but [75] not least I'm going to show you guys a [76] real example where I am sending [78] follow-up emails based on some date [80] manipulations just to round it out and [82] make sure that you guys got all the [84] knowledge that you need in order to get [85] out there and make money with it so [86] without further Ado let's start with the [88] very first which is Unix time so I'm not [91] going to give you like a super crazy [92] deep dive into Unix time all you need to [94] know is the following in believe it was [97] 1969 or maybe 1970 uh computers were [100] gaining a lot of popularity in [101] industrial applications people were [103] using them in various factories they [104] were using them to do like accounting [106] and stuff like that and a problem that [108] started happening more and more [109] frequently was that you know different [112] computers represented dates in different [113] ways it was difficult basically for them [115] to communicate um dates and times and [118] that sort of thing so in 1970 I guess a [121] Consortium or a big group of people [123] basically got together and just decided [124] on a standardized way to represent dates [127] moving forward and the way that they [128] picked it was the number of seconds that [130] have passed since January the 1st 1970 [134] so what I have open here is UNIX Tim [136] stamp.com this is just a very simple and [140] easy accessible resource to learn a [142] little bit more about Unix time and then [144] to see how many seconds has basically [145] elapsed since that date as you see we [147] are currently at uh 1 [151] b729 M [153] 53123 seconds since January the 1st 1970 [156] in my current time zone that's [159] 11201 um the really cool part about [162] representing dates and seconds is that's [163] basically just all you need in order to [165] do anything like if we know that it's [166] been 1 [167] b729 million actually let me do the math [170] 17295 [172] 31221 right if we know that this is how [174] many seconds have elapsed since January [176] the 1st 1970 we can technically use it [178] to recreate like any date that we need [181] right for instance um this is the number [182] of seconds but what if we wanted to get [184] the number of minutes hypothetically [185] well there are 60 seconds in a minute [187] right so if you just divide the total [188] number of seconds by 60 then you get the [190] number of minutes that have elapsed [192] likewise there are 60 minutes in an hour [194] right so if you divide that by 60 well [196] now you know how many hours have elapsed [198] since that date if you divide that by 24 [201] you know how many days have elapsed and [202] if you divide that by 365 you get 54 [206] years which again my math ain't so good [208] but it's 2024 that's you know second [211] since January the 1st 1970 1970 plus 54 [214] is 2024 so uh yeah you know I'm sure you [217] guys are starting to appreciate it [219] already but just by representing [220] everything in seconds there's a lot that [222] we can do and by having this be the [224] standardized way that all computers [227] around the world understand time or [229] maybe not necessarily all computers [230] around the world but just having this be [231] a standardized way that we can [232] communicate about times makes it a lot [234] easier to do things like manipulate [236] dates add subtract dates obviously get [239] the right times zones and so on and so [241] forth so that's just a little bit about [242] Unix time um I'm not going to go any [244] deeper than this because we don't [245] actually have to learn more about Unix [247] time in order to understand what's going [248] on in make.com under the hood all right [250] now let's look into some practical [252] examples let me run you through what all [253] this looks like in make.com so I have a [256] scenario open here called dates inm [257] make.com pretty simple um I have this [260] little default variable picker what I'm [262] going to go uh and do up here is I'm [264] going to go to the top here click tools [266] and then what I'm going to use just for [267] the purposes of this video is to set [268] variable modules this enables us to set [270] a variable then return it super easily [272] I'm going to call this date example I'm [275] using capital or sorry camel case here [277] formatting which is where I have [279] lowercase first word in the variable [281] name and then uppercase everything else [282] so date example for YouTube for instance [284] would look like this um you could name [287] this differently if you wanted to I just [289] find that this is um simpler for me when [291] I just you know oh it's snowing uh this [294] is simplest for me when I pick like one [295] format and just stick to it so yeah [297] we're going to call this date example um [299] and then in terms of the variable value [300] what I'm going to do here is I'm going [302] to scroll over to our calendar or date [305] and time model and I'm just going to [308] walk you guys through what this looks [309] like what all of this stuff means to [311] start now I've recorded a few videos on [314] all of the functions in make.com where I [316] chatted about a few of these Loosely in [318] this video I'm going to go into way more [319] depth so you're going to understand how [320] all of this stuff works under the hood [321] you're also going to understand some of [322] the more contradictory ways that [323] make.com represent states which is quite [325] unfortunate because I think that it does [327] not need to be this difficult but it's [328] sort of how it is so we're going to [330] figure it out anyway at the top of this [332] picker you have a calendar this calendar [334] should be pretty self-explanatory right [336] it's currently representing October 2024 [338] it's October 2024 uh right now so the [341] recording of this video so I can go back [343] in time here I can go to uh the month [347] picker and I can also go forward in time [350] to [352] 2025 at the bottom leftand corner of [355] this little calendar we have the current [357] date button so we can go to today if I [360] give this a click you'll see that it [361] just highlighted the 21st which is the [363] current date and then when I clicked it [366] it populated the variable value window [368] with the current date and time you [370] notice that this says 10:40 a.m. that's [372] just because the time zone of my [374] make.com instance is 1 hour West so it [377] is in Vancouver where I'm currently in [379] Calgary Alberta is 1 hour after so my [381] computer says 1140 this one says 1040 is [384] what it is no big deal um but anyway [387] what happens is when I give this a click [389] um basically it takes the current date [391] and time which as we know is always [393] represented is a Unix timestamp and then [395] it converts that into a string that's [397] sort of human readable and the human [398] readable format always looks like this [400] it's uh four digits for the year so year [402] year year year then there's a dash then [405] there is the month which in this case is [407] 10 right October is the 10th month of [409] the year then another Dash and then the [411] number of days so we're the 21st day of [414] October in 2024 this is a datetime [417] format that not all of us may be [419] familiar I know like Americans for [420] instance represent dates typically [422] differently to uh I don't know Europeans [424] who I think might represent dates [426] differently to Canadians and that sort [427] of thing after that we have the number [430] of hours and then the number of minutes [432] and there's a space and then it's am or [434] p.m I don't know if make.com represents [436] us differently if you're on an EU server [437] to be honest um like I am European sort [440] of by Blood so like if it were 2:41 p.m. [443] you know like mentally I'm representing [444] this is [446] 1441 but you know uh make.com may just [448] do this because because the vast [450] majority of the users of this platform [451] are probably American um or they might [454] just be you know localizing this to [456] whatever way I'm most comfortable or [457] familiar with so if yours looks a little [459] bit different point I'm making is don't [460] worry too much about it okay great um [463] there's also this little picker down [464] here that allows you to select the time [466] so you can scroll through times as well [468] which is quite handy as I'm sure you can [470] imagine you can also scroll through [472] hours and that sort of thing but I'll be [474] real uh in practice I rarely use this [476] calendar I almost always manipulate [478] dates based off of the current time [479] stamp or today uh it just makes the math [482] that I'm going to show you guys in a few [483] minutes much much [485] easier next up we have some variables [487] there's a timestamp variable and then [489] there's a now variable so if I click on [490] this timestamp variable should be pretty [492] self-explanatory but this is the Unix [493] timestamp right so if I give this a [495] click and then I run this module we just [497] got 1 b729 [500] m5325 195 if I were to take this back to [503] my Unix timestamp page convert this this [506] is well it's going to say a few seconds [508] ago technically but yeah shows us the [510] the current date in their own format [512] right notice how this format looks [514] different from make.com format this one [515] has Monday in front of it this one uses [517] strings like October 21st 2024 U [520] make.com has its own format um but you [523] know it's interoperable with most other [524] platforms which is quite nice any who [526] the point of making is you know you can [527] kind of imagine how the Unix timestamp [529] is like the center of everything and [531] then every other website and platform [533] they have their own way of representing [534] the data um but everything starts with [536] Unix timestamp so if you understand that [537] you'll understand how computers [538] represent data [541] okay there's also another variable here [543] called now and this one's pretty [544] misunderstood if I click okay run this [546] module what I see is I see a human [549] readable date which is October 21st 2024 [552] 1044 and this is how make.com will [554] represent it when I run it but actually [557] and this is the really sneaky annoying [558] part this is actually being represented [561] differently under the hood and the only [563] way that you could see this is if you [564] Mouse over it and then allow your little [566] um tool tip to pop up notice how when I [569] Mouse over this if you see in tiny text [571] there it says 202 24-10 D21 t17 [575] 44061 n9z this is another uh time date [581] time format that make.com uses in order [583] to represent dates and this is actually [584] what's being populated when you click [586] the Now button make.com when you run a [588] module just converts this into a more [590] friendly version for us which is October [592] 21st 2024 10:44 a.m. so uh technically [596] we have three daytime formats that [598] make.com is using changeably which is [600] super annoying we have the time stamp [601] right which was that 1 b729 million [604] thing then we have strings actually I [606] guess four then we have a string the [608] first string that I showed you said 2024 [611] d10 D21 space 1046 whatever a.m the [615] third is when you instantiate or run a [618] variable that includes the now which is [620] October 21st 2024 1044 a.m. and then the [623] fourth is sort of like what's actually [625] you know the way that it's actually [626] being represented which is 202 24-10 D21 [629] t P [630] 17446 your logical question at this [632] point is Nick what the does any of [634] this mean why are there so many damn [635] different ways that they're representing [636] the dates and I wish I could tell you I [638] do not have a concise and simple answer [640] maybe one of the make.com devs will [642] watch this video and get angry at me and [643] be like well there's a logical reason [645] but I personally don't think that there [646] are there is so what I do is I just use [650] uh I just use one of them and I just [651] learn that one and I just use that all [653] the time and it makes all of the math [655] behind make.com a lot easier for me when [658] I'm subtracting dates adding dates and [659] that sort of [660] thing okay so that's how the now works [663] let's head on back to this calendar [665] before I just give myself an aneurism [667] looking at all these things you'll see [669] there also a bunch of functions add [670] seconds add minutes add hours add days [672] add months add years set seconds set [674] minutes set hours set days set date set [676] month set year format date and parse [678] date I'm going to run through every [679] single one of these we're actually going [680] to perform some examples with them later [682] on in this video but for now I just want [683] to show you format date and then parse [685] date because these are the two that I [686] tend to use the most often so we're [688] going to start with par State um the [690] reason why is because par state allows [692] us to take a string and then turn that [694] string into the make.com actual [698] representation of the date time so if [700] you look underneath these examples here [702] you'll see that you know the very first [703] one says parse State [706] 2016-12-28 and then if you parse it um [709] it is evaluated as [711] 2016-12-28 t00 [715] 00000000000000 Z the way that this whole [718] datetime string thing works is um that [720] first part is obviously the date right [722] and then the t is where the time starts [724] and they represent the time in hours and [725] then minutes and then seconds and then I [727] believe the z00 z0000 Z is milliseconds [731] um this is the way that we're going to [732] convert dates into a standardized format [735] that is later going to allow us to do [736] math with them okay so what do I mean by [739] math well uh let's learn a little bit [741] about how to manipulate and Par and [743] format add and subtract if I were to [745] click on 22 then I were to go minus [750] then I were to go 21 here okay this is [753] string a this is string B if you think [756] about it logically what you should get [758] as a result of this is you should get a [760] distance of about one day right because [761] this was on the 22nd and then this one's [763] on the 21st logically whatever the [765] distance is it should evaluate to one [767] day when you run this though what you'll [769] find is that it is empty the reason it's [772] empty is because what you're doing right [773] now is you're you're basically saying [774] one string minus another string and [776] there's just no like internal [777] representation there's no way for to do [779] math on strings so what you need to do [781] is you need to convert both of these [782] into a format that make.com understands [785] so first of all let me just uh run [787] tomorrow okay I run tomorrow I get the [790] string tomorrow that's pretty simple [792] let's pass this through a parse date [794] function just wrote parse State and then [796] a little um curly bracket smooth rounded [799] bracket then automatically opens up this [801] variable picker then I go a right smooth [803] bracket over here and I just you know [804] bound the date by these if I run these [808] now what I'm getting if I Mouse over [811] this is I get that same datetime format [814] that we talked about earlier now that [815] it's in this make.com datetime format we [818] can actually do math with it so parse [820] date this minus parse date and then [825] where was the calendar here uh yesterday [828] or today I guess now if I run this [831] you'll see that we actually get a number [834] as opposed to nothing okay this took me [837] many months to understand I never touch [840] dates and times in make.com because I [842] just couldn't get why sometimes I would [844] get a variable and then other times I [846] would get an empty value other times I [847] get a number nothing would ever makes [849] sense but this is how it's done you need [851] to parse the dates into a standardized [853] format which make the common Fort [855] doesn't show you and then you can start [856] manipulating and then you can start [857] doing math so um what you'll notice is [862] you have uh hold on a second 1 2 3 1 2 3 [867] 86,400 th000 well probably think is well [870] we're doing all this math in seconds [871] right so this is probably the number of [872] seconds this is not the number of [873] seconds unfortunately another [875] complicating factor is when you do math [877] like this make.com Returns the answer [879] not in seconds but in milliseconds so if [882] we were to do a little bit of math here [884] this is the number of milliseconds [887] between tomorrow and today we pick the [891] exact number of minutes right 10:46 a.m. [894] so the result should be like a nice [896] round number basically representing the [898] number of the number of milliseconds U [900] if we do the math here 86 [904] 400,000 uh if we do the math here there [907] are 1,000 milliseconds in a second right [909] so what we're really working with is [910] 86,400 seconds if we then divide the [913] number of seconds in a minute which is [915] 60 and then the number of minutes in an [916] hour which is 60 and then we divide that [918] by uh the number of hours in a day which [920] is 24 you end up with one right so [923] basically the result [924] here is in milliseconds but because it's [927] in milliseconds you can do a little bit [929] of smart math you convert this into [930] whatever the hell else that you want we [932] could get the number of hours between [934] these two days if we wanted to we would [936] just have to stop before we you know got [938] the number of days we go A6 400,000 we [941] divide it by a th000 we divide it by 60 [943] divide it by 60 24 hours right so I'm [946] sure you can imagine this gives us a ton [948] of control and granularity over how to [951] do things in make.com you can run polls [953] let's say to some CRM or project [955] management system and you can see how [957] many hours have passed since a [958] particular date and if you know it's 2 [960] hours before a date or something like [962] that you might be able to use that to [963] like trigger a notification or if it's a [966] week after some other date maybe you [968] could use it to trigger an email like [969] the example that we're going to be [970] building later um you can do things not [972] just in hours you can do things in [973] minutes you could do things down to [974] seconds you even do things down to [975] milliseconds so this gives you a ton of [978] power and control over a make.com [979] scenario but only if you understand sort [981] of these building blocks that enabled us [983] to get here okay great so this is how [985] you do math between two dates using the [987] calendar but what I find I typically do [990] is I don't use calendar dates what I do [992] is I'll use now I'll use like the [994] current date basically and then I'll [996] take that and try and figure out you [998] know how many days have elapsed since [999] something how many minutes have elapsed [1001] since something so for instance um if I [1003] wanted to take the current date now and [1006] then I wanted to subtract that um from [1009] or I wanted to subtract 10:46 a.m. on [1012] October the 21st from that we should get [1016] I mean I know it say 11:51 but remember [1017] that my time zones are off we should get [1019] about 5 minutes right if I run this this [1023] is how many milliseconds have elapsed so [1025] if I do this just as a sanity check we [1027] divide this by a th that's how many [1028] seconds have elapsed we divide this by [1031] 60 that's how many minutes have elapsed [1034] oh I guess it does take my current date [1035] and time that's interesting um and then [1037] we divide that by 60 again sorry we [1040] don't divide that by 60 uh we divide [1042] that by yes 60 to get the number of [1044] hours um or you know we can represent in [1047] terms of minutes that is about 6 6 6 [1049] minutes I suppose um I'm not exactly [1052] sure why this parses my current date [1055] here let me just try this [1057] 1146 yeah I think this is a better [1059] example [1061] here there you go that's the number of [1063] seconds that have passed right if you [1064] divide that by 60 you get 6615 minutes [1067] which is about um yeah it's about a [1068] distance of 6. 615 minutes okay so now [1071] that we're done with that sanity check [1073] let's run on another example um what we [1076] want to do now is let's say we have [1079] a variable here afterwards or a module [1082] here afterwards I should [1084] say maybe we have some trigger and then [1088] we have some action and what basically [1090] we want is we only want this to run if [1093] it has [1095] been let's say 10 minutes since uh some [1100] date that we've evaluated so what we [1102] want is we want date example and we're [1104] going to go to numeric example equal to [1109] and then we're going to go [1112] 10 then we'll say 10 [1115] minutes and what I'm going to do here is [1117] I only want this to run when 10 minutes [1120] has passed between when I set [1129] something let's get enter the current [1131] date [1133] here and um you know some date that I'm [1137] pulling in from some system CR I mean in [1139] this case I'm I'm manually putting this [1140] in I'm manually saying it's October the [1141] 21st at 10:53 a.m. um let's do this [1144] 11:53 a.m. but let's just run a quick [1147] example it's currently let's say 1154 [1149] right so I'm going to go [1156] 1146 and we want it to return just X if [1159] I run this scenario what you'll see is [1161] what we've returned is [1164] 50133 right I actually have to do a [1166] little bit of math on this so we we want [1168] to do is we want to get this in the [1170] number of seconds and then we want to [1172] convert that into minutes like we did [1175] before so what I'm going to do is I'm [1177] going to start doing some math and you [1179] see it's going to get pretty ugly [1180] looking we want to divide this by a [1182] thousand to get the number of seconds [1184] then we divide this by 60 to get the [1186] number of [1188] minutes okay let's run this again this [1191] evaluated to 8. 82815 right so basically [1195] it's close to 9 another thing you can do [1197] um just to make your life a lot easier [1198] is you can round these entries by [1201] rounding this entry when we run this [1203] what you'll see is this is now going to [1205] nine what you might be able to do and I [1207] don't actually recommend running it [1208] every minute this is mostly something [1209] you do maybe like every hour or [1211] something like that what you could [1212] theoretically do is you could run [1213] something every minute then only when 10 [1216] minutes has passed since something [1219] occurred um do you actually trigger this [1221] so the date that I picked back here was [1223] 11:46 it's currently 1155 let's go 11:45 [1226] make it exactly 10 minutes I run this [1228] what you'll see is this actually equates [1230] to 10 or it evaluates to 10 which uh [1232] enables our scenario to [1234] proceed the reason why I'm showing you [1236] guys this example is because we're going [1237] to use something very similar we're just [1238] going to do it on a week basis instead [1240] of a 10-minute basis and then that's [1242] what we're going to use to send an [1243] automatic follow-up email after a [1244] certain amount of time all right let's [1246] cover another function here instead of [1248] parse number or parse date rather what [1250] we're going to do is we're going to do [1251] format date now format date you can [1253] think of it as the inverse of parse dat [1255] in parse dat what we did is we fed a [1257] string and then we returned make.com [1259] secret date time representation which [1261] allowed us to standardize the math that [1262] we were doing between two different [1263] dates what format date does it allows us [1265] to pass that standardized representation [1267] and then turn that into any string [1269] format that we want so for instance um [1272] if I went now and then I formatted now [1274] as y y y y month month and then I ran [1278] this what you'll see is I just created [1281] my own little formatting um habit or my [1284] own little format uh with the year year [1286] year year-month Monon and then I I [1289] passed in the current date to it and it [1291] gave me you know the current year and [1292] then the current month if I went DD and [1296] I ran this now I get the day as well so [1299] I'm sure you can imagine you can go hour [1300] hour minute minute I run this again we [1304] get [1305] 1110 I don't know why it says 1110 [1307] actually that doesn't seem right might [1310] be [1311] hhmm there's some datetime tokens which [1314] I'm going to show yeah there you go hhmm [1316] not Capital [1317] hhmm um there's a way to represent like [1319] AM and PM and stuff like that um if you [1321] want to get a list of all of these [1323] operators go integromat datetime [1326] tokens or tokens for datetime formatting [1330] here and check this out this includes a [1333] list of every date and time token to be [1336] used when you format um you know a [1339] string or turn a date into a string so [1341] for instance y y if you just do y y you [1343] only get like the last two digits of the [1345] year so if I were to take this back to [1347] my example earlier if I if I just wanted [1348] to get like the last two digits of this [1350] year hypothetically for whatever reason [1351] if I just go YY and run you'll see it'll [1353] just say 2024 or 24 rather if I wanted [1357] to get uh the quarter you can even do [1359] like hey is this first quarter second [1361] quarter third quarter you know a lot of [1362] the time these like big Finance [1363] businesses they work with everything on [1364] a quarterly basis right so you might be [1366] able to like customize an email and say [1368] hey I know it's a second quarter you [1370] asked me to follow up just wanted to [1371] drop some information about how Q2 is [1373] going and then you know put a bunch of [1374] data in it you get quarter the year with [1376] ordinal first second third so maybe yeah [1379] you know instead of quarter one you go [1381] qo and you go hey qo I know it's qo [1384] space quarter I know it's the first [1386] quarter m is the month number so you can [1388] go 1 to 12 m o like capital M and then [1391] lowercase o is sort of like the ordinal [1393] um ordinal just refers to these little [1396] letters that occur after the the number [1398] so first second third fourth uh if you [1402] go mm then you get it represented with a [1404] zero in front of it mmm January February [1406] November December mmmm January February [1409] November December as a quick test why [1411] don't we try and get the date in this [1413] format will go October the 21st [1418] 1159 so as we saw back then we're going [1421] to go mmmm for October space then we [1424] want we want the day with the ordinal I [1426] believe and then we want a comma and [1429] then we want the year year year [1431] year give that a run we received October [1434] 21st commas space 2024 but the cool part [1437] is you can insert insert whatever string [1439] you want in here and it'll still render [1440] it right so this is a very quick and [1442] easy way to turn um you know a date into [1445] a nicely formatted string that you can [1447] manipulate I'll let you guys go through [1449] the rest of these but you can also get [1451] like week you can get hour minute [1454] millisecond um this one over here that [1457] capital x this is the Unix timestamp and [1460] this is what enables us to do some other [1462] math as well for instance you can go [1464] format date now X [1468] you get the Unix time stamp right so [1471] maybe instead of now what we want to do [1473] is we want to format the date [1475] um want to format this date as [1479] X okay so then we want to subtract the [1482] current time stamp let's let's subtract [1485] today's date [1487] from uh I don't know October the 20th or [1491] something just showing you guys a few [1492] different ways to do math here uh so the [1494] current date is October the 21st we're [1496] subtracting basically yesterday from it [1498] and we're doing so with the time stamp [1500] that we formatting that we formatted so [1502] we're going to get you know [1505] 9,084 um seconds basically if we do the [1507] math on the [1510] number it's a number of days it's been [1512] one day 1.04 days since then for [1515] instance so yeah a lot of lot of [1517] different ways to do the math here some [1519] may be simpler preferred from others um [1521] I personally prefer the way that I [1522] showed you before which may seem a [1523] little bit more unseemly but I just like [1524] to like be able to follow the math from [1527] step to step you can also so obviously [1528] just manipulate time stamps directly [1530] using format date the current date then [1532] you could see the distance between this [1533] set date and then the current date [1535] because this is a negative number that [1536] means that this is technically um in the [1538] past by I don't know we'd have to do the [1541] math on this to figure it [1543] out but just as a sanity check why the [1546] hell [1547] not if we were to divide this by 60 and [1552] then divide this by another 60 and then [1554] divide this by [1556] 24 um and we may have to do milliseconds [1559] actually one [1560] second yeah let's do divide this by a [1564] thousand again you'll see for instance [1566] the date that I picked was six days in [1568] the past which makes sense 15th 20 21st [1572] um you could have some function that I [1573] don't know like checks to see how many [1574] days are left between now and the 30th [1577] to maybe yeah notify somebody that an [1579] invoice is coming in a certain amount of [1581] time obviously the opportunities are [1582] Limitless and I'm just trying to give [1583] you some very basic examples here but [1584] yeah um that's really the utility the [1586] set hour set day set date set months and [1588] set your function um so the tldr here [1592] sort of the cliff notes are you can use [1593] these functions to replace some of the [1595] addition and the subtraction that we [1596] were doing earlier you could check to [1598] see if now add day s is equal to a [1600] current date or maybe uh you could check [1603] to see if now minus 7 is equal to a date [1606] and then I'll kind of compare the two um [1608] but this is just an alternative method [1609] of doing you know date and time [1611] manipulations and the unfortunate part [1613] about make is like I I think it's great [1615] that they give you all these options but [1616] considering that all these options are [1617] basically functional equ in anyway it' [1619] be much simpler for a lot of people if [1620] they just gave you one and it was just [1622] like hey this is how you do datetime [1623] math moving forward but you know it's uh [1626] as I mentioned in my makemoney withth [1627] make.com course this is a wonderfully [1630] powerful platform but it's a little bit [1631] unpolished and my goal here is just to [1633] guide you guys through that a complexity [1635] necessary or unnecessary all right so [1638] now that we know everything about format [1640] date and parse date it's time for us to [1642] just do some simple examples using um [1646] make.com and a CRM that I like using [1648] called clickup the example that I'm [1650] going to be building is an example that [1652] you know basically we have a CRM field [1654] and in this CRM uh well it's not a CR [1657] it's a hiring pipeline uh what we have [1659] is we have people that sign up to our [1660] service and they want a job they include [1662] their email address here then we also [1665] have a column here called Date added [1666] what we want to do is every day we want [1668] to check through this date added column [1670] for all the entries and if the number of [1672] days is seven we want to send a [1674] follow-up email to them just checking in [1675] and seeing how it's going there's a very [1677] simple and common use case that you can [1679] use for basically anything you could use [1681] it for outbound you could use it for [1682] anything inbound you could use it to [1684] basically build out your own Fallout [1685] flows um and in this video I'm going to [1687] show you everything you need to do to do [1689] it so first I'm going to go to click up [1691] and then what I'm going to do is I'm [1692] just going to list all [1697] tasks I have a workspace setup here [1700] called [1701] NSM what I need to do is Select my list [1703] so I'm going to go [1705] select the workspace I have is NSM [1709] space is going to be I think [1712] operations and then we're going to [1714] select the [1716] specific list which should be hiring [1718] example or something like that there we [1721] go and all we want to do is we just want [1723] to run this and just see a quick little [1725] example of all the data that we're [1726] returning so I'm just going to right [1728] click this run this it's listing the [1731] tasks right now and you see we got a [1732] task there was a guy called Nick surar [1734] that signed up to our hiring pipeline [1736] which is awesome thank you Nick [1739] um and there are a variety of like [1740] custom fields and stuff like that the [1742] custom field that concerns us is this [1744] date added you'll see the way that [1746] clickup represents dates and custom [1748] Fields is they do so with the Unix [1750] timestamp well I think it's the [1752] millisecond timestamp actually so if I [1754] were to go back to Unix timestamp grab [1757] this divide this by a [1760] th paste this in convert this you'll see [1764] that this sign up was 7 days [1766] ago so because it's already in Unix time [1769] it makes it very easy for us to do math [1771] right all right next up I'm going to [1773] create an email and I'm just going to [1776] send an email to this person following [1779] up with the status of their [1781] application so what I'm going to do is [1783] I'm going to [1785] say uh let's do it from my own email and [1788] go to I'm going to go down and select [1790] the email address on the record which is [1793] this one here I'm going to say following [1797] up read [1798] application and I'm just going to use [1800] plain text here and I'm going to write [1801] hi uh we want their name right me see if [1805] I can grab their first name yeah no I [1806] don't think I can so I'm just going to [1809] split this name based off the presence [1812] of a space then I'm going to get the [1815] first entry so is now going to say hi [1819] space [1821] Nick thanks for submitting your [1824] application last week just wanted to [1827] check in and see how things were going [1830] with your trial form let me know [1835] appreciate the time [1837] cheers and I mean in this case my name [1839] is also Nick I'm talking to [1843] myself uh we're going to click okay [1846] awesome then there's one more thing that [1847] I have to do I believe I have [1850] to uh I think we're actually sending the [1852] email eh yeah we're actually sending the [1853] whole email which is um probably should [1856] have just done a draft but let's run [1858] this anyway let's just do a quick little [1860] example [1861] here let's go [1863] Nick oh I need to refresh the [1867] token and we go down here [1870] to oh boy I have a lot of these uh [1872] probably the July 19th 2012 241 let's [1875] give this a try run this [1881] puppy cool that one looks like it's sent [1884] why don't I now go back to my main email [1888] should now have a record [1891] somewhere don't really know where this [1894] is so maybe we'll go back here and go to [1897] my other [1899] email maybe it's somewhere in [1903] Scent yeah there you go uh so we sent an [1906] email hi Nick thanks for submitting your [1907] application last week just wanted to [1908] check in and see how things were going [1909] with you TR for let me know appreciate [1910] the time awesome so the email looks good [1912] and now what we want to do is we only [1913] want to send this if it's been exactly 7 [1915] days since the last um you know touch [1919] since basically the person was added to [1921] our pipeline so a variety of different [1923] ways we could do this we could just do [1924] all of the math directly in the filter [1926] and that's something that you know I [1927] would usually do to optimize the number [1928] of operations but just for um kind of [1931] like illustratory purposes I'm just [1933] going to put a module in between them [1935] and I'm going to say calculate date time [1938] and [1939] distance going to Auto align this then [1941] what I'm going to do is I'm going to [1943] list all the tasks in Click up so what [1945] that's going to do is it's just going to [1946] show me all of the people here here and [1948] then I only have one entry right now you [1950] can imagine this would work if you have [1951] like 50 entries as well then I'm going [1953] to extract the date added that's going [1955] to be in Unix time stamp format I'm then [1957] going to do a little bit of math I'm [1958] going to convert that Unix time stamp [1959] format into just the number of days for [1962] Simplicity I'm going to take that and [1964] I'll see if that's equal um to like if [1968] the if the current date minus that date [1970] is equal to seven um then uh you know [1973] I'll I'll be good and then I can send [1974] the email if it's not equal to seven [1976] maybe if it's equal to five or six or [1978] maybe eight we're not going to send the [1979] email we're then going to run this just [1981] once per [1982] day and maybe we'll do this at like I [1984] don't know 7:00 a.m. or [1988] something and in that way um basically [1991] every single day we'll just do a quick [1992] check through our clickup determine [1994] whether or not it's been seven days if [1995] it's been seven days then we'll send [1997] that follow-up email so I'm going to do [1999] the filter right here after calculate [2000] datetime distance and what I want is I [2002] want this date example to be [2005] equal I'm going to use numeric operators [2007] not text operators uh to [2011] seven I'll put a label of 7 days past [2013] here and here's where I'm going to [2015] actually do the math okay so what we're [2016] going to need to do to calculate this [2018] date example is we're going to have to [2019] take this date right which is 1729 [2022] whatever you notice that this is [2023] currently being represented in [2025] milliseconds so what we're going to want [2027] to do is we're going to want to divide [2028] this by a thousand that's just going to [2030] give us the number of seconds right it's [2032] going to be a lot easier to deal with [2034] oops let me actually not run this module [2036] only I'm just going to run both of these [2038] together okay so that's the number of [2040] seconds that's the Unix time stamp and [2042] then all we really need to do if you [2043] think about it is this is like a a [2045] former date right this is a date that's [2047] in the past most likely so what we need [2048] to do is we just need to take our time [2050] stamp and then subtract this and I'm [2053] also going to have to add some brackets [2055] in here and I'm doing the brackets just [2056] by using um you know two curly brackets [2059] and putting a round bracket in [2061] between okay so what happens is if we [2063] run this what we're really doing is [2064] we're grabbing the current time stamp [2066] we're subtracting it by um the other [2068] time stamp which is seven days well [2070] should be seven days ago we're looking [2071] to check whether it's seven days what we [2073] receive is the number of seconds between [2074] the two so now mathematically if you [2077] think about it what we just have to do [2078] is we have to figure out how many [2079] seconds a week is right um or we just [2082] need to do the math to divide this and [2083] turn this into um the number of [2086] seconds so I'm just going to do another [2088] expression bounded with brackets here [2091] then I'm going to divide this by 60 [2093] seconds in a minute divide this again by [2096] 60 minutes in an hour and divide this [2098] again by 24 hours in a day I'm going to [2101] run this one final time and the result [2103] is 7. 34234 [2106] 9537 we're citing Pi here that part [2109] isn't super important U what I'm going [2110] to do is I'm just going to round all of [2111] this now so that I can get a seven and [2115] then what I'm going to do is I'll [2116] connect [2117] this and this is only going to run now [2120] if um seven days have passed exactly so [2123] hypothetically if I run this now you'll [2126] see that this is going to EV we to seven [2128] it's going to proceed right but let's [2130] just say for the purposes of this [2132] example I'm going to go back to click up [2134] and I'm going to change this October the [2135] 14th October the 15th instead it's six [2138] days now right if I run this we're going [2141] to be blocked here because the date [2142] example is not equal to seven in fact [2144] what we calculated is only [2146] six same thing if we set this to 8 [2151] Days hold on a [2153] second uh yeah eight [2156] days give this a [2159] run right it's not going to work because [2161] now this is eight and so on and so forth [2164] so in this way what you can do is you [2165] can build out like a series of of [2167] follow-up automations basically maybe [2169] you could have one that does it on the [2170] seventh day you could have another that [2171] does it on the the 14th day what we [2173] could have done is we could have very [2174] easily just added a router [2177] here connected that router between these [2179] two [2180] modules the first would be if seven days [2182] were passed maybe the next would be if [2184] like 14 days were passed [2190] this is the simplest way to build a [2191] follow-up system based off dates by the [2192] way there are like hundreds more and [2195] I've seen all sorts of them at this [2196] point in my career trust me um maybe we [2199] want to do one more right and then maybe [2202] in this way you'll do exactly three [2204] follow-ups or four follow-ups um one [2207] every [2208] week and in this way uh you know they'll [2210] all be different basically and there's a [2212] very simple scenario that'll just run [2214] through all of like the entries in your [2215] CRM or maybe hiring pipeline or [2216] application pipeline or whatnot [2218] calculate the daytime distance and then [2220] for reasonably few operations um because [2222] you're only running this once a day [2224] follow up with everybody and you [2225] wouldn't have been able to do that had

myself included now [9] you can do all the work involved in [10] setting up a cold email campaign in just [12] a couple of hours so naturally is a very [14] low bared entry and a lot of people are [15] getting in the space right now by far [16] the biggest problem that people have is [18] they still don't know where to Source [20] effective leads from so in this video [23] I'm going to show you guys my nine Top [25] Ways To Source highquality leads for [27] cold Emil in 2024 these are % real [30] they're actively used by myself and [32] members of my automation Community every [34] single day and I'm going to show them [36] all to you in the next few minutes let's [38] get into it because I don't want you [39] guys to have to spend hours scrolling [40] through this video here is in brief [42] every single lead generation source that [43] we're going to cover the first is [45] LinkedIn sales Navigator Phantom Buster [47] and any mail finder the second Apollo [49] appify and Derek Das app the third [52] Google Maps appify to any mail finder [55] the fourth Google search to appify to [57] any mail finder then instantly we'll [59] talk about cognism then I'll show you an [62] indeed company to Phantom Buster [63] LinkedIn company scraper to LinkedIn [65] sales Navigator back to Phantom Buster [68] to any mailf finder pipeline I'll show [70] you a LinkedIn group to Phantom Buster [71] group scraper to any mailf finder [73] pipeline then last but not least I'll [74] show you builtwith specifically how to [76] find uh you know websites that have a [78] little snippet of code on them that [79] might represent a Plugin or or some [81] other thing you're targeting so without [82] further Ado let's start with the first [84] which is our LinkedIn sales Navigator [86] Phantom Buster and any mail finder [88] pipeline I've talked about this a lot [89] over over the course of the last few [90] months in fact this is one of the most [92] popular lead sourcing methods right now [94] and the reason why is because it works [96] super well um basically what you do is [98] you need a LinkedIn sales Navigator [99] account I have one right over here and [101] what we do is um you know we enter [103] whatever search that we want in here [105] let's hypothetically just say I'm [107] looking for project manager you don't [108] need to use these keywords what you do [111] from here is you'll use this leftand [112] side in order to uh filter out you know [115] different functions seniority levels job [118] titles geographies and that sort of [119] thing I'm going to pretend that I'm [120] sourcing leads for my own company in [122] this uh instance my company's name is [124] left click excuse me we are sourcing uh [127] B2B Founders basically we're looking for [129] like B2B tech companies B2B agencies [131] hell even like B2B SAS businesses so why [133] don't we go down here to uh current job [136] title and then why don't we just go [137] owner [139] co-owner let's do principal [142] owner uh even do small business owner [145] and Senior partner as well and then why [148] don't we scroll a little bit down to [149] geography and let's just say you know [151] United States or something like that [154] okay that's pretty big generally [155] speaking we want an audience size of [156] about [158] 2,500 so what I'm going to do is I'm [160] going to Niche down pretty heavily and [162] I'm going to call this Professional [164] Services it's going to filter for [166] primarily agencies not 100% this isn't [168] like the highest quality search I've [169] ever created in my life but from there [171] we can do something like uh I don't know [174] like marketing agency or why don't we do [176] creative [178] agency okay so what we've basically done [181] is we' built out a search the search is [183] a list of people that have a keyword [186] somewhere on their profile that it says [188] creative agency um from here we also [190] narrow down the job titles to owner [192] co-owner principal owner small business [194] owner uh and then we were looking [195] specifically for people in the United [197] States now just given because the search [198] is still pretty big why don't we just do [200] let's see uh why don't we do Texas and [202] let's just see how many people we end up [204] getting okay so we got 1,000 results why [206] don't we do Texas plus Virginia that [208] should be about 2,000 [210] or maybe we'll throw in a Missouri there [212] too all right screw it we got 1,500 [214] that's what we're going with so the way [216] that this flow works is once you have a [218] LinkedIn sales Navigator search like [220] this all you do is you head over to [222] phantombuster tocom there a software [224] platform that you have to sign up for [226] costs a little bit of money I believe [227] it's like 60 well actually we can find [229] out right [230] now believe it's $60 something dollars [233] per month as of the time of this [235] recording for that $69 per month you end [238] up with uh 20 hour of execution credits [241] that is more than enough for me to be [243] scraping basically every single day at [244] least a th000 or 2,000 leads so quite [247] straightforward what you have to do then [248] is go down here to um [251] LinkedIn sales [255] Navigator search [258] export just type in search export use [261] this Phantom then all you have to do [263] next is paste in that search URL then [265] you have to click this little button [267] connect to LinkedIn that's going to [268] connect to your own LinkedIn profile [270] it's going to use your own LinkedIn [271] profile to do the scraping once you're [273] done with that I'm not actually going to [274] give this a click because I don't want [275] everybody to see my own cookie um once [277] you're done with that you set the [278] parameters of how many sech leads you [280] want to export basically then once [282] you're done with that um you know you [285] click save and then you're basically [286] good to go and normally this will take [288] anywhere between maybe 15 to 45 minutes [290] depending on how you set it up and then [292] at the very end of this if you go down [293] to leads let me just give this a [296] refresh soor if you go down to results [299] well you can do is you can export this [301] as a [302] CSV okay once you have this exported as [305] a CSV you dump this into Google Sheets [308] like so and I'm only doing this to [310] visualize the data you don't actually [312] have to but um I like to store my data [315] and sort of organize [317] it and then from there you end up with a [320] list of profiles from LinkedIn that [323] looks something like this now you'll see [325] there's tons of data here there's your [327] profile URL full name first name last [329] name company name blah blah blah blah [330] the one thing that's missing for the [332] purposes of our cold email campaign is [334] obviously their email address right and [336] so that's where our next step comes in [338] handy which is any mail finder any mail [342] finder is a very simple and easy way to [345] find email addresses using a person's [347] first name last name a company name or [350] uh or the company domain name as well [352] basically what these guys do is they [353] will iterate through first name. [356] lastname company name.com um you know [358] various ways right like if my name is [360] Nick surve they might do nick. surve at [363] my company name is left click left [364] click.com or left click. until uh they [368] find a verified email and then you end [370] up only paying for the ones that are [372] verified or fully verified in addition [374] you usually end up with a bunch that are [375] partially verified and a lot of those [377] partially verified ones work too in my [379] own experience anywhere from maybe like [380] 50% and so yeah it ends up being quite [383] uh scalable as an email finding method [386] in terms of the pricing we go down to [388] monthly which is what I usually [389] recommend [390] don't really pay for annual software [391] licenses for stuff like this cuz you [393] just never know when uh you know a [394] better solution is going to come out but [396] if you go monthly you end up with [398] something along the lines of 1,000 [399] credits for $50 a month 1,000 credits [402] are a th000 verified emails in practice [404] you usually end up getting anywhere from [406] like I don't know 2,500 for that [409] thousand to maybe even like 3,500 just [411] depending on how crappy your initial [412] lead source is so if you get $3,500 [414] emails for $49 a month you can kind of [416] do the math [419] that comes out to one point yeah 1.4 [422] cents per lead or per email address I [424] should say um and you know obviously as [426] you scale up this gets better and better [428] I mean this looks to me to be I don't [431] know almost twice as profitable this [433] looks to me to be like my math so good [436] but what's that five times to two this [438] is like five times as profitable um and [439] so you know as you pay more and more [441] money obviously things get more and more [442] scalable the way that this works is [444] you'll go to anymail finder.com bulk [446] search and then you'll just upload that [447] same CSV that we had a second ago if I [449] give this a little upload it'll then ask [452] you hey you know based off of all this [453] information what do you want you want to [455] import the F the full name the first [457] name the last name the company name [459] right um and then I usually unclick [460] domains but obviously you know play [463] around with this find what works best [464] for you I'm going to go down here to [466] custom uh you then click process and [468] then at the end of this you end up with [470] a bunch of email addresses that are [471] found that look something like this [474] right I paid 362 emails for this um all [477] is well you know because I also ended [479] getting an additional 275 or so as you [482] can see you don't find all of them 621 [483] are not found but that's just sort of [485] how this works right you're never going [486] to find 100% of the email addresses that [488] you feed in as sources um just something [490] to keep in mind all right the next is [492] Apollo appify and Derek Dasa now Apollo [496] is probably the most popular lead [497] sourcing platform right now the benefit [499] to Apollo is uh it usually contains [502] email addresses right out of the gate so [504] obviously this can help you don't have [506] to go through an additional step you [507] know you can usually save a little bit [508] of money no real like email verification [511] required because everything is done in [512] Apollo um but the thing is if you were [515] to just go to Apollo and then check out [516] their pricing page sort of on its [519] own you'll find that this is not [521] actually very cheap at all um you know [523] they default to annual if you do monthly [525] billing you'll see that for $99 a month [528] we basically only get 2,000 um export [531] credits which means that you're paying [532] something like my math ain't so good [534] here but I think it's about 5 cents per [536] lead in order to get the email address [538] when you put all all of that together so [540] what we do instead is just like we use [542] Phantom Buster to get a bunch of [543] LinkedIn sales Navigator emails there's [545] also a way that you could use another [546] platform called [548] appify at least as of the time of this [550] video and then use a scraping platform [553] or a scraper called the apollo.io lead [555] scraper and basically what you do is [557] you'll go into Apollo which I have to [559] open up over here so give me one [563] second you'll pump into Apollo and then [565] once you're in you know you'll find a [567] search let's say I'm looking for [570] I don't know uh marketing agency or [572] something obviously you're going to want [573] to make your searches a little better [574] than this uh just like LinkedIn you can [578] sort based off Persona and company name [580] and job title and you can get as [581] granular as you want with the stuff but [582] basically after you get uh a search in [585] place what you do is you just copy this [586] URL and then you go back to Apollo and [588] then what you do is you use this [589] apollo.io lead scraper this is one of [591] them there's several more that you can [593] the benefit to this sorry let's use this [596] account [597] here the benit benit to this is [602] now just like previously where I pumped [604] in a search URL address I do the same [606] thing over here I just pump in a new [607] search URL address and then I click save [610] and start and basically what's happening [611] under the hood is instead of you using [613] up your export credits on Apollo I'm [615] you're just scraping using the [616] information that's available on the page [618] this is certainly I imagine not uh this [621] doesn't jive with Apollo's terms of [622] service so I doubt that this opportunity [624] is going to be available for much longer [626] they're probably working hard as we [628] speak to patch it and that sort of thing [629] thing um but it's similar to The Phantom [631] Buster LinkedIn Pipeline and so far [632] they're using some data source that you [634] know you might have to pay data for that [635] don't really want you to see the email [637] addresses and then use a third party [638] service to scrape all those emails [640] anyway from here what you do um is [642] you're going to get a big list of leads [644] from this so if I go down here to let's [646] do [647] runs I go to [650] storage you'll see that I have a bunch [652] of information here I have like the [653] country I have the first name the last [655] name I have the email address and all [657] that stuff and what you do is you kind [659] of have two options you can export this [660] manually or you can build an automation [662] like I've built in many of my previous [663] videos that takes data after an appify [666] actor is completed and then you know [667] automatically does a lot of this next [669] step but you can download this file just [671] like we did [672] before and then what you do is you [674] import [679] this if you you know remember how the [681] hell Google Sheets works good God okay [684] so you import this give that a quick [686] drag and [688] drop and you have a giant Google sheet [691] with way too many columns Apollo has [693] substantially more data per record than [696] anything else as you see we could scroll [698] for hours and hours and hours and then [701] what you do is you go to another app [702] called Derek Das [704] apppp and what this does is right um [707] this information is sufficient for you [708] to run an email campaign you have like [710] the first name you have the last name [711] you have some company names and that [712] sort of stuff um so so everything here [714] is fine but if you wanted to go one step [716] further and if you wanted to get a bunch [717] of like their profile information if you [718] wanted to get like their bio if you want [720] to do some cool AI personalization stuff [722] what you do is you get Derek Dasa d-a is [726] a quick and easy way for you to enrich [729] or add the LinkedIn profile of the URLs [732] and email addresses that you have in [733] this sheet uh and then from there not [735] only do you have like the first name [737] last name company name all that stuff [739] but you also have the entire LinkedIn [740] profile that includes stuff like their [741] bio their summary they about information [744] uh and the really cool part about that [745] is you can then feed that into AI in [747] order to you know write substantially [749] power quality [750] campaigns I talk a lot about this in all [753] of my videos If personalization is [755] something that you've never done before [756] I highly encourage you giving it a try [758] uh because I personally find response [760] rate increases anywhere from like two to [762] maybe four times with personalization as [764] opposed to without all right next up we [766] have a couple of less traditional lead [767] sources that I don't think many people [769] are familiar with uh we have Google Maps [771] to appify to any mail finder and then [773] Google search to appify to any mail [775] finder these rest upon again a third [778] party web service call appify which [780] allows you to input a Google Maps query [782] or a Google search query and then [785] extract a list of results which then you [787] can use to feed company names or [788] websites into any mail finder with let [791] me show you guys a quick example of what [792] this looks like so head back to um [795] ampify over [797] here okay so you see there's a Google [799] search results scraper let's start with [801] Google Maps uh scraper just because that [803] was what I talked about [804] initially and what you see is this is a [807] service that cost $12 per 1,000 results [810] so right off the gate you're going to be [812] paying about 1.2 cents my math is [814] correct per uh website that you scrape [817] um this may or may not be feasible for [818] you because remember we still have to do [820] some additional processing we still have [821] to get additional email addresses on top [823] of this um but regardless in order to [825] make this work what you do is you'll [826] come up with like some Google Maps query [828] right let's say you know I wanted to do [830] Puerto via [831] hypothetically so let me just open this [833] up in Google [835] maps and you know how if you just scroll [838] through this page here you'll see a [840] bunch of these different businesses [841] start popping up salons right fiestas I [843] mean I'm not Spanish I don't know the uh [847] I don't fully understand what some of [848] these words are um but what you can do [850] with this Google Maps extractor is you [852] can feed in a location and a search so [854] let's say I wanted to do I don't know [855] flower shops in Phoenix Arizona or [857] something like that and it'll actually [859] go through that page extracting the [861] businesses that correspond to your [863] search um so I'm just going to run this [865] as an example why don't we just do I [867] don't know 10 places you you can select [869] deeper City scrape if you want there are [871] tons of settings here that I'm not going [872] to go into just for brevity sake but [874] once you're done with uh you know [876] selecting your parameters you click save [877] and [878] start and what it does is it actually [880] goes out opens up a Google Maps instance [883] it then puts in your search term all of [885] this is underneath the hood you don't [886] see any of this stuff and then it [888] extracts the information for the [890] companies it basically clicks on them it [893] gets the name it gets the type it gets [895] the reviews it gets the website phone [897] number all that stuff and then it dumps [899] that into their own little spreadsheet [901] which then becomes accessible for you so [903] let's give it a few seconds and let me [904] show you the data okay so I actually [906] didn't find any flower shops in Phoenix [908] um just because my search parameters [909] were a little bit different so I changed [911] the search and as we see we got a ton of [914] local dental practices hygienist and [916] stuff like that in my area Calgary [918] Alberta um and so this is currently [920] inside of appify we want to get this out [921] of appify I'm going to click export [923] results we'll do a CSV again and then [926] I'm just going to use this same Google [928] sheet to import the results just so we [929] could visualize them take a look at [932] them so we're going to do aend to [934] current sheet wonderful all right and as [936] we see here we still have a ton of [938] columns lots of data but the data that [940] matters for us is right we have the [942] address column here that's pretty cool [945] let's keep scrolling over to the right [948] uh we have like the neighborhood even so [949] we have a ton of opportunity to [951] personalize this data which is pretty [953] cool and then probably the most [956] important one for us is I don't know why [957] they hide it it's all the way on the [958] right hand side here uh but it's the [960] website and so as you see we don't get [962] websites every time because not every [964] Google Maps entry has a website but the [966] vast majority of the time we do right [967] make a night Square Dental if I just [969] open that up you see this is actually [971] like a dentist website so you have a [973] couple of opportunities here a couple [974] things that you could do the first is [976] right I mean I mentioned using any mail [977] finder but even before you get there [979] what you could do is you could run a [981] very simple automation or a little web [983] scrape that takes this website and then [986] just looks for anything on on the page [989] that's formatted like an email address [991] so as you see this is formatted like an [992] email address it has a string with a [994] bunch of letters then it has an at sign [996] then it has another string a period and [997] then some other string right you could [999] use regular Expressions regex you could [1001] pump that into maybe something like [1003] make.com or zap here parse out the HTML [1006] the page and then if you find an email [1007] address you're good you don't need to go [1009] you don't need to go any further this [1010] can save you a little bit of money [1012] because you know the alternative is what [1013] you do is you take this URL and then [1017] just like we did before with any email [1018] find you pump this in here using new [1021] bulk just going to grab this data [1025] set and then what you want is you just [1028] want to have the domain or the website [1030] column now the cool part about having [1032] the domain or the website column is uh [1034] if you don't feed in like a first name [1035] or a last name or something like that [1037] and all you do is you feed in the [1038] website an email finder will still go [1039] out there and get you uh email addresses [1042] it's just it's not going to get you [1043] email addresses of any person in [1045] particular what it's going to do is look [1046] for any email address at that domain [1049] which is pretty cool um of course there [1050] are going to be lower success rates [1052] using this approach than there are if [1054] you were to supply a first name and a [1055] last name and a company name and and all [1057] that stuff if we're only going off the [1058] domain I personally find results are [1060] maybe 30% of the time 40% of the time um [1063] you also need to keep in mind that [1064] you're not going to get the first name [1065] and the last name of the specific [1066] contact back you're just going to get [1068] the email address which can obviously [1069] make doing email Outreach a little bit [1071] more difficult um you can't say hey [1072] Peter you know you might have to say hey [1074] how's it going hey haa I saw you you [1076] know when I walked down the block the [1077] other day um you'll have to get a little [1079] bit strategic if you want it to still [1081] seem as personalized and customized but [1083] this is a very high Roi approach that [1084] you can do uh when you don't actually [1086] know who the decision maker is or uh you [1089] know what they're doing or how to search [1090] similarly you can do the exact same flow [1092] that I just showed you guys except [1093] instead of using a Google Maps extractor [1095] you could use the Google search [1096] extractor so uh same flow it's just [1099] instead of feeding in Google Maps [1100] profiles what we're doing is we're [1102] feeding in Google uh search results so [1105] if I were to look up I don't know [1106] divorce lawyer New York here right as [1108] you see we get a ton of these search [1110] results find a divorce lawyer best [1112] divorce lawyers Nyc New York City [1113] divorce lawyers New York family law [1115] attorney as you see not all of these are [1117] actually um specific divorce attorneys [1119] some of these are like directories or [1120] that sort of thing but you can certainly [1122] take this search term and do the exact [1124] same thing that we just did back there [1126] feeding it into the Google search result [1127] scraper instead if you give that a run [1130] um just like earlier we generated a [1132] bunch of lists of Google MK profiles [1134] what we're going to do now is we're [1135] going to generate a list of basically [1136] just websites from here we can take [1138] those websites feed those directly into [1139] any mail finder just like I did [1141] previously and then you'll get a list of [1143] email addresses at those domains I [1145] should also note that you can get more [1146] than one email address per domain using [1148] this and the previous methods so it's [1149] entirely possible for you to feed in 100 [1151] profiles and then end up with I don't [1153] know 200 or or 300 email addresses back [1156] um I think one time I found like 17 or [1158] 18 email addresses at a single domain uh [1160] that was a really interesting campaign [1162] the next lead generation source is very [1164] simple it's called instantly a little [1166] while ago instantly actually released a [1168] b to be lead database that allows you to [1170] just purchase leads directly on their [1172] platform I will say in my humble [1174] experience I have not found as good [1176] results just buying instantly leads I [1178] have sourcing my own and then running my [1180] campaigns I think that's basically the [1181] trade-off anytime you buy leads from a [1183] provider like this you're trading off [1185] convenience and cost for maybe uh speed [1187] to lead or or speed to Market but [1189] basically what you do is you'll sign up [1191] for instantly which is you know one of [1192] the biggest cold email platforms on [1193] planet Earth right now you may probably [1195] already be using it and then you click [1197] on this little button up here called [1198] finder this will take you to this page [1201] and then what you can do is you could [1202] sort by just like we did back in the day [1204] with LinkedIn filters and Apollo filters [1207] um job [1208] titles [1213] location um industry and keywords number [1216] of employees maybe we want uh Business [1220] Services or [1224] something and then you can even use [1225] artificial intelligence to construct a [1227] search term for for you so I mean an [1229] example here is engineers in New York in [1231] software companies with more than 500 [1233] employees it'll go through and just do [1234] all the math for you um after that what [1236] you do is you select all the leads that [1238] you want so actually why don't I just [1239] select 25 so I don't mistakenly buy [1242] 69,000 worth of leads you click add to [1245] campaign and then you'll click add um [1247] from here you can buy however many leads [1250] you want as you see uh it's $147 per [1253] 10,000 294 for 20,000 right as you scale [1257] up I think eventually it gets more [1259] um cost effective I don't know maybe it [1260] doesn't maybe I li yeah it doesn't [1262] apparently but uh that comes out to a [1264] cost per lead of I think 0.147 cents I [1268] believe I may not be 100% right there [1271] but anyway um you end up with the name [1273] the title the company and the email [1275] address and some of them also have [1276] LinkedIn profiles if they do have [1278] LinkedIn profiles then you can even go [1279] as far as feeding these into Derek Das [1282] app like I was showing you guys in a [1283] previous lead Source method number six [1285] is cognism now I should make a [1287] disclaimer I have yet to run any [1289] meaningful size campaign using cognism [1291] um all of the information I'm about to [1293] tell you is information that I've [1294] sourced from my community and then [1295] people that have reached out to me but [1296] I'm mentioning cognism specifically [1298] because this is gdpr compliant and uh [1301] lead sourcing in the European Union or [1304] EU is historically a big problem um a [1306] lot of people that I've worked with that [1308] want to do cold email in the EU sort of [1310] get scared off by gdpr regulations and [1312] stuff like that so for the most part um [1314] my understanding is the cognism is a [1316] gdpr compliant which is difficult to do [1317] at the scale that they do um their [1319] pricing is going to come out to be more [1321] expensive than most of the other lead [1323] sources that I mentioned here um and as [1324] you know you remember we had lead [1326] sources that range in price anywhere [1327] from like 1.4 cents per lead all the way [1329] up to maybe like 15 or 20 um with [1332] cognism what you have to do is you have [1333] to basically ask them for a quote you [1336] need to go onto their website fill out [1338] your information and then they're what's [1339] called a hi touch B2B uh tech company so [1342] they're actually going to like get [1343] somebody in touch with you they're going [1344] to give you a quick call um as long as [1348] you know you you guys are smart about [1350] how you pitch cognism the volumes that [1352] you're looking for and stuff like this [1353] and this is definitely an option for you [1355] and I know of a few people that are [1356] running campaigns that are quite large [1358] with leads from cognism um cognism leads [1360] include everything from like the first [1362] name last name to like company [1364] information to uh I think it depends on [1366] the specific parameters of the search [1368] but if you want B2B leads you get [1369] everything that you need for any any [1371] sort of campaign using their platform [1373] the next pipeline is super powerful if [1375] in the right hands because the [1376] information that you get are from [1378] companies that are hiring for a [1379] particular role if they're hiring for a [1380] particular role and if you can fulfill [1382] the requirements of that particular role [1384] whether or not you know you want to work [1385] with them for like 9 to5 or something [1387] like that um you know the response rates [1389] tend to be a lot better interest tends [1390] to be a lot better and so does average [1392] ticket size so here's how it works what [1393] you basically do is you'll use um indeed [1397] which is a job search [1400] platform where basically you can look [1402] for jobs in I don't know let's say [1405] automation [1407] even and know you may need to do some [1409] human verification here if you're as [1410] fast as I am look like a robot um right [1414] and so you'll get information of the [1416] company using uh a scraper that I'm [1418] about to show you but as you see you [1419] know indeed allows you to post a bunch [1421] of different jobs if you're a company so [1423] this company Wade Muer LTD is looking [1424] for a Western Regional automation [1426] specialist right um but as you can see [1428] we we can see a link there if we give [1430] that link a click we'll be taken to [1432] their page um and then from you know [1434] their page we can grab their company [1435] name and we can actually use it in [1437] subsequent scrapers to find like their [1438] LinkedIn profiles to find like their [1440] domain names and then I think you're [1441] starting to see how we piece together [1443] all of these different functionalities [1444] right if you have their domain name well [1445] now you can actually feed them into any [1447] mail finder or one of these like email [1449] enrichment platforms start finding [1450] contacts at those um but anyway my point [1452] is indeed is a place that you can get um [1454] job posts right and so if we know that [1456] this company is looking specifically for [1457] you know an automation Specialist or [1459] something like that what we can do is we [1461] can feed in that search term into an [1463] Indeed job scraper and I have to open [1466] this up in another tab [1470] let's go to store and then we'll go [1473] indeed from here what you can do is you [1475] can just look up the positions and [1476] keywords for a search so maybe we want [1478] Automation in San Francisco click save [1480] and [1481] start and then basically what's going to [1483] happen is it's going to pump in your [1485] search term which was Automation in San [1487] Francisco and then it's going to go [1489] through indeed just like we did over [1491] here I don't think I can do this cuz my [1493] account's probably Canadian yeah it's [1495] probably Canadian no luck for me here [1498] maybe we'll do just Toronto so I can [1499] show you guys how this is going to work [1501] behind the scenes um and then it's just [1503] going to scrape all of this information [1504] including the company name as we see up [1506] here so once you have all of this [1508] information um you know you can do some [1510] really cool things with it this is what [1512] the page ends up looking like I'm just [1514] going to abort the search and then [1515] export these results into a CSV just so [1517] we could play around with them a little [1518] bit let's just call this indeed [1522] companies then from here if I import [1524] this and then I append [1526] this what you'll see is this is [1529] horrendously formatted good God we going [1531] to make this way [1533] smaller little more manageable uh thank [1536] you very much um what you see is you get [1538] a bunch of information on like the [1540] company uh the [1542] description um you know HTML version of [1544] the description external apply link um [1546] the ID of the job the location the [1548] position name what they're looking for [1550] and even like the URL of the search the [1553] thing that matters for us though is if [1554] we go back here um there's this company [1557] now keep in mind these are very large [1558] companies most of the time you know your [1559] search isn't going to be as broad as [1561] automation it's going to be hyp specific [1562] you're maybe going to mention a specific [1564] software platform or something like that [1566] um but what you're going to do is we can [1568] take this list of companies and we [1570] actually feed this in to Phantom Buster [1572] it's right back over here using their [1574] LinkedIn company URL finder [1577] search so the way that this works is [1579] what you do is you give it a list of [1581] company names and then if it finds the [1583] associated LinkedIn page it'll return a [1586] LinkedIn company URL right over here [1588] okay so I'm just going to click use this [1590] Phantom and we're going to give this a [1592] little [1593] try so first of all we need a list of [1595] company names right the way that this [1597] sources them is this uses a uh URL and [1600] you feed in a spreadsheet so that's what [1603] we're going to do here and I'm just [1604] going to say um in uh well actually let [1607] me copy this information to a new [1608] spreadsheet one [1611] sec we'll go sheets. new we'll call this [1614] indeed companies and then going to feed [1616] in all this data which is a again [1618] horrendously [1621] formatted let's bring all that stuff way [1624] up o that's a little [1627] small I'm only doing this because I've [1629] had several YouTube comments that say [1631] they actually love how OCD I am and bit [1633] stuff like this so uh okay we have a [1635] list of indeed companies what we'll do [1636] is we will share this [1642] now going to copy this link what we have [1645] to do is we have to go back to um our [1648] Phantom Buster and we have to paste this [1650] link in and now it's going as you as you [1652] see It'll say you can give your company [1653] names in one of the following formats a [1654] single company name which is just [1655] literally the name the URL of a Google [1658] sheet containing a list of company names [1659] the URL of a CSV file containing a list [1662] of company names so you can feed in a [1663] bunch of different information whatever [1664] you want the name of the column matching [1666] companies for us is just going to be [1667] company that's the one that matters [1669] right because that's back over here and [1672] you'll see that it actually already [1673] pulled out all of the all of the options [1675] for us description description HTML that [1676] sort of thing anywh who from there we [1679] save we're going to leave this empty and [1680] leave the results fall empty I'm going [1682] to click save as well and then I'm going [1683] to click launch manually uh what this is [1685] going to do now is this is going to if [1687] we click launch go out and then look up [1690] all of these companies on LinkedIn um to [1692] see if we could return a company URL now [1695] this takes I don't know I mean depending [1697] on the size of your list as you see um [1699] it's proceeding through one every like [1700] three or 4 seconds or so but if you had [1702] I don't know like a thousand companies [1703] or something this might actually take [1705] you a fair amount of time uh the reason [1706] why is cuz they're attempting to not get [1708] rate limited by LinkedIn when they do [1709] the search and so that's just something [1711] that you have to uh you know play around [1713] with as you see these companies are huge [1714] Salesforce Amazon web services alveo [1717] Technologies um and as you know I've [1720] discussed ideally your search would be a [1721] lot more specific than just automation [1723] like I was doing back there might prefer [1724] specifically to a software platform it [1726] might be some program manager type that [1729] does one thing some marketing uh [1730] function or whatnot the idea being once [1733] you have that search you'll have a much [1734] smaller companies who will be much more [1736] likely to actually respond to your Emil [1738] Outreach unlike you know open AI or [1739] something and then once you're done you [1741] receive a list of basically all of the [1744] companies with LinkedIn URLs that we [1745] were able to find so as you see we fed [1747] in 14 and we actually received 14 which [1749] is quite unheard of just because the [1751] size of the business is if I to imagine [1753] what I'm going to do is I'll [1757] say companies and then from here we'll [1760] go LinkedIn URLs then I'm going to feed [1762] in what I just got from Phantom buer a [1767] second ago [1768] append this import this data and now [1771] you'll see that we actually received the [1773] LinkedIn URL okay so now you're probably [1775] wondering all right Nick we've just done [1777] like three different steps here now we [1778] have the LinkedIn URL uh what do we do [1780] next well the really cool thing about [1782] Phantom Buster is once you get the [1784] LinkedIn URL you can do a ton of stuff [1785] with it um most of the time the LinkedIn [1787] URL contains believe it or not the [1789] website as well and then once you have [1791] the website you can take that website [1793] and then use it to uh you know find [1794] people at that company okay so from here [1796] what we do is we feed in the exported [1798] LinkedIn URL to this scraper called [1801] LinkedIn company [1803] scraper and it looks like I reached my [1806] limit of the number of phantoms I can [1807] have running concurrently so I just have [1809] to delete one of these I'm just going to [1810] delete this one because this is a [1812] test and then I'm also going to delete [1814] this one because there's just no need [1815] for me to have [1817] that okay so we're going to go back here [1820] to company and then I'm grab the [1822] LinkedIn company [1823] scraper and then from here um we can [1826] actually just feed it in the company [1827] urls uh as well so as you can see we're [1829] kind of going back and forth and back [1831] and forth a few times but that's okay um [1834] the really cool part is you can actually [1835] chain all this stuff in together using [1837] automation so LinkedIn URLs right here [1840] what sort of columns do we want to keep [1841] in this file we can keep all of them if [1842] we wanted to first name last name [1844] company name email location query Tim [1846] stamp LinkedIn URL description [1848] title then we need to obviously connect [1851] to LinkedIn like we did before um I'm [1853] just going to scrape oh I guess we only [1855] do 10 per launch or something like that [1856] I don't know I'm going to do more I'm [1857] going to do like 20 just because I have [1858] 15 right what we can do is we can save [1860] each company logo as a JPEG if you want [1863] we could extract related company Pages [1865] which is pretty cool and then we can [1866] also grab the about page of each company [1868] I'm going click save launch that puppy [1871] manually and then let's give it a launch [1874] um we set a 3 second delay between each [1878] uh run as you can see so that 3second [1880] delay should be sufficient for us not to [1882] get super rate limited or anything like [1884] that um the really cool part about using [1887] uh f phant Busters a lot of the time [1888] Phantom Buster includes like built-in [1890] controls to prevent you from getting [1891] your account banned or whatnot um I [1894] think they have some warning feature [1895] that they recently implemented or [1896] something like that but you know there [1899] there you do always run a risk of having [1900] your LinkedIn account um activity seen [1903] by whatever their AI is that's [1905] monitoring this sort of thing um and if [1907] they do decide that your activity is not [1909] human if it's like bot activity or [1910] something like that you know you do run [1911] the risk as a suspension or something [1913] along those lines so just keep that in [1914] mind every time that you're doing [1915] scraping or working with a third partyy [1917] plat form there is always that risk um [1920] it's usually minimal and I personally [1921] have never been put out by it um I've [1923] had a couple of accounts paused [1925] temporarily um I have had like a couple [1927] of email accounts banned by uh Google [1930] and then like deliverability is so [1931] heavily tanked that like I you know [1933] could send a million emails not a single [1935] one would ever make it but when it comes [1936] to using stuff like Phantom muster apify [1938] and stuff like that as long as you're [1939] smart as long as you operate within the [1940] recommended limits you'll probably be [1941] fine all right so we just ran that [1943] scraper it is now finished if we scroll [1944] down here you'll see that now we have [1946] way more information than we had before [1948] we have the LinkedIn URL we have a logo [1950] the banner the description most [1951] importantly though we have a website and [1953] as you'll see sometimes the website will [1955] include like a LinkedIn account instead [1957] um usually if the company doesn't have a [1959] website or you couldn't find one does [1961] something like that um but for the most [1962] part we get the companies right so now [1964] what do we do well we download those [1966] results a fourth [1970] time maybe we go like websites and then [1973] we import [1975] this keep in mind you don't again have [1977] to do this importing I'm just doing this [1978] because I like personally to keep [1979] everything organized you can absolutely [1982] develop automated systems that enable [1983] you to do stuff like this for the most [1985] part automatically I'm just going to [1987] delete those uh rows and I'm going to [1988] double click this and then I'm just [1989] going to make this a little easier for [1991] me to see and then if you scroll all the [1993] way down to the right uh you'll see you [1994] get a bunch of info you get like the [1995] about page here which is very useful if [1997] you want to customize stuff um you even [1999] get like the logo so what you could do [2001] with this is you could literally well [2002] maybe we'll do something like this you [2004] can take this logo um you know if this [2007] is like a smaller company or something [2008] like that not like a major business like [2010] this you could feed this into artificial [2012] intelligence have it tell you stuff [2013] about this I mean godamn what a cool ass [2015] freaking cover photo um anyway and then [2018] what you do is you go down to the [2019] website like this here once you have the [2023] website you can do the same thing that [2025] we just did a moment ago in on email [2027] finder which is you know you can feed in [2029] the [2030] company then it'll go through and it [2033] will find email addresses at said [2035] company for you which is pretty neat so [2037] I'm doing this on a one by one basis and [2038] you can see we found one email address [2040] at that URL but ideally what you do is [2042] you just uh take the whole spreadsheet [2044] that we had pump that into bulk search [2045] and do the same thing that I've already [2046] showed you how to do all right we're [2048] really getting deep now the next flow I [2049] want to show you guys is LinkedIn groups [2051] to Phantom Buster group scraper to any [2053] mail finder um I believe you guys are [2056] probably starting to see the trend here [2057] the trend is we come with some primary [2059] data source we for the most part look [2060] for either a website or LinkedIn URL and [2063] then from there we're capable of [2064] extracting stuff like email addresses [2065] using common email enrichment platforms [2068] so let's say you're on LinkedIn right [2070] like I am I love my LinkedIn a really [2073] cool part about LinkedIn is they include [2075] this group feature so you can search for [2077] groups maybe like automation make.com or [2080] something you can then filter for said [2084] groups so a automation with make.com [2086] make.com Community I should probably [2088] start one of these honestly just giving [2089] the size of my Channel at this point um [2091] anyway uh what you do is you know you [2092] can join a bunch of these groups right [2094] inside of these groups you have a list [2095] of the members which is pretty neat um I [2098] think you get information about the [2099] admin and stuff like that as well and [2101] obviously you can imagine how people in [2102] these groups are obviously there because [2104] they want to they're probably in your [2105] target Niche they're probably talking [2106] about things that are related to your [2107] target Niche and odds are they have [2109] problems that you can solve so what you [2111] do is you take these groups and then you [2113] go back to Phantom [2115] Buster and let me just see the solutions [2118] page just typed in group what you'll see [2121] is there's LinkedIn group members export [2124] right over here uh there's even LinkedIn [2126] group members to emails which is I think [2128] a a hyper optimized way of doing things [2129] this probably includes you calling a uh [2132] you know like an email enrichment [2133] service is built in but you know for the [2135] purpose of this let me just show you [2136] what this would look like if you were to [2137] do this manually you have a LinkedIn [2139] group members export [2141] right from here you can then feed in [2143] either an individual LinkedIn group URL [2146] or you can actually just get a whole [2148] spreadsheet and then make a list of [2149] LinkedIn group [2150] URLs so I might do like LinkedIn groups [2155] I might do like LinkedIn group URL maybe [2159] like LinkedIn group name right do [2161] something like this and then you just [2164] paste in all of the URLs of the LinkedIn [2167] groups which I do not know where mine [2170] went in particular right right over [2172] here and then you know you can like add [2175] more information to this if you want to [2177] you could also Source LinkedIn groups [2179] from a scraper I believe appify has [2181] somewhere on there like a [2183] LinkedIn group scraper something like [2186] that where you can a list of LinkedIn [2188] groups as opposed to just necessarily [2190] the the group members themselves um but [2192] anyway what you do is you paste in the [2194] URL of a [2195] group and then you could say how many [2197] groups to scrape how many members to [2199] scrape per group all that stuff then [2201] what it'll do is it'll actually go and [2203] then it'll scrape the freaking group [2204] members for you and now you have a list [2205] of people that are basically in your [2207] exact target Niche that you can then use [2209] to feed into something like animail [2211] finder um you could scrape the the [2214] profiles of all of these people using [2216] one of many different software platforms [2217] to be honest um but then you know from [2219] there you end up with the data in a very [2221] similar format to what we had earlier [2223] which uh you know you can then use to [2225] generate leads and then add to your [2226] email campaign all right from here on [2227] out you end up with a list of full names [2229] first names last names you can get some [2230] headlines and you also get a profile URL [2232] this information may be sufficient for [2233] you to get out there and do whatever you [2235] want to do I mean I don't see a company [2236] name so you might have to go a little [2237] further than that or you'd have to find [2238] a way to extract it from here um what [2240] you could do after this if you wanted to [2242] get like the complete profile [2244] information is you could run this [2245] through yet another scraper um and that [2247] would be LinkedIn [2250] profile so I'm going go down here [2251] LinkedIn profile [2254] scraper and you know I mean I'm out of [2257] phantoms at this point and I'm not going [2258] to go through the whole flow of me [2259] adding it and waiting and that sort of [2261] thing but what this does is it allows [2262] you to feed in a list of LinkedIn fan uh [2265] LinkedIn profile URLs then it goes in [2267] and actually scrapes the URL returns all [2270] of these data points first name last [2272] name School degree company name a full [2274] name subscribers right everything you [2276] could ever possibly need and certainly [2278] more than enough for high quality [2279] personalization all right the last lead [2281] sourcing method is a little specific and [2282] it's certainly a lot pricier than most [2284] of the other ones that I mentioned but I [2285] felt like I had to mention it anyway uh [2287] it's built with uh forever ago built [2289] with used to be mostly free now what [2291] they do is they charge a ton of money [2293] for leads but a lot of the time these [2294] leads are quite high quality they're [2296] also leads that have specific software [2297] platforms that maybe you're marketing to [2299] so a good example of this is I was [2300] working with um one of my longtime [2302] clients and they were wanting to reach [2303] out to people that ran a very particular [2306] sort of like intercom chat widget in the [2309] bottom right hand corner of their [2310] website and so uh what we did is we went [2312] to builtwith and we just typed in the [2313] name of said little intercom widget it [2315] was like some knockoff brand three or [2318] four steps removed from intercom or like [2321] talk.io or something along those lines [2323] um and then we were able to instantly [2324] get a list of maybe two three 4 thousand [2327] of these um uh websites and then we were [2330] able to take these website URLs and then [2332] put them into any email finder extract [2334] email addresses and reach out to them [2335] and this is a hyper successful campaign [2337] because because you know there are very [2338] few websites out there that had this [2340] specific software platform on it uh [2342] because you know it was sort of like [2343] third rate and then everybody that we [2344] reached out to we mentioned the software [2346] platform we said ours is better and [2347] it'll save you a ton more money uh [2349] here's how to get started with it so you [2351] know you guys can run campaigns for [2352] anything from like Shopify website [2354] owners HubSpot website owners clavio [2357] right if a website has Magento on it or [2359] zenes or something along those lines [2361] it's super easy what they do is they [2363] just crawl the web constantly looking [2366] for uh let's see [2368] here looking for platforms that have [2371] little code Snippets that maybe have [2372] like ectron on it or Zoho Mail or crio [2375] and then they turn that into a list that [2378] you can [2379] purchase so I mean you know you could [2381] buy this list of 8,6 [2384] 53,5 31 if you wanted to um if I click [2387] download Lead list it's going to ask me [2389] to make an account here I'm just going [2391] to make a bogus [2395] one then you can see here that you can [2397] sign up for I believe like some [2398] unlimited trial or something like that [2400] even if you wanted to uh download a [2402] bunch of these [2404] yourself yeah maybe not I'm not entirely [2406] sure but anyway as you see um you have [2407] to spend a fair amount of money in order [2409] to like get in but the second that [2410] you're in you can scrape an unlimited [2412] number of these reports and of these [2414] lists of websites so you know it's kind [2416] of not necessarily worth it if you're [2418] small but it becomes very worth it if [2419] you're big right no real use in spending [2422] $295 to scrape two lists when you could [2425] spend $495 to scrape an unlimited amount [2427] uh and as you see you know you can get [2428] some pretty intense lists here I mean [2430] that one has seven or eight million or [2432] something uh you know maretto zenes even [2435] like very less understood or known of [2438] software platforms tend to pop up on [2440] here because this is sort of built with [2441] whole value proposition this is how they [2443] make their money uh I don't know maybe [2446] we'll do something with salana or [2448] something like that or uh some some some [2451] crypto coin thing [2453] right maybe we're looking specifically [2455] for websites that include coin ad right [2457] it's like a bitcoin-based ad Network [2459] looks like they're only 12 but you know [2461] as I'm sure you can imagine as evidenced [2462] by the fact that there are only 12 you [2463] can Niche down like crazy with built [2465] with and when you find something that [2467] works um it tends to work really really [2469] well all right I hope you guys enjoyed [2470] this list the top nine ways to Source [2472] leads for cold email campaigns in 2024 [2474] if some of what I was talking about [2476] seemed like magic to you or you didn't [2477] really understand some of the principles [2478] behind the scraping or the third party [2480] platforms I was using that's okay just [2482] check out my YouTube channel I have tons

Title: How I Save 10,000 Make.com Operations/Day (Google Sheets Hack)
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here and [1] in this video I'm going to show you how [2] to optimize your Google Sheets [4] operations usage in make.com I'm going [6] to show you how you can add thousands of [8] rows consuming just one operation using [11] a Nifty little API hack that I recently [13] found out so if you want to improve your [15] operational efficiency with make.com if [17] you want to save a little bit of money [18] for yourself or for your clients this is [20] the video for you stay tuned and let's [22] get into [23] it all right so here is our task we are [26] getting a bunch of information from a [28] web service called appify this is like a [30] web scraper that enables us to find [32] leads and you know Source information [34] off of websites and stuff like that and [36] what I want to do is I want to take all [38] of this information which right now is [40] first name uh LinkedIn profile title um [44] you know country and that sort of thing [46] and I want to dump all this into a [47] Google sheet why I don't know maybe some [49] member of my team is using this Google [51] sheet maybe this is like an intermediary [53] step before I upload it into a cold [54] email platform whatever the specific use [56] case is that's what we have to do and in [59] the past the way that would work is okay [61] let's hypothetically pretend that I am [63] scraping let me just use 100 operation [65] screw it um what i' have to do in the [68] past is if I click run once what's going [70] to happen here is this is going to go [71] through cycling down the entire list of [74] leads that I've generated and then dump [76] this into this Google sheet one [78] operation um or one row at a time and [81] you know if I wanted to put in a 100 of [82] these right because this uh module [84] outputed 100 bundles I'd have to [87] previously consume a whole 100 [89] operations to do so and I just did [90] because I love you all um we're at 75 [93] right now you can imagine how if you had [95] multiple modules in the scenario you [97] could consume a lot of our operations [98] really quick like let's say on top of [100] this you had I don't know another two or [102] another three um let's say in total we [104] had five modules in this flow that's [106] something like 400 or 500 operations [108] that adds up right even if you run that [110] once per day you're already over the [112] limits of like the make.com Pro Plan and [114] you're already having to start to dig in [115] your wallet a fair amount so you know we [117] don't want to have to do this anymore we [119] don't want have to manually go row by [121] row by row what I'm going to do in this [123] video is I'm going to show you a better [124] way and the way that we're going to do [126] this is using the make.com and Google [128] Sheets API module so I'm going to go [131] down here to the bottom right hand [132] corner where it says Google sheets I'm [133] going to give that a click and what I [134] want to do is scroll all the way down to [136] the bottom to where it says make an API [138] call now you do not need to know how to [141] do any sorts of computer programming in [143] order to make this Modo work uh what I'm [144] going to do is I'm just going to open up [146] the syntax on another screen and then [148] that way I can run through this just [149] like you would be for your very first [151] time and then instead of this I'm just [154] going to unlink this module I'm going to [156] drag in the make an API call module [158] instead we're going to say bulk add to [161] sheet so remember this flow right here [165] this consumed 101 operations okay by the [168] end of this I'm going to show you how to [169] do the same thing uh in I believe three [172] operations total okay so bulk add to [175] sheet stick this in right here first [177] thing that we have to do is we have to [178] add a URL if you're un familiar with [180] what the URL of your sheet is um I'm [182] going to give you a quick and easy [183] formula that you can use right here and [185] I'm also going to include all this [186] information just in the video [187] description so if you need to copy and [189] paste it feel free you're also going to [190] get all of this stuff in the blueprint [192] and you'll just be able to swap out your [193] own so uh first of all the first [196] parameter in the URL is you need to put [197] in spreadsheets and then you need to go [199] slash and what you need to do is you [200] actually need to find the specific sheet [203] that you're interested in so um we found [205] the sheet that we're interested in then [206] we have to go to the URL go back/ d/ [210] what you want is you want the section [211] between backd SL and the section um uh [216] that's back sledit and you want to copy [218] that that is your spreadsheet ID we're [220] going to go back into our URL here and [223] then I'm going to do another slash then [225] I'm going to write values like this and [228] then you have um what's called the range [230] parameter the range is usually A to Z [233] unless you have more than Z columns in [235] your spreadsheet so in my case uh I'm [237] only using What four out of the 20 six [240] available ones in Z but hypothetically [242] if I added another column to the right [243] notice how we just looped around to a a [245] if I do it again now we're at a if I do [248] it again then we're at AC so these [249] additional columns here like if you had [251] data in these columns you a header um [253] you know you wouldn't be able to just do [255] a to z you'd have to do probably a to a [258] z or something like that instead but I'm [260] going to leave that for now we're just [261] going to do simple A to Z stuff because [263] most people don't have more than 26 [264] columns in their [265] spreadsheet and the last thing you need [267] to do is you need to add another colon [268] and then you need to use the word word [270] append this is just the Google Sheets [272] API you know you don't have to be a [274] programming professional as I mentioned [275] in order to make this work all you need [277] to do is just follow this structure next [280] go to method and then click [282] post and then you're going to leave the [285] headers as content type application Json [287] we're then going to go down a query [288] string here and then for key what we're [291] going to do is we're going to go value [293] input option and then value is going to [296] be user uncore entered all caps [300] the last thing we have to do is we have [301] to actually add the data itself and I'm [303] going to show you how to do this just [304] with a simple example first and then um [306] I'll show you how to actually like [307] Wrangle up all of the data that we're [308] generating out of this appify module but [311] the syntax is you go um squiggly colon [314] that has a better name than that I think [315] okay so curly brace uh comma sorry curly [319] brace double quote um values double [322] quote and then a colon and then what you [324] want to do is just for the purposes of [326] this demonstration you're going to do uh [328] one left square bracket and then another [330] left square bracket and then one right [332] and then one right and then another [333] curly bracket okay so everything that [337] I'm showing you here is necessary um and [340] this is just [342] templated everything from this point [344] onwards is your own data so the way that [348] this API I guess specification works [353] is basically if you have four columns in [356] your sheet then you need to insert an an [359] array that has four values okay so you [363] see here it says um you know there's a [365] LinkedIn URL and there's a title and [367] there's a first name then there's a [368] country let me just delete all of the [370] rest of these just as for the purposes [372] of this [374] example [375] oops okay great all deleted all we have [378] is that one example um I'm going to add [380] my myself in here and we're just going [382] to see what that looks like let's [383] hypothetically say my LinkedIn profile [385] is linkedin.com [386] Nicholas SAR that is no longer [388] hypothetical and pretty sure that's my [390] actual LinkedIn profile um what did we [393] have next we had a title so my title is [395] uh let's say fractional consultant I [398] don't even know if that's a term but I'm [399] making it one uh my name is Nick and [402] then what was that last column on the [403] spreadsheet country right my country is [406] Canada okay so there are four values in [409] this array that's number one that's [412] number two this is number three and then [414] this is number four and for every one of [417] these values uh we need to have um a [421] corresponding column [423] here so now that that's done I'm going [425] to click okay and then just because this [427] is a test I'm going to right click this [429] and click run this module only and if [432] you put in everything right you'll get a [433] status code of 200 if we go back here [436] what you'll see is I've just added in [438] one more row to my [440] spreadsheet the issue with this is well [442] this still consumed an operation we only [444] added one row we don't actually want to [445] do that what we want to do is we want to [446] add substantially more than one row [448] right and this is this is where you get [450] into text aggregation which I'm going to [452] run you guys through um right now so if [455] you think about it if I unlink this I [457] know I have a bunch of modules spread [459] out over here but if I run this module [460] only as we saw previously we get a ton [464] of um bundles right 1 two 3 four five [467] all the way down to [469] 100 this module the get data set items [472] from appify happens to Output multiple [474] bundles not every module is going to do [476] this but for most purposes you know if [478] you're like listing rows from Google [479] sheet or you're scraping information or [481] whatever uh your data will come in in [483] such a format if your data isn't coming [485] in a format you can make use of the [486] iterator [487] module to take uh data that is [490] constructed as an array and then to [491] iterate through it and then you know [492] construct multiple bundles like this um [494] if you guys don't know how to do that or [496] if iterating and aggregating just seems [497] like witchcraft to you then definitely [499] check out my iterators and aggregators [500] Master Class by the end of it you'll [501] know everything you need to know to [503] actually make money with make.com using [505] iterators and aggregators but in this [506] video I'm going to run you through a [507] very particular type of aggregator [509] called the text aggregator and I'm going [510] to show you how it [512] works okay so uh for the purpos of this [515] example I'm just going to Output five [517] because I don't want this to be super [519] lengthy and then I'm going to open up [521] this text aggregator I'm going to select [522] the source modu as app IFI get data set [524] items there's only one uh module here so [526] that sort of makes sense and then what [528] we have to do next we have to construct [529] the text that we're creating well let me [532] give you a quick example so there were [533] there was some data that we wanted to [534] pull in right let me just um go back to [536] the sheet we wanted the LinkedIn URL the [537] title the first name in the country so [539] let me actually go and let me grab all [540] that data uh the LinkedIn URL was here [542] and I'm just going to add these vertical [544] lines here and you'll see why in a [546] second [547] title then we'll do first [550] name and then I'm going to do uh country [554] as [555] well I'm going to do another space so we [557] have LinkedIn URL space vertical line [559] space title space vertical line space [561] first name space vertical line space [563] country okay and I just want to show you [565] what this looks like when you run it [566] it's going to give you a warning here [568] because uh purple modules are [569] Transformers that's all right just exit [571] that out and after if we click on the [574] output what we'll see is what we've [576] basically done is we've gone through the [578] five bundles that we provided as input [580] and then we've just concatenated them [582] all together AK we've just added them [585] together now this is not in any format [588] that we could use via like an API call [590] right because this is a format that I [591] Just Whipped out of my ass I said screw [592] it I want vertical lines in between each [594] entry but if you think about it what you [597] could do with this text aggregator is [598] you could you could use the same [600] functionality that generated as this [601] string here to generate an array that [604] feeds into the bulk make an API call [607] module you can construct this in the [609] right format that it likes um so that [611] you know you can you can actually use [612] this as part of the API call how do you [615] do this well it's pretty simple first [616] you use a square bracket on the left [618] just like we did there and then you wrap [620] everything in quotes and then you add a [622] comma [624] space comma space [631] and then a comma and then we close it [635] and this is now what this looks like we [636] have a LinkedIn URL which is wrapped in [638] quotes a title which is wrapped in [639] quotes a first name which is wrapped in [640] quotes and then a country um and that [642] last one does not have a quote because [644] if it ends in an array right this the [646] last value we don't put um sorry we [649] don't put a comma at the end okay [650] there's one more thing we have to [652] do and that's we have to go to row [654] separator and then click other and then [656] just type a comma and this is just part [658] of the formatting this is just how we [660] need to do this in order to make this [661] work but if I run this example now and [663] actually look into it this is what our [665] output is now we have an array with four [668] values LinkedIn up here title here first [671] name here and then the country if you [673] think or if you think back to our [675] example this matches our template or our [676] layout basically perfectly right um and [679] then we have uh I think I put in an [681] extra space or something like that which [683] I didn't have to so I'm going to go back [684] and fix that but then you have a space [685] then a comma and then you have another [687] one then you have another one then you [690] have another one and just sort of like [692] over and over and over again um until [695] you know we we finish the data set which [697] is awesome so let me just see uh why we [701] had that right I actually added an extra [702] space in there so I'm just going to [703] remove that space and then what I'm [705] going to do is now I'm going to connect [706] this over to our bulk ad to sheet module [708] and we're actually going to work with [709] live data this time instead of fake data [710] so you see down here where it says [713] values what we have to do is we just [715] have to format this now to delete our [718] old old um array then all we have to do [721] is just stick our new array in between [723] these two brackets because basically [725] what's happening is we're feeding it in [726] an array of arrays so everything inside [729] a text here this is going to be our [730] array and then we need to wrap that [732] array of arrays in this um the square [735] bracket so I'm going to click okay and [738] then just to show you guys the power of [739] this I'm going to go back to this I'm [741] going to delete my record then instead [743] of five I'm going to do [746] 100 just to show you guys how many oper [749] we can save by running it this [752] way okay so if I look back on my sheet [756] we see that we've now added a whole [758] whopping 100 additional rows to this but [762] if we look back to our our module we'll [764] see that uh they'd only had to consume a [766] single op in order to uh to work which [769] is pretty cool why don't I go a little [771] bit further why don't we just delete all [772] of this [773] again and then instead of 100 why don't [776] we just max out the data let's just see [777] how many rows we can get in this bu [780] I'm just going to go all the way up [783] press run once and even though we're [786] pulling in like hundreds of Records [788] now you can see that we just iterated [790] through 950 records and all it consumed [794] was a single op not bad if I do say so [797] myself so if we just take one step back [799] and we think to how many operations it [802] would have taken if we'd stuck with the [803] ad row I mean we would have iterated [806] through this um it would have consumed a [808] single operation to Output 950 then we [810] would have had to individually do 950 um [813] module executions for the row that would [815] been 951 in total right we basically got [819] 951 in total down to three uh and my [822] math ain't so good but that's a factor [825] of [826] 316 almost 3117 times more [829] efficiently so I hope that this makes [832] sense I hope you guys found a lot of [833] value in this what I'm going to do is [835] I'm just going to um export this right [837] now as a blueprint and then I'm going to [838] put this underneath uh the Youtube [840] description so you guys all have access [842] to it but there are a few other ways you [844] can use the bulk ad to sheet [846] functionality here the Google Sheets API [849] and if you guys have interest in that [850] just let me know more than happy to make [852] another video I'm showing you guys some [853] of the more some of the other things [855] that you can do with Google Sheets and [856] and that sort of deal great I hope you [858] guys appreciated this video I had a lot [860] of fun putting it together if you have [861] any questions or anything like that just [862] drop them down below as a comment I [864] Source most of my YouTube ideas from [867] comments at this point as well so if you [868] want me to do something or record [869] something specifically then please leave [871] that below otherwise like subscribe do [873] all that fun YouTube stuff and I'll [875] catch you on the next video

Title: This piece of information changed my perspective on hiring and business as a whole.
[0] the vast majority of the time when I [1] enter a business at least a third of the [4] staff members they do absolutely nothing [6] when I say nothing I mean like in terms [7] of their like actual deliverable output [9] it's something that you could probably [11] do in an hour and you're giving them a [13] task for them to do like a whole month [15] so you could literally like if you just [16] wanted to say it I'm going to spend [18] the next hour doing something you could [19] usually accomplish that whole person's [21] month of work in an hour which is [23] obviously ridiculous and there's no need [25] to be spending 5 10 or $15,000 on [27] somebody to do something that you could [28] do in an hour that's like a terrible [30] Miss allocation of resources

Title: How I break down business tasks
[0] it looks like you have some task like [1] write an article or something and then [3] your whole job is to break that down [5] into a few subtasks and then try and [8] farm out as much as you can of those [9] subtasks to like a robot or chat gbt or [12] some small micro software company or [15] some like that and by chunking it [16] down you can usually just achieve much [18] higher profitability if you do [19] inevitably have to end up hiring for [20] that role anyway

Title: Tracking daily progress has been one of the easiest and highest ROI additions I've made.
[0] clearly Define daily accountability this [1] is more of a managerial thing than [3] anything else and this is something that [4] the vast majority of 7 and8 figure [6] agencies that I've seen experience [7] really fast growth inevitably screw up [9] on because when you're growing really [10] fast as a Founder business owner [12] entrepreneur whatever you want to call [13] yourself your time's extremely limited [14] and it becomes very difficult to break [17] something if it's not really broken or [19] try and fix something if it's not really [21] broken yet the issue with staff is that [23] they rarely chug along and be perfect [25] and then all of a sudden break all at [26] once it's more of like a slow inevitable [28] decline in your margins and their [29] performance and their ability to do [31] things and their respect for you as well [32] so in order to avoid that you need to [34] clearly Define daily accountability [36] practices it was Peter Jer that said you [38] can't improve what you don't measure and [40] I keep that in mind basically anytime [41] that I'm making a hiring decision for my [43] own company or for one of the many [44] companies that I do operations and [45] Consulting with

Title: 1on1s with employees should be simple and productive 📞
[0] when you or your manager does a [1] one-on-one a one-on-one if you guys are [2] familiar is just like a sort of like a [4] routine regular check-in you can do it [6] maybe once a week you can do it [7] bi-weekly you can do once a month there [9] are different implications depending on [11] frequency but whatever your one-on-one [12] frequency is it's basically just where [14] you check in and see how the person's [15] doing if they need any help if they have [16] any blockers when you're on your [17] one-on-one with that staff member with [19] your direct essentially just compare [21] their performance this period to last [22] period that's all you have to do you [23] don't even have to dive in there and [25] start providing structured [26] recommendations or working with them on [28] some performance plan if you just show [29] them somebody is watching their output [31] they'll usually perform a lot better

Title: Hiring full-time employees vs. contractors for your agency 👨‍💻
[0] 30 40 50 years ago was probably more [1] common just to have a team of like six [3] or seven employees that were salaried [4] and inh house and you pay them a certain [6] amount every day today you have [8] contractors Freelancers flexible temp [10] workers there are a variety of other job [12] types that make this a little more [14] complicated especially for agencies at [16] around the 78 figure mark because they [17] typically employ a ton of contractors so [19] what I'd recommend here is if you run an [20] agency and you have a bunch of [21] contractors you want to apply this to [22] your business calculate Revenue per [24] employee and revenue per contractor [25] differently because they do different [26] things most of the time and they sort of [27] have different value propositions and [29] different Hing Logistics it's a lot [31] easier to hire a contractor than it is [32] to hire a full-time salaried employee

Title: Don't default to hiring in your business ❌
[0] you just don't need to hire in the vast [2] majority of cases and usually there is a [4] much better outcome or Choice really if [7] you don't hire instead of hiring being [8] your first call anytime you're facing a [10] problem try and make it your last call [11] and I guarantee you your company's going [13] to be substantially more cost effective [14] not only is it going to be more cost [15] effective it's also going to be leaner [16] it's also going to be faster because [18] when you have fewer people in a company [19] information disseminates quicker you [21] have less managerial overhead you need [23] to loot fewer people into the meeting [25] you have fewer opportunities for lowest [27] denominators to basically bottleneck [28] your flow

Title: Why I like B2B tech as a target niche for automation agencies 💻
[0] B2B Tech often has very similar sales [1] processes to agencies and I've talked a [3] lot about how the agency sales process [5] looks but there's usually some sort of [7] Discovery call or demo call sometimes [9] there's a big super expensive sort of [11] closing call where you get the person to [12] say yes to you and then there's usually [14] some proposal there's a quote there's an [15] agreement there's a sort of like drawn [17] out more like old-fashioned old timey [19] sales process it's not just like a [20] button that you click and you accept the [21] terms and conditions and then you pay so [24] because of that you have a lot of stuff [25] that you can automate you can template [26] proposals you can template um quotes and [29] agreements and stuff like that using Ai [30] and no code and there's a ton of sales [32] leverage there for the companies because [34] companies like this typically spend a [35] lot of their sales Budget on sales [37] Administration

Title: One of the things I look for when picking a niche 📝
[0] I look for niches that have no or poor [2] project management systems I look for [4] ones that typically have very complex [5] org charts org chart just refers to the [7] distribution of people in a business [9] right CEO CTO coo maybe a director of [12] marketing director of sales I look for [14] people with these really bloated work [16] charts typically where they don't [17] necessarily need to be anywhere near as [19] bloated but they are just because that's [20] how the niche does things

Title: Why hiring in a business should increase your profit ⬆️
[0] the purpose of a business is to produce [1] revenue and the purpose of you hiring [3] staff is to assist you in the generation [5] of that Revenue I think some people at [7] this point are probably going to be like [8] oh well no you know the purpose of this [9] guy is to like help maintain the back [11] end or whatever but by maintaining the [13] back end he's allowing you to continue [14] producing revenue and potentially [15] increase the rate at which you are [16] producing Revenue so logically every [18] time you hire somebody you should be [20] adding to your bottom line

Title: My take on making money. What're your guys thoughts?
[0] I'm not going to lie like everybody says [1] that money doesn't make you happy but it [3] sure as hell cannot make you sad I hope [6] I said that right I come from a family [8] that's historically our family was [10] bankrupt for a large portion of my [11] childhood like in bankruptcy I think [13] that just colored how I viewed money [15] growing up and to me to be able to make [17] $48,600 in one month like that's more [20] money than I probably made the entire [22] year in 2020 granted that was [24] exceptional because it was Co but maybe [25] even like 2021 as well just having [28] access to that Capital has freed me up [29] from problems that I didn't really know [31] that I had and I would highly recommend [33] every man woman or child at some point [35] in their life try give their life like a [37] couple of years to like really try and [39] push and try and make a ton of money [40] like it's freaking amazing and it does [41] change the way that you view the world

Title: Why The Theory of Constraints is so important in business 📈
[0] but basically the theory of constraints [1] visualizes your entire business as a [2] pipeline from end to end where there's [4] your raw Goods coming in at the [6] beginning of the pipeline and then [7] there's some transformation happening in [8] the middle and then there's the finished [10] high quality products coming out at the [11] end of the pipeline and you basically [13] make money based off the distance [15] between your like shitty raw good and [18] then the high quality product and like [20] that's that's where your Arbitrage is so [21] in the theory of constraints your whole [23] goal is to maximize the width of that [24] pipeline at every step if you notice [26] that there's a space in your pipeline [28] like let's say in a writing agency it [29] might be like the QA or the editing and [31] that that space is like constraining or [33] bottlenecking the rest of your flow [35] theory of constraints is it's just a [36] systematic way of alleviating that and [37] then setting up your pipeline in such a [39] way that like every stage is just moving [41] along as constantly and as high [42] throughput as possible

Title: How I run one of my businesses 📊
[0] the other business that I operate is [1] sort of like a consultancy it's a very [2] interesting sort of business and I used [4] to have a partner for it it was the same [5] partner that I started once I copy with [6] and I no longer work with on this [8] business just cuz we decided that we go [10] our separate ways no hard feelings or [12] anything really enjoy working with them [14] but the way that this business works is [16] it's essentially like at one second copy [18] I built a bunch of systems that enabled [19] me to make a lot of money quickly and [21] like get clients and then I use those [23] systems to get clients for my service [25] which is one second copy and that was [26] good what I realized is why don't I just [29] use the systems and then sell the [30] systems as a way to make money for any [32] business you know isn't the upside [33] potential significantly higher over [35] there what if set of content writing [36] it's a very high growth industry maybe [38] something like lead gen or you know some [40] info product business and then I just [41] build a system that enables them to go [43] from 300K to like a mill well I'm pretty [45] sure if I were to take a percentage of [46] that 300K to a mill at [48] $700,000 I'd make way more money than I [50] would with one second copy and so far it [52] appears to be true

Title: How I pitch different sized companies 📞
[0] every business I work with is usually [1] quite different and that enables very [3] interesting sort of work day I've worked [4] with a variety of businesses on this now [6] from like six figure smaller companies [8] that are just getting started that might [9] have some startup Capital to seven [11] figure companies which are probably the [12] most common to even eight figure [13] companies to develop systems that like [15] shave three or four% off their margins [17] so depending on whatever place that [18] they're in you know my value proposition [20] sort of changes and it's no longer like [22] if you're very early on in your business [23] I'm usually pitching how I'm going to [24] help you make money up front if you're a [26] little later on in the business you guys [27] are at seven or eight figures I'm [28] usually pitching how like my operations [30] will improve your profitability and your [31] margins just cuz that's really where the [33] priority is and I tried doing this in a [35] productized way as well where I would [36] like charge somebody a fixed amount of [38] money for $1,400 a month and then offer [40] some type of fixed service and it [41] doesn't really seem to be working that [43] well people like to have Consultants on [45] retainer I found and it seems just quite [47] difficult to pitch them on a deliverable [48] that I can consistently provide every [49] single month for $4,400 that part's not [52] going the best but my pricing does seem [53] to be relatively variable relatively ad [55] hoc and it's resulted in me being able [57] to make a ton of money

Title: How my content agency differs from a traditional agency 🤝
[0] I run two businesses the first is called [1] one second copy this is essentially a [4] productized Content Marketplace and all [6] that that really means is you know [8] instead of being like a traditional [9] agency where you'll sign up and I'll try [11] and Pitch you on some big monthly [13] package and you'll be assigned an [14] account manager that sort of thing a [16] productized agency just strips away [18] literally everything except for the [20] actual deliverable that you're getting [22] and then usually gives you like just a [24] very simple straightforward way to order [26] something and then does it all in like a [28] completely automated fashion well in our [30] case we're offering content writing [31] services and so if you think about the [32] way that a Content writing agency [33] usually operates it's like you know you [35] sign up you have some type of kickoff [37] call you have some type of SEO strategy [39] like content road map you have like all [40] of this stuff around the actual [42] deliverable that you know your agency [43] supposedly produces which is the content

Title: Explaining buyer awareness 🧐
[0] there's a term when you're in sales and [1] I used to be in sales for quite a while [2] I was doing door to door for maybe two 2 [4] and a half years of my life and it's the [6] problem buyer awareness but essentially [8] the way that it works is there are [10] different levels of prospects the [12] hardest level of prospect is the one [14] that doesn't understand the problem [15] doesn't understand the solution and then [17] doesn't understand why you're the right [18] fit for the solution so if you want to [19] sell them on something you have to sell [20] them on three separate levels you have [22] to literally inform them with the [23] problem is inform them about the [25] solution and then inform them about hey [27] here's why you should work with me [28] specifically example is CRM a lot of [30] people don't realize that not having a [32] CRM in their business maybe their [33] business makes $50 to $100,000 a month a [35] lot of them don't even realize that [36] that's a problem

Title: You don't have to be a genius to make money online ❌
[0] learn the client management skills they [1] necessarily having to learn all that [2] extra at the beginning you can [4] then easily go backwards and then iron [6] that stuff out with money and experience [8] and this is more or less described like [9] my own business trajectory this isn't [11] necessary for something to be good but [13] if you think about it logically if a lot [14] of other people have done this and these [15] people aren't necessarily Geniuses [17] they're not super smart they're not [18] super incredible they're just diligent [20] they're ambitious and they're willing to [21] put a little bit of work in every day if [22] you look at opportunities like this and [24] you see other people making money you [25] should know that you can make money on [27] this platform too if you're all of the [28] above so I'm one of them there are [30] thousands of high earners it's a proven [31] platform it's been around for a long [32] time it's not going anywhere it's worthy [34] of you investing at least an hour or so [35] a day for the next couple of months

Title: Learn Regex For Make.com In 34 Minutes
[0] what's going on everybody in this video [1] I'm going to give you a no for alls [2] practical way to use Rex in make.com I [5] currently run a make.com community with [7] 400 members and one big thing that's [9] come up over the course of the last few [10] weeks is hey how the heck do I actually [12] use all this Rex stuff to parse data so [15] if Rex is something you've personally [16] struggled with in make.com this is the [18] video for you I'm going to guide you [19] through a bunch of practical examples [20] and practical ways you can use it not [22] just dry academic Theory let's get into [26] it all right so first of all what is Rex [29] well Rex stands for regular expression [32] and I have been yelled at many times in [33] this channel because of how I pronounce [34] it um but essentially it is a sequence [37] of characters that specifies a pattern [40] in text and in make.com what you do in [42] order to use it is use this text parser [45] or match pattern module so you go down [47] here you scroll down to match pattern [50] and this is the one that you use the [51] cool part about rexes and why people [53] love them so much is they basically [54] allow you to create a set of rules that [56] if your text exists in the input that [58] you feed into it um can can match [60] specific strings and specific patterns [62] of characters and it's not just like [64] matching the same text over and over and [66] over again like you know how on your [67] browser if you hold command or control [69] and press F then type in a word like [71] pattern it'll find that exact word for [73] you right if it's present well rexes [76] allow you to instead of using a specific [78] word pattern Say Hey I want to look for [80] something that starts the letter P and [82] then um I don't know has like any [85] character in between and then um it [87] needs to have two T's and then an e and [89] then an n [90] and you know if that exists then rexes [93] the the Rex that you create will allow [94] you to find that you can imagine how [96] that very simple example can be [98] extrapolated and sort of expanded to [100] cover basically anything you could [102] possibly want it for and what I [103] personally find rexes are super useful [105] for in make.com is to find things like [107] URLs to extract lists of email addresses [110] from websites um to find specific [113] patterns and strings that may not be [114] formatted the way that you want to uh to [116] find names to pull out details contacts [119] customer information keywords and email [121] addresses resumés and that sort of thing [124] so if you master the use of Rex's if you [126] learn how to use regular expressions in [128] your make.com flows you'll be a lot more [130] powerful and just a lot more Adept of of [133] a power user I want to say so what I [135] have over here is I have four very [136] simple examples and I haven't actually [138] done a lot of prep in any of these [139] examples here I'm just going to sort of [141] do it and wing it as we go along the [143] reason being is because I want to show [144] you how I personally approach rexes when [145] I'm faced with them um I'm not actually [147] a Rex Pro I'm actually I probably [149] consider myself like very much in the [150] middle in the median 50th percentile [152] here I used them a little bit when I was [154] programming but when I started you know [155] make.com and I started really diving [157] into it I never really had to expand my [159] skills because of a few very simple [161] tricks and techniques that I'm going to [162] show you here um the cool thing about [165] rexes is you only need to know like [167] three or four of the little patterns off [169] the top of your head and then you can [170] either consult resources that are sort [172] of like Rex games which I'm going to [174] show you in a minute one's called Rex [175] 101 um or you could use AI to answer a [177] lot of those rex related questions for [179] you and I just have a little CLA um [182] sonnet instance open over here which I'm [183] going to be using to help me build this [185] but yeah we're going to start with the [186] simplest examples and then just work our [188] way up in terms of complexity and this [190] is going to cover what I would consider [191] the vast majority of the landscape to be [193] once you know how to do all four of [194] these if you just put in a little bit of [196] hard work uh and some elbow grease you [198] should be good for for more or less [200] anything okay so let's start here with [202] the very first example basic letters CAT [205] so what I have here is I have a set [207] multiple variables module here with a [209] variable called Rex me with a value the [212] quick brown fox jumps over the lazy cat [214] a cat the capital c is different from a [217] cat lower case but a caterpillar is not [219] a cat at all okay so what we want to do [222] is we want to find the presence of a cat [225] essentially we want to find find the cat [227] inside of this you can imagine how I [229] don't know um we are looking for some [232] keywords in either a resume well maybe a [234] resume isn't the best example but this [236] is like a maybe a book passage and we're [237] we're feeding as input in a book and [239] we're just looking for the presence of a [241] specific set of characters and what [243] we're going to do is we're going to feed [244] this into our text parser over here so [247] I'm going to use this as the [249] input and then I'm just going to put in [251] like a basic input here for now because [253] I want to show you guys how to use Rex [254] 101 and how I'd approach this but you'll [256] notice that there are a bunch of [256] settings here there's Global match case [258] sensitive multi-line single line [260] continue the execution the right the [261] module finds no matches these are all [263] just different configurations of the Rex [265] which I'll show you um and basically all [267] of these according to the the reject [270] language because re is basically a [271] language um these will change uh the way [274] that this works like uh if you do Global [277] match for instance it's as if you have [279] another string attached to the end of [281] your Rex that's something that really [282] confuses a lot of people and I'll [284] explain that in a moment but okay great [285] so if I have this what's my actual [287] workflow what do I personally do when I [288] build my flows and you know I've made [289] tons of money with make.com um let me [291] show you exactly how somebody that has [293] done that would proceed I'd go on a [295] website like Rex [297] 101 or um i' just type Rex tester over [300] here and you'll see that there are a [301] bunch of these tester debugger whatever [304] solution you want to use they basically [305] do the same thing they enable you to [307] paste a text string down here and then [309] they allow you to play with the [310] Expressions up top in order to find you [313] know uh the the string that you want and [315] this is just a much faster way of doing [317] Reax than testing it inside of make.com [319] if you test it inside of make.com you're [320] going to have to run then you're going [321] to have to look at the results then you [322] have to go back and run look at the [323] results you're going to be wasting [324] operations and it's just going to take [326] like 100 times the the amount of time so [328] what I do is I I open up r 101 and then [330] I paste in whatever string an example [332] input for the string that I'm looking to [334] to source so uh you know most of you [336] guys are probably going to have Dynamic [337] inputs you're going to have different [338] inputs coming in every time because [339] you're calling some resource or doing [341] some API call or watching an email or [343] whatever um just get an example of an [345] input that has the string character that [347] you want and then use that to feed in [350] what you're looking for once you've done [352] that we can actually start building the [354] regular expression now the cool part [356] about Redux 101 one of the reasons why I [357] like him so much is because on the right [359] hand side here they have this quick [360] reference if we go down here to um [363] common tokens you'll see they've [364] actually and I know my face is sort of [366] covering this let me see if I [367] can I know Zoom way out maybe okay that [371] definitely doesn't work you zoom in a [373] little bit oh I know we're gonna drag [376] this all the way over [379] here um okay let me just do this as you [383] see down here at the bottom we have a [385] bunch of common tokens so there's uh I [387] don't know Single Character of a or C if [390] you want to match a b or c what you need [391] to do is you need to do a square bracket [393] and then the letters a b or c if you [395] were to put this in it would match one [397] instance of a b or c if you were to use [400] a square bracket and then type in this [401] up carat and then go ABC it would look [403] for any characters except a b or c so [407] what I'm going to do here is I'm [407] actually going to try this out on a [409] couple of [409] rexes um I'm going [412] to do this right now I'm going to put in [414] these brackets and then I'm going to [415] match the letter a and let's just see [417] what happens if you type in this [420] then you say you know match the letter A [422] what this will do is this will look for [423] every instance of a in the [425] string now I'll talk about why it's [427] looking up every instance it's because [429] we set the global flag if I remove the [431] global flag it'll actually describe the [432] first instance but let's just do Global [434] because it's a little easier to see how [435] this works but basically um this is just [438] one of the many programming rules that [441] Rex allows you to engage with right uh [443] square bracket and then any string [445] inside like let's say u i c or something [449] it's going to match every one of these [450] letters but it's going to do it [452] individually okay now contrast that with [455] if I were just type UIC if I type UIC [458] it's going to match the entire UIC [459] inside of quick whereas if I type [461] bracket UIC basically the inherent uh [464] logic here is match um u i or C whatever [469] one of those characters comes in which [470] is why we all of a sudden we're matching [472] U we're matching c c u c i right we're [475] matching a bunch of characters inside [477] here but what does the what does a match [480] really mean well as you see right here [482] on the right hand side there's like [483] match one match two match three match [484] four in make.com when you match [487] something what you're really doing is [488] you're returning it um as a variable [490] that you can then use later on so if I [492] were to do this myself right uh let's [494] see what did we what would we do back [495] here UIC if I were to pump now this into [498] make.com and then if I were to run this [499] flow and just ignore the warning about [501] the [502] Transformer look at what we end up [504] getting basically every single time we [506] make a [507] match um we're going to get two things [509] one we're going to get the um index or [512] the number of the match so this is the [514] first thing that we match the second [515] thing the third thing the fourth thing [516] the fifth thing then we're going to get [517] the actual character that uh that we [519] matched here as well and you'll see that [521] we actually ended up matching 13 [522] different things so we've received 13 [524] different bundles as you can imagine [526] it's probably not that valuable to have [528] things laid out like this because every [529] time in make you have more than one [531] bundle you're going to run every [532] subsequent scenario more than one time [534] but I'm just showing you this just so [535] you guys get a little bit of familiarity [536] here the term match really just means [538] hey we're going to see this output in [540] make.com when we run it and the value [542] there is you can obviously use this in [543] your flow right you can look and see you [545] know if cat is present then do something [548] else okay great so we've covered a [550] couple of the basic characters here um [553] what I want to do next is I want to show [554] you guys my personal [556] favorites easily my simplest and and [559] most personal and most commonly used [561] character is this dot character because [563] that matches any single character in [565] your entire string so if I just type a [567] DOT for instance it will literally match [569] everything it's going to match the [571] characters T he it's going to match the [573] white space in between it's going to [574] match the periods the punctuation [576] literally everything okay and I actually [578] end up using this very very often in my [580] own Rex's because it's just sort of a [582] placeholder character you might be [584] thinking Nick why the hell would you [585] want to match everything but I'll show [586] you why in a second let's hypothetically [588] say that what I'm looking to match is [590] I'm looking to match any character and [592] then I'm looking to match any character [594] and then the letters H and E if I were [597] to type this in then this is now a [598] placeholder allows me to match any [600] instance of the whether it's like [601] uppercase the lowercase the or whatever [604] you can imagine if we had like something [605] else like [608] um Ash or something like that it'll [611] match the s in the in the charact in the [614] string as well right um I don't really [617] know what other words or characters or [619] strings start with [622] that okay so instead of me just staring [624] blankly into space for 5 minutes we're [626] just going to do a different example uh [628] let's pretend that it's any character [629] and then an S for instance right we [631] could do as we could do s we could do is [635] we could do Ys us right um it'll match [637] basically all of these and this is [638] really where like the the the power of [640] Rex has come into play because if you [642] know one or more of the characters in [644] the string that you're looking to match [646] like in an email for instance just show [647] you guys how to do in a second you can [649] basically like parse out the rest of it [651] and in this way you can get a very [652] structured response now I usually don't [655] just use this period in isolation what [657] I'll do is I'll use it with another [658] character and this is probably like the [660] single single highest Roi most common [663] Rex pattern that I'll use I'll use this [665] star what the star does is now I'm not [668] just trying to match any one character [670] what I'm doing is I'm matching any [671] character any number of [673] times so I know that this may seem a [675] little bit weird to you but let me give [676] you a practical example here let's say [678] I'm looking for this I want a space and [683] then I want any character and then I [685] want a comma okay what it's going to do [688] is it's going to [689] grab anything okay actually let's let's [692] do this then let's do a [695] space okay we'll do a and then we'll do [698] a space and then we'll do any character [700] any number of times with a comma after [701] it what this basically allows us to do [703] is it allows us to look for a pattern [705] where it starts with this a character [707] then has a space afterwards and then [709] matches any number of characters in [711] between as long as it ends with a comma [714] right you can imagine how if we're [716] looking for like an email address or [717] something it's really easy to do [719] something like [725] this and voila we've now match an email [728] address why because we're looking for [729] any character any number of times and [731] then an at then any character any number [733] of times then because uh the period is a [736] protected character in Rex you have to [737] escape it that just means you have to [739] add one of these in front of if you [740] actually want to match the period [741] character and we look for the actual [743] presence of a period and then we look [745] for some some ending over here um you [747] can imagine now if you wanted to stretch [748] this and make this Maybe not just. maybe [750] you wanted to do my website left click. [752] you'd have to change this up a little [753] bit instead of you'd have to go um you [756] know something else uh you could also [758] store any number of these um you could [760] have like let me see here there's a Rex [763] token or character which allows you to [764] match either one thing or another thing [767] so maybe we could do or [772] AI like this and I'll show you what the [775] bracket character means here but now we [777] can basically match either Nick at [778] google.com or we can match Nick at left [780] click. uh the point I'm making is [782] there's just a variety of of of [783] different ways to approach ax um and I [786] hope now that I've given you guys at [787] least a toolkit that you can use to [788] actually go out and build yours because [790] this is exactly what I do every single [792] time I'm approaching the Rex problem [793] it's exactly what I did when I was [794] starting out with Rex exactly what I do [796] now as somebody that you know builds [797] rexes on a daily [799] basis okay so that was a mouthful and I [801] know we went a little bit away from our [803] initial example which was just us trying [805] to find the character cat but you can [806] imagine how if you want to find the [807] character cat uh you'd basically just [809] type in cat okay so let me show you guys [811] what that looks like if you try and look [813] for the pattern [815] cat there are a couple of gotchas here [818] if I run this then I open this up what [821] you'll see is that basically we match [823] every instance of cat okay and that may [826] or may not be valuable to us um but we [829] have a little hack that we can use here [830] to instead of making it four bundles we [833] can get uh much better information if [835] you just write a left open bracket and [838] then what you're looking for and then a [840] right Open [841] Bracket and then you [843] run you end up with the actual character [846] that you found over here which is quite [849] valuable and then right now um we're [852] searching for all of the uh like we're [854] basically searching for all of the [855] instances because we have Global match [856] on but if I just wanted to see if cat [858] was present all I would have to do is i' [860] I'd click Global match off and then I'd [862] check this out and then basically if we [864] find cat we'll have cat visible to us in [867] the bundle selector and if we have that [869] well now we can you know use this to do [871] our logic we could say I don't know [875] cat exists and we could say cat and then [879] we could say exists and then down here [882] we could say cat does not exist we could [886] say cat does not exist in this way we're [889] now building in a little bit of logic to [891] our flow and we can use rexes basically [892] as like a permissive like hey is this [894] here is this not if it is then we'll do [896] something and then if it isn't we'll do [897] something else so very common design [899] pattern over here for cat but obviously [901] cat isn't a very realistic example [903] because why the heck would you want to [904] just like verify the presence of a [906] charact of a string of characters that [907] you know of couldn't you just do like [909] you know find and replace right like [910] couldn't I just like hold command F Type [912] cat and then like you know if it is [914] there then it's one thing if not then [915] it's another thing um there are multiple [917] other modules here to allow you to do [918] stuff like that um but you know we're [920] using this match pattern Rex one so [921] obviously why don't we like dial this up [923] a little bit and use Rex the way that is [925] meant to be used so I have a [927] hypothetical scenario over here um and [929] I'm just going [930] to I don't know I'm just going to like [933] write a bunch of random characters here [936] and we're just going to pretend that [937] this is some database that we're calling [939] with a bunch of random [940] strings and we're looking for the [943] presence of a particular ID in this [945] database okay um kind of contrived [948] example but we know that the IDS start [950] with the letter a1f and then they have a [952] bunch of other information afterwards [954] and basically if the ID starts with the [958] letter a1s F we know that it's valid and [960] then if it doesn't then we know that [962] it's not so a1e would not be valid um A9 [966] would not be valid but a1f this is valid [968] and what we're looking for is we're just [969] looking for this whole ID here okay okay [971] so how do we actually go about finding [973] this well I'm just going to copy this [974] here and I'm going to paste this down [975] here and then you can think about it [977] right now as if we're looking for the [979] presence of the a1f character then you [982] know there's a bunch of other characters [983] we could pick if we knew the pattern of [985] this and we knew that they were all [986] going to be lowercase A to Z and then [988] numbers uh you know 0 to 9 we could [991] theoretically write um let me [994] see 0 to 9 or A to Z I believe we could [1000] add as many of these as we wanted and [1002] that way we we'd always match um [1005] basically we'd match this particular [1007] string over here we could also like the [1010] quicker and easier way like what I [1011] personally would do is I probably just [1012] do this I'd go select everything but [1015] then notice how right now it's selecting [1017] all of the string uh basically from [1018] start to finish because this matches um [1021] any character including uh line [1023] Terminators right sorry uh uh new new [1026] lines and new spaces and stuff like that [1028] um what you can do instead is you could [1030] add a question mark to the end of this I [1032] believe and then a period and then a [1033] space rather um and now you're selecting [1035] everything here the reason why is [1036] because we're looking for a string [1038] that's formatted with a1f then we're [1040] looking for however many characters [1042] afterwards but what this question mark [1044] does is this question mark is called uh [1046] the non- greedy quantifier so basically [1048] it it stops you at the shortest possible [1052] match that that satisfies your search if [1056] we didn't add this question mark the [1058] shortest possible match of our search [1060] would just be a1f because this character [1062] is basically um zero to an Infinity [1065] number of any characters like that's [1067] what this little string here does um so [1070] just doing that we'll try and match just [1071] that little string right if we do a [1073] space though then basically we're saying [1075] we want you to match everything up to [1077] and including the space [1079] so let me give this a quick little try [1081] and actually pump this in I'm not [1083] entirely sure if this is going to work [1084] but we'll give it a go [1087] um why don't I just feed in the actual [1089] string here just like that just give it [1092] a run and we see that we did indeed have [1095] a quote unquote fallback match here with [1097] the presence of our uh string that we're [1099] looking for now what I'll always do [1101] every single time I make a Rex is I'll [1103] always wrap it in these curly uh uh [1106] round brackets the reason why is because [1108] I end up getting um this uh value over [1111] here which is always like a dollar sign [1112] one um and it's just a lot easier for me [1114] to map that otherwise you have to use [1115] the fallback match and [1118] um uh the cool part about these brackets [1120] is that you can actually create like a [1122] name for the match that you want uh let [1124] me just check out named match group Rex [1126] one [1129] sec so you need to do a question mark [1132] and then the name so we're going to do [1134] over here is we're going to question [1135] mark [1137] name and then I'll just call this uh I [1139] don't know ID and the value here is if I [1142] run this again now you'll see that the [1145] output actually has a key with the [1147] pattern that I provided back there which [1148] is [1149] ID if I said NX awesome ID well now the [1154] variable name itself is going to be [1156] Nick's awesome ID and this is [1158] tangentially useful you can imagine [1160] there are some situations in which you [1161] want to call a dynamically generated key [1164] um but yeah this this allows you to do [1165] that and I find it just a lot cleaner [1167] and easier and more documentable [1168] basically basically but anyway let's [1170] just keep it small and short and hacky [1172] and that's a very simple second example [1174] if I were to now move this over here to [1177] what i' consider a more business um [1178] adjacent example uh let's say we have a [1181] bunch of strings with valid emails so [1182] john. example.com Jane smith1 123 at [1186] some subdomain user host. org basically [1189] we're just testing a bunch of text and [1190] seeing if we can extract all them sweet [1192] sweet emails so if we want to match this [1193] it's going to be a little bit tricky and [1194] we're going to have to learn a couple of [1196] things that we haven't talked about so [1197] far um what we're going to do here is [1200] previously I would probably try and just [1202] match everything with this Dot and then [1203] this um sort of star asterisk here but [1207] for instance if we're trying to grab all [1208] of the email like let's just go john. do [1211] at [1212] example.com right this is a specific [1216] instantiation of an email but it's not [1217] every email if you wanted to grab every [1219] single email here you'd have to know [1220] what the email rules are how emails have [1222] to be formatted by both the mail [1224] providers and by um you know the the [1226] various services that work with these [1227] mail providers and it turns out that the [1229] way that emails are [1230] formatted and I only know this because [1233] I've done uh you know I've done a bunch [1235] of email parsing in my time but it's [1237] basically uh we can parse any character [1238] between lowercase A to Z uppercase A to [1242] Z and then the zero to9 including um [1247] underscores and then periods as [1249] well um and this is the pattern that [1251] match it like in order for an email to [1253] be valid it needs to just be somewhere [1255] between lowercase a all the way to [1257] lowercase C uppercase case a all the way [1259] to uppercase C and then numbers [1260] including an underscore and then a [1261] period that's it you can't um have an [1264] email uh otherwise you can't have any [1267] other like it's not considered a valid [1269] email if you structure it in any other [1271] way so if we do this and then we do an [1273] at well there's a problem there why is [1275] there a problem well because the way [1277] that we've written this so far it's only [1278] looking for a single character it's [1280] basically saying A to Z or a to z or 0 [1282] to9 or underscore or period any [1284] character that exists there so we need [1286] to do is we need to um do an exclamation [1288] or uh an asterisk here and now it'll [1290] capture all of the characters basically [1293] any one of these as many times as [1294] possible until we reach the presence of [1296] this little at [1297] sign same thing with the domain [1300] here basically do it as many times as [1302] possible then we go a period and then uh [1306] I believe tlds Can Only Be A to [1309] Z well I guess they could also be [1310] Capital somebody like really screws up [1312] the writing or [1313] something and then let's go this and [1316] then we'll go um yeah and then we'll go [1319] like this this should cover I believe [1321] like 99% of email something like that [1323] it's going to cover the vast majority of [1324] them there may be some specific edge [1326] cases where I don't know there's like [1327] some different characters that some [1328] emails use or something like that but [1329] this is personally what I will use when [1331] I'm reg Xing emails um simply because it [1333] just tends to work for basically [1334] everything and you can see in this case [1336] that we we've captured all the emails if [1337] I were to like change the string then go [1339] like Nick left click. a you see that it [1341] doesn't actually like pop up until I [1342] finish the whole Nick left. a and also I [1345] could add a bunch of other characters in [1347] between and then I could say hello [1352] gmail.com Oh interesting well now that [1354] I'm saying now now that I'm looking at [1355] this actually um if I were to do that oh [1358] well yeah actually that would be the [1359] email right there yeah there's no way [1362] for Rex to know that this hello is the [1364] email but basically if there's any other [1365] character in between it'll only grab [1367] like the hello at the gmail.com part [1369] right um it'll also do any number of [1373] these here um so the rule is it'll only [1377] match uh [1379] characters at the end because obviously [1380] characters [1381] are um the only things that are [1384] permissible in like the top level domain [1385] endings if I had a space here or [1388] something it was like an MZ and then a [1389] bunch of underscores or something it [1390] would still match my email if it was [1394] this that would work as well you can see [1398] that we matched Fe at instagram. the [1400] reason why is because um all of these [1402] underscores are uh considered valid [1405] characters to have an email address if I [1408] did a space or a backslash or something [1409] like that if I deleted these then yeah [1411] we we'd still match it the reason why [1413] I'm just running you through this stuff [1414] a bunch is because the best way to learn [1415] Rex is just to play around with it and [1417] just to get an intuitive feel for hm [1419] okay what happens if I press a period [1421] right now well that's going to match any [1422] character okay let me think like if that [1424] if we match any character next to this [1426] character then you know what's the [1428] result going to be and as you see here [1430] um pressing a button and then seeing it [1433] update in real time is so much faster [1436] than taking this back to make.com and [1437] then running it and then checking and [1439] then running it and then checking so if [1440] you just get in the habit of using a [1442] platform like reg x101 or re x101 to do [1445] the testing you're going to you're going [1446] to build your redex is like 100 times [1447] faster but okay great so what do we have [1449] here we have our wonderful email string [1453] uh why don't we actually pump this now [1454] back into [1456] make.com and then why don't I just grab [1459] this why don't we just see what happens [1460] as we run [1462] this so the output here is going to be [1465] empty now why is the output going to be [1467] empty well I'll tell you why the reason [1469] why is because we didn't [1471] have one of these um and so if we didn't [1475] have the beginning and the end here um [1479] it's not going to work so I'm going to [1481] add these two here now we're going to [1483] run this we've now gotten one email and [1485] now you're probably thinking why are we [1486] only doing one well it's because if you [1488] remember there was a way to select [1489] Global match versus um uh individual [1493] match and I turn that off so if I go yes [1495] I click okay and I give this a run now [1497] we've selected or we've gotten all three [1499] of these emails and if you wanted to do [1501] something cool with this um what you can [1503] do is you can go down to [1506] aggregator right because right now these [1508] are all different [1509] bundles uh what we can do here is we can [1511] feed in let me see it's the dollar sign [1514] one actually why don't we [1516] do [1520] this that should work a little better um [1523] I have to unlink this one more time [1524] because I'm trying to get the the [1526] variable email now okay great [1529] now I can connect this I'm going to use [1530] the text parsers as my source module and [1532] what I want to aggregate is this [1533] email I'm going to run this and now what [1536] we get is we get an array with all of [1538] these email addresses basically which is [1540] great and you know we could use this for [1541] whatever purpose we want um so yeah [1543] that's that's how to do emails as you [1545] can see there's a lot of playing around [1546] here but the main ones to know are [1548] period and then [1549] asterisk um and then these brackets that [1552] allow you to choose any characters so A [1553] to Z um A to Z A to Z you this is the [1557] pattern that you use when you want to [1558] match all lowercase and all uppercase uh [1560] word characters uh and then you know 0 [1563] to9 would also match anything between [1565] zero and up to N9 and if you want to [1567] watch individual characters you just go [1568] ABC D um you can insert logic here like [1572] I'm matching ABCD or [1575] efgh so ABC d efgh right that's going to [1578] work for either of [1580] them but we're basically just matching [1583] one of these characters um we're not [1585] matching all of them right we're either [1586] going A B C D or e [1590] fgh and yeah that's that for emails if I [1593] were to drag this down here now to our [1595] final boss our final boss is going to be [1596] URLs from web scraping and the reason [1598] why I left this blank is because I [1599] actually wanted to go and then scrape [1601] and show you guys how to do this in [1602] practice so I have my handy dandy make a [1606] request module here and what I'm going [1607] to do is I'm just going to match my own [1612] website um the content type is going to [1614] be application Json and I'm going to [1616] parse the response and if if I give this [1618] a run we're going to get a bunch of HTML [1621] right well what I want to do in this [1623] case is I want to really quickly and [1625] easily just scrape all of the um URLs if [1628] I go HTML to text and I feed this in [1630] check out what the output [1632] is this is my website left [1636] click. so this is the exact same thing [1639] as what we're seeing just represented in [1641] text but as you'll notice there are a [1643] bunch of these URLs here [1646] basically and what I want to do is is I [1648] want to select all of the [1651] URLs every single one maybe I'm trying [1653] to scrape all of the files on a website [1655] or something like that and I'm trying to [1656] get the I'm trying to get the URLs well [1658] it's a very quick and easy way to do so [1660] and I'll show you how to do this this is [1662] something that I do very very often so [1665] I'm actually just going to remove the [1665] URLs from web there's no more reason to [1667] do that I'm just going to feed this tax [1668] parser module [1670] in we're going to do it like [1673] this oh and actually let me think do I [1676] want to scrape my website every time I [1677] do a test [1678] uh all right screw it we'll scrape the [1680] website every time I do a test what I'm [1682] going to do is I'm going to grab all [1683] this text and go over to rex11 again [1686] I'll paste this in and my task is now [1688] scraping or or pulling all of the URLs [1692] that's what I want to [1693] do so off the top of your head how would [1696] you go about doing this well odds are my [1698] URLs are going to follow a similar [1699] structure right notice how we're using [1701] square brackets here if you remember [1703] square brackets in Red X these are this [1705] is sort of like a reserved character I [1707] believe that's what it's called and so [1708] if you want to scrape the actual or if [1710] you want to match the actual square [1711] bracket you need to escape them so we [1713] need to do an escape and then we need to [1714] do this now what we're doing is we're [1716] matching the presence of any one of [1717] these left square brackets which we [1718] could see over here and now basically [1721] what I want to do if you think about it [1722] is I just want to match anything within [1725] these square [1727] brackets that's more or less it now [1729] you'll see that it's not matching [1731] everything that I want because there are [1733] some other there's some other text [1736] basically um so I need to find a way not [1738] to match [1741] that let me see if I match any character [1744] UNG greedy that'll probably work yeah [1747] there we go any character ungrad [1749] beautiful um and then what I can do is I [1751] could match these and then I could add a [1755] question mark and then I could say um [1757] URL and now we have a group called URL [1760] which is matching all of these but [1763] you'll see that there are some weird [1764] sort of uh there's some weird sort of [1766] patterns here and the reason why is [1767] because some of these are absolute URLs [1769] which store https colon back SLB slash [1772] and then the the URL that I'm looking [1773] for and then other ones seem to store [1775] the relative URL which is like they just [1777] assume that you already have my URL in [1779] front of this uh so that's okay if [1781] you're trying to store or scrape only [1783] absolute URLs you could do it pretty [1785] quickly all you do is you only look for [1787] the ones that have like an HTTP in front [1789] of it and if we do that now we only grab [1792] the uh absolute URLs and these absolute [1795] URLs obviously store images and files [1797] and that sort of thing [1798] so let me actually take this now let me [1801] pump this into my text parser the [1802] pattern I'm going to be looking for is [1803] this and then the text I'm going to be [1805] feeding is going to be the output of [1806] this previous module we're going to run [1808] this and what we're going to get is [1810] we're only going to get one why well [1811] it's because while I was designing that [1813] I forgot to click Global match on so [1814] we're going to go Global match on going [1816] to run this again and then now we have [1818] basically bundles of URLs and we can do [1822] things with these URLs and let me just [1823] double check to make sure these URLs [1825] actually work if I paste this in what we [1827] got we got a type form link [1829] wonderful um this is a stripe by link [1832] probably for my subscription service [1834] right yes this is going to be we are [1839] getting a lot of type forms I think [1840] that's cuz I have my type form link up [1841] like six times or something but you know [1843] we got our Twitter over here which is [1845] pretty [1846] cool um I think if we were to go to the [1849] relative URLs the relative URLs would [1850] contain images so if instead of this [1852] HTTP I just go back and maybe I want the [1856] presence of this forward [1859] slash and I run this [1861] again we're now going to get all of the [1863] relative URLs um and you know the left [1865] click logogram for instance if I type in [1867] left click. a and then paste the rest of [1869] that in you'll see that we actually have [1871] access to the images as well um so this [1873] is going to depend on the convention of [1874] whatever you use to build the website in [1876] my case I know what I use to build the [1877] website so if I want to collect images I [1879] basically need to just scrape um [1881] relative URS if I want to scrape other [1883] ones then I need to do it in other ways [1885] but I'm sure you can imagine how you now [1886] have the toolkit that you need need to [1888] get out there and start scraping um and [1890] then converting the data and parsing in [1891] ways that you want okay great so that's [1894] sort of how to do it all um using regx [1896] 101 and then um obviously uh sort of [1900] like your own Acumen just looking at [1901] these procedural rules but the cool part [1903] is in 2024 you also have access to AI so [1906] I'm going to use CLA here and basically [1909] what I want to do is if I want to uh [1911] check whether something like this is [1913] going to work most of the time the first [1914] time that the first thing that I do is [1916] I'll look for um I'll I'll basically ask [1919] Claude to design me something instead so [1922] I'll say here is a test [1925] string design a simple reg X that [1928] matches all of the links in this test [1932] string and as you can see I'm simply [1934] asking it to design a simple [1936] regex you'll see that we now have some [1939] result the thing is I'm not going to [1941] trust CLA 100% I'm actually going to go [1944] and I'm going to verify this myself [1946] you'll see that there are now a variety [1947] of errors here um and Claude you know I [1950] want to say [1951] Works maybe half the time doesn't work [1953] all the time maybe half the time um but [1956] there [1957] are what look like some Escape issues I [1960] believe and I don't think Claude escapes [1962] the characters naturally so I had to go [1964] in here and I basically had to look for [1965] the presence of all these red ones and [1966] then I just had to manually Escape them [1969] okay so I escaped them and then what [1970] happened um CLA actually did pretty good [1973] you see that it's not matching [1974] everything that I want always um like [1976] it's looking for the Press of this and [1978] the reason why is cuz I didn't actually [1979] give it full URLs um so it did it did an [1982] okay job didn't do the best job did a [1984] pretty good job but the cool part is um [1986] you can actually have it explain to you [1988] what's going [1989] on simplify this so instead [1993] of [1995] capturing [1997] um links that begin with a [2000] backslash we capture anything between [2004] the two [2005] brackets two square brackets [2008] simpler also make sure to escape your [2012] reserved characters using [2016] backlash it's going to [2019] apologize thank you Cloud you're very [2021] dimir today and then we can take this [2024] back and then uh you know within like [2027] what like two little iterations there [2029] Claude was able to design a Rex that [2031] actually works and you know does a [2032] pretty good job so yeah I obviously [2035] wanted to show you guys how you can do [2036] it yourselves first before having to [2037] rely on our AI overlords the benefit to [2039] to just knowing a tiny bit even a [2041] smattering even this 30 minutes or [2042] whatever of Rex video is when clog gives [2044] you an output you will now be able to [2046] dissect the output use a specific tool [2048] like Rex 101 and then go through and [2050] hover over every character and be like H [2052] this is what that does that's what that [2053] does H okay I sort of understand it um [2056] and personally if you have been with me [2058] if you're still with me up to this point [2059] in the video this is all the Rex that I [2061] personally use on a day-to-day basis I [2063] really don't know anymore as you can see [2064] you can get to a similar level of [2066] understanding or potentially mastery in [2068] uh I don't know just a few hours or so [2070] poking around with it I hope you guys [2072] appreciated that video this is the exact [2074] process that I follow every single time [2075] that I'm tasked with parsing something [2077] in a big string it's super simple and [2079] it's something that you do not need to [2080] be a programming Pro in order to get up [2082] and running with if you have any [2084] questions about what I showed over here [2085] just leave a comment down below more [2086] than happy to get back to you otherwise [2088] if you could do me a big favor and like [2090] subscribe get me to the top of that [2091] YouTube Alo and I'll catch you on the [2093] next video bye-bye

Title: Watch Me Double Inbound Conversion Rate Using Make.com In 26 Min
[0] what's going on everybody in this video [1] I'm going to show you one of the [2] simplest but also highest Roi email [4] systems that you can build this is going [6] to completely transform your warm [9] campaigns specifically campaigns that [11] are coming from ads so like maybe PPC [13] ads or something like that um SEO where [15] they're filling at a forum at your [16] website or anything where basically the [18] customer has to come to you I built this [20] own system out for myself multiple times [22] I built this system for dozens of [23] clients at this point and this is one of [25] those systems that can literally [26] quadruple your conversion rate on the [28] front end takes just a few minutes to [30] build I'm going to show you exactly how [31] to do it right [34] now all right so I'm going to show you [35] the system in a moment and it's a it's a [37] nice system we're going to build every [38] module in this flow together but first I [40] just want to show you the deliverable [41] like what is the output of this system [43] and the output of the system is an [45] extraordinarily simple form that looks [47] like you wrote it in 20 seconds and [50] that's the whole point that's the whole [51] objective here the whole idea is when [54] somebody fills out a form on your [55] website right if somebody's clicking [57] into an ad and then somebody puts in a [59] bunch of information you get back to [61] them within 2 minutes with a hyper [64] customized reply that shows that you're [66] a real person on the other end of the [67] line that's read through their website [69] read through their information and that [71] is basically ready to Tango if you will [74] uh this is one of the lowest hanging [75] fruit in any AD campaign it would [78] absolutely break your guys' hearts to [80] see how much money is wasted on a daily [82] weekly or monthly basis especially at [84] these like big PPC agencies who run [86] these things and then send all the [87] traffic into the void if you have [89] something like this for a PPC campaign [91] right off the front end your your [92] conversion rate is probably going to [94] double maybe triple or quadruple so [97] that's really the whole purpose of this [98] system and I'll walk you through the [99] logic just using this make.com scenario [102] flowchart before we build it uh together [105] basically at the front end we have a [106] form now you can use any form that you [107] want I'm using a type form type form is [109] just one of many form providers you [111] could use jot form U form you could use [113] like Wix forms WordPress forms webflow [116] forms paper form like like there's like [118] a million in one providers but the whole [120] point is just pretend that this is [121] somewhere on a website right if you go [123] to my website maybe you are funneled [125] here into an ad campaign and down at the [127] very bottom we just have like an [128] embedded type form or something very [130] common design pattern and basically I'm [133] you know the Prospect and I'm interested [134] in working with these people so they ask [136] me some [137] information and I'm filling out a brief [140] little little form here on their [142] website and they're asking me for my [144] website URL maybe it's some business [145] thing it's obviously B2B so they want my [147] website for some purpose maybe they want [149] to sell me a service and then I click [151] submit now what normally happens here if [154] you are a prospect on some website [156] looking to work with somebody is your [159] form entry just went into the void and [162] you have no idea where it went you have [164] no idea who's reading it you're probably [165] not going to get a reply for at least 15 [167] 20 or 30 minutes uh and basically this [169] is just the shittiest user experience on [171] planet Earth but it's also the one that [172] the vast majority of businesses do seems [175] like a really low hanging fruit to fix [176] this right well you'd be surprised at [177] how many people don't what our system is [179] is going to do is our system is going to [181] do two things first you're going to get [182] an immediate transactional email a [184] transactional email is just an email [186] that you get basically immediately after [188] um you fill out a form and it's just a [190] way to notify the customer that hey [192] how's it going we got your form entry [195] and we're going to get back to you soon [196] okay seems pretty simple again you'd be [198] surprised that how many people don't do [200] this this is a simple one that I put [201] together in like 5 seconds and then [204] what'll happen after that is a few [205] moments after you'll get a customized [207] reply from somebody that works at one of [209] the at company in my case it's Nick from [211] workflow [212] Loop and then Nick from workflow Loop [214] will have read through your website [216] gotten a bunch of information that he [218] really could not have known unless he [219] actually did his his research and then [221] it'll send you this message here saying [223] hey how's it going listen I'm out of the [224] office right now but you want to chat [225] later when I'm back happy to give your [226] ring just send me over a couple times [228] this basically instantly cements this [231] call within just a few minutes of [233] somebody filling out a form and it's [235] just a very straightforward way of [236] ensuring that you always uh maximize the [238] quality of every lead [240] like what a lot of people do on forms is [242] they'll add like big calendars they'll [243] add like multi-step things tons of [245] questions and that sort of deal and I [247] understand the reason why you want to do [248] this you want to collect as much info up [249] front so you can do cool stuff with it [250] later add them to crms do like [252] personalized Outreach and that sort of [253] deal the really cool thing is um if you [256] if you take advantage of AI you can [258] usually just collect very little [260] information make it really easy for them [261] to sign up and then just use the AI to [263] to do all that customization stuff on [265] the back end and that's basically what [266] we're doing here so it starts with type [269] form we'll fill out a couple of uh we [271] have a couple of these modules for type [272] form now what we'll do is we'll get the [274] website URL and then we'll actually [275] scrape it just using an HTP HTTP request [278] we then parse the HTML there turn it to [280] text and then if we found a parsed [282] website sometimes we will not have then [285] it'll go through then it'll actually [286] customize the reply using both uh [288] templated transactional email and then a [290] human email then if we don't find it [293] then we'll do sort of two templated [296] transactional emails and then like a [297] human email um that is still templated [300] but I've just written it in sort of like [301] a very a very intelligent way I want to [305] say one that implies that I am actually [306] a real person on the other end of line [308] I'm going to show you what all that [309] looks like in a second but uh let's [310] actually get to building out the system [312] from scratch in a new tab over [315] here now the first thing you're going to [316] need is you're going to need an intake [317] form of some kind right so I have an [320] intake form right over [324] here and it's just called intake form [326] it's obviously very simple it asks what [328] are your contact details then we have [330] the first name we have the phone number [332] and then we have an email address you [334] can imagine how if you're building um an [336] ad campaign or something for I don't [338] know Roofing maybe you also want to ask [340] some questions about the dimensions [341] their home or something you can do that [343] here I'm just trying to make it as [344] simple as humanly possible so you can [346] just take my template just build [347] whatever the hell you want on top of it [349] I'm also asking for a website URL [351] because in my case it's like B2B if [353] you're doing something else again if [354] you're doing like a roofing company [355] maybe you ask uh the geography maybe you [358] get the address and then maybe instead [359] of doing doing an HTTP request to the [360] website you do an HTTP request the [363] Google Maps API and then the Google Maps [364] API tells you something about the area [366] that you then use to customize in the [367] email but again I'm just assuming most [369] people that are doing this are probably [370] in a similar scenario to me they [372] probably just want like a simple [374] solution that works for B2B purposes so [376] this is what my form looks like it's [377] really not any more complicated than [379] this you could build this out in two [380] seconds you just click add content first [382] thing you need is contact [384] info um I'm not going to do last name [387] then I'm not going to do company [389] and then I'll just in my case copy and [392] paste it in your case just write [393] something what are your contact details [395] and then for the second one you need to [396] add a website [399] module then just ask you know what's [401] your website URL make sure to make these [403] required Fields if they're [405] required uh let's see if they're [407] required [409] here then uh they'll have a little [411] asteris next to them and then that way [413] nobody will just like not include some [415] of the information that you need we're [416] not asking for a whole lot here so [417] obviously it's fine to require them if [419] you're ask ask for a ton of information [420] maybe some of these fields won't be [421] required anyway let's publish this puppy [425] now once we published this what I'm [427] actually going to do is first I'm just [428] going to go and I'm going to fill out [429] the form as an example so my first name [432] is now going to be Peter my phone number [434] is going to be this and then my email is [435] going to be the same one that I usually [437] have nickol left click. and then again [439] I'm pretending that I'm a company called [440] left click that's signing up for some [441] service but while I I have it done it [443] says all done thanks for your time what [445] we're going to do next is I'm just going [447] to create a new module or a new flow [448] here I'm going to call this um AI [451] autoresponder [453] example and we're going to start not [455] with the type form watch row module [457] we're going to start with the list [458] response so I'm going to go over here to [460] my form and I'm going to [461] select intake form right over [465] here then I'm just going to scroll all [467] the way down here to limit and press one [469] and why did I do this well I did this [470] because I want to right click this press [471] run module only and then I just want to [473] see the response that I put in so Peter [475] phone number ni left click. a left [477] click. a okay awesome now that I've done [479] this I actually have most of the [480] information that I need to finish the [482] sequence the next thing I'm going to do [484] is I'm really quickly going to go over [485] to http and I'm just going to say make a [487] request then I'm just going to pump in [489] this URL here left click. a the method [491] I'm going to use is get body type is [493] going to be raw content type is going to [495] be Json application Json and then I'm [497] going to click parse response why did I [499] do that well it's because I'm trying to [500] scrape this website if I click run once [503] you'll see the output of this now is a [504] bunch of HTML and this is the HTML of my [507] website if you go to left click and look [510] for we build hands-off growth [512] systems you'll see that this is actually [515] inside of the HTML it's represented in [517] code but to be honest the code isn't [519] super important to us what we want is we [521] just want the raw text so in order to [523] get the raw text we go down here to text [524] parser go HTML to text then just feed in [528] the data which just contains HTML code [531] into this module now if we run [534] this well now we don't have the HTML we [537] actually just get a bunch of text and [538] this is a couple things for us it makes [540] it a lot easier um it makes it a lot [542] shorter makes a lot more interpretable [543] for the next step which is feeding it [545] into AI it also saves you some money on [547] token cost and that sort of thing it's [548] pretty sweet um we could actually go [551] even further here right now this is [552] pretty long because there are a lot of [553] new lines right what we could do if we [555] wanted to is we could actually strip all [557] of these new lines in The Next Step so [559] hypothetically I'm just going to go set [561] a variable then I'm going to say trimmed [564] and stripped then I'm going to trim this [568] then I'm also going to go and replace [571] all of the new lines [575] here I'm just going to replace them with [578] a space [579] instead and now if we press run once the [582] end result is just this big block [584] attacks it's no longer spaced out it's [586] no longer super crazy long we've [588] eliminated basically a bunch of tokens [589] that we don't need anymore so it's [591] easier it's a little bit shorter you can [593] obviously perform as many of these [594] arbitrary text Transformations as you [595] want you could remove everything within [598] these brackets if you wanted to these [599] brackets are just files that are being [600] hosted on the website um yeah there's [603] just a million in one different ways to [604] do this but now that we have our text in [606] a relatively compressed format what I'm [608] going to do is I'm going to feed this [609] into Ai and what I've chosen to do for [611] this one is I'm using anthropic CLA you [613] can use gp4 here there's literally no [615] difference between the two at this point [617] um I'm just using anthropic Cloud [618] because in most of my previous videos [620] I've used GPT 4 and I just want to show [622] you guys that you could use anthropic [624] what we're going to do is we're going to [625] create a new um user prompt with a type [628] text and and let me just see what I said [630] in the other one [633] here okay I'm just going to copy this [636] whole prompt and then we'll read it I [637] don't want this video to be about me [639] just creating a prompt from scratch [640] because that's just rebuilding the wheel [642] um we're just going to pretend that [644] we've we've already written it okay so [646] in terms of the prompt what am I saying [648] the prompt isn't actually magic here and [650] it's not the best prompt um I think a [652] lot of the people that are making these [653] videos they always like make it seem [655] like their prompt is super special this [657] isn't super special I wrote it in like [658] 15 seconds and I just said what I wanted [661] it to do and it did an all right job um [663] you could probably optimize this a lot [664] further and I'll talk about how to do [665] that in a sec but all it is is it says [668] below is a website scrape and some [669] contact details use it to customize an [672] email reply to a prospect write in a [674] short succinct way use this template [677] filling in the variables with data from [679] the site do not output anything except [681] for the email copy now what is the [684] actual text the text is sorry I just [687] have to move this so we we can all see [688] it [690] the text [691] is High um variable this variable here [695] that I've selected is the first name as [697] you see it sort of says Peter down here [699] hi variable thanks for reaching out [701] whatever the company name is looks great [704] love your unique value prop I'm out of [707] the office right now but do you want to [708] chat later today when I'm back happy to [710] give you a ring just send over a couple [711] times tomorrow works too now this copy [714] here um I've written it in a way that [717] just makes it seem like it's a real [718] person that's responding to the email [719] I've done a lot of copywriting so I'm [721] just familiar and comfortable with [723] writing in such a way I usually write my [724] cold emails in a similar manner as well [727] um but typically the whole idea here is [728] for whatever you're doing you just want [729] to make it seem like somebody was on [730] their phone when they got the inquiry [732] and then they just penned the response [733] um just just right there while they were [735] on the phone maybe in the middle of the [736] street or something you don't want to [737] write in a super complicated way you [739] don't want to spend too much time making [740] this seem really polish and grandiose [742] you just wanted to seem very incidental [744] is the term so that's what this message [747] is and if you see what we're doing here [749] is we're adding these curly braces and [750] saying whatever the company name is then [752] we're saying unique value prop well the [754] whole idea here is we're actually going [755] to get AI to take the information from [757] the website and use that to fill this in [758] for us so we're going to grab the [760] company name from the website we're [761] going to grab the unique value [762] proposition from the website it's going [763] to be pretty [764] sweet okay great now for our next prompt [767] we're going to go to text and then I'm [769] just going to write um I guess we [772] already have the company name well I'll [773] just write first name again anyway just [775] in case and then what I'm going to do [777] I'm going to say website scrape [779] I'm just going to dump in this trimmed [781] and stripped section over [783] here and then I'm just going to go to [785] advanced settings um for system prompt [788] let say you are a helpful [790] intelligent writing assistant you don't [794] output anything except for what you [797] asked and then the temperature I'm just [799] going to go [800] 0.7 and that looks pretty good okay as [802] you see we're not building on this [804] successively so if I click run once [806] everything finishes very fast except for [807] the anthropic Cloud module obviously L [810] but you'll see what ended up happening [811] was we went through we scraped the [813] website we converted that website into [815] um its text form we compressed the hell [817] of that text then we fed it into Ai and [820] then we use that to fill in these [821] variables so now it says hi Peter thanks [823] for reaching out left click your website [825] looks great love your approach to [826] building hands-off growth systems for [827] B2B Founders now if you think about it [829] from Peter's perspective the guy that [831] just filled out the form if he sees this [834] all he's thinking is oh this is a real [835] person that just went on my website and [837] he filled out a quick little you know he [838] wrote a quick little email for me this [840] is very high Roi for Peter Peter is [843] going to be impressed Peter's going to [844] be a lot more likely to want to work [845] with the service because you've done a [847] little bit of work which you know most [849] other agencies and coaching programs and [850] stuff just can't for whatever silly [852] reason then I'm out of the office right [854] now but do you want to chat later today [855] when I'm back Happ to give you a ring [856] just Cent over a couple times tomorrow [857] works too all right so um at this point [859] you'd probably be like well we're done [861] we don't have to do anything else [862] unfortunately we still do have to do a [864] few more things we have to now now that [866] we built like the bones of the system we [867] have to obviously make it work so we [869] have to connect this to an email module [872] so I'm going to go down here to email [873] and I'm going to click Send an [876] email email module historically is um a [879] lot better to use than the Gmail module [881] fortunately for whatever reason it [882] always defaults back to a very old [884] connection that I've set up we're going [885] to want to save the message after [886] sending just because I'm going to want [888] to like track that I did indeed send the [889] email and then down here I have to [892] select folder inbox if I don't do that [893] then it just disappears now for the [895] purpose of the demonstration I'm just [896] going to be sending this to the same [898] email address my own um but you can [900] imagine how uh what you should be doing [901] is you should be going down here and [903] getting the email from the form fill [904] right that makes more sense and then [906] subject line you can do whatever you'd [908] like but I'm just going to say thanks [909] for filling out our intake [912] form and then the content type will be [915] plain Tex I'm just going to [916] say this is going to be our [918] transactional email um so we'll say [920] hello first [923] name this is the workflow Loop team we [927] wanted to let you know that we've [930] received your [934] submission and we're excited to get back [937] to you please keep an eye on your inbox [941] our team Prides [944] themselves on [946] replying within 5 [949] minutes let's say [951] thanks for getting in touch talk to you [954] in five let's do that that'll be nice [957] our team Prides themselves in replying [958] Within 5 minutes if you have any [960] questions feel free to reach out thank [963] you workflow Loop team so if you're [967] running an agency you can imagine this [968] sort of verbiage is probably pretty [970] important and then they talk to you in [971] five minutes that's just meant to be hey [973] this is pretty impressive we're going to [974] talk to you in five minutes you know a [976] human being will get back to you doesn't [977] matter if you fill it out at 2 a.m. in [978] the morning uh we will get back to you [981] now what I'm going to do is I'm going to [982] copy this email module paste it this [984] just a very quick and easy way to ensure [985] that all my settings are saved I have [987] the same connecting connection set [988] settings and stuff like that and what [991] I'm going to do is I'm going to add some [992] emojis cuz I love getting an [995] emoji and then I'm just going to [997] respond and I'm gonna say Nick here nice [1000] to meet you what I'm going to do is [1003] because I've already written this copy [1004] and I know that it works I'm just going [1005] to go back over to the human email I'm [1007] just going to copy this whole oh [1009] actually I don't need to what am I doing [1011] I can just paste in this text response [1013] here and the subject line is going to [1014] say Nick here nice to meet you okay [1016] great so I think we have everything that [1017] we need now I'm just going to say send [1021] transactional email this one's going to [1024] be send human [1027] email and now what I'm going to do is [1029] I'm just going to run this from start to [1031] finish now these two email modules are [1033] right next to each other so you can [1034] imagine how in reality we said 5 minutes [1037] this is like 2 seconds um so we're going [1039] to need to add some sleeps but I'm just [1040] doing this because I want to show you [1041] guys what it uh what it actually looks [1044] like okay great so these are the two [1047] emails and I'm just doing them on Nick [1049] left. on my email address just because I [1051] wanted to show you what it looks like um [1053] from my perspective and this is just a [1054] little bit more reliable so the email [1056] the first email that sent us thanks for [1057] getting in touch talk to you in five [1058] minutes hello Peter this is the workful [1059] Loop team we wanted to let you know that [1061] we received your submission we're [1062] excited to get back to you please keep [1063] an eye on your inbox our team prizes and [1065] replying within 5 minutes if you have [1066] any questions feel free to reach chat [1067] thank you work flid team that's a [1069] fantastic experience because I just [1070] filled out the form and I just got the [1072] response the next email is this one here [1076] and this now comes from a real person [1079] that says hey Peter thanks for reaching [1081] out left click looks great love your [1083] approach to building hands-off system [1084] growth systems for B2B Founders again [1086] this is the customized part right here [1088] I'm out of the office right now but you [1089] want to chat later day when I'm back [1090] happy to give you a ring just s over a [1092] couple times tomorrow works too you can [1094] imagine how now I basically have cart [1097] blanch I can chat with them anytime it [1098] doesn't actually matter I could even [1099] give them a call right now but by [1102] providing this of basically implying [1105] that the quality of our service is [1106] fantastic and we're basically second to [1108] none that's going to make a great [1109] impression that's going to make your um [1111] your warm lead flow process go very very [1114] far indeed okay so these are the bones [1116] of the system now we have to add a [1118] couple of things we have to add a little [1119] bit of error handling because there's a [1120] possibility that this will not work and [1123] then we have to add a couple of routes [1124] um because we need to account for the [1126] route where the they Supply a website [1128] that works and then we also account uh [1130] we have to account for the route where [1131] they Supply a website that doesn't work [1133] right like this is not hunky dory [1134] there's a possibility that there may be [1135] an issue here in my previous videos I [1137] haven't really talked a lot about a hand [1139] and really flushing things out perfectly [1140] but um I figure it's about time that I I [1142] start being responsible so that's what [1145] we're going to talk about now how do we [1146] turn this the bones of this system into [1149] one that actually uh works and would be [1151] sort of production ready well the first [1153] thing we need to do is we just need to [1154] add a [1157] sleep between these two modules right [1161] you can imagine [1162] how uh let's do 3 [1165] minutes the reason why is because we [1167] send the transactional email that says [1168] hey we're going to get back to you [1169] within 5 minutes and then we sleep for 3 [1171] minutes and then we get back to them [1172] maybe we'll even do 2 minutes maybe [1173] we'll do like 154 seconds or something [1175] that'll seem a little bit more random [1176] which is [1177] nice um so that's good the second thing [1180] that we have to do is with the HTTP [1182] module where we're calling the website [1183] that they Supply us we need to go over [1186] to flow control and then we need to add [1188] an [1189] ignore why do we need to add an ignore [1191] because hypothetically I run this but [1193] then the website that I add is a website [1196] that doesn't exist [1199] this is going to time out it's going to [1200] be looking for a website URL that [1203] doesn't actually exist I think the time [1204] out's like 30 seconds or something like [1206] that when this happens you're going to [1208] get this little yellow thing that says [1209] connection error service is not [1210] reachable and if somebody supplies a [1212] website that isn't real or a website [1214] that we can't scrap for whatever reason [1215] um we just need a way to continue moving [1217] on with the flow and so that's what this [1219] ignore is going to do it's going to say [1220] hey even if we get an error with this [1222] HTTP request it let's keep going [1225] next up we need a way to account for the [1226] fact that if there is an error here this [1228] is not going to parse anything so what [1230] we're going to do is we're going to [1231] provide a router [1233] now so I'm going to rightclick this oh [1236] actually we can just click add router [1238] you don't actually need to do [1240] that um we've added a router and what we [1243] want to do is we want to provide two [1245] cases the first case is sort of as [1247] normal and that says um pars what we're [1250] going to do is we're going to look at [1251] this text parser here and then we're [1252] going to say hey does this [1255] exist if this exists if the output of [1258] this data if there is an output of this [1260] data odds are that this data thing was [1262] successful right um meaning that we got [1265] website scrape data and we can proceed [1267] with the flow but we also need to [1269] provide a route for if it doesn't exist [1271] and what I'm going to do here is I'm [1272] just going to copy these [1274] three because that's all that really [1276] matters and then we're going to add a [1279] second route that says [1281] empty or maybe fail let's do that where [1286] this thing does not exist [1289] now if you think about it we've now [1290] covered every possible case either this [1292] variable can exist or this variable [1293] cannot exist the two cannot be true [1296] simultaneously so this will only ever [1298] proceed down one of our routes the issue [1300] now though is well if you notice I had [1302] an AI module in the bottom route but no [1304] AI module in the top route the problem [1306] is obviously if you don't get website [1308] copy it's very hard to customize this [1309] right so what I've done instead is I've [1311] just written some copy that seems [1312] customized even though it's not and it's [1315] not perfect but it does a pretty good [1316] job [1318] so I'm just going to go over here and [1319] paste this in show you guys what that [1321] looks [1325] like we have a high name so I'm going to [1329] go find the name Peter thanks for [1331] reaching out just out of the office [1332] right now but you want to chat later [1333] today when I'm back happy to give you a [1334] ring if so send me a couple times and [1336] I'll call you at and then we have the [1337] phone number here tomorrow works too the [1340] idea in providing the phone number is [1342] just to make it seem a little bit more [1343] customized and then what we're doing is [1346] uh we're thanking them for reaching out [1347] but we're not really providing anything [1348] super custom so this is sort of our fall [1350] back in case the rest of the flow [1351] doesn't work you always have to have a [1353] fall back in these scenarios it's just [1354] something good to get in the habit of [1356] doing okay great so this looks pretty [1358] good to me but we've just forgotten one [1360] more thing that we have to do at the [1361] left hand side here and that is um we [1364] have a module now that lists the [1365] responses but anytime we want to run [1366] this we actually have to manually go and [1367] click run once what I'd like to happen [1369] is I'd like to I'd like for this to run [1371] completely automatically this is just a [1372] module that I use for testing the way [1374] that I'm going to do this I'm going to [1375] go to watch responses and I'll actually [1376] drag this all the way on the left here [1378] and what I'm going to do next is I'm [1379] going to add a little sleep [1381] module and this sleep module just allows [1383] me to test very quickly if I ever need [1385] to and I'm just going to say 3 seconds [1387] and I'm going to connect this what this [1389] watch responses module is going to do is [1391] it's going to watch intake [1394] form and now what's going to happen is [1397] every time I fill out this intake form [1399] we're then going to sleep for 3 seconds [1400] we're then going to list the most recent [1402] fill on the type form we're then going [1404] to do the HTTP call to the website we're [1406] going to parse the text if it is [1408] parsable we're then going to compress [1409] the website data we're then going to [1411] feed it into AI send a transactional [1414] email immediately which is going to [1415] impress them we're then going to wait [1416] about 2 to 3 minutes then we're going to [1418] send a human written email if there is [1420] no website data we're then going to send [1422] a transactional email do the same thing [1424] sleep about 3 minutes and then send a [1426] sort of poorly written human email but [1427] still a human email nonetheless and [1430] that's our flow from start to finish [1432] let's actually give this a quick little [1433] run now if you think about it um if I do [1436] give this a run it's going to take sweet [1437] ass time cuz I'm waiting to sleep for 3 [1439] minutes so I'm just going to [1439] hypothetically for the purposes of this [1441] example just change this to 10 just [1443] going to be 10 whole seconds instead of [1445] 154 but as you can imagine it's the same [1447] sort of deal okay so I just click run [1450] once and now we're waiting what I'm [1451] going to do is I'll go back to the [1452] intake form and I'm just going to [1454] pretend that I'm a woman called [1456] Janet my email is Janet [1460] gmail.com and my website URL is maybe 1 [1464] second copy.com let's try [1467] that we're going to go back here we're [1469] going to get that [1471] data make the request then we're going [1472] to proceed down the first [1477] row sleeping for 3 minutes really it's [1481] just 10 [1483] seconds and now we're going to proceed [1485] with writing our human email very nice [1487] and why don't we take a look at the [1490] result okay great so this is the [1492] transactional email and Janet got it [1494] instantly immediately after we filled [1495] this out very nice and this is the [1498] customized email right over [1501] here very sexy hi Janet thanks for [1504] reaching out one second copy looks great [1505] love your network of handpicked [1506] highquality writers working on demand [1508] out of the office right now but you want [1509] to chat later day when I'm back happy to [1510] give you a ring just send over a couple [1511] times tomorrow works too Color Me [1514] impressed there's no way Janet is not [1515] working with us now so that is the [1518] system in a nutshell what I'm going to [1519] do over here is I'm just going to change [1521] all of these email addresses to um the [1524] email that is supplied and then I'm [1526] going to save this as a blueprint the [1528] reason I'm going to say this is a [1529] blueprint is so that everybody in the [1532] YouTube anybody in the YouTubes like an [1534] old man now even got glasses anybody in [1537] that dang YouTube's going to have access [1539] to These Blueprints and then you can [1540] take the stem of a system and then build [1542] on however much complexity you want as I [1544] mentioned earlier you could swap out [1546] this httv module for basically whatever [1548] you want anything you could you know if [1550] it's like a b Toc thing and you're doing [1551] some construction project or I don't [1553] know you're like a general contractor [1555] these flows are very important for [1556] General Contractors and companies of [1558] that nature right because you want to [1559] get back to people quickly and you want [1560] to provide them the impression of very [1561] customized service well if you're doing [1563] something like that you just swap out [1564] the HTTP module for like a Google Maps [1566] module that then tells you something [1568] about the location right maybe it gives [1570] you the city name and then you pump the [1571] city name into Ai and have it say hey um [1573] tell me some cool unique things about [1575] the city and then that's what you feed [1576] into the email there are variety of [1578] different ways you can do it but I think [1580] you guys get my point thanks so much for [1582] watching this video I know that this is [1583] one of the simplest and most [1584] straightforward systems that I've done [1586] but I wanted to dial back the complexity [1587] a little bit here before I proceed uh [1590] and increase the complexity again over [1591] the coming weeks if you guys have any [1593] questions or anything like that just [1594] drop a comment down below more than [1595] happy to help if you have any ideas for [1597] future systems please do the same I [1598] Source most of my ideas from the YouTube [1600] comments now otherwise if you can give [1601] me a big solid and like And subscribe I [1604] will forever be in your debt catch you [1607] on the next video bye-bye

[0] hey everybody Nick here have you ever [1] wanted to scrape local service business [3] email addresses I'm talking the plumber [5] across the street maybe the flower shop [7] down the block well in this video I'm [9] going to show you a simple system that [11] takes less than 20 minutes to set up [13] that lets you scrape thousands of local [15] service businesses in just minutes if [17] that sounds like something you guys want [18] to learn how to do then watch me build [20] [Music] [23] it now as mentioned this is a very [25] simple system and what I've done here is [27] I've Just Whipped up a Whimsical this is [29] a visual flowchart mapping software uh [32] and I've added in the flow of [34] information from start to finish so [35] we're going to start by scraping local [37] service businesses from Google Maps [39] where they're going to feed that into an [41] email enrichment platform called any [42] mail finder and then we're just going to [44] be dumping all the results into a Google [45] sheet from a bird's eye view this looks [47] pretty simple now I'm going to be [48] building this make.com so it's going to [50] be a little bit more complicated when we [51] actually get into the nitty-gritty uh [53] but this is more or less all you need to [55] know we're going to be grabbing stuff [56] from Maps enriching it with an email [58] enrichment platform in this case anail [59] finder and then dumping it into a sheet [61] pretty straightforward right first thing [63] we need to do is we need to find a bunch [66] of people or a bunch of businesses that [67] we want on Google Maps so all you need [69] to do is go maps.google.com and I'm in [72] Calgary over here so what I'm going to [73] do is I'm just going to type in the term [75] plumber and I'm going to pretend that my [77] goal here is to just find a list of [79] local plumbers as you can see if I zoom [81] out from the downtown area which is [83] where I'm in to more just the total City [85] we have tons of [87] plumbers and if I were just to keep [89] scrolling down down here you know we'd [90] find more and more and more and more [92] eventually there'd be hundreds if not [94] thousands I don't know how many plumbers [96] per capita um the average city has but [99] you know I think Calgary is a population [100] of 1.5 mil so realistically I think it's [102] fair to say there's probably maybe 500 [104] to a th000 minimum and maybe more um [107] let's hypothetically say that this is [108] what we wanted to do scrape plumbers [110] from the City of Calgary Alberta where I [112] live well what we need to do is we need [115] to find a way to to do the scraping [117] right and so we could theoretically [119] build some web scraper ourselves that [121] goes on this URL with this latitude [124] longitude and then goes from top to [126] bottom clicks this website link grabs [128] the URL stores it and then adds it to a [130] big Google sheet for us or we could just [132] use a simple out-of- the- boox solution [133] that does 99% of that work for us [136] obviously if you've watched my previous [137] videos you know that I love simple out [138] the box Solutions no use rebuilding a [140] wheel if you don't have to and what [142] we're going to be doing for this is [143] we're going to be using a ter a platform [145] called apify apify lets you build very [147] reliable web scrapers fast as you can [149] see here but probably the more important [151] one is if you go to browse existing [153] tools you'll see the apfi store and this [155] just has dozens if not hundreds of outof [157] the- boox website scrapers it even has [160] some email finders and stuff like that [161] although we're not going to be using [162] that in this video and uh basically just [165] a ton of out-of the- boox functionality [166] that just lets you do the 8020 of [168] website scraping without really having [169] to like dirty your hands with code and [171] whatnot so what we're going to be using [173] here is actually this first one here and [174] I think it's only first because I've [175] done a lot of clicking on it recently um [177] but you're going to want to look for [178] Google Maps as you'll see see there are [180] dozens of these a lot of them are from [182] these guys called Compass um since it's [184] a store apify basically lets different [186] developers sell their scrapers against [188] each other um but there's a Google map [190] scraper Google Maps extractor a review [192] scraper you can see there's a map [193] scraper orchestrator whatever that means [196] uh in our video we're just going to be [197] using this one here at the top left hand [199] corner but I want you to know if for [201] whatever reason that one doesn't work [202] you are free to choose any one of these [204] it doesn't actually matter what input [206] you provide to the system as long as you [207] have something that scrapes Google Maps [209] listings and then gives you URLs so yeah [211] we're going to be using this Google Maps [213] extractor pretty simple pretty [214] straightforward I'm just going to click [215] a try for free and the cost here is very [217] low which is quite nice what we're going [220] to be doing is we're going to be putting [222] the term plumbers the cool part about [223] apify is it just gives you $5 in credit [225] just up front so you could scrape a lot [228] of leads essentially with that $5 in [230] credits um this is just runtime but [232] anyway I'm just going to be typing in [233] Plummer and then down here there's a [235] field that says location only use one [236] location at a time so I'm just going to [238] be going Calgary [240] actually you know I can probably just [240] type Calgary AB Calgary Alberta this is [243] probably going to be the same thing [244] that's pumped into Google Maps right [246] here so yeah I think if I type in [248] Calgary that should be fine um number of [251] places per each search room URL if we [252] click on this little question mark icon [254] you can see that you can actually add in [259] 99999999 as the limit meaning if you do [261] that you will scrape literally every [263] place in the whole city which is [265] obviously fantastic if that's what [266] you're looking to do in my case though [268] if I were to do that that would take a [269] fair amount of time to run so I'm just [271] going to I'm just going to type in five [272] and we're just going to use this as sort [274] of an example placeholder but just keep [275] in mind that at any point in time you [277] can change us to 9999 if you want to um [279] and then you can also use it to iterate [281] through different locations to scrape [282] all of the plumbers in let's say I don't [284] know the State of Florida or something [286] if you wanted to there are a couple of [288] additional features here deeper City [290] scrape um basically uh if you go to the [294] Google Maps place that we had before [296] you'll notice that as you zoom in or [298] zoom out of various places um you'll see [301] more listings or fewer listings just [304] because they don't want to overwhelm you [306] right so if I type in plumers here you [308] know I see I don't know maybe 50 [309] plumbers or so here but if I zoom way in [311] Click search this area you'll see that [313] now we're finding a bunch of additional [314] plumbers that we weren't before that's [316] what this does um so if you enable this [318] feature it will increase the runtime by [320] extracting more places in our case we're [322] just doing five I'm not going to I'm not [323] going to click deeper City scrape just [325] know that if you really wanted to get [326] all of the leads you would give that you [328] would give that a click in our though as [330] I mentioned I want this to run quickly I [331] want it to do I want it to be able to [333] work in the course of a video um you [336] have some additional features here you [337] can Define the search area by much more [339] precise uh parameters so you can enter [343] the postal code you can enter the US [345] County you could enter the state and [347] then you could literally enter the [348] longitude and the latitude if you wanted [349] to like really drill it down and then [352] down here there are just a bunch of [353] different categories that you could [354] filter you could look specifically for [357] um these types of businesses the reason [359] why you can do this is because Google [360] just provides these I think as [361] parameters in the search so maybe we're [363] only looking at beaches or something or [365] beauticians or however the hell you say [367] that word I don't [369] know uh and then last but not least you [371] could also use a Google Maps search URL [373] so this URL right over here you could [374] just copy and paste this and then enter [376] that in and essentially what would [377] happen is that would be the source or [379] the the input instead of this um Calgary [381] Alberta plumber search instead okay but [384] I'm showing you how to do this in apify [386] what we're actually going to end up [386] doing is we're going to end up porting [387] this over to make.com where going to [389] build out the flow from end to end uh [391] but the reason why I'm showing you all [392] of this is just because I want to get [393] you guys comfortable on appify and then [395] once we know how appify Works once we [397] verify the input and the output then we [398] can worry about actually connecting it [400] so that looks good to me what I'm going [402] to do is I'm going to go down here and [403] then press save and [405] start this is now going to basically [408] whip up a server for us and as you can [411] see the memory went from 0 gigabytes to [413] 1 Gigabyte we're a lot at 8 gigabytes [414] because I'm on a free plan I always use [416] free plans for my videos but I do have [418] like a functional appify account the [420] reason why I use free plans is just to [421] show you guys how much you can get done [422] with $5 a month in usage it's a ton you [424] can basically do all the testing you [426] could ever possibly want you could do [427] more or less like half of the scraping [429] maybe all the scraping you'd ever [430] possibly want um but yeah okay and as [433] you saw that that was really quick right [435] A lot of the time if you're doing 5,000 [437] places may take you a little while [438] longer but because we were just doing [439] five um we we basically did it [441] immediately and what you see here is we [443] get a bunch of different pieces of info [445] we get an image which is pretty cool I [447] don't really think we're going to need [448] this image but I I don't know maybe you [450] could use it in some part of your flow [451] if you're looking to reach out to these [452] businesses cold maybe you could feed [454] this image into AI have it tell you [455] something about it and say Hey you know [456] I love how you're I love that picture [459] where the guy is well maybe this [460] wouldn't be the best piece of Outreach [462] for a plumbing company but I love that [463] picture where the guy's doing some [465] Plumbing I don't know maybe this one's [467] better um you know love the fact that [469] you guys have some smiley faces and uh a [471] Canadian flag on your uniforms this [473] stuff like that you get a total score [475] this is the review score review count [476] Street city state right tons of [478] information here the you could use to [479] customize your a reach which is pretty [481] great um but really the column that we [483] want is we want the website so the [485] gentlemen pros.com Calgary MF flow.com [489] doca Franks plumbing and heating Calgary [491] wordpress.com in order for us to do the [493] email enrichment part we actually need a [495] domain name we can't just feed in a [496] business name it's going to work maybe [497] 30 40 maybe like 20 30% of the time if [500] we feed in a domain name it's going to [501] work a lot more often um so basically [504] what I'm going to be doing once we [506] actually build up the flow is I'm going [508] putting every single row here through a [510] filter and the filter is just going to [511] check for the presence of a website if [513] the website exists then it will go [515] through the rest of the enrichment [516] process if the website doesn't exist [518] it's not going to so that seems pretty [520] straightforward how do we actually get [521] all the stuff inside of make.com let's [523] do it all we need to [526] do is um I'm going to be using Google [529] Maps extractors just make note of this [532] URL here this is sort of like apfi sort [535] of API if that makes sense you can see [536] they even allow you to copy it the [538] reason why is so that you can just paste [539] it really quickly into um whatever [541] service you're using to automate what [543] we're going to be doing is we're going [544] to be using this um module here and I'm [546] just going to be calling this local [549] service business [551] scraper plus enrichment [554] system okay so let's pretend there's [556] nothing here at all this is all you see [557] what you need to do is you need to click [558] on this button and go to apify and what [561] I'm going to use right now is I'm going [562] to use the run and actor but the actual [564] scenario that we're using is not is not [566] actually going to use that um and I'm [568] doing this just to show you guys how to [569] trigger things from inside of make.com [571] but it's actually a little bit smarter [572] not to do the triggering um in the same [574] scenario that you're doing the rest of [575] the data and I'll explain why in a [576] moment but we're going to choose run an [578] actor here now what you need to do next [580] is you need to connect to appify so [582] you'll click add and then there'll be an [584] API token all you need to do is just [586] copy this paste this into your search [588] bar and then you'll head over to your [590] appify account with the API tokens um [593] just paste that in and that'll do the [594] connection for you I've already done the [595] connection so what I'm going to be doing [596] is I'm going to be using this account [599] under actor here you can do two things [601] you can map and then plug in the URL [603] that we just did or you could look for [605] the scraper here and you can see it [607] actually already has the compass Google [609] Maps extractor which is nice you'll see [611] there are some settings it says run [612] synchronously um integrat will wait [614] until the actor run is finished beware [616] the maximum time out for the run is 120 [617] seconds the reason why this is valuable [619] to know and understand is because if [621] you're searching for a ton of Records [623] like you know you probably want to be if [624] you're doing an actual scraping job as [625] opposed to just a video demonstrating it [627] you're probably going to need to um run [630] this and then get the results in another [632] scenario and that's what I was referring [633] to before about having about not using [635] the run this actor in the same flow that [637] you're going to be collecting the [638] information from you know uh sometimes [640] these are going to take like 5 10ish [642] minutes to run obviously that's still [644] very little time if you consider the [645] thousands of different results that you [647] could get but uh in our context we're [649] going to be running this on I don't know [651] maybe I'll increase it from five to like [653] 30 just to show you guys what that looks [654] like so we're going to run it [655] synchronously but I know that it's not [657] going to time out so I'm going to leave [658] it at yes for now [660] okay now we get to the interesting part [661] there's this field here called input [662] Json and this is probably the most [664] intimidating field in the entirety of [666] appify um all you need to do in order to [668] satisfy that is go back to the actor [670] here then you see how at the top left [672] hand corner there's manual and then [673] there's Json well this Json is just a [676] copy paste way for you to put in all of [678] the terms that you want um into make.com [681] and you can see if I just hold command [682] and press V if I just try and paste this [684] in like normally you'll see that like [686] the the Json looks really shitty so what [688] I'm going to do is I'm actually going to [689] right click and I'm going to paste in [690] match style and that'll just make it [691] look a lot easier for us to kind of go [693] through top to bottom so deeper City [695] scrape if you remember I turned this [696] parameter to off so um in make or in [699] Json par Lance that is false language [702] here's a location query here's where I [703] type in Calgary Alberta the really cool [705] part about this now is now that we have [706] this in a scenario what you could [708] feasibly do is if you had some other [710] module behind it like a Google map uh [712] Google uh sheets module sorry you could [715] actually use that as the input for this [717] flow and if your Google sheet is a bunch [720] of cities like Calgary uh I don't know [723] Minnesota is Minnesota a city I don't [725] know I'm not [726] American uh you know Cincinnati um [730] Toronto San Diego right you could [733] actually have it iterate through all of [734] those and then you could run this [735] multiple times for each different city [737] so that's where the Json comes really in [739] handy the max crawled places search is [741] five I'm just going to set that to 30 [743] for now hypothetically let's just see [744] what happens search strings array um and [746] then here is basically a big array of [748] the different search strings will feed [749] in Plumber I don't know flower shop um [752] HVAC right these are local service [754] businesses and uh you can feed in [756] basically however many you want just by [758] adding a comma in between and then [760] adding your Search terms sort of like so [762] you don't need to add a last comma here [764] that's fine just that first uh just the [766] one in between records but we're going [768] to leave that here and then for build [770] and for timeout you can just leave those [771] blank it's not a big deal U memory just [773] leave it all leave it all blank it'll [774] just pick the default from appify um and [776] then you don't need to worry about like [777] managing any of that stuff for now [780] okay so why did I get you to this point [781] um all we're now doing is we're [783] basically going to do the exact same [784] thing that we just did over here like [786] physically in the appify dashboard we're [787] just going to do it make.com and the [789] reason why is because that's going to [790] essentially enable us to trigger or [794] sorry about that where the heck was I [796] it's going to allow us to trigger it [797] outside of appify and that's just going [799] to open the door to a ton of other API [800] call Shenanigans and just really cool [802] things that we can do so all I'm going [805] to do is I'm going to right click this [806] and press run this module only [813] as you see it's taking its sweet ass [815] time the reason why is because this is [816] actually spinning up a web server like I [818] was talking about before it's then [820] pumping in all of our Json then it's [821] going out it's actually scraping line by [823] line getting the website it's actually [825] just doing all that heavy lifting for us [827] if you remember last time it also only [829] took us I don't know 15 seconds or so [831] now it's taking us longer and the reason [832] why is because I've fed in more places [834] right I did 30 instead of five so we [837] receive this big output here looks [839] pretty positive we have the capital [841] succeeded scraping finish you can view [843] all scraped places laid down in a map on [845] here it could take some time to fully [847] load for large data sets that's cool [848] then we have a bunch of other parameters [849] meta stats options usage usage USD the [853] one that's valuable to us is this [854] default data set ID all we're going to [855] do is we're going to command click C so [858] I'm going to copy that the reason why [860] I'm copying this is I just want to show [861] you what the data looks like and what we [863] need to do is get data set items down [865] here now appify separates the running of [868] the actor with the actual data that we [871] get as a result of that because the data [873] can usually be pretty big right you [874] don't necessarily want to put all that [875] stuff together you want to make it [877] accessible to people what we do next is [879] we go to this data set ID and just paste [881] in the same data set from the default [882] data set ID parameter here now if you [885] wanted to run this as a scenario [886] obviously you wouldn't just be [887] hardcoding in the data set you'd [888] actually go down and then let me just [890] type in default you'd actually use this [892] uh this variable here default data set [894] ID but because what I'm doing is I'm [896] just trying to run this next module once [898] just to show you guys what's going on [900] I'm actually hardcoding it you can then [903] um select the type of data [904] transformation you want just always [906] click clean unless you are doing some [908] very specific things and then for format [910] Json It's usually the best with a limit [911] of 100 but keep in mind if you have [913] other functions that you want maybe you [914] want to like create an HTML page for the [916] scraper or something hypothetically you [917] could choose HTML um CSV whatever then [920] the limit I'm going to choose 100 just [922] use the default and now that I have the [923] hardcoded default data seted I'm going [925] to right click press run this module [927] only and you'll see that I now have a [930] giant list of every plumber that I was [933] looking for so about 30 plumbers total [935] all arranged in a bundle format here now [938] when you see 30 bundles like this what [939] this is basically doing is it's it's [941] allowing you to run whatever modules [944] come next 30 times once per Dynamic uh [948] piece of data once per Dynamic run so if [951] we scroll down here to website albertab [953] besome doca for [955] instance if I pump that in here this is [959] Plumbing website of a plumbing service [961] that is in Calgary somewhere within my [964] search now what we want to do is because [967] the rest of our our flow if you go back [969] to local business scraper because the [971] rest of our flow requires a URL what [972] we're going to do is we're going to add [973] a filter next and that next filter step [976] is just going to filter out all of the [978] websites that don't have URLs what we're [980] going to do next is we're going to add [981] that to any mail finder which is our [983] email enrichment platform I'm going to [984] show you how to set up the API call for [985] that and all that fun stuff uh and then [988] finally at the very end we're just just [989] going to dump to a Google sheet but know [990] that you can actually dump to a Google [991] sheet at any step in this process right [994] A lot of people will probably look at [995] what I'm doing and think huh why isn't [996] he logging this all to a database well [999] you can do that if you wanted you could [1000] have your next step be a Google sheet [1002] you could dump in all of the websites [1004] into sorry all of the searches into a [1006] Google sheet and then maybe you could [1007] separate it out using search filters or [1010] something like that to only grab ones [1011] with websites just that you have all of [1013] the data you don't have to do any [1014] searches twice in my case though I'm [1016] just being as simple as humanly possible [1017] and this is really what I want the [1019] system to be like I've sold systems like [1021] this for anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000 [1023] so I just wanted to recreate exactly [1025] what that looks like for you guys okay [1027] great so we have the data set items what [1029] do we have to do next well if you think [1030] about it the next thing we have to do is [1031] we have to send this thing over to um [1034] any mail finder which is our [1036] API now there's actually a module for [1039] any mail finder this did not used to be [1041] the case you used to not be able um used [1044] to not be able to do this you used to [1045] have to like set up the HTTP request [1047] custom so we used to have to to http go [1050] down here to make a request type in the [1053] I don't actually know if this is the API [1056] but you know it used to have to be [1057] something like this um let's do company [1061] then we used to have to go post and then [1063] raw and then Json we used to put in a [1066] bunch of information here so this is [1068] what I personally had to do when I was [1069] setting up that system now any mfinder [1071] has a very simple um module that allows [1073] you to do all of that for us and that's [1074] just what we're going to be using in [1075] this instance what I'm going to do is [1077] I'm going to use the search for a [1078] company's emails macher right over here [1081] but I'm not actually going to go through [1082] the rig roll of setting this up and [1084] creating the connection just yet what [1085] I'm actually going to do first is I'm [1086] I'm going to set up that filter what we [1088] want to do is we want to make sure that [1091] website exists the condition I'm going [1093] to be pumping in is I'm going to go down [1095] here to the web site field I'm going to [1098] say website I'm just going to go exists [1101] in this way if there is a bundle of [1104] these [1105] 30 um probably going to take a sweet ass [1108] time to find one where the the website [1111] field is blank the run will stop there [1115] and then it'll go to the next one stop [1117] there next one until it finds one with a [1120] website so it's not showing the filter [1123] right now that's just due to a bug if we [1124] grab this module and kind of move it [1125] around we'll see that it now says [1127] website exists we could also just say [1129] website it's probably a little bit [1130] shorter of a way maybe a little bit more [1131] interpretable it's always easy to it's [1133] always best to make these things as [1134] short as and as interpretable as [1135] possible and the next thing we're going [1137] to do is we're going to now route this [1138] over to any mail finder now in order to [1140] do this you need to create a connection [1141] and in order to create a connection you [1143] have to do a whole thing with like your [1144] API key so click on this it'll say my [1147] anail finder connection I'm just going [1149] to go to Nick left click. then I'm just [1152] going to pump in my API key right now uh [1154] now what we need to do is we need to [1155] search by domain what we need to do is [1158] we just need to feed in that website [1159] parameter which we found let's see right [1163] over here now if you wanted to like if I [1166] couldn't find that I could just go curly [1168] BRAC curly brace [1170] 3. website and do the same thing as me [1173] physically looking for this but I was [1175] trying to keep it as simple as possible [1176] for people in this video going to seeme [1177] that you don't have a pre-existing bed [1178] of [1179] knowledge okay now once we have that [1182] what we want to do is we want to add [1183] this to a Google sheet and what I'm [1184] going to do is I'm just going to create [1185] a really um quick and easy sheet just by [1188] going to sheets. new and then I'm just [1191] going to call this uh in my case I'm [1193] just going to call this [1195] plumber scraping we'll go plumber email [1198] scraping [1200] and then what I'm going to do is I'm [1202] going to add let's see what sort of data [1204] would it make sense to grab from each of [1206] these items um okay we obviously want [1209] like the business name so let's go [1211] business [1213] name then let's go website that's the [1218] URL let's go phone number I don't know [1220] how many of these are going to have [1221] phone numbers but we should definitely [1223] check for the phone number um we could [1225] also grab the latitude and the longitude [1226] too I mean there's really no reason not [1228] to if you think about it like what is [1229] the additional work required here all we [1231] do is we map a single parameter um total [1234] score we could say review [1237] score Place ID that's meaningless to us [1240] um categories we could theoretically add [1241] the categories in here I don't really [1243] think it's that valuable image [1245] categories and then we have a bunch of [1246] other settings down here like we could [1248] get gas prices if this is a a gas place [1252] planning service options reviews places [1254] people also search opening hours maybe [1256] need the opening hours Monday through [1257] Friday um in our case we don't I think [1259] I'm I'm probably happy with this the [1261] last thing we need to do is we need [1262] emails so I'm actually going to leave [1264] emails blank here um and the reason why [1267] is I'm going to use a formula to extract [1270] um the email array and then I'm going to [1272] have like an email one email 2 email 3 [1276] email 4 email 5 and I'm hypothetically [1279] going to say you know there's a chance [1280] that this scraper that this um email [1282] enrichment service actually finds like [1284] five emails for us so what I'm going to [1286] do is I'm going to use uh very simple [1288] formula here to take the an array of [1291] emails that it generates for us and then [1292] split them into five and I'm just doing [1294] this off the top of my head this is what [1295] I did for the client there are many [1297] other ways to do this you could actually [1298] do the separation inside of make.com and [1300] then have an email one email 2 email 3 [1301] I'm just going to use this email array [1303] thing um instead and I'll show you guys [1305] what that looks like okay great so [1307] business name website phone number [1308] awesome what I'm going to do is um [1310] personally I always like to make my [1311] Google Sheets very pretty one of the [1313] things that I talk about very often my [1315] community um which teaches people how to [1316] do this stuff is how important present [1318] is for the client and I know this may [1320] seem simple and all we're doing is just [1321] changing a font and we're maybe spacing [1323] things out a little bit um but I find [1325] that when I deliver Google Sheets or [1328] Google Documents or or whatnot and I [1329] just make the formatting just a little [1331] bit different than maybe like the [1332] default um it usually comes across this [1334] a lot better and people think that the [1336] the quality of the product that I've [1337] delivered is higher one of those quick [1339] little hacks that takes you 5 Seconds to [1341] do but they can really change the game [1343] okay now once we've added this Google [1344] sheet we actually have to add it so I'm [1345] going to go to sheets I'm going go down [1347] here and what I'm going to do is I will [1349] add a [1350] row looks good to [1354] me then what I want to do is I need to [1356] go to the specific account that has the [1359] spreadsheet what I want to do is I want [1361] to feed in Plumber email scraping that's [1364] the same sheet that I'm referencing up [1366] here the sheet name is just going to be [1368] sheet one that's just referring to this [1370] and then table does indeed contain [1371] headers okay great so now we can [1373] actually go through and we can map all [1374] of the data that we got from here as [1376] well as the emails that we've gotten [1378] down here [1379] so first of all business name uh what [1382] was title [1383] website it's going to be [1385] website phone number phone uh you could [1388] do it unformatted too in my case I'm [1389] actually going to do it unformatted I'm [1391] going to allow myself to deal with the [1392] formatting later see how it's one plus [1394] one space 403 Dash right um I could just [1397] do all that work myself or my client [1399] could do the work I don't need to do [1400] that work inside of [1402] make.com uh review score total score and [1405] now we can actually feed in the email [1406] array now I could just add this in and [1409] just stick it in there and that'd be [1410] fine but I actually want to show you [1412] guys what the process looks like so I'm [1413] just going to run this a couple times [1415] without the emails and we're just going [1416] to go from there now because this run an [1419] actor I I don't want to test this whole [1420] flow from start to finish on new data I [1422] just want to use the old data what I'm [1423] going to do is I'm going to unlink this [1426] and then I'm going to drag the schedule [1427] module over here to get data set [1429] items and I don't actually want to get [1431] all the data set items in this case um [1434] actually you know what yeah I kind of do [1435] let's do [1436] 30 yeah so I'm going to leave that as is [1438] 30 uh we should have 30 bundles awesome [1441] and I'm just going to run this once [1442] without the actual email array I just [1444] want to show you guys what it's going to [1446] look like when this populates one thing [1448] that I'll warn you guys is going to [1449] happen is if you add some formatting to [1451] the header row all of the other rows are [1452] going to be formatted kind of weirdly to [1454] start um but uh that's all right press [1457] run once we'll see that it already [1459] passed the website thing which is nice [1462] and the search for a company's emails [1464] flow was done we actually found uh it's [1467] a success true which is weird we're not [1469] actually getting any emails from here [1473] odd anyway we're just going to run this [1475] scraper then go back over here it's not [1477] like we were getting the emails anyway [1479] and as you see I I mentioned how the [1480] formatting is going to be kind of weird [1482] so what I'm going to do is just go down [1483] here and then reset this then reset that [1487] oh and then I'm not going to bold any of [1489] this stuff so command B there you go [1493] unbolded and basically this module just [1495] takes the formatting from the previous [1496] row so from now on uh we're not going to [1498] have to deal with that it's just going [1499] to grab whatever this format is and then [1501] just use the same one underneath it I'm [1504] going to format this a little bit [1505] differently I want this to look kind of [1506] pretty and you see that some of these [1508] Plumbing websites have sort of oops [1510] sorry about that uh they have sort of [1511] weird like uh UTM parameters and whatnot [1514] I'm not going to worry about that okay [1516] so we verified that this works so I'm [1518] going to press stop here for stop we [1521] verified that this works to add [1522] everything except for the emails let's [1523] actually go through the email step so um [1526] I just paused this hence why there's [1527] this sort of like yellow warning sign I [1529] basically forced the stop but what I'm [1531] going to do is I'm going to look to see [1532] if there's a run with an email okay [1536] great so I see that there's one here [1537] Calgary plumbers and drains for instance [1540] there's one over here cross connection [1542] Services there's one over here with [1544] three different email addresses right um [1547] and it looks like uh I don't know maybe [1549] half of them have email addresses looks [1551] like the first few didn't but yeah most [1554] of them do which is quite nice what we [1556] want to do is we want to deal with the [1557] case or deal with a situation in which [1559] there's more than one email essentially [1561] um so what I'm going to do is I'll go [1563] over here and then what I'm going to do [1564] is I'm going to feed in just this whole [1566] email list okay if you want to see what [1569] multiple emails actually looks like like [1570] the actual text that it's going to be [1572] outputting we'll go over here and then [1574] in the top rightand Corner we're going [1575] to go to download output bundles and [1577] you'll see that this is basically what [1579] I'm going to be getting I'm going to be [1580] getting email list Mike Dan gy basically [1583] all of the stuff um just in like one one [1586] big [1587] string uh and let me think about this [1591] specifically this is precision [1601] [Music] [1604] plumbing.com [1605] doca then down over here for the result [1608] uh just for this test I'm going to feed [1610] in this whole email list into the email [1613] array and we're just going to see what [1615] what it pops up [1616] as so I don't actually need to run this [1619] 30 times I only need to run this once so [1621] I'm just going to go to limit [1623] one run this from start to finish you'll [1625] see that the second time it ran much [1626] faster that's because every time it does [1627] the search it actually goes and it [1628] caches the [1630] results okay great you see how now we [1632] have Mike at Precision Plumbing Dan and [1633] precision Plumbing gy at Precision [1635] Plumbing basically um what we can do now [1638] is we can split this email array so [1643] G10 oops uh we need to add the delimiter [1645] which in our case is just going to be [1647] this um comma [1648] and you'll see it actually automatically [1650] adds in all of the email addresses for [1652] us into the first second and third row [1655] which is quite nice I should note that [1657] this is not hardcoded as you see up here [1659] we have the split so if you wanted to [1661] hardcode it you would have to um paste [1662] it without formatting um and you'd have [1664] to paste all these without formatting [1666] but this is a very very quick and easy [1668] and simple way that you can just very [1670] simply map across all these emails so [1671] that having a deal with a bunch of [1673] make.com BS um if you wanted to do this [1676] differently what you could do is you [1678] could [1679] add make.com logic where uh you [1683] basically get from email list the first [1685] email here and then the second email and [1688] then the third email and then the fourth [1689] email but I like the idea of not having [1691] to hardcode it in like that I like the [1693] idea of just being able to add split on [1696] this first row and then just have it [1697] automatically iterate over every single [1699] email all the way down here like [1701] theoretically we could I don't know one [1703] website might give us like 30 emails [1705] right so this way we get to do all of [1707] that without having to just do the logic [1708] and make.com and without having to sort [1710] of I don't know account for it if that [1712] makes sense little bit more scalable of [1714] a solution that way and yeah you're [1716] probably not going to get 10 emails but [1717] uh does not does not hurt I want to say [1720] now this email array for us actually [1721] isn't very valuable so what you can do [1723] is you could just like minimize it and [1724] make it really small if you wanted to [1726] totally up to you okay great so what I'm [1728] going to do now is I'm just going to [1730] delete um let's do [1734] this and then actually let's just delete [1739] everything um and then what you have to [1741] do in order to make this work is you [1743] just have to feed in uh g whatever the [1745] row number is and then just delimit by [1748] this you are going to get an error here [1751] um but that's okay you could also say [1752] like [1753] if uh I don't [1756] know if uh could you do exists I don't [1759] know but you could say like if G2 [1762] doesn't equal uh like an empty string or [1765] whatever then run it I'm not going to do [1766] that right now because again I don't [1768] really care um the the dollar sign value [1770] exclamation point is fine for now and [1774] then what I'm going to do is I'm going [1775] to go back here to now collecting all of [1777] the websites instead of just one I'm [1779] going to go back over here to doing a [1781] limit of [1783] 30 and then now we're just going to test [1786] this on that one specific data set uh [1788] run which is going to be quite nice then [1790] we're going to iterate through all of [1791] these and just see how many of these [1792] emails we get see just all the data that [1794] sort of comes through now the first 10 [1797] or whatever are going to run a a lot [1798] faster now because we've actually done [1800] the execution and what anyil finder is [1802] doing under the hood is they're actually [1803] storing the email addresses that they [1804] found which is quite [1808] nice and for some reason this isn't [1810] actually adding in what I wanted it to [1813] so hold on a [1815] sec title website phone unformatted [1820] H oh you know what it's not adding it [1822] because oh it's not adding it because [1824] you can't actually add this ahead of [1826] time sorry I lied you can't actually add [1829] all of that until you know what these [1832] are so you have to go down [1833] here so we're just going to delete all [1836] of these for [1838] now and then uh we're going to run this [1841] one more [1843] time there you go this looks a lot [1846] better okay so what I'm going to do is [1848] I'm just going to go all the way down [1849] and then I'm going to change this [1850] formatting I'm going to reset reset [1852] that's going to stop what we had before [1854] which is a bunch of weird format and [1855] then I'm just going to unbold all this [1857] and now we don't have the the Bolding [1858] either and now that we've you know [1861] previously it was just running through [1862] rows that were cached which is why it [1863] ran all 13 of these so fast now that [1864] we're on actual data we do need to slow [1866] down a little bit and it's going to run [1867] these sort of like one at a time I [1869] should note that you don't actually have [1870] to run it this way if you run it this [1872] way um it will be it's sort of going to [1874] take quite a while right as you see it [1876] might be like a minute or I don't know [1877] maybe 10 or 15 seconds or something per [1880] run if you were to try and iterate [1882] through thousands upon thousands of rows [1884] this make scenario would actually time [1885] out and that's where the um the API [1887] comes in handy as opposed to using just [1889] these these pre-built modules [1891] here but anyway we're getting a bunch of [1894] data then if I go through you'll see [1896] that a bunch of these have email [1897] addresses which is pretty cool not all [1899] of them are 100% right but uh you know [1901] in scraping you can never be 100% right [1904] like some of these are WordPress for [1906] instance and the reason why it's getting [1907] WordPress emails is because this isw [1909] wordpress.com basically the top level [1911] domain here is is this wordpress.com or [1914] the root domain is wordpress.com Frank [1916] just either couldn't to have his own [1918] website domain or just doesn't want to [1920] and that's fine what we could do as well [1922] is we could add a filter after this n [1923] email finder steps that the only rows [1926] that we're adding here have email [1927] addresses that would make our thing look [1929] a little bit prettier too I didn't do [1931] that in this case but maybe I'll do that [1932] right after this finishes [1934] running okay great so it actually just [1936] finished running and what I'll do is I'm [1938] just going to split G2 by the presence [1941] of this then I'm just going to go let's [1945] just add all of these in you see that a [1948] bunch of these if I add a filter and [1950] then if I sort a bunch of these have um [1954] email addresses specifically it looks [1956] like of [1958] the oh oh hold on we're getting a bunch [1961] of additional rows unfortunately I think [1963] the reason why is because I did not [1965] successfully [1967] delete um the previous ones so I'm just [1969] going to go through here and just delete [1971] all [1972] these oh it doesn't look like I can okay [1975] what I'm going to do is I will go [1978] back here and I'm going to filter out [1981] the presence of blanks okay nice so it [1984] looks like out of the I don't know 26 [1987] that we fed in we got 16 so 16 out of 26 [1990] is about 60% or so of the emails which [1992] is a reasonable good result uh not the [1994] best result but it's pretty solid so you [1996] know if if you were to feed in 10,000 or [1998] so you would get 6,000 email um 6,000 [2002] rows with the presence of at least one [2003] email it looks like we also had let's [2006] see uh nine records with more than one [2012] email oh I guess I have to make that 15 [2014] actually not 16 because this Matt at [2016] WordPress is twice because I ran it [2018] twice um but of that we got nine with or [2021] eight with two emails and then we had a [2023] bunch of these with three emails um so [2025] really like sort of if you were to count [2026] of the number of emails that you're [2027] getting out of the 10,000 websites that [2029] you supply you'd probably get about [2031] 10,000 it's just some of these would be [2032] from the same business granted it's fine [2034] to do that uh because a lot of the time [2036] the same like if you just send it to one [2037] person they won't reply but if you send [2039] it to two people or something like that [2040] the second person will see it talk to [2042] the first person in the local service [2043] business and be like hey did you see [2045] that email that Nick sent us um and that [2047] can actually you know sort of go to your [2049] go to your benefit if that makes sense [2051] but okay I personally don't really like [2053] the way that this looks um sort of got [2055] ahead of myself here and use these quick [2057] hacks I don't like the fact that I have [2058] to add in that information I don't [2060] really like the fact that I didn't [2061] filter it for the presence of email [2063] addresses so what I'm going to do is I'm [2065] going to go down here and I'll say email [2067] email list one has to [2071] exist so now it's only going to dump [2073] emails in if the emails actually exist [2076] which is pretty [2077] nice and what I'm going to do is for [2080] email one I'm actually going to hard [2082] code email list we'll say get I'm [2085] actually going to hardcode that first um [2086] email from the email list and then I'm [2088] going to proceed with my cute little [2090] formula um from the second Point onwards [2093] that's what I'll do and that way I can [2095] make it completely optional and [2098] if you don't want to have a second ugly [2100] looking email you don't have to just [2103] going to filter and unfilter to see if I [2105] have any additional rows here that I [2107] wasn't keeping track of nice [2109] good I'm going to delete all this now [2112] and now that I have this email question [2113] mark I'm just going to run this whole [2115] puppy one more time it's going to run a [2116] lot faster now because I have the um [2119] cached [2122] responses it's pretty nice [2127] and I'm just going to now reset the [2129] formatting oh yeah I got to unbold it [2131] too one sec there we go and yeah you see [2134] that out of all of those runs we ended [2135] up with 16 uh ones with with actual [2138] email ones and then a bunch of them have [2146] more not all of them but a bunch of them [2148] have [2150] more and then if you I don't know wanted [2152] to iterate through more or something [2153] like that you you could I believe in [2155] sheets you could also index or something [2159] so that you could start this whole [2160] process at the second row not the first [2162] but we'll just leave that blank for now [2164] we'll just pretend that you know you [2165] only wanted to get one hypothetically so [2167] I just don't have to make this very [2168] complicated for people that don't fully [2171] understand what's going on here under [2172] the seeds or under the hood okay great [2174] so that's the end to- end system but I [2176] mentioned to you earlier that there were [2177] going to be a couple of differences here [2179] in so far that we can't use this this [2181] run because if we use this run on like a [2182] thousand rows or something then it's not [2184] it's going to take too long basically [2186] for us to be able to run this scenario [2188] so what I'm going to do is I'm actually [2189] going to separate these two I'm going to [2190] have one [2193] scenario um let's do this I'm going to [2196] separate this into two parts the first [2198] is going to run the actor the second is [2200] going to get the local service business [2201] data and then send to enrichmond [2202] platform how do I actually do this in [2204] practice well I'm just going to open up [2205] another scenario [2208] here I'm just going to call this [2210] scenario one run local business scraper [2214] maybe we should actually say Google Maps [2216] extractor [2217] apfi scraper and then I'm just going to [2220] copy and paste this in and that is all [2223] this scenario is going to do it's going [2225] to go on a schedule maybe I want it to [2226] run every day I want it to run once a [2229] day at uh I don't know 1216 p.m. [2233] hypothetically and what this is going to [2235] do is this is going to run that scenario [2237] and in the second [2239] scenario instead of using the run and [2241] actor we'll go back to app five what [2243] we're going to do is we're going to look [2244] at watch actor runs instead [2249] plug that in here and then we have to [2251] create a new web hook [2253] here this web Hook is going to allow us [2255] to watch that specific actor run so go [2257] to actor and then type in Google Maps [2259] extractor we'll say Google Maps [2262] extractor finished click [2266] save that looks good then we're going to [2268] go into the get data set items and now [2270] we're actually going to map the default [2271] data set ID [2273] here then instead of a limit of 30 I'm [2275] just going to set I don't know [2276] hypothetically I'm going to pretend that [2277] we're only going to do 100 at a time and [2280] then now we have everything that we need [2281] to actually run this in reality so I'm [2284] just going to delete everything but but [2286] Alberta Pro drain Solutions just because [2288] I want the formatting to be the same [2289] when this thing runs now what I'm going [2290] to do is I'm going to save this I'm [2291] going to run the scenario now and now [2294] I'm actually going to go here make sure [2296] this is all my data right we're going to [2297] search 30 places nice okay build time [2299] okay great and I'm actually going to run [2301] this [2302] now so this first scenario is actually [2305] going and then running the actor [2307] you'll see that because I left the [2310] sequential um run synchronously button [2313] on it's actually going and it's it's [2314] it's not finishing the the run [2316] immediately it's actually going and it's [2317] actually running it if you go to actor [2319] here then we go to runs you'll see that [2321] this is now actually [2323] going and I think that this just [2325] finished so now if we go back here [2327] you'll see that we caught the successful [2329] run we listed all of those records and [2332] then what we did is we fed that into [2334] default data set ID here and now we're [2336] pulling in actual websites like Frank's [2338] heating Frank's plumbing and we're [2340] actually finding websites just like we [2341] were doing before as I showed you now [2343] these are going to be the same websites [2345] because I'm running a search of 30 and [2347] I'm just feeding the same URL but you [2348] could as you saw before feed in a much [2351] deeper search by going and changing the [2353] the depth settings uh and just making [2355] them go way way deeper and then adding [2357] like 9,999 records or whatever instead [2360] so what I'm going to do is I'm going to [2361] stop both of these oops sorry about that [2364] we're going to force stop you poor [2366] little guy took them out in the back [2368] shed and put them down and I'm going to [2370] export These [2373] Blueprints let's go [2376] here then I'm going to go over here [2380] export this blueprint [2382] too and I'm just going to name both of [2384] these what they are and then I will add [2387] that as a link to the bottom of this [2389] video description so that is that [2390] hopefully you now know everything you [2392] need to know in order to get out there [2393] and scrape hundreds of thousands of [2395] local service businesses for yourself [2397] very quickly I might add as you see this [2399] is quite an inexpensive process you [2401] could theoretically run a system like [2403] this for just a few dollars a day you [2405] just need to spend money on the make.com [2406] operations and then the apfi um I think [2408] it's like memory or runtime or whatever [2410] they gave you the $5 in credits for I [2412] love building make.com systems on camera [2414] if you guys have any recommendations or [2416] suggestions or or requests just drop [2418] them down below as a comment and I'll [2420] add them to my queue otherwise if you [2421] guys can do all that fun YouTube stuff [2423] like subscribe get me to the top of the [2424] ELO and I'll see you on the next video

Title: 5 Things I Wish I Knew About Automation Agencies Before I Started One
[0] hey everybody Nick here and in this [1] video we're going to cover five things [2] that I wish I knew about automation [4] agencies before I started one if you [6] guys are at the beginning point of your [8] automation agency Journey this is going [10] to help you avoid a ton of friction and [12] grow much faster let's get into it as [14] always this is just my own process it's [15] what got me to 72k a month with my [17] automation agency but I'm not trying to [19] be prescriptive here I'm not saying you [21] need to do any of this stuff so just [22] take whatever makes sense to you and [24] then leave all the irrelevant Parts uh [26] no gatekeeping I'm going to show you [27] everything I'm going to give you [28] templates I'll give you a big list of [30] resources basically a curriculum as well [32] so yeah I hope you guys enjoy first [34] things first what exactly are we going [36] to talk about well if I had known what [38] I'm about to say when I started my [40] automation agency I would have gotten [41] much further ahead much faster um the [44] problems that I'm going to be discussing [45] are basically problems that will eat [46] into every part of your business from [48] the lead generation side of things to [50] the client management side of things to [51] the project management side of things to [53] the Fulfillment uh so basically all of [55] these problems just uh they just provide [57] like this General suppression to your [59] ability to grow and I'm going to show [61] you systematically how you can solve all [63] of them in a moment the benefit to doing [65] this now as opposed to doing this sort [67] of as the problems arises you'll just be [68] able to deal with them preemptively [70] you'll be able to inoculate yourself [71] against that and then you know if I [73] could transport this knowledge back uh [76] to me you know about two years ago I [77] probably would have saved and at least [79] made several hundred thousand more [80] dollars uh and I like money so hopefully [83] you like money too the first major thing [85] that I've came to realize now running an [87] automation agency is that being good at [89] automation is is not the same as being [91] good at running an automation business [93] these are actually unfortunately two [95] very different things they require two [97] very different skill sets to very [98] different types of experience I'm going [101] to dive into why right [103] now the issue here and the issue for me [106] as well is that we'll spend a lot of [108] time becoming really good at the [109] automation side of things so we'll [111] become great at make.com or zapier or [114] hell even programming understanding the [115] core principles behind things like HTTP [118] requests scraping apis [120] and we'll gain this massive body of [122] knowledge that will make us great at [123] that but we won't spend a lot of time on [126] the actual automation business side of [128] things right and it's not really even [129] just the automation business it's just [131] like the running a business side of [133] things the reason these are two [135] different things is that the first is [136] engineering knowledge it's knowledge [138] about a particular set of Technologies [140] whereas the other is practical business [141] knowledge it's just knowledge about the [143] general business landscape how to run a [145] profitable and successful company and [147] that sort of thing what I found is that [149] there are hundred of thousands of [150] incredible Engineers many of which that [152] I have personally now hired that will [154] never make more than maybe 5 to 8K a [156] month and the reason why is because [157] they're limited by their lack of modern [159] business Acumen they will I guess [161] understand technically how to build an [163] automation they'll get the reasons why [165] it face value but if you were to ask [166] them to say diagnose the the problem [168] that the customer is facing or really [170] what the business use case is here how [172] you might be able to solve different [173] business problems with a similar system [175] they'll just come up dry and this lack [178] of Mo modern business acument I say [180] modern here because internet businesses [181] are a little bit different from most the [182] other sorts of businesses they obviously [183] share tons of similarities but um by by [187] missing this Acumen essentially like all [189] all you're ever going to be for anybody [191] is just like the Builder you're just [192] going to be like the automator the [193] integrator the Builder you're not going [195] to be somebody that they could they [196] could see working with more on like a [199] partnership level which is where you [200] start getting the real Hefty retainers [202] where you start getting sort of a lot [204] more of the value right more in the [205] Consulting side of the client management [208] than the this is just some little [210] contractor that I'm going to send myself [212] some work to so if your goal is to make [215] money for yourself using Automation and [216] I'll be honest if your goal is to make [217] money for yourself using any sort of [219] business you should learn the [221] necessities of how to fulfill that [222] service and you should do it really well [223] of course I'm not trying to say that you [225] shouldn't I pride myself on my own [226] abilities as an automator and I'm very [228] good at it but the moment that you reach [230] a satisfactory level if you really want [232] to cut down your learning curve you [233] should spend all the rest of your time [235] learning to run the business and not [237] necessarily just fulfilling the service [239] you should learn how to be that [241] consultant or how to be that partner not [243] just how to be that little contractor [245] that somebody sends work to every now [247] and then and the bonus here is that you [250] spending time learning these skills will [252] pay dividends because now they'll apply [254] to all of your future business Endeavors [256] as well like if you're at the beginning [257] stag of starting a business you're [259] probably going to run multiple [260] businesses over the course of your life [262] and if you just like figure out the [263] business problems then hell even if this [265] is an automation business but your next [266] business is like a window cleaning [267] company or something uh the principles [270] therein will be very similar to both so [272] the way that I see it I always talk [273] about Roi and stuff uh for me this is [275] one of the most high Roi things that you [277] can do now how do you practically [279] improve in this great question nick uh [282] if you think about it and I had to do a [284] little bit of research for this video [286] the agency model which is what most [288] people here are doing you can do [291] freelancing as well you could do a [292] couple of other sorts of business models [294] but I'm assuming most of you guys want [295] to run an agency the the agency or the [297] service business model is pretty old [300] it's been around for about 200 years uh [302] the very first Ad Agency was built in [305] 1786 and I think that was in the UK [307] somewhere and it was brought over to you [309] know the United States uh somewhere in [311] the next 50 years I believe and then [313] from there there have been tons of ad [315] agencies and marketing agencies and [317] professional service agencies and that [318] sort of thing that have cropped up [320] obviously to solve these these business [321] problems and since then they've evolved [323] quite a bit as well um but what I've [324] found is that all of these different [326] sorts of businesses that were open [327] they've all converged on a very similar [330] set of skills similar way of fulfilling [332] projects and similar way of managing [334] clients and what I've come to realize [336] are that these skills are very [337] particular they are sales and marketing [339] sort of on the front end project [341] management and client management sort of [343] while you have the prospect or client I [346] should say and then uh the maximization [348] of retention on the back end so some [350] mechanism to get them in some mechanism [353] to fulfill whatever it is that they're [355] paying you for and then some mechanism [356] to get them in again over and over and [358] over and over again just to squeeze as [360] much value and juice out of every [361] Prospect as possible so what I found is [364] no one basically frames it like I did [366] but this is I believe the simplest and [368] most straightforward way to put it the [370] great part is once you break it down on [371] a skills basis you can then just improve [373] in each of these skills um all you need [375] to do or all I really did when I was in [378] a lot of the people that are watching [379] this is shoes is I just read a couple of [380] books I didn't read 500 books I read [382] like one or two books per topic and then [385] I just went out and implemented that [386] specific book like I didn't try and uh I [389] don't know analysis paralysis I didn't [391] try and fill my brain with five trillion [392] different ways of doing things because [393] in reality there are multiple different [395] ways to do the same thing and if you [397] just do what one of those things [400] recommends like prescribes then you you [402] can get there as well so what I have [404] down here is I have a little practical [406] curriculum um and I mean you can call it [409] a curriculum if you want it's really not [410] it's just a collection of five or six [411] books and there are a bunch of YouTube [413] videos that go alongside this stuff and [414] I've watched a ton um but if you can [417] just if you just finish this and then [419] you you know take care of the automation [421] side of things at least for this [422] business model um you'll have like the [423] theoretical basis upon which you can go [425] and and attack this business [427] systematically um and then if you can [428] just get a few of your first [430] introductory clients you can very easily [432] get to a seven out of 10 in all of these [434] skills um and if you're a seven out of [435] 10 in all four of these you'll be like a [438] top 1% top uh agency or service business [441] not just like in your particular local [444] but you'll probably be like top 1% in [446] the world because the service business [448] model is so low barrier to entry that [451] basically this is one of everybody's now [453] especially on the internet first forays [455] into business so if you just like spend [457] a little bit of time refining each of [459] these skills you know a seven out of 10 [461] isn't just like two points above a five [463] out of 10 it's like it's like a 100 [465] times as good right so my little [467] curriculum here and the books and the [468] resources that have made the biggest [470] difference to me um in hindsight are [471] never split the difference by Chris Foss [473] that changed my life completely I use [475] basically every one of the principles [477] that he talks about in that book all day [478] long every sing s day and it's very [480] consultative selling which is now what I [482] do I used to be very Hardline sort of [485] sales but now it's all very consultative [487] and Chris Voss was a massive help for me [490] there and then the science of selling [492] the author isn't coming to me at the [493] moment but the science of selling was a [494] great book as well very systematic [496] breakdown of the sales process for [498] project and client management um I'd [499] recommend these two uh the goal for [501] project management I talk about this [503] quite often it's the way that I've come [504] up with my bottleneck way uh like model [507] of thinking and then influenced by [510] who uh talks a lot about just like human [512] behavior and how to optimize things like [514] reciprocity and and various human biases [516] and whatnot um you're not looking to [518] read these books because you want to [519] become a better manipulator or something [521] you're reading these books specifically [522] so you can manage your clients better [524] you can give them more of what they ask [526] you to give them uh you can go above and [528] beyond and then you can you can improve [529] your ability to retain and that does [531] take me to retention maximization the [532] best book on which I've read uh is [535] called unreasonable Hospitality so I'm [538] going to attach this to the gamma and [540] this is going to be in the link in the [541] description I would recommend you [544] guys this is the first time that you're [545] looking at any of these topics um you [547] know take take a month or two to go [549] through these five books and the second [551] that you're done with these five you'll [552] know basically everything that I know [554] honestly and everything that I use on a [555] daily basis in my own [557] businesses so the second major thing [559] that I wish I could transport back in [560] time is that what you build is not what [562] the client will see basically at all [565] have a picture of what looks like a AI [567] generated Ice Break here and basically [570] what the client sees is just what's up [571] here but what actually went into the [573] project is everything down here and [575] everything down here is like 7 times as [577] big as what the client sees right in [580] reality most of the work that you're [581] going to put in as an automation agency [583] or or freelancer is not going to be [585] visible too or even if it is visible [587] it's not going to be interpretable by [588] the [589] client which is a curse but it's also a [593] blessing it's a massive opportunity just [594] waiting to be taken advantage of it's a [597] curse because it means that most people [599] that have gotten an automation client [601] will spend dozens of hours working on [602] the systems they're working on the flows [604] working on the make.com app your na10 [608] whatever and then they do all that just [610] so that the end result that the client [611] sees is a little email or maybe like a [613] new row added in the CRM or something [616] and so like the dozens of hours that you [617] spend like that isn't reflected at all [619] in the end result it just looks like an [620] email so a lot of clients would be like [622] well what this guy just made an email [623] for me that's it that's the real juice H [626] why did he blog 25 hours then [628] hypothetically [630] uh and that's something you have to [631] fight against which I'll talk about in a [632] second but anyway that's the curse part [634] it's also a massive blessing because [637] when your work is set up in this way it [639] lets you use templates it lets you use [641] Blueprints and it lets you use a lot [642] more to basically template your work and [645] then achieve the exact same results as [646] if you built it from scratch let's say [648] you hypothetically had a system that was [649] just plug-and-play drag and drop and it [651] resulted in that same email um you could [654] have just you know opened up your [655] scenario editor imported that file [657] pressed a couple of buttons and maybe [659] change some of the inputs and outputs [661] total project time which might have [662] taken you an hour and from the client [664] perspective you deliver the exact same [666] result so you can do it in one tenth of [669] the time and then the client gets [670] exactly what they asked for as well [671] which is a win-win now underneath here I [674] have a a bolded section which is that [676] presentation is the most important part [677] of fulfillment and I believe this really [679] really strongly uh and I'll show you how [681] I I've massaged my own delivery process [683] to accommodate this but the way that you [685] deliver your project the way that you [687] present it even the tiny things that you [689] don't really think matter they do they [691] really really do um disproportionately [693] so so how do you actually practically go [695] ahead and fix this in your own business [697] well in order to eliminate this as a [699] problem uh what I did is I put myself in [701] my client's shoes and I asked them you [704] know out of all the interactions with me [706] from start to finish from from all of [708] them what is the client thinking what's [709] the client feeling and how is the client [711] like perceiving me as a service provider [713] so when I say all of the interactions I [714] mean if you could just like zoom out and [717] then pretend that it's just a big graph [719] or like a number line with like the [720] dates upon which you guys have have [722] interacted you know the first one might [723] be the cold email that you sent them the [725] second one might be maybe a video that [726] you sent them the third one might be a [727] call that you jump on the fourth one [729] might be the contract The Proposal that [730] sort of thing fifth one might be the [732] kickoff call sixth one might be some [733] project delivery update seventh one [735] might be the project uh fulfillment then [737] maybe the eth one is like an email or [739] video that you send them in a few months [741] after just to like check in on them and [742] see how they're doing so I mapped all of [745] this out obviously every client's [746] different but I mapped all of this out [747] just on average and I I asked myself how [750] do I maximize the quality of every [752] single one of these things what are the [755] clients seeing it's not as much as what [757] I put into it but what's the end result [759] for the client what are they seeing what [760] what does that email look like what's [762] the Google Doc that I send them look [763] like what's the video that I sent them [764] look like you know when I deliver what's [766] the end result from their perspective [767] not from mine and from there I realized [770] that the vast majority of how a client [772] evaluates the success of your work is [773] not in the many hours that you spend [776] doing the project itself it's on the [778] small little sliver of that Iceberg all [781] the way up at the top they don't care [783] about this they can't see this all they [785] see is that nice cute little part um at [789] at the very top of your project [791] essentially and the cool part about this [793] is this reframes fulfillment completely [797] and it forces you to focus on what the [798] client considers important not all the [800] work that you spend to deliver that [803] thing conceptually I think of this very [805] similarly to the whole benefits versus [807] features thing because you're now [809] putting a client first if you guys have [811] done any sort of copyrighting before [812] there's this massive massive point this [815] this hurdle that people need to cross in [817] order to become good copywriters and [818] that's where you start writing in terms [820] of customer benefits instead of just the [821] features of the service provider [823] features might be stuff like you know [826] our patented 3 XX process um is the best [830] in the market if you think about that [832] like all you're doing is you're just [833] bragging about how great your process is [835] but you're not really framing this in [836] terms of the customer right if you [838] wanted to frame this in terms of [839] customer you'd say something like you [840] know our process is three times faster [842] than everybody else and it costs twice [844] as little and you can get started today [847] with three button clicks right those are [849] all benefits for the customer because [850] the customer is worried about things [851] like friction cost time to fulfillment [853] that sort of thing so this is the exact [855] same process I I feel as doing that just [858] for like your business your your [860] business fulfillment process so exact [862] same concept you just put the client [864] first and you ask them you ask yourself [865] how can I maximize the quality of their [867] experience my example what I personally [869] do um and how I live this vicariously is [872] I will record a video at the end of [874] every one of my projects and then I'll [875] deliver it alongside the systems most of [877] the time the systems that I build what [878] do they do they like I don't know it's a [880] CRM and it updates a record right it's a [883] it's a proposal generator system and it [884] just like creates a proposal template [886] these are pretty and you should [887] definitely spend time on the actual [888] thing itself like in The Proposal case [889] you do have a lot of uh leverage if you [891] make the proposal really [892] beautiful but like the the thing that [894] I'm showing them sort of like the [896] delivery of it um is encapsulated in [898] these videos than the documentation that [899] I provide alongside it that's a major [902] lever that I could pull to make my [903] project look a lot better and a lot more [905] polished so I literally when I was doing [907] this I spent a disproportionate amount [909] of time making sure that the beginning [910] of my video was engaging and interesting [913] and then I made sure that the text [914] documentation that I was providing was [915] great and the whole idea was you know I [917] would literally focus on like what font [919] am I going to use for this like Google [920] doc H you know a lot of people are like [922] well that's a silly wasted time who [923] gives a about the font well the [925] client will The Client just paid you a [926] fair amount of money they they want you [927] to deliver something nice they want to [929] look very polished and if you can make [930] it 10% better and it's just the [933] formatting and it takes you maybe half [934] an hour to do that the client will [936] evaluate the entire project as 10% [939] better because that's really what [940] they're seeing that's the [942] iceberg the third thing that I want to [944] talk about is that in the automation [947] industry there are a million in one [949] things that you can do but only a [951] handful of these things that you do will [952] actually move the needle now what do I [954] mean by move the needle if we take a [955] couple steps back moving the needle in [957] an automation business is making money [959] it's uh generating more top line revenue [961] it's saving more um bottom line so [963] profit it's I don't know uh well I don't [967] even want to say it's like growing your [969] notoriety it's building your network [970] because it really isn't that the really [971] most important thing is just making that [973] cashola making those bamans so at any [977] given point you know if you're running [978] an automation business you basically [980] have a million things that are [981] constantly battling you and battling [983] each other for attention and they're [985] begging you to pay attention to them and [987] and take care of them stuff like [989] updating your website stuff like making [991] your social media pictures all nice [992] stuff like getting some head shot stuff [994] like changing your I don't know changing [996] the way that you wrote the copy or [998] something like that on some email and [1000] don't get me wrong all of these are [1001] important in their own times and places [1003] but where most people are right now [1005] which is under the $10,000 month Mark [1008] the vast majority of these tasks [1009] although they feel productive aren't I [1011] want to say 99.9% of all of the things [1013] that you could do here just are not [1015] productive at the end of the day towards [1017] that end of making more money which is [1019] really all that we should really be [1019] giving a about in reality the [1022] things that tend to move the needle are [1023] very boring they're very monotonous [1026] they're not at all exciting they're not [1027] at all interesting it's not what you see [1028] when you go on Netflix type in The [1031] Social Network and watch you know that [1032] amazing 2our flick uh because all that [1035] you know Hollywood will tell you that [1036] business is is like meetings with a [1039] lawyer big presentations seminars all [1041] that cool in reality the most [1043] important part about um really any [1045] business especially the lower level ones [1047] is like boring monotonous routine [1049] mundane stuff and that mundane stuff is [1052] is what really moves the needle so don't [1054] try and think about how to excel in [1055] business in terms of maybe what what [1057] media has portrayed it as or what [1058] Hollywood has portrayed it as in reality [1060] 99% of the time is just hm I found [1062] something that kind of works I'm just [1063] going to do that really fast it's like [1065] pressing a button that prints you money [1066] and just trying to press it as quickly [1068] as possible imagine you went to the [1070] casino and you just found that one slot [1072] machine paid out a little bit more when [1074] you pulled the thing you know instead of [1075] you losing on aage I forget what it is [1077] like 133% of the time or something um [1079] you won 133% of the time uh like the [1081] most optimal thing for you to do would [1083] be to go to that machine and just like [1084] pull a lever all day every day and try [1086] and find ways that you could be at the [1087] casino more to pull lever more or make [1089] the machine work faster right that sort [1091] of boring stuff is is really how you [1092] become financially successful with [1095] business so the reality is if if you do [1098] these monotonous ass boring things a lot [1100] of which involve customer sourcing lead [1103] acquisition that sort of deal you're [1105] going to move a million times faster [1107] than the people that have these super [1109] exciting interesting lives that you see [1110] on social media all the time that just [1112] had a meeting with some big hot shot [1114] multi-millionaire and they took a selfie [1116] together at some super ritzy cafe or oh [1118] you know I I just traveled to China to [1120] work on some big project like like you [1122] were going to work you're going to grow [1124] way faster than those people if you just [1126] do the things that really suck and are [1128] boring to do but then if you just do [1129] them every day you make more money do [1130] you know what I mean that's one of the [1133] reasons why um a lot of people would ask [1134] me like Nick can you make a day in the [1135] life can you make a video recording Vlog [1138] sort of thing about what you do on a [1139] daily basis and what I do on a daily [1140] basis is I literally just sit here and [1142] then I just type on my computer and I do [1144] the same tasks you know again and again [1145] and again and again they're very [1146] monotonous they're very boring so it's [1147] not really like if you wanted to see the [1149] day in the life of somebody that is [1151] growing and actually improving their [1153] business it tends to be just super [1154] monotonous and if you want to achieve [1156] the same things that they do you just [1157] need to do the same things that they do [1159] so what are some examples of that verbal [1162] diarrhea cold DMS and cold emails are [1164] usually the most consistent ways that [1166] you can get your first customer without [1167] any AD spend without massive uh loss and [1170] margins without you putting much of [1172] capital up front right but they're also [1174] very boring you usually just I don't [1175] know have some process where you find [1177] somebody's profile you try and [1179] regurgitate something unique about their [1181] profile you have some little [1182] introductory offer you want to give them [1183] and then you just do that hundreds of [1185] times over the course of every week [1187] every day basically but for every hour [1190] that you spend on one of these low super [1192] low interest uh boring tasks you get a [1195] disproportionate return relative to all [1197] the other things that you could be doing [1199] and if you guys think back to a couple [1200] of problems ago I mentioned how one of [1202] the things that you should be doing if [1204] you really want to grow quickly is reach [1205] a sufficient level with make.com or [1207] sufficient level with the automation [1208] platform of your choice and then just [1210] move on and start working on business [1211] right this is a really good example I [1213] mentioned reading make.com documentation [1215] I can't tell you how many people um that [1217] I have seen some of which are in my [1218] community and some of which I see on [1220] YouTube and and that send me questions [1221] of email they just spend every waking [1223] hour trying to like brush up on some [1224] fine-tune make.com skill that they will [1226] only ever use 1.5 % of the total time [1230] but they don't spend an equivalent [1232] amount of time on skills that they will [1234] use literally every single day with [1236] customers which are stuff like sales [1237] skills writing skills communication [1239] skills video presentation skills the two [1241] just don't really make sense right so [1244] how do you practically fix this well the [1246] first is you need to separate feelings [1248] of monotony from feelings of stagnancy a [1251] lot of the time we'll feel stagnant [1252] because the things that we're doing are [1253] monotonous and it just the same thing [1254] every day but if I think back to my [1257] fastest growth in business and my [1259] fastest growth on YouTube kind of [1260] building my brand it's just been when I [1262] do the exact same thing every day and it [1264] does feel quite monotonous when you're [1265] doing it but when you look back in the [1267] rearview mirror you know a couple of [1268] months later you realize just how much [1270] growth you've made and how you really [1271] have never made that much growth um ever [1274] before realize that successful [1276] businesses are often very boring and [1278] that's just part and parcel of what the [1279] money-making process is like capitalism [1282] is a game that we have all been [1283] basically unwittingly signed into [1285] especially if you are obviously this [1287] doesn't apply for every country around [1288] the world I know that people have slight [1289] differences and their priorities and [1291] whatnot but it's it's a game that you're [1292] entered into and your goal when you [1294] enter into a game is usually to win the [1296] game or at least do as well as you can [1298] place as high on the leaderboard right [1300] so you need to find the the the the the [1304] ways that you play and if you're playing [1305] Super Smash Bros for instance and the [1307] way that you win the game is just by [1308] spamming the a button or something like [1310] that even if it's the most boring way to [1312] play you should be spamming the a button [1314] if you want to win so what I would [1316] recommend if you're at less than 10K a [1318] month what this means in in reality is [1319] to focus the vast majority of your time [1321] just on sales activities direct sales [1323] activities once you've reached a [1325] sufficient level of knowledge then you [1327] should start to maintain a daily [1328] Outreach regimen and then you should [1329] just make sure that you do this most [1330] important thing first and foremost every [1332] day if you get a handle on this really [1334] quickly um you can you can achieve Leaps [1336] and Bounds more growth than most people [1338] can in just like a month than most [1339] people can in several years um because [1341] you will have done way more Outreach and [1344] that takes me to another point which is [1345] that consistency is worth more than any [1347] master plan you instead of building a [1349] super long-term master plan like I did [1351] many times throughout my business career [1354] um just do your high Roi activities [1356] every day for a month and then just see [1357] where you land you can evaluate [1358] afterwards why well the super long-term [1361] master plan is probably like a year long [1363] two year long 5 year 10 year long plan [1365] and we all have them of course and I'm [1366] not going to sit here and wax poetic [1368] about how 99% of them will never reach [1371] uh you know the goal but we we all have [1374] them but you can substantially improve [1377] your ability to achieve them if you just [1379] do something really small and boring and [1380] consistent every day for a month and [1382] then just sort of see what your progress [1383] is like so the reason why is and I have [1386] to make this more theoretical but in my [1388] mind there are two sorts of problems the [1390] first is proportional problems these [1393] scale directly with the amount of effort [1394] you put in and the second are permissive [1396] problems where they don't scale [1398] proportionally to the amount of effort [1399] you put in they don't all you need to do [1401] is just show up every day hell even if [1402] you show up for 5 minutes every day or 2 [1405] hours every day doesn't really make that [1406] much of a difference you just need to [1407] show up a tiny bit every day and if you [1408] just do that for long enough things will [1410] happen what's an example of the second [1411] thing uh the stock market time in the [1414] market almost always beats timing the [1416] market for instance if you just bought I [1418] don't know the S&P 500 30 years ago and [1421] if you just held AK if you were just in [1423] it every day then right now your results [1425] would be unbelievable I don't know what [1426] the gain on the S&P 500 has been over [1428] the course of the last 20 or 30 years or [1429] whatever but I guarantee you it's been a [1431] lot how about the gym you could spend 17 [1434] hours working out one day but would that [1436] make you would that make you grow 17 [1437] times as fast no it would not it is um [1441] it is a permissive thing if you showed [1443] up half an hour to the gym every day for [1444] 17 days you would grow much much more [1446] than if you tried working out for 17 [1448] hours in one day that'd be a really [1450] interesting day maybe I should try that [1451] that' be a hell of a live stream [1453] blog now in business especially the [1455] automation agency game uh we have [1457] elements of both of course if you put [1459] more effort in you will tend to win [1460] proportionately more um but the most [1463] important factor for me has been the [1464] permissive aspect it's been just the [1465] consistency part if I just show up every [1468] day even if I just record a really lousy [1470] video for instance or if I I don't know [1472] do some really lousy cold email Outreach [1474] or my lead sourcing sucks whatever [1477] that's like that's like the dumb whacka [1479] way to play and yet it works much much [1482] better than trying to intricately work [1483] out everything in advance because [1485] reality is always very different from [1486] your expectations um you know the map is [1488] very different from the [1490] territory when I simply started showing [1492] up and doing small daily activities like [1493] sourcing 100 leads a day or doing five [1495] even five upwork applications a day took [1497] me like 15 minutes 20 or one YouTube [1499] video a day I I would always see [1500] tremendous growth a few months later and [1502] everybody around me would be like Jesus [1504] who the heck is this guy where is all of [1505] this coming from what it was where it [1507] was coming from was that boring stuff [1509] that I was doing every [1510] day now how do you practically fix this [1513] if you consider sales activities High [1514] Roi which we do then building a [1516] lifestyle that allows you to do [1517] consistent sales activities on a daily [1519] basis is even higher Roi what I mean by [1522] this is let's say it took you 3 hours [1524] right now to go and do a bunch of sales [1526] and then I don't know next week you get [1529] paid $900 because of that three hours [1530] that you put in this week right you [1533] could make $900 in 3 hours so you could [1536] have a rate of $300 an hour or what you [1538] could do is you just take one little [1539] step back and you could just find a way [1541] to design your life a little better so [1544] that you can do consistent sales [1547] activities every day for the next [1548] year if you spent three hours [1550] intentionally considering what is my [1552] day-to-day look like how do I optimize [1554] my day-to-day so that I have more time [1555] available for sales activities what are [1557] some activities that I can cut out right [1558] now so that I can just get back to [1559] focusing on sales activities you know [1561] what are some routines that I might be [1562] able to try and let me try and test [1564] three of these and just see my results [1566] if you just spend three hours doing that [1567] then by the end of the year you might [1568] make $328,500 which is 900 time 365 the [1573] point I'm making here is um design your [1575] life in a way that allows you to do [1577] these activities every single day and [1578] you will achieve disproportionately [1579] higher results right if a good example [1582] of what I've mentioned multiple times is [1584] I just have my laptop next to my uh next [1586] to my bed and when I wake up in the [1587] morning instead of me ing at the ceiling [1588] or reaching for my phone the first thing [1590] I do is I'll go to my laptop and then my [1592] laptop's way more stimulating or [1593] engaging than anything else that I could [1594] do so I just start working honestly and [1596] that way I bang out another 45 minutes [1598] of just things that I need to do that [1600] day and I do them without really [1601] sweating or really blinking it's not [1603] hard for me because it's not [1605] proportional it's simply [1607] permissive the best resources that I [1609] found for this um is a blog post on less [1612] wrong which is basically like a website [1614] dedicated to minimizing human biases and [1617] this guy ALK jash who I love to death [1621] posted the sequence a while ago called [1622] Hammer Time and the first one's called [1624] Bug hunt and in this he basically goes [1626] through a bunch of these like [1627] rationality techniques uh to eliminate [1630] the in your day and to [1632] structure it in such a way that you can [1633] be happier and then in my case focus [1635] more on the stuff that actually moves [1636] the needle so I did this a while ago um [1639] right before I was starting YouTube and [1641] then before that I think like a year and [1642] a half before that right as I was really [1644] scaling up my cold Outreach and both [1646] times that I did this I found so many in [1648] my life that after I removed I was able [1650] to achieve you know pretty silly results [1653] and if I hadn't done this there's no way [1654] in hell I would have been able to record [1656] a video every day right it's just [1658] because I eliminated all the Bucks and [1659] all the low hanging fruit in my life um [1661] that I that I was able to do that and [1663] then you know I forget how many YouTube [1665] Subs I got in the first month I think it [1666] was like 3,500 or 4,000 or something but [1669] uh yeah that's really important and the [1670] other one is this book called Atomic [1672] habits which I don't have a direct link [1673] to but you can just get it on Amazon or [1675] whatever I'm not affiliated with it I [1676] don't have an affiliate link but Atomic [1678] habits is really important because one [1679] of the core tenants was if you just do [1682] something every day for a long enough [1683] period of time even if it's like a one [1684] minute thing on day one and a 2minute [1686] thing on day two and a three minute [1687] thing on day three by the end of the [1689] year you'll have achieved I don't know [1691] 3,800 per more or something than if you [1693] had just tried to do it um like like [1696] one-offs trying to do it [1698] sporadically okay so the last thing I'm [1700] going to mention and this is now hypers [1701] specific to the automation industry is [1703] that automation the service that we're [1704] providing is actually very sticky so [1706] your priority in automation is getting [1708] as many opportunities as possible [1710] because if you just get as many [1711] opportunities as possible the ones that [1713] um you you end up retaining those are [1714] going to last you for basically ever the [1717] reason why is because automation has the [1718] potential to touch every aspect of a [1720] person's business so if you just wait [1721] long enough if you just work with that [1723] person for long enough what will happen [1724] is it eventually will you will [1725] eventually touch every part of a [1727] person's business from their Finance to [1729] their their operations to their lead [1731] generation to their sales to their [1732] marketing to their fulfillment to [1734] literally every part because that is [1736] your job your job is to automate but not [1737] just aut at a particular thing [1739] eventually you will want to automate [1740] everything the value there is that if [1742] you're responsible for that it's very [1744] difficult to justify getting rid of you [1746] because you now touch every part of a [1747] person's business and odds are the [1749] systems that you developed over the [1750] course of the last day week month or [1752] year are delivering outsized value every [1754] single time that they do one of those [1756] things right in Practical terms as long [1759] as you're competent your turn is going [1760] to be very low in many Industries turn [1762] is quite high in the automation industry [1764] turns really low so that's one of our [1766] main advantages in automation then [1768] because a lot of your work only needs to [1769] be done once but then from the client [1770] perspective as we talked about earlier [1772] they perceive the value constantly [1774] because they see the emails go out they [1776] see the CRM records made and all that [1777] stuff from your from the client [1779] perspective you're delivering value [1781] basically forever which means you have a [1783] tunnel leverage a single client can [1784] easily be worth over 80k a year and [1786] it'll take you relatively little time in [1788] upkeep so if you want to make a million [1790] dollars just have 12 clients for [1792] instance how do you take advantage of [1793] this in practicality well provide a [1796] disproportionate dummy thick amounts of [1799] value early on to maximize the odds of [1801] getting to work with a client in the [1802] first place then the entire time that [1805] you're working with them like overd [1806] deliver I don't just mean overd deliver [1808] like 1% 2% I mean like drastically overd [1811] deliver constantly so that the first [1813] thing that comes to their mind is holy [1814]  who is this person who is this [1815] company I've never met anybody like this [1817] I need to work with them doesn't matter [1819] if I'm on a $500 a month ,000 a month [1821] subscription or retainer I just need to [1823] have them in my Rolo decks they're very [1825] important the reason why is because in [1827] reality you may think that you're over [1828] delivering but you're not because the [1829] second that you lock in a client with [1831] that low turn your work that you put in [1834] now becomes like 500 times as valuable [1837] you basically instantly get a massive [1839] multiple on the time that you had put [1841] in so what I do is I build overd [1843] delivery into my business model if I say [1845] something is going to take two weeks it [1846] usually takes like a week if I say [1847] something is going to take like a month [1849] it usually takes like three weeks [1850] something along the lines I'm not saying [1851] it has to be minus one week exactly but [1853] the point I'm making is just build overd [1855] delivery into your business model [1857] practical example um if your clients [1859] have a stated timeline of X days to [1860] project completion then deliver an x [1862] minus 3 days and just do that every time [1864] you know show the client a proposal that [1866] says it's going to take this long then [1867] internally when you do your project [1868] management if you're doing it yourself [1870] or if you're assigning it to other [1871] people assign it to that due date minus [1873] three days so you just always go ahead [1876] of time [1877] basically excuse me another practical [1880] example is you know in the proposals [1882] that you send out or in the Scopes [1884] emails or in the messages on platforms [1886] whatever um that outline what what [1888] they're going to be getting give them [1889] all of that and then give them something [1890] extra and just do that consistently [1892] every time literally build this into [1893] your business model build that into your [1895] margins build that into your projected [1896] profit and all that stuff and I [1898] guarantee you you will find like five [1900] times the margin or profit that you were [1902] expecting because some of these people [1904] will choose to work with you long term [1905] the second they're working with you long [1906] term you're basically good you're going [1908] to just get stupid multiples in your [1910] time and energy uh instead of you [1912] spending 10 hours to get one project to [1914] $10,000 you'll spend 100 hours to get uh [1917] one project and that'll pay you a [1919] million dollar right so that is that I [1923] hope you guys appreciated this video in [1924] closing being good at automation does [1926] not mean being good at running an [1927] automation business so distinguish [1930] between the two and understand that a [1932] large portion of your success in this [1933] industry is just going to be in your [1934] ability to acquire like agency skills [1936] that may or may not actually be related [1938] to automation the second thing is that [1940] once you're sufficient at automation AKA [1942] what I'd recommend is once you finish my [1943] introductory make.com for people that [1945] want to make real money course get out [1947] there and just start looking for leads [1948] get out there and start generating them [1950] because that will teach you more than [1951] just spending all day reading ever well [1954] the last thing I going to mention is [1955] that consistency Smooths out everything [1957] so even if your execution is poor even [1959] if your ability to monetize these [1961] strategy sucks even if your writing is [1964] shitty or even if your sales is trash if [1966] you just show up consistently long [1967] enough it'll just smooth all of that out [1969] and you'll win simply by virtue of [1971] overwhelming momentum which I believe I [1973] have done many times before and I know [1975] that many people in both my community [1976] and on YouTube have done as well [1978] hope you guys appreciated that I had a [1980] lot of fun putting it together if you [1981] have any questions about this just leave [1982] a comment down below I'm more than happy [1984] to answer otherwise if you could give me [1985] a big solid And subscribe to the YouTube [1987] channel I'm noticing the number of [1989] people watching to the proportion of [1991] those subscribed has definitely gone [1992] down recently so if you've just watched [1993] my videos more than a couple times I'd [1995] really appreciate it otherwise have a [1997] great rest of the day and I'm looking [1998] forward to the next video thanks so much

Title: 48 Minutes of Make.com Hacks You Didn't Know ($2.5M Earned)
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here and [1] in this video I'm going to run you [2] through a laundry list of make.com hacks [6] that'll both help you build your [7] scenarios like three times faster at [10] least and save a ton of money in [12] operations these are hacks that I have [13] painstakingly had to learn the hard way [16] over the course of the last 3 to four [17] years of building on make.com and I'm [19] going to help you learn them in about [21] half an hour instead so if that sounds [23] like something you guys want to improve [24] on and learn then this is the video for [27] you stay tuned and let's get into it [32] all right we're going to start quick and [33] simple with a few keyboard shortcuts if [35] you were to try and drag a module around [36] in a scenario like I'm doing right now [38] that's great but what if you wanted to [40] drag a bunch together well that's where [42] shift click comes in handy just hold [43] shift click and then drag and you can [45] now select a bunch of modules at the [47] same time super quick and easy I had [50] somebody ask me this in the community [52] the other day so I thought I would bring [53] it [54] up the next is control s or command s if [58] you are on Mac um every time you hold [60] command and press s oress hold control [62] and press s you see that little purple [64] save dialogue happen in the bottom right [66] hand corner basically what I do is every [68] time I make a major change to my [69] scenario whether that's add a new module [71] change the configuration of some I just [72] hold command press s really quickly and [74] then I save and the reason why you want [75] to do that is because if you go to more [77] and then go previous versions over here [79] you'll see that you've actually like [81] make has actually stored a list of all [83] of the major changes that you've made to [84] your scenario and if you save the most [86] recent one you'll end up with a list of [88] all the most recent changes that you've [90] made it just makes it really easy for [91] you to roll back things without [93] necessarily having to go ask yourself [95] crap I really like the way my scenario [96] was working a week ago what the hell do [98] I need to do to to make it go like that [100] right I've wasted dozens of hours trying [102] to rebuild things from scratch when I [104] could have just used this so hopefully [105] that saves you guys a fair amount of [108] time the next and probably one of the [111] highest impact little hacks that I had [113] to learn again the hard way was if you [115] just right click a scenario or a module [117] and then click run this module only [119] it'll only run that specific module so [122] as opposed to me trying to run all 25 [125] modules in my flow here and waste 25 [127] operations every time I test I can just [129] test the specific thing that I'm curious [131] about by right clicking and then [132] pressing run this module only I do this [134] a lot in you know all of my videos as [136] you guys see if you guys are Avid [137] Watchers of my content you'll know how [138] to do this on your end but essentially [140] this eliminates the the the long [142] feedback loop like if you think about it [143] when you're testing a make.com flow [145] using iterative testing like I recommend [147] you guys do uh every time [150] that you have to run every single module [152] in a flow you're basically wasting like [154] 30 seconds a minute sometimes scenario [156] take like 5 or 10 minutes to run even [158] and if you think about the ability to [160] learn from what is wrong and then make [162] the change and then use that to make [164] your scenario better that's a really [165] really long feedback loop imagine if you [167] could just right click press a button [169] then with two seconds within two seconds [170] know exactly what's wrong you're [172] obviously going to be able to build much [173] faster right and that's at the core of [175] what I personally do and why I'm able to [177] move things so quickly um essentially [179] push the needle forward in my own [182] business all right the next thing I want [184] to talk about are set and get variable [186] modules if you haven't worked with these [188] before they can be sort of intimidating [190] so what I'm going to do here is build a [191] purposeful flow just to cover this [193] concept what I have here is I have four [196] modules if you count the router if you [198] don't it's three and on the leftmost [200] side we have a basic trigger module this [202] just allows it's basically like another [204] set variable module just allows you to [206] start flow using this as just like a [208] default trigger so we don't need an [209] action module here we're just using the [210] basic trigger next up we have a set [213] variables module and if I give this a [215] click you'll see that what I've done is [216] I've set a variable whose name is equal [217] to Peter locked if I give this a click [220] you'll see how I did it I just wrote [222] name and then I wrote Peter locked [223] pretty straightforward right next I have [225] a router I just zoom in a little too [228] much there so let me delete this but [230] next I have a router and the router if [232] you only have one route in a flow or a [234] scenario it's just going to continue [236] along the Route it's going to pretend [237] like nothing was here it only really [239] ever does something if you have multiple [240] variables or multiple modules in a flow [243] which I'll show you how that works in a [244] moment um but then that last thing that [246] runs is just this get variable module [248] and the way that it works is you pump in [249] the name of the variable okay the [251] variable key and then it grabs the value [254] for you so if you think about it the [255] output of this is basically equivalent [257] to the output of this and most people's [259] question is well like Nick why would you [260] want to do this the reason why is [262] because this gives you an extra layer of [263] flexibility when you're designing [264] scenarios particular scenarios that have [266] routes take a look at this variable up [268] here or this mod module this is set [270] multiple variables but I I'm Now setting [272] a name and I'm changing the value of [274] this variable instead of Peter lock is [276] now Jackson lock right and if I give [279] this a quick little [281] run you'll see that every module in my [283] scenario ran but if I click on this down [286] here which is what I'm curious about the [288] value of the variable is Peter [292] locked but pay close attention to the [294] way that these routers work this says [295] first this says second basically this is [297] the the order in which the various are [300] executed if I were to unlink this then [302] link this back you'll see that now this [304] is first this is second if I were to run [306] this what do you think would happen well [308] now because this ran before this we've [310] essentially changed the variable value [312] it's now Jackson locked instead of Peter [314] locked so these are two hacks the first [316] is how do use set and get and the second [318] is the fact that rouers will proceed in [319] the order in which they're connected if [321] I unlink both of these again and then [323] start with this that'll be first that'll [324] be second um a lot of the time people [326] use router as a sort of like logical way [329] is to change the way that a flow Works [332] depending on whether or not something is [333] found they use filters basically so give [335] us a click they'll say if x equals to [339] two and then down here it'll be like if [341] x is equal to one right and so if x is [344] equal to one it can't be equal to two [345] therefore you only ever execute a single [346] route but if you don't constrain the way [349] that a router like if you don't add [352] filters after a router it'll just run [354] all of these routes for you and that's [356] where you can start doing some really [357] cool logic so if you go back here to to [359] this other scenario the one that I [361] started with you'll see that I actually [362] make use of that exact same design [363] pattern here I will set a variable [366] called section text the contents of [367] which aren't very relevant and then I [369] will route here with a 25% probability [373] to the secondary function and 25% of the [376] time I'll run it and then I'll set a new [378] variable up here the other 70% of the [380] time 75% of the time I don't actually do [382] this at all but you'll notice that [383] regardless I'm getting the variable so [385] in terms of the flow it's basically um [388] if I could explain it visually it would [389] be 75% of the time we set a variable [392] called section text and then we just get [393] that same variable so nothing changes [395] this is basically equivalent to this but [397] 25% of the time we'll go up this route [399] we'll set section text again and then [401] we'll come back down here and then get [402] that section text and this allows us a [405] ton more flexibility in our operations [407] it also allows us to build vertically as [408] opposed to horizontally and this allows [410] us to get away from some of the very [411] long make Doom flows that I've seen that [413] are like a 100 scenarios and you just [415] have to continuously be dragging all the [417] way to the right if you want to um look [419] at at where things start and finish and [421] I don't just think that's unseemly I [423] think that's just kind of annoying so [425] yeah this is a new design pattern that [427] essentially allows you to gain a ton [429] more flexibility and just do a lot of [431] cool [433] things the next thing I want to talk [434] about is the auto align feature in make [437] if I were to look at our old scenario [439] here and then click Auto align you'll [440] see that things just moved around quite [442] a bit basically how Auto align works is [445] they'll prioritize a flat um scenario [449] from start to to finish and then they [450] will put the first running flow or first [454] running branch of uh scenario up at the [458] top like here which is why we just [459] swapped second and [461] first in addition you'll see that they [464] sort of spread them out equally here so [466] it goes uh straight and then there's one [468] arm that goes up another arm that goes [469] down I don't actually like designing my [471] flows like this and I think that the way [472] that I do it is much better because it [475] instantly provides uh it instantly tells [478] you both the higher key the way that [480] things are laid out and then like what [481] is the main route of the flow and then [482] what's the accessory route of the flow [484] what I mean by this is if we go back to [486] this previous scenario you'll see the [487] way this works is it's basically just [489] one long straight line path at the very [491] bottom and then above it you have these [493] branches and these branches come and [495] then they continue uh straight forward [498] and so in this way we sort of know [500] logically that everything at the bottom [501] is just sort of the main route and then [503] things that Branch off from that main [504] route these are just accessories I also [506] think that this allows us to cram more [508] information in in the same area if I [510] were to try and click Auto align look at [512] what make would do to this you see how [514] it sort of branches it out and then adds [516] these break modules and sticks them all [518] the way in the corner and these angles [520] aren't equal and personally I just think [521] it's pretty ugly um if you were to just [524] go back here discard these changes and [526] this is to me is just a much simpler and [527] easier way to do it so this is just my [529] opinion but this is how I've built [530] scenarios for a very long time I learned [531] it from good friend of mine in business [533] partner a couple years ago and I just [534] think that this is a much more beautiful [537] and simplistic way to do things the last [539] thing I'll mention there is not only do [542] you get to stack modules vertically [543] which helps you save space but uh the [545] way that I I spread these out is I do [547] exactly three of these tiny bubbles in [549] between module to module um to me this [551] is just the simplest way of going about [553] things so I'd recommend that if you guys [555] were to do something similar um you just [556] do like when you Auto align it [558] automatically adds three little bubbles [559] between but this just provides you [560] enough room so that if you were to add a [562] filter you could read the filter where [564] it's not so much room that if you want [566] to grasp the full scenario you [567] constantly have to be moving left to [568] right here from workflow perspective [571] it's a lot [573] cleaner all right let's talk a little [575] bit about API calls now um some API are [577] slow and so in order to make them work [580] you need to space out the first and [582] second calls a little bit and you'll [584] notice that I do this in a lot of my [585] videos I'll have one module then a sleep [587] module and then another module and the [589] two side modules will work on the same [591] API the Sleep module in the middle just [592] gives them a little bit of space I have [595] here a clickup flow it's just two [596] modules one creates a task the other [598] gets a task this is probably not going [600] to break in this particular instance but [602] I've run this over a thousand times [604] across my old writing business and what [605] I found was something like 10% of the [607] time there'd be some issue if you stack [609] to create a task and get a task and put [611] them side by side because you'll create [613] the task and then you will get that same [614] task that you just created um sometimes [617] the clickup API is just a little bit [618] slow and it doesn't have the time to [620] actually finish creating the record [621] before the next module runs then you end [623] up with an error here because it's like [624] wait a second we're trying to get an [626] empty task right uh this is work work in [629] this has worked in this particular [631] scenario run but if you wanted to work [632] across all scenario runs a very quick [633] and easy way to do it is just go down to [635] tools sleep and just add at least a [638] second delay in between the two and a [640] second is usually more than enough time [642] to emulate 99.999% of Errors so if [645] you've run into some inconsistencies if [646] you run into some weird things that [648] logically shouldn't really make sense [650] just add a sleep module in between um [652] especially for like business [653] applications project management based [654] things adding an additional second to [656] your flow will not ruin anything it'll [657] be perfectly fine and this just solves a [660] lot of the common gchas that people [662] experience when they're designing [663] make.com flows uh for for their first [666] time the other one is I want to talk [669] about syntax and how you can write [672] variables without necessarily needing [674] those variables to be present if I go [676] over here and add a set multiple [677] variables module just going to Auto [679] align this so I can see it a little [680] better and let's just say I wanted to do [683] the name of the record then I'm just [685] going to grab this name task name here [688] well have you ever experienced something [689] where um you try and get a variable but [692] that variable doesn't exist in the [694] previous module and for whatever reason [695] here on the right hand side you're just [696] not finding that specific variable to me [698] this happens all the time and there's [700] actually a really quick and easy way [701] that you can just access the same thing [702] regardless all you need to do is you [704] need to put the raw name in between two [707] curly braces so what I'm doing here [709] sorry this's a little firet track [712] outside but what I'm doing here is I'm [714] going to add two left curly braces and [716] then if I just Mouse over this you see [718] how it says raw name I'm just going to [719] put name here you notice that that [721] doesn't work so you have to go one step [723] further what you have to do is go curly [724] braces one so you have to get the number [727] here do name and then close it out like [729] that and it'll automatically transform [731] it into whatever the variable is so uh [733] you go curly brace one. name [736] voila in Click uh in make.com all [739] modules have their own number which is [741] why um when I just put in name you know [743] it was black it didn't really make any [744] sense if I tried two. name you'll see [746] here that I'm now selecting from a [748] different module previously I was [750] selecting from this one now I'm [751] selecting from this [754] one so you know you just need to make [756] sure to put the number of the module [757] that you are [758] calling um into whatever this is and [761] this works with any one of these so if I [763] wanted to I don't know get this color [765] notice how it says raw color and the [767] parent says Raw Status so what I have to [770] do is I have to go one and then I have [771] to do a DOT and then write status and [773] then underneath I have to write the [775] child there which is color so see here [777] now that I'm getting status color see I [779] could click on this but I could also [781] write uh one status type if I wanted to [783] get type or one let's see what's this [786] order index [788] one. order index like this in order to [792] get order index maybe I wanted to grab [794] the sharing here so I'd go one. sharing. [798] SEO [799] optimized right uh this works even if [801] the variable is unselectable so if I [803] knew that there was theoretically a [805] variable somewhere around here um that [807] you know for whatever reason wasn't [809] popping up in my module picker I could [810] go one. space do uh I don't know let's [813] just pretend there's a child of space [815] called token value you'll see that now [818] instead of it being filled in it's just [820] bordered here and this tells you that [821] hey man the module that you're calling [823] exists and so do some of the variables [825] but the exact like final one here we [828] can't actually find in the test history [831] uh so we're going to fill this in for [832] now and then if the data is available [834] when you run we're going to we're going [835] to add it um but if not you're going to [837] have some error it's going to be an [838] empty value so yeah that's how you use [841] this syntax you'll notice that if you do [842] two left curly brackets and two right [844] ones it just like disappears that's [845] because this is just make.com way um of [849] demarcating what is a variable or not if [851] you go to the text and binary functions [853] for instance and you want to put in some [854] of these keywords if you just do the [856] keyword surrounded by two curly brackets [858] you'll actually be able to instantly [860] create one of these you'll notice that [861] this works for the keywords doesn't [862] really work for the [864] functions because it just looks it just [866] thinks we're trying to call a function [868] call or a keyword called length um if [870] you want to do functions you have to [871] write the variable name and then you [872] have to do a left bracket instead just [875] like [876] this so notice that you know no other [878] combination works but if I just do a [880] little left bracket it just pattern [881] matches that as a function that exists [883] if you want to call a variable here like [885] a uid um same thing uh let me just see [888] if there's anything else here that maybe [890] you guys could could [892] see if you want to do mathematical [894] operators just curly braces and then put [895] an equal sign like this is just a string [898] that has an equal sign but this is the [900] actual mathematical operator and make [902] that has the equal sign same thing if [904] you wanted to do this um same thing if [906] you wanted to do oh I don't think and [908] works actually unfortunately I think you [910] have to do an and here there you go and [913] then I think for or you have to do a [915] pipe so it has to be this vertical pipe [917] um but you know the vast majority of the [919] way that this works it's pretty [919] self-explanatory after you figure out [921] this value so play around with that and [923] see what other sort of variable values [925] uh names there are both in make and then [928] in your previous module run [931] histories the next thing I want to talk [933] about is the email module and why it is [935] vastly superior to the Gmail module so [938] if I click on this favorites and I click [939] add you'll notice there's an email [941] module if I go to Gmail you also notice [942] that there's a Gmail module most people [944] when they're starting out in make [946] they'll be using Gmail and they'll think [947] well I'm just going to use the Gmail [948] module Gmail specifically for email this [950] is just one of those things that you're [951] not going to know unless you use make a [952] bunch the Gmail module is just vastly [954] inferior to the email module in [955] basically every way um the Gmail module [957] is filtering just doesn't work very well [959] I'm not going to like hit you over the [961] head with this a million in one times [962] I'm just going to say that um everything [964] that you can do in the Gmail module you [966] can do in the email module instead it's [967] the exact same connection um it's just [969] faster it's it's more accurate I'll find [972] so anytime that you're going to use the [973] Gmail module just use the email module [975] instead as I mentioned all the same [976] functionality exists it just tends to [978] run a lot faster and more accurately um [981] and then the Gmail module tends to have [982] a bunch of issues with connections where [984] you have to reconnect constantly and [985] this just solves that so you're not [986] going to have to [989] the next thing I'm going to talk about [990] is prioritizing acid and instant [992] triggers as opposed to ones that are [994] just acid or ones that are just schedule [995] based that don't have either if I were [997] to try and create a type form module [999] here you notice that under responses [1001] which is a a a trigger there are a [1003] variety of different modules I can [1004] choose from there's get a response file [1006] list responses watch responses and then [1008] watch responses instant acid you're [1010] probably wondering what the difference [1010] between these two is well if I were to [1012] use this watch responses [1014] module and just give myself a little bit [1016] of space here sorry for jumping around [1019] and then zoom in and let's just [1020] hypothetically say I wanted to use one [1023] of the many forms that I've [1026] developed maybe this one right [1030] here you'll notice that um I have an [1032] ability to choose where to start so I [1034] could start from now on since a specific [1036] date I could choose all of my records or [1037] I could choose manually I could actually [1039] like reach and choose a specific one in [1041] my case I don't have any because I don't [1042] think this form has run but the [1044] difference between the instant modules [1046] and then the ones that are just acid is [1049] you'll notice that this has a um clock [1051] next to it with a schedule the reason [1053] why is because it's basically asking you [1055] hey what interval do you want us to [1058] check to see whether or not something [1059] has been put in a new form submission or [1062] a new contact record or whatever the [1064] specifics the module you're you're [1065] working with this is called polling and [1068] it's a vastly inefficient way of getting [1070] data the alternative is event driven [1074] flows which have the term instant next [1076] to them and notice how these have the [1079] exact same name watch responses and [1080] watch responses but if I move this here [1083] that schedule that little clock changes [1085] to an electricity sort of Thunder thing [1087] the reason why is because this one runs [1088] instantly whenever a new response comes [1090] in because this is event driven this is [1092] web hook driven and these are [1093] fundamentally different ways of doing [1094] the same thing if you think about it if [1096] I were to use this and this were to run [1097] every 15 minutes basically what's [1099] happening on the hood is every 15 [1100] minutes I'm checking to see if something [1102] has been entered like a new type form [1104] has been filled out and if you think [1105] about it um 15 minutes is a quarter of [1107] an hour right so it happens four times [1108] an hour and if you want to do it every [1109] single hour that's 96 times a day so if [1113] all I were doing were this then every [1115] day I'd be wasting 100 operations what [1117] if my flow looked like this well now [1119] every day I'm wasting 400 operations or [1121] I'm doing 12,000 a month right that flow [1124] in and of itself is enough to completely [1126] exhaust all of your operations for the [1127] month if you're own one of like the [1128] normal 10K a month plans whereas if you [1131] were to do something like um this [1134] instant trigger let's say you only got [1136] two form submissions a day even if you [1138] add all these up together that's only [1139] running a total of eight operations so [1142] as you can see these uh web hook driven [1144] or event D driven flows are [1145] substantially more efficient and so if [1147] you have a choice to choose between an [1149] instant and then one that's just acid [1150] always choose the instant um instant [1153] will just make your life a lot [1155] easier okay on that note if you find [1158] some piece of functionality that you [1160] need or you're looking for some type of [1163] trigger and you notice that there's no [1166] instant um thing associated with that [1168] trigger like for instance this email is [1170] watch emails you'll notice that this [1172] watch emails runs the exact same thing [1175] as that previous one did so I have to [1176] select the right folder here so let me [1179] just choose this and then I'm just going [1181] to make this uh oh I don't think my [1183] connection Works actually let me see [1185] this probably the most recent one I to [1188] guess might have to reconnect it um [1191] again because it's been about a month [1192] and I've changed my whole thing a bun [1194] okay I'm going to go to inbox here uh [1197] and then I'm going to do all emails [1200] notice that I have to choose where to [1201] start again but if I if I rightclick and [1203] press run this module only sorry I [1205] haven't chosen where to start let's just [1206] do all emails it'll actually go and [1208] it'll grab the first email in my inbox [1210] right 46 years old and starting over [1213] somebody sent me a message basically [1215] asking me for some help um quite a while [1217] back but anyway the point that I'm [1219] making is uh this is not web hook driven [1221] it's not event driven but the cool thing [1223] is make allows you to very easily [1225] convert the vast majority of things that [1227] are not instant into instant just by [1229] creating a web hook and then sort of [1231] building your own integration so web [1233] hooks here allow you to essentially [1235] create your own thing right and if I [1237] drag this uh schedule icon from here [1240] down to here you'll see that i' change [1241] into a thunder well one very quick and [1244] easy way to turn any watch emails flow [1246] into one that is vent driven is use a [1249] mail hook and I realize I I selected the [1251] wrong module there so let's go here [1253] let's go web Hooks and then we'll go [1255] custom mail hook the way that a mail [1256] hook works is it's basically a foring [1258] address address that you just forward [1259] emails to and the second that you [1261] forward an email to it it'll run [1263] immediately if I go down here and then I [1265] say new email [1267] received I now am given a URL and this U [1271] sorry an email address and this email [1272] address is an email address that I can [1274] just forward any email to and the flow [1277] will instantly [1284] start I just sent out that email if I go [1286] back here after Gmail who typically [1290] holds emails for another 5 to 10 seconds [1292] just in case you sent the wrong thing [1294] after they do that you'll see that I've [1296] now received my mail hook and it has the [1299] text it has everything I need and it ran [1300] instantly within a few seconds basically [1302] of me sending that if I were to use the [1304] watch emails module instead it would [1306] just be constantly running in the [1307] background every 15 20 or however many [1309] minutes I scheduled it for it would [1311] consume all my operations and it just [1312] also wouldn't be yeah it wouldn't be [1314] running very quickly like what if it was [1316] something some use case where I really [1318] really [1319] needed good Lord apologies what if it [1322] was some use case where I really really [1324] needed to get back to that person [1326] immediately if it was like some [1327] transactional email or if it was just [1329] some something um well if I was watching [1331] it every 15 minutes at minimum or at [1333] maximum there'd be about a 15minute [1334] delay between when I received the email [1336] and when I responded to it this way I [1338] might have 10 or 15 seconds [1340] instead all right in this next one I'm [1342] going to show you guys how to instantly [1344] create basically whatever data structure [1346] you want very easily and it's using [1348] Jason or JavaScript object notation I [1350] unfortunately learned this pretty late [1351] in my make.com career I already knew how [1353] Jason worked um conceptually and I knew [1355] what the the format was but I never [1357] really realized I could apply it to make [1359] basically Jason is just this curly brace [1361] as an opener the variable name and then [1363] a colon and then a variable value and so [1366] this is now Json that represents [1369] something very similar to what we see in [1370] make.com and the magic here is if you go [1373] to sorry if you click on this plus press [1375] Json and then look for parse Json and [1378] just add whatever the string is that [1380] contains Jason here and if you click run [1383] once the output of that module is going [1385] to be um basically like the make.com [1389] variable syntax that we can map that [1390] we're all used to so this is what we fed [1392] in and then this is what we got we [1394] actually got something where in a future [1396] module if I wanted [1398] to let's see set another variable [1401] hypothetically with that [1403] value we'll notice how now we have a a a [1405] variable called name value the one from [1408] our Jason module here um actually has [1410] this string in it um curly brace quote [1414] name quote colon quote value quote curly [1416] brace um but now we can actually just [1418] reference the value and in this way you [1420] can create arbitrarily complicated data [1422] structures very very easily so maybe I [1424] have name value maybe I have list and [1426] then I have an array item one array item [1431] two um we can add I mean as arbitrarily [1434] as many as we want but now if I were to [1436] look at this parse Json you'll see that [1438] we have a name value and then a list [1440] which is an array which has these two [1441] array items you can imagine how if [1443] you're testing something is really [1444] really really convenient because now you [1446] can basically provide the entire data [1448] structure of the flow that you are [1449] looking to do just in these two modules [1453] and then instead of you having to go and [1454] I don't know fill out a type form every [1456] time you want to test the flow or create [1457] a new task and clickup every time you [1459] want to test it um you can just do it [1460] here inside of make and so you're [1462] basically creating artificial data which [1463] makes testing your module way [1466] easier all right the next thing I want [1468] to talk about about is array indexing [1469] and how to index into an array which [1472] just means select a particular element [1474] in an array using numbers so you know [1476] how here we had this set multiple [1478] variables module right well let's say I [1480] wanted to grab a specific [1484] item from this list here you see how it [1487] says number one is array item one well [1489] if you remember there was a second array [1490] item in there called array item two I'll [1493] prove it to [1495] you if I go to the parsejson module [1497] you'll see that inside this array we [1498] have array itm 2 well the question is [1501] you know Nick if you click on this how [1504] the heck do I get array item 2 I can [1506] only see array itm 1 well the trick is [1508] if I were to click array itm 1 here and [1510] I were to run this and go back you'll [1513] see this successfully picked up array [1514] item one but you'll also notice that all [1516] of a sudden in this variable value field [1517] here there's a space the purpose of the [1520] space is to allow you to select specific [1522] elements that are ordered starting from [1525] one and then ending at however long the [1526] list is so I wanted to get get the [1528] second item I would go list and then I [1530] would go two and this is array indexing [1532] this will allow me to pick that specific [1534] element array item two from that from [1537] that array I can do the same thing [1539] arbitrarily many times so I don't know I [1541] want like five array items here's three [1544] here's four here's five if I run this [1546] and maybe I want to get the fourth one [1548] give this thing a little run you'll see [1550] that I'm now grabbing array item four if [1551] I'm doing two [1554] instead I run this now I'm getting [1556] number two uh and then if you do one or [1559] if you just don't add anything in there [1560] it'll just automatically select the [1563] first all right next up is how to scrape [1565] the HTML of a website in less than 5 [1567] Seconds this works for [1570] 99.5% of websites out there nowadays [1572] because they're all static all you have [1573] to do is create an HTTP module called [1576] make a request this is like the fifth or [1577] the sixth one down it's right over here [1580] then you just have to type in the URL of [1582] the website that you're scraping I'm [1583] going to type in my own the method needs [1584] to be get and the body type has to be [1586] raw content type Jason application Json [1589] click parse response yes give that a run [1592] and at the other side of the result [1594] you'll see that you basically just got [1595] the full HTML of that whole website the [1597] second that you have the HTML of the [1599] website it's the exact same thing that [1601] we see [1602] here the second that you have the HTML [1604] the website you can do really cool [1605] things with it so in a ton of previous [1607] videos I've shown people how to uh [1609] scrape website data by converting things [1611] into text if you go to text parser you [1613] can go HTML to text here you can convert [1615] this HTML into something that's actually [1617] readable [1619] now you have a bunch of information [1621] about a person's website you a bunch of [1622] text you could feed all of this into AI [1625] so maybe we want to use an open AI [1627] module called create a completion then [1629] we just want to [1631] write GPT 40 let's do user tell me [1636] something about this website we're going [1638] to feed in this text we want 496 tokens [1641] if I press run [1644] once it's now calling AI with the entire [1647] body that I fed in which is pretty long [1649] mind you so we're going to be using a [1650] fair number of tokens but you can [1651] imagine that you can text process this [1653] to make it shorter and the result is a [1655] very deep in-depth uh guide maybe [1658] instead you want it [1661] to Output in Json only like this and you [1666] want uh I don't know description on line [1671] description email [1675] address if there is no email leave it as [1680] blank well now what we're doing is if we [1683] add a Json parse Json module there and [1686] then feed in the output of that previous [1687] run well now we basically created our [1690] own scraping system and it only took us [1693] a few seconds sorry the reason why it [1695] didn't work that time is because it [1696] actually output a specific thing there [1699] um don't output any back ticks [1702] no your first character should be a [1706] curly brace [1708] okay and now if we run this [1712] again you'll see that we now have [1714] basically parsable data here um with a [1717] oneline description and then we even [1718] have an email address field where maybe [1719] there's an email on the website well now [1721] we can actually parse it in a second get [1723] that and then if there is an email we'll [1724] do something else if we don't do it then [1726] if we don't have one then we'll do [1727] something [1729] else okay the next thing I want to talk [1731] about is the presence of a switch module [1733] and how switch modules allow you to take [1735] a million different possibilities and [1737] then just push them all into one route [1739] instead you know how earlier we talked [1740] about if there was an email address we [1742] do one thing if there wasn't an email [1743] address we do another thing well that's [1745] where switch values come in handy if you [1747] think about it logically if I wanted to [1748] do this what most people would think is [1750] they would slap a router in there and [1753] then they'd have some function here I'm [1754] just going to use these set variables [1756] here because that's a little [1758] easier and then what they do is they'd [1760] say if email address doesn't [1764] exist then we have some top route that's [1766] no email and and then if email address [1770] exists then we have some bottom email or [1772] bottom route right and this may look [1775] okay if it's the first time that you [1777] built something like this you don't [1778] actually need any of that you don't need [1780] to split the r up like this you don't [1782] need to add a ton of complexity like uh [1784] what usually people will do in routes is [1786] they're they're just going to do the [1787] same thing there's just going to be one [1789] tiny little difference between the two [1790] and that's just going to be the presence [1791] of that variable or not um and so [1794] instead of you having to have two routes [1795] with exactly the same thing you could [1797] actually squ squish all of these [1798] together just using the the presence of [1800] a switch module which I'll show you how [1802] to do right [1803] now so basically um instead of this [1806] router we could shave this down a little [1808] bit I'm going to remove this filter and [1810] all we need to do is go to add and then [1812] type in switch you'll be taken to tools [1814] and then switches all the way down here [1816] at the bottom and the way that switch [1818] works is you basically put the input in [1820] here so the thing that you want to route [1822] based off of so the thing I want to [1824] write route based off of is this email [1826] address and then what you can do is you [1828] can supply cases and you could say hey [1831] if this then do this if that then do [1833] this then do that I me you get to do all [1836] of that right here and what you do is [1838] you get to set the output variable and [1841] make it equal to something based off of [1843] the presence of an input variable so for [1845] instance we could have a pattern where [1847] if this is empty then we want to output [1850] something I don't know maybe we want to [1851] Output just the words empty okay and [1854] notice what's going to happen I'm just [1856] going to close this notice what's going [1857] to happen if we run this now with an [1859] empty um email the output to this is now [1862] empty you'll notice that the input to [1864] this was uh the email address right but [1867] now the output is empty and so we're [1868] doing is we're switching the output [1871] based off of an input the cool part [1873] about switches is you can make them [1874] arbitrarily complex let's hypothetically [1877] say that in addition to like I just fed [1881] in a bunch of website text here right so [1883] let's actually just say nick. left [1885] click. is in the text that I'm I'm [1887] feeding to the air well now it's going [1889] to find this and it's going to add this [1890] to my email [1892] right so let's let's say that there are [1894] a bunch of other routes let's say [1895] there's one where I'm looking [1896] specifically for this and we'll say it's [1898] Nick and then there's another one where [1899] I'm looking for somebody called John [1901] I'll say it's John notice how we have [1904] three possible routes or three possible [1906] variables that we could set the value of [1908] based off of the presence of something [1909] in here um there's also this else uh [1912] option which essentially says if it [1914] doesn't fit any of these options then we [1915] want to use this [1920] and if I add in the data like this and [1922] press run anyway let's see what happens [1924] now you'll see how the output is its [1927] Nick why well because if I look at the [1929] Json we now have an email address Nick [1931] equals to left click. a and so instead [1934] of me having to route based off of the [1936] presence of an email or the lack of an [1938] email or something like that we could [1940] just switch and then use the output [1941] variable to do the things that we want [1943] it to do a common thing here is if you [1945] are doing something in clickup or [1947] something in a CRM that has IDs you [1950] could change the subsequent ID based off [1953] of the [1954] switch all right the next thing I want [1956] to talk about is a very simple design [1958] pattern that I always use in basically [1960] every flow it's what I call the trigger [1962] and the list design pattern so [1965] hypothetically let's say that we have a [1967] scenario here um that uses type form and [1969] this doesn't just work with type form [1970] this works with any sort of twep flow [1972] like this this will work with any form [1975] system basically so jot form it it'll [1977] work with like a bunch of Google Sheets [1979] things it works with basically anything [1981] the point that I'm making is um you'll [1983] have some type of action or some type of [1985] trigger rather uh like the type form [1987] watch responses module here which will [1988] trigger every time you fill it a form [1991] that you select so every time I fill out [1993] this content generator brief web hook [1995] thing it'll fire and then it'll run and [1999] then uh the vast majority of these form [2001] platforms or these inputs usually have [2003] another module that lists or searches or [2005] gets a bunch of responses and so the [2008] reason why I split these into two parts [2010] here and the reason why this is so [2011] valuable is because essentially if [2013] you're testing a big flow that requires [2015] a form to be used as the input to that [2017] flow then anytime you want to test that [2019] flow you basically have to go through [2020] and you have to fill out the entire form [2022] again so if I wanted to run this thing I [2024] would literally have to go through this [2025] content generator brief and I have to [2026] fill this out every freaking time that I [2028] wanted to run the thing and you can [2030] imagine now if I actually wanted to fill [2032] out like this form with like legitimate [2034] good-look data it would probably take me [2036] like 2 minutes every single time that I [2038] wanted to run this thing if you if it [2040] takes you 2 minutes to run a scenario [2042] just to test it and you test it even [2044] like 15 times which I would say is an [2045] average number of times that I test [2047] something you just added half an hour to [2048] your build time here instead what you do [2051] is you split this up into two parts one [2053] that watches and then another lists and [2055] when a form is submitted it runs this [2057] watch but then it also has a list and I [2059] split these with a sleep because I like [2061] to make sure that there's enough time [2062] between the two like I talked about [2063] earlier but anytime you want to test all [2065] you do is you unlink this and then you [2066] drag this to the list list and then you [2068] can just right click and press run this [2069] module only and that way you can [2071] actually just get the exact same data [2073] that you just filled out and you can [2075] just repeat that over and over and over [2076] and over and over again so instead of [2078] you having to physically go through and [2079] fill out a form every time now it takes [2081] you two seconds you just right click run [2082] this module only um you you ensure that [2085] that has the data that you want and then [2086] you just start the rest of the flow [2088] using that so very very quick and easy [2090] way of doing this um in order to make [2092] this work the best you should probably [2093] just set limit to [2094] one so I'm just going to write limit [2096] equals 1 for type form [2098] this works with Google Sheets too Google [2099] Sheets is like a search um rows module [2102] this works with the vast majority of [2103] form systems this works with basically [2105] everything and it's just a quick and [2106] easy way to ensure that when you test [2108] you test fast again the whole point of [2109] make.com is to minimize the feedback [2111] loop if you really want to do this well [2113] you just minimize the amount of time [2115] between when you test something and when [2117] you see the results of that [2120] test okay another thing I want to talk [2122] about is a second design pattern that I [2123] use which I call the split and the get [2125] design pattern and if you watched a [2126] couple of my videos you probably seen me [2128] do this so let's say that um I'm going [2131] to use this Json flow that I developed [2133] here earlier let's say that I have a [2137] full name value and the name is me Nix [2140] RVE okay I'm going to take that and then [2142] I'm going to parse it right and when I [2144] parse it what's going to happen well [2146] we're going to get a result that says [2148] Nix but let's hypothetically say I don't [2150] actually care about the full name I just [2151] want to get the first name how do I get [2153] it really quickly well I use split and [2156] get so let's do first let's also do last [2158] name just for [2159] shits the question is how do you get [2162] only the first half of this name well [2164] you use the fact that there's a white [2165] space in between to split the variable [2168] based off of the presence of a space [2171] like that now if I were to do this I'm [2174] just going to copy this in both here if [2175] I were to do this and then run what is [2177] the output of this you'll notice that [2179] the output is we now have an array with [2181] the first and the last name split into [2183] one and then two so we've already done [2185] half the battle all we have to do now is [2187] we have to select or index the specific [2189] element in the array that we want and [2191] similar to uh array indexing like I [2193] showed you earlier it's just instead of [2194] using that dot notation thing that we [2197] were doing sorry not the dot notation [2199] but the bracket notation we were doing [2200] earlier we just use the function called [2202] get we get and then we do a bracket then [2205] I move to the end here and then I select [2207] which result I want first or second so I [2210] selected the first result there if I [2212] want to do this and get the last name [2213] here what I would do is I would go to [2214] the end and then press two and now if I [2217] press on once you'll notice that I now [2218] have the first name where I want it to [2220] be the last name where I want it to be [2221] this doesn't just work on first names [2223] last names or sort of like name related [2225] things this works with basically [2226] anything um once you get the keyboard [2228] shortcuts down you'll notice that it's [2230] super easy I can do this whole thing in [2231] like one second basically split this [2233] based off the presence of a space and [2235] then get this based off of uh its [2238] position one or two that took a little [2240] longer than one second but I think you [2241] guys catch my [2243] drift all right so I remember a moment [2245] ago where I showed you guys this [2246] two-step design pattern with a watch and [2248] then a list well I have another hack [2250] that works quite similarly to this and [2252] works for instances where you're not [2254] just trying to trigger something but you [2255] just want to you just want to test a [2257] particular part of a scenario based off [2259] of data that you've cached or stored um [2261] and what I do in order to accomplish [2263] this is I use the set variables module [2265] here so if you think about it what this [2268] function here is doing is this is [2269] searching a Google sheet and it's just [2271] getting a bunch of rows and I'm getting [2274] a bunch of variables like um title word [2276] count primary keyword um and that sort [2279] of thing what I've done here is I've [2280] actually set the variables [2283] here and let me give you maybe an even [2286] better [2287] example like if I were to take all of [2291] this [2293] data okay here's why this works so well [2295] so in my particular flow what I'm doing [2297] is I'm feeding in a bunch of variables [2298] to Ai and I'm basically just doing a [2301] bunch of example content and then I'm [2303] saying hey here's the title here's the [2304] word count here's the primary keyword [2306] secondary keyword internal links intern [2307] links additional instructions well the [2309] reason why this design pattern is so [2311] valuable like if you think about it I [2312] could have just selected all this data [2313] from the Google sheet instead but I [2314] chose to do it from this the reason why [2316] this is so valuable is because anytime I [2317] want to test this flow okay I could just [2321] use the set variables module as the [2324] trigger and I do that by just dragging [2326] this all the way over here now the set [2328] variables module is currently [2329] referencing a bunch of Google sheet data [2331] but what if instead I just write what I [2335] want to do here [2337] right now it's 22 there may be more who [2344] knows um I don't [2356] know right what if I just set it all and [2359] I hardcoded [2361] here well now I can actually run my [2363] entire scenario just from this module I [2366] don't need to bother myself with any of [2368] the beginning part of this module and if [2370] you set up your scenario right you'll [2372] notice that despite the fact that I [2373] broke off arguably the most important [2375] part of this whole flow which is the [2376] beginning and the trigger there's no [2378] error in any of these subscrip modules [2379] there's no little red or orange icon [2381] that'll pop up saying hey man you're [2383] missing a module name or variable here [2386] um because what I've done is I've just [2387] made sure that everything starts here [2389] and if I fill in the variables manually [2391] like this now I can just test it using [2392] the same data and you can imagine this [2394] is really really good for Expediting the [2395] rate at which you build flows [2399] the next thing I want to talk about is [2400] storing incomplete executions and then [2402] using this break module now if you've [2404] looked at my scenarios and you're not [2405] familiar with the break the first thing [2407] that you probably asked yourself is Nick [2408] why is there a bunch of little orange [2410] pause icons on top of a few modules why [2414] are they on top of these orange modules [2415] and not on top of all the other ones [2417] well basically what this is is this is a [2419] way where if an API is rate limiting you [2422] or if there's some error in your API [2423] call there's some issue you can um store [2427] that that data and then run it in 15 or [2429] 20 minutes instead when maybe your rate [2430] limit isn't fixed or maybe when the API [2432] is back online in order to trigger this [2434] what you need to do is you need to go [2435] down to the settings icon and then click [2438] allow storing of incomplete execution so [2439] press this yes button then what you want [2442] to do is you want to go to flow control [2445] what you're looking for is you're [2446] looking for this break icon here now the [2449] only situation which you actually want [2450] to use a break icon is on an API call [2452] usually on some type of like AI large [2454] language model thing or just an API that [2455] you know is a little bit shoddy it [2457] doesn't work all the time I mean if I [2459] were to use it on this markdown HTML [2460] module this would do nothing because the [2461] markdown htl module is just a make.com [2463] built-in it basically never breaks [2465] there's just no point to do it but if [2467] you give this a click you'll see that [2468] you can select the number of attempts [2470] you want to give it to retry and then [2471] you can also set the interval between [2473] attempts you could say 15 minutes you [2474] could say up to 44640 minutes it's [2476] pretty crazy right um and basically I [2478] use this on every large language model [2481] that I run in production meaning that [2483] anytime I'm running um something on an [2485] actual client website or on my own [2486] business I will always always use the [2489] break module because there will [2491] inevitably be problems there'll [2492] inevitably be some downtime we'll [2493] inevitably hit rate limits and this just [2495] ensures that the flow doesn't completely [2497] stop and completely break it ensures [2499] that if there is an issue well 15 [2501] minutes from now it'll be [2503] resolved on that note I want to show you [2505] guys a very special variable that most [2508] people don't know exists if you go down [2509] here to the settings icon and then click [2511] show advance settings to scroll down [2512] you'll see that there's a number of [2514] consecutive errors fielded you can [2515] actually set the number of errors that [2517] you are comfortable dealing with before [2520] it deactivates the scenario for you the [2522] reason why this is valuable is because [2523] if you're running something that costs a [2524] lot of money every time it goes if it [2526] fails like once or really more than once [2529] you're going to be spending a fair [2530] amount on that right um and so you can [2532] make your scenario a little bit more [2533] fragile and you can make it actually [2534] just like forcefully deactivate if [2536] there's ever a problem I've done this [2538] before to save a few hundred a month in [2540] token costs where when I know that [2541] there's some AI module that doesn't [2543] always work and sometimes it's a little [2544] bit shitty and it's not critical to the [2546] functioning of my business but sometimes [2547] it's nice to have I will set this to one [2550] and then anytime that there is an error [2552] basically um it will automatically [2554] deactivate the scenario and send me an [2555] email that way it doesn't run on a bunch [2557] of bogus or bunk data and I get to save [2559] some money I'm not saying that you [2560] should do this I'm just saying that uh [2562] this is a lever that you could pull to [2564] give yourself a little bit more control [2566] over how make.com works for you [2567] alternatively maybe you never want it to [2569] deactivate I don't know you set it at a [2571] th000 or something like that so even if [2572] there's an error it'll continue to run [2574] um and it's not that big of a deal [2577] all right the second last thing I'm [2578] going to talk about is the iterator and [2580] the aggregator if you've seen my [2581] iterator and aggregator breakdown this [2583] is just going to be a brief rehash of [2584] this um I'm going to touch it a little [2586] lighter than I normally do but [2588] essentially what you have if I go to [2590] tools here and then if I have actually [2595] let's do this let's go to Google Sheets [2597] instead um this one right here I'm just [2601] going to paste this because I don't want [2603] to completely screw up my flow and what [2606] I'm going to do is I'm going to right [2607] click press run this module only you're [2609] seeing I'm going to get a ton of data [2610] basically on um what is in my Google [2612] sheet right um if I were to [2614] hypothetically set the maximum number of [2617] return rows to let's say three okay now [2619] I'm going to disconnect this I'm going [2621] to make this the trigger and I'm just [2624] going to have my own little mini [2625] scenario on top of here that isn't [2626] really related to [2629] this let's say I want to set a variable [2631] here and I just want to this this to be [2634] the title if I generate three results [2636] like I just allowed it to what you'll [2638] see is the first scenario is going to [2639] run once the second scenario is going to [2640] run three times that's because of the [2642] number of bundles that are output the [2644] search rows module the list form entries [2646] module the watch whatever module um a [2648] lot of the time if these will have a [2649] setting that tell that asks you how many [2651] results you want to deliver if you do [2653] more than one it'll run every subsequent [2655] module however many times you select it [2657] to based off of different data every [2659] time right so these are three different [2661] titles that I got from the first bundle [2663] second bundle and third bundle and we [2664] just changed the variable here well If [2667] instead of running it three times I just [2668] wanted it to run once what I could do is [2670] I could feed this into an array [2672] aggregator I can then aggregate all of [2674] these fields and then I could set this [2676] variable value to be the array and what [2679] this is going to do is this is going to [2680] turn multiple runs so multiple B bundles [2683] over here into one [2686] bundle with a bunch of different array [2689] items so now the variable value isn't [2691] three separate things it's one with uh [2694] the value the key name title and and [2697] then inside of title we have each of [2698] these three arrays that I've fed in um [2701] if I wanted to only grab the title I [2703] could just do title and I could run it [2707] and it would just be in a single bundle [2708] with three items right uh but that's [2711] more or less how the aggregator module [2712] works if I wanted to convert this back [2714] into something that ran on a bundle [2716] basis AKA that executed every subsequent [2718] module I I could just feed in this array [2720] to an iterator again and then I could [2722] get the results of [2724] this and then we would be right back at [2727] square one now we have three operations [2729] used three bundles um every bundle [2731] subsequently Downstream is is uh you [2734] know selected a different title [2736] iterators and aggregators are sort of [2737] beyond the scope of this video if you [2738] don't know how they work and if this is [2740] just black magic to you then please do [2741] check out my deep dive I talk a lot [2743] about how they work and how they can add [2744] a ton of value to make.com [2747] flows the last thing I'm going to touch [2749] on briefly is status code status codes [2751] are not super crazy important to know um [2754] so I'm only going to cover this very [2755] briefly but basically anytime you do any [2757] sort of HTTP request or call a website [2759] you receive this status code parameter [2762] um and this is just like a code that [2763] somebody 30 years ago decided would be [2767] equivalent to like a thumbs up like hey [2769] everything worked um there are a variety [2772] of status codes out there 200 means that [2773] things worked we'll do a patch [2777] request I'm going to right click um [2780] you're going to get a 405 method not [2782] allowed um that status code basically [2784] says hey this isn't working um the 400 [2789] series of status code just means like [2790] there's some issue 405 particularly [2793] means the method is not allowed so I [2794] tried calling a website that can only be [2796] called through get and I and I tried [2798] calling it through patch um if there's [2800] like an authorization I think there's [2802] like an authorization error status code [2804] I think that's 401 um and so uh this [2807] isn't so much as a quick hack as it is [2809] just understanding what these HTTP [2811] modules are telling you if you run [2813] scenarios that frequently access [2815] websites or try and scrape data then [2817] just spend like 5 or 10 minutes Googling [2819] htttp status codes and then spend just a [2822] few moments just like breeding up on [2823] what they all are a lot of them aren't [2825] really that useful um but generally [2827] speaking 2xx means success 3xx means [2830] redirection and then 4xx means there's [2832] some issue with the client 5xx means [2834] that there's some issue with the server [2836] but if there's like a server error if [2837] you receive a 5xx response so five [2839] something something um odds are it's [2841] like an API issue it's not necessarily [2843] related to you although I will say some [2845] apis like really suck with this they [2847] just don't have good error handling so [2848] they'll return a 5xx server error even [2850] if the real issue is something on your [2852] end but that's a topic for another video [2854] all right I hope you guys appreciated [2856] this video and our 21 or 22 quick [2859] make.com hacks I had a lot of fun [2861] putting it together because have any [2862] questions about any of the the quick [2864] little things that I talked about here [2865] you want me to dive into it a little [2866] deeper just drop a comment down below I [2868] get most of my ideas now from the video [2871] comments that I receive simply because [2873] it's sort of hard to continue producing [2874] content otherwise I really want to [2875] create content that solves part [2876] particular problems that people are s [2878] suffering from today not like [2880] theoretical Grand problems that people [2881] aren't so yeah keep them coming um [2884] otherwise we could do me a big favor and [2885] like And subscribe to my channel that [2887] would mean a lot thank you very much for [2889] watching and looking forward to the next [2891] one see you guys later

Title: How I Made ~$500K On Upwork (Step-By-Step Applications)
[0] hey everybody Nick here and in this [1] video I'm going to show you how I made [2] almost [3] $500,000 on upwork over the last few [6] years I'm going to break down my profile [7] I'm going to break down my application [9] strategy and really you're just going to [10] get everything you need to do if you [12] want to get there too over the course of [14] the next hour or so this video let's get [16] into [17] [Music] [19] it all right so first things first this [22] is just my own process there are [23] actually like a million in one different [25] ways to get successful whether it's on [27] upwork or just in general so just take [29] whatever make sense to out of this video [30] discard whatever isn't relevant uh no [33] gatekeeping I'm going to show you [34] everything I'm even going to give you [35] real templates that you can use on your [36] own upwork profile real things you could [38] say real messages you can copy paste [40] that sort of thing so uh just getting [43] down to Brass tax here what exactly are [44] we going to talk about well I'm going to [46] share five things that essentially made [48] my profile successful on upwork the [51] first is profile optimization after I've [54] been in upwork for a few years I've [56] realized that there are a few things [57] that basically every person looks for [59] when they post new job to the platform [61] these are extremely simple things that [63] actually only take like 3 or 4 minutes [65] to put on a place on your own so I'm [67] going to run through that entire laundry [69] list uh I'll show you the things that I [71] personally look for when I also hire on [72] upwork because I now hire on upwork to [75] and essentially I'm just I'm going to [76] show you how you can 3x your conversion [77] rate in like 5 minutes the second thing [80] is I'm going to show you my exact [82] application strategy I'm going to run [83] through actual applications that I've [85] done before some of them recently some [87] of them a while ago and I'm just going [89] to show you how I go about you know [90] sourcing and then applying to jobs using [92] both templated and then customized [94] approaches this application strategy is [96] really at the core of why I was able to [98] make $500,000 or around $500,000 on [101] upwork um and I'm going to I'm just [102] going to run you through everything and [104] then you can just copy and paste my [105] Approach and make that money too then [107] I'm going to show you how to scale past [109] about 10K per month essentially there is [111] a ceiling on upwork that you hit when [113] you're just freelancing and doing the [115] jobs yourself so I'll show you what you [117] can do if you want to scale past that [119] not saying you have to scale past that I [120] personally nowadays much prefer to do [122] freelancing versus like actual running [125] of agencies and stuff like that I have a [126] VA that I work with from time to time um [128] but for me that lifestyle is just a [130] little bit better based on where I am in [132] my life but I'm going to show you how [133] you can scale past freelancing to start [135] a whole business if you want to and make [137] that business successful the fourth [139] thing I'm going to talk about is [140] Advanced upwork SEO upwork is a search [142] engine just like Google just like bang [144] just like a bunch of these other [145] platforms and essentially I'm going to [146] be talking about some growth hacky stuff [148] I'm going to talk about how to maximize [150] growth how to optimize your job success [152] score jss and a couple of other things [155] and the last thing we're going to talk [156] about and really what I'm going to talk [157] about throughout this video are going to [158] be a few upwork message templates these [160] are the exact messages that have helped [162] me make almost $500,000 on this [164] platform what aren't we going to talk [167] about this is almost as important as [168] what we are going to talk about uh what [170] I'm not going to be sharing with you in [171] this video is how to take clients off [173] platform a lot of people ask me but this [175] is explicitly against the upwork terms [177] of service I should also note that if [179] you take client off platform none of [181] their revenue counts for your profile [183] Revenue uh you also don't get reviews [185] from them or whatever so doesn't really [187] add to your SEO it doesn't really add to [189] how noteworthy your accomplishments on [190] the platform may be I'm also going to [193] talk about the best upwork niches sorry [195] I'm not going to talk about the best [196] epor niches I know that this is [198] important and it's definitely a topic [199] worth covering it's just this is such a [201] big topic that I'm going to make a [202] dedicated video for it afterwards so I'm [204] going to cover niches in depth I'm going [205] to talk about the best niches to use on [208] upwork the ones that I personally have [209] had ESS with and that sort of thing so [212] uh you know the big question a lot of [213] people ask me is why upw workk and if [215] you're about to skip ahead to the part [217] where I actually talk about how to do it [219] don't because I think this is very [220] important the first thing is upwork is [223] the best way to acquire leads for a [226] fledgling business or a freelance outfit [228] when I say fledgling business here I [230] mean a company that you are just [231] starting one where you don't necessarily [233] have like offer or product Market fit [236] yet you don't have a defined lead [238] generation strategy you're still looking [240] for customers sourcing customers is your [241] biggest concern when I say freelance [243] outfit I mean this is like just you [245] doing the work you doing the service [246] fulfillment and again you don't have [248] like a stable consistent client uh [250] sourcing mechanism upor cazi to solve [253] both of these problems and the reason [254] why is because of these four issues [257] sorry these four reasons the first is [259] that your commissions are very favorable [261] I know a lot of people will [ __ ] about [262] upwork and how much money they take and [264] how greedy they are as a platform but [265] just think about what they give you for [267] that 10% they're taking uh you get an [270] escrow system so you get some third [273] party which holds funds for you or your [275] client and then disperses them according [276] to certain criteria that in of itself [279] can cost more than 10% of your total [280] deal size especially on smaller deals [282] like this if you've ever tried to work [284] with dedicated escro platforms before [286] it's really tough and so this is like [287] very frictionless it substantially [289] reduces the the pressure that a lot of [291] clients feel when working with people [292] especially on fixed price payment [293] systems like I do uh and and really it [296] just like substantially improves that [297] the number of jobs you can get the [299] number of dollars that you can make [300] especially when you're early on in your [301] career you don't have credibility or [303] anything like that so that's already [305] worth the 10% of it being honest they [307] also do Payment Processing for you and [308] this is huge like payment processing on [311] upw work like like if you think about um [312] you know billing clients your yourself [314] through stripe or something if you build [316] them yourself through STP it's about 3% [318] it's 2.9 plus 30 cents or something is [320] the time of the're recording this video [321] so it's about three cents 3% of every [324] transaction if you think about it that [326] means that like and and upward covers [328] this for you if you think about that [329] that means that really you're just [330] paying upw work 7% like you going to [331] have to pay the payment processor anyway [333] and 7% for all this stuff is even more [335] worth it you also obviously get a [337] messaging platform it's not the best but [339] it is what it is you get a meeting [340] system so you get a way to like book [342] meetings this personally was not around [344] when I was just starting on upwork so [345] this is like added value uh and then [348] probably the most important part is you [349] get a freaking job pool you get to talk [350] to customers you would literally never [352] have otherwise been able to contact or [354] it just would have been very difficult [355] and they're just right there ripe for [357] the taking so to pay 10% to a platform [359] for to do this for you is basically like [360] a no-brainer it's like no [ __ ] I'm going [362] to pay 10% if I pay 10 it's like would [364] you rather pay 0% of $5 or 10% of [367] $100,000 it's like obviously you know [370] you know what you would rather do you'd [372] rather succeed and then pay a little bit [373] of money alongside that the biggest [376] other issue that people complain about [378] is that uh you know there's so much [380] competition on upwork and really that [382] seems like it should be a problem but it [384] isn't because your competition on upw is [386] going to suck um sure it is competitive [388] there are going to be I don't know how [389] many freelances there are right now but [390] I wouldn't be surprised if it was like a [392] million or more so it's competitive uh [394] but your competition freaking [396] blows pardon my French it is [398] straightforward to crush it on upwork if [401] you just watch this video from start to [402] finish like everything that I [404] do you don't even need to you know I I [406] run a community for instance where I [407] show people how to build automation um [409] businesses from from scratch and then [411] scale them all the way up to to 10 15 20 [413] 25k a month you don't even need to like [415] you can do this All 100% for free just [417] watching this video if you're diligent [419] and you just take what I'm saying here [420] to heart and then you use it step by [422] step uh you can absolutely crush the [425] competition and it is not hard it's very [427] straightforward it's very simple you [429] just need to do the same thing over and [430] over and over again for a little while [432] so your competition blows don't worry [433] too much about that um sure it's [435] competitive but it's not that big of a [437] deal the other one is that uh and one of [439] the reasons why Upp is so great is [441] because you're dealing with customers [442] that already want what you're selling [443] and I really can't overstate this I [446] really can't harp on this enough um [449] there are are there's a term when you're [451] in sales and I used to be in sales for [452] quite a while I was doing door too for [454] maybe two two and a half years of my [455] life uh and it's the problem awareness [458] essentially sorry buyer awareness it's [460] like the buying temperature it's like [462] the buyer ladder there a bunch of [463] different names for it but essentially [464] the way that it works [466] is there are different levels of [468] prospects the hardest level of prospect [471] is the one that doesn't understand the [472] problem doesn't understand the solution [474] and then doesn't understand why you're [476] the right fit for the solution so if you [477] want to sell them on something you have [478] to sell them on three separate levels [480] you have to literally inform them what [482] the problem is inform them about the [483] solution and then inform them about hey [486] here's why you should work with me [487] specifically example is CRM a lot of [490] people don't realize that not having a [491] CRM in their business maybe their [493] business makes $50 to $100,000 a month a [495] lot of them don't even realize that [496] that's a problem so if you wanted to [497] come into a business and sell CRM [499] systems if you were like me knocking on [500] doors and you know breaking hearts the [503] only hearts that were broken were mine [504] let's be real you would have to explain [507] to them why they need a CRM system in [508] the first place and then you'd have to [510] talk about how the solution to the big [512] problem that they're facing their [513] disorganization their low speed delete [515] all that stuff is because they don't [516] have a serum and then you'd have to say [518] and you know what out of the 5 million [519] Crum providers I'm the guy for you [521] that's a lot of freaking work right you [524] can also find buyers at varying other [526] parts of that buying ladder but if you [527] think about it logically on upwork 99% [530] of the prospects that you're going to [531] deal with are going to be people at the [533] top end of that buying ladder they're [534] going to have the highest buying [535] temperature they're going to be ready to [536] freaking go they are basically people [538] that understand the problem [540] they understand the solution because [541] they even wrote a job post asking for [542] somebody and the only thing that they [544] have to do is they have to make a [546] decision between service providers it is [548] the simplest way to sell all you have to [551] do all you have to show them is like hey [552] here's why I'm Different here's why I [554] can do the exact job that you're asking [555] for you don't have to sell them on the [557] problem you don't have to sell them the [558] solution this is really the juice this [560] is why you want to be on upw workk [561] especially at the beginning because it's [563] hard to do the whole thing that I talked [564] about that's why I floundered for so [566] long doing door to door sales that's why [568] so many people flounder for so long if [570] you can just jump past that on upwork [572] learn the client management skills that [573] necessarily having to learn all that [575] extra [ __ ] at the beginning um you [576] can then easily go backwards and then [578] iron that stuff out with money and [580] experience and this is more or less [581] describes like my own business [583] trajectory the last one is the fact that [585] a lot of people have made money on it uh [587] this isn't necessary for something to be [589] good but if you think about it logically [590] if a lot of other people have done this [592] and these people aren't necessarily [593] Geniuses they're not super smart they're [594] not super incredible they're just [596] diligent they're ambitious and they're [597] willing to put a little bit of work in [598] every day [599] if you if you look at opportunities like [601] this and you see other people making [602] money you should know that they're you [605] can make money on this platform too if [606] you're all of the above so I'm one of [608] them there are thousands of high earners [610] it's a proven platform it's been around [612] for a long time it's not going anywhere [613] it's worthy of you investing at least an [615] hour or so a day for the next couple of [617] months like I'm about to show you okay [620] that is my whole Spiel let's actually [622] jump on up work let's go into some [624] profile optimization let me run you [625] through what my profile looks like and [627] what you can do to make yours better uh [628] I'm going to be alt tabbing back and [630] forth between this so um let me just [633] make sure that I have everything set up [635] for myself yes I do awesome and yeah [638] let's get into it so the first thing is [640] that uh this is super low hanging fruit [642] right uh most people have God awful [644] profiles on upwork they do super simple [647] stuff um they have crappy profile [650] pictures they have crappy titles they [651] have crappy job rates they have crappy [653] locations they have crappy reviews [656] crappy earnings rates no badges no [658] nothing and and really if you just get [660] all of those sorted like we're going to [662] do one by one in the next few minutes [664] you're going to do really good on the [665] profile so all telling back um let's [668] start with the simple stuff let's start [670] with the profile pictures the badges the [672] titles the video the English how to get [674] to 100% profile completion and then [676] rates I'm going to use my profile as an [678] example here not because I'm trying to [679] say that my profile is the best it's not [681] it's actually probably like 80% of the [683] way there and there's another 20% I [684] could do to make it even better uh but [686] as you see you know I've still made a [688] boatload of money on the platform that [689] definitely isn't changing so uh let me [692] run you through things from top to [693] bottom I do roasts of upwork profiles on [696] my communities where actually like [697] record customized videos for everybody [699] that asks me and uh this is usually what [701] I will do um you know first and foremost [704] and I'll show you why all the stuff [705] matters in a minute I'm actually going [707] to go to a job post I create on nwork [708] and show you what profiles look like and [710] how to make yours different but for now [712] uh trust me on this one the first thing [714] is your profile picture your profile [716] picture is extremely incredibly [718] important why because your profile [720] picture is the first thing that people [721] are going to see it's where their eyes [722] are naturally going to default you when [723] you apply for a job so I talked about [726] profile optimizations just taking a few [727] minutes right well this is one of those [729] things that really takes a few minutes [730] if you look at my profile it just looks [731] really different from most the other [732] platform pictures the reason why is [734] because I just have a bright ass yellow [736] background behind me I [ __ ] you not this [738] makes a very big difference in my [739] conversion right there are a million in [741] one people on the platform if you can [742] just make your own picture stand out [744] just a little bit more you're going to [746] do really well so what I did is I just [748] took my photo I went into canva and then [750] I created a yellow background and then I [751] added a little drop shadow behind it I [753] don't know if you can even tell that [754] there's a drop shadow behind it just to [756] give it the illusion that I actually was [757] actually behind like yellow muslin [758] fabric um I look semi-professional but [761] I'm not like super crazy professional I [763] find that the professionalism can scare [764] people on upw sometimes so I don't do a [766] suit and tie just a little button down I [768] have myself smiling um I had a coffee in [770] the picture here I don't know if you can [771] see I have a little cup I'm not trying [773] to say this is the best photo in the [774] whole wide world it isn't um I think I [776] could have even done better if I was [777] looking right at the camera so if I [778] could take this again it would be like [780] uh you know that bright yellow [781] background something semi uh business [784] but not necessarily business big fat [786] smile on your face looking at the camera [788] and then in terms of the zoom just make [789] sure you're about like chest chest up [791] like don't like zoom out a lot of the [793] people who I roast they have profile [795] pictures where they literally like you [796] can see their shoes and stuff um meaning [798] that their face is super small you want [801] to put your face in the thing you want [803] them to see your face your face is like [804] the Gateway into you know your soul I [807] guess and you want to minimize the [809] between your client and and that so [812] that's number one um the Gateway into [813] your soul jeez this is more like uh [816] spirituality than it is up work advice [818] but hey we're in it together so that's [820] number one number two is um location now [824] I'm looking in Vancouver Canada just [826] because I jump back and forth between [827] there all the time I was actually just [828] in Vancouver a couple of days ago and uh [831] you know Vancouver is very well-known [834] place in Canada um if I had picked a [836] tiny little unknown town in Canada my [837] profile would perform worse I picked one [839] of the capital cities well I picked like [841] one of the major population centers in [843] the entirety of the country and so most [844] people know Vancouver because of the [846] Olympics and I don't know we're in [847] magazines and [ __ ] like that the reason [849] why I'm I'm telling you this is because [851] you know you could like I don't know if [852] you're if you're in Austin versus if [854] you're in like Chattanooga Tennessee or [856] something my new favorite city [859] um I actually have no idea how big and [861] well-known Chattanooga is because I'm [862] not American but the point I'm making is [864] if you if you are close to some major [866] city or something just use that you want [867] people to sort of pattern match be like [869] oh that person's in a major city that [870] person's like an urbanite they're not [872] like some random person working out of a [873] van somewhere um this isn't incredibly [875] important mind you but I am just going [876] to talk walk you top to bottom through [878] all these [879] optimizations the third is this [881] available now badge this is pretty [883] important basically the way that this [885] works is on upwork you can bid your [887] available now badge if you go back here [890] and then you go availability badge give [891] this a [893] click every week uh you can spend a [896] certain number of connects and then by [898] spending these connects connects [899] connects are the um almost like currency [901] on the [902] platform uh if you do that I mean upper [905] says you receive up to 50% more invites [906] in practicality I probably receive like [908] 10 20% more but that's okay because one [910] of these jobs might be worth several [911] hundred or several thousand dollars over [913] the course of the next year or so for me [914] that's a compromise worth making so [916] always available now the third is this [918] little green badge at the top left hand [920] corner if you click on your profile at [921] least this is what it looks like right [922] now uh just go click online for messages [926] um and that'll that'll change your badge [927] status as you see mine goes from great [929] to Green gray to Green um if you're not [931] around your computer for a little while [932] I'm pretty sure it goes yellow but [934] that's okay um just if I were you I [935] would always have a tab open on upwork [937] by doing this this is just always going [938] to show to other people that your [939] profile is available that it's online so [942] these are like the top left super simple [944] profile optimizations if you're [946] wondering why my upwork looks different [947] than yours by the way I just set my dark [948] mode on you can do that as well I just [950] you know do a lot of work at night and I [952] don't like the blue light like [953] absolutely molesting my melatonin uh so [956] yeah that's that in terms of some more [958] difficult stuff stuff that you don't [959] have as much control over these two [960] badges are very important for me I'll [962] cover this in detail over the course of [964] the next hour or so but um 99% job [966] success would be considered very high on [968] upw work and then expert vetted is like [970] I'm the top 1% of all Talent on the [972] platform which is obviously great [973] because if there's a million people 1% [975] of that is what 10,000 people um when [977] people see the expert vetta they're like [979] oh wow this person knows their stuff so [981] I'll show you how to get that later but [983] uh for now let's scroll over here to um [985] let's zoom out a little bit more so we [986] can see more about what's going on here [989] so as you see uh there are several [991] different profiles that you can have you [993] can have I think an maximum of two [995] specialization profiles and then you [997] have a general profile um so what I did [999] is uh because I was providing writing [1000] services initially then I pivoted to [1002] marketing automation I just created two [1004] specialization profiles one for each [1005] service I'm not saying you have to do [1007] this and I don't actually recommend you [1008] doing it but if you provided multiple [1010] services in the past or you're planning [1012] on providing two fundamentally disparate [1014] or distinct Services then I definitely [1016] would the reason why is because each of [1018] these have different titles and each of [1020] these titles they help you rank it's [1021] sort of like upwork search engine [1022] optimization upwork SEO so if I'm [1024] applying to a writing job I want my [1026] title to be all about writing if I'm [1027] applying to a marketing job or marketing [1029] automation job rather I want it to be [1031] all about marketing Automation and that [1032] sort of thing so if you're trying to [1034] offer multiple services on here then [1035] definitely just be careful um and then [1037] note that your uh as you see the the [1039] total earnings per specialized platform [1042] that's going to change um I was using a [1043] general platform for the first 200ish k [1045] or something like that which is why this [1047] one only has 100K so just keep that in [1049] mind uh you can select the reviews that [1051] that you want to show for specific [1053] specialization profiles and that's [1055] really important if you have really good [1056] reviews that are specific to article [1057] writing or something um you know that [1060] maybe you got back when your profile was [1061] General or maybe when you were using a [1063] different type of profile then you know [1064] you can you can select them later um but [1067] yeah that's sort of how the [1068] specialization Works down here you [1070] obviously have the total earnings total [1071] jobs number of total hours uh this is [1073] hella important if you have more than I [1075] want to say $10,000 on here uh you're [1078] basically like this will never be a card [1080] against you if you have $10,000 the [1082] second you're at five figures people [1083] just stop worrying and they're like all [1084] right this person knows their stuff if [1086] people have trusted him with $10,000 [1088] before or more like he's good I don't [1090] have to worry about it so $400,000 is [1093] obviously 40 times that people feel very [1095] comfortable working with me um and then [1096] I come across like I know my [ __ ] so [1098] it's never really an issue the number of [1100] total jobs here is important as well um [1102] people sort of just mentally do a divide [1104] if I had two total jobs 400k people [1106] would sort of raise an eyebrow but I [1107] have 570 it's like damn that guy's done [1109] 570 different jobs on this platform geez [1111] he's been a while he's been around total [1114] number of hours um in my case I [1117] basically never do hourly contracts I [1118] almost always do fixed price the reason [1120] why is because fixed price is a lot [1122] safer for me I feel a lot better with it [1124] and then I also get to like get you know [1125] a bunch of upfront money versus hourly [1128] which I don't like they have screen [1129] tracking they do all sorts of [ __ ] [1131] um it also just works for my own [1132] business model which was writing and [1133] then marketing automation you can [1135] certainly work hourly and I did at the [1136] beginning obviously with these 28 total [1138] hours but uh I much prefer the fixed [1140] price and I'll talk about why [1142] later okay now let's actually get into [1145] the profile like the profile description [1147] and and all that stuff so I zoom out a [1149] little bit [1151] here then I put the screen here you'll [1154] see there are various components to a [1156] profile you have the title up here at [1157] the top left article writer content [1159] writer copywriter SEO specialist so you [1161] get to choose this title if I click this [1163] button here I can actually change what I [1164] want to be there right now what I did [1168] was in order order to figure out what [1169] title to do and this is something I [1170] recommend anybody that's watching this [1172] do is I went through um a bunch of [1175] upwork jobs for writing and I just [1177] looked at the words that they were using [1178] in their post and I noticed that they Ed [1181] the word article writer more often they [1182] used the word content writer more often [1184] they use the word copywriter more often [1186] SEO specialist SEO came up a bunch and [1189] so I tested a bunch of different titles [1191] over the course of something like 6 [1193] months and I found that this particular [1194] title combination worked the best when I [1196] put up that title and when I created my [1198] profile which was quite a while ago now [1200] it's possible that the marketplace is a [1202] little bit different maybe now I need to [1204] put in stuff like chat gbt because a lot [1206] of writers are now being not forced held [1208] at gunpoint and told that they need to [1210] use AI but uh yeah this worked really [1213] well for me when I when I first arrived [1214] at it and I just encourage you guys to [1216] take a data driven approach essentially [1218] what you want to do is you just want to [1219] have a few different Services here um [1222] around whatever the main service that [1223] you want to do is so mine is article [1225] writing so I'm also a Content writer [1226] copywriter SEO specialist if anybody [1228] that's creating a job uses any of these [1230] terms I want to be in the pool for that [1232] and I want to see that as well when I [1234] look for the best matches because this [1235] is also applicable to your best matches [1237] I [1238] believe okay so that's a pretty [1239] straightforward way to optimize your [1241] title um you could just match or try and [1243] like copy my titles if you want let's [1245] say you're doing graphic design maybe [1246] your graphic design ux design um figma [1250] mockups uh I don't know like website C [1253] website creative the point that I'm [1255] making is just do your research um look [1258] through 100 jobs or something like that [1259] and just try and like take note of the [1260] words that are being used the most often [1262] and and just copy mine if you want to [1264] the next thing I want to talk about is I [1265] want to talk about the rate now the rate [1267] is actually a lot more important than [1268] people think uh and the second that I [1271] changed my rate and I made it what it is [1273] now I started getting a lot more um [1275] obviously a lot more inquiries and a lot [1276] more success my rate used to be for [1279] article writing anyway $50 per [1281] hour it is now 5250 per hour you're [1284] thinking Nick that's 5% how the hell are [1287] you making all this extra money by just [1288] increasing the rate 5% it's not that I [1291] increase the rate 5% it's that my rate [1293] is no longer a round number when you [1295] price yourself at $50 an hour $60 an [1297] hour $100 an hour $200 an hour at some [1301] level at the back of the prospect's Mind [1302] what they're thinking is does this guy's [1304] time actually worth $50 an hour or did [1307] he just pick it because it's a nice [1308] round number if you use like a round [1311] number you're basically saying that you [1313] settled on something that just sounded [1315] nice to you there was no real time [1316] energy or thought put into the [1318] calculation of your rate if you make [1321] your rate something non-round and [1323] something hypers specific like 52 51 or [1326] 59 38 the first question the prospect's [1328] going to have is like wow that person [1330] was very specific I wonder what they [1332] what sort of math they did to acquire [1334] this number and their followup question [1336] is going to be like H I guess they've [1338] thought about it a lot more and that's [1339] important because the second that the [1341] prospect think that you've thought about [1342] it they're basically assigning you a [1344] little bit of credibility a little bit [1345] of authority and they're saying oh this [1346] person's been around at least enough to [1348] know exactly how much money he's willing [1349] to charge now I'm not saying that people [1352] write all of this logic out and then run [1354] through it line by line I'm just saying [1356] that um this provide like this implies a [1358] certain amount of credibility when you [1360] have like some specific sort of number [1362] um and then in addition to that there's [1364] also just the sheer pattern breaking [1366] effect where you're going to have 100 [1367] people apply to your job and all of them [1369] are going to say 50 40 50 50 50 40 and [1371] then some guy comes in that's [1372] 50192 your brain's going to stop for a [1374] second and be like I wonder what that [1376] guy's all about let me give him a click [1378] so as you can see these are all little [1379] hacks they're tiny micro optimizations [1382] when you make 5% here 3% there 10% there [1385] uh the result is you have an [1386] overwhelming advantage against your [1388] enemy no against the other Freelancers [1390] on the [1391] platform all right so that's the rate I [1393] would encourage you guys to just take [1394] whatever rate you're charging and then [1395] you can go down a few dollars or up a [1398] few dollars if you go down a few dollars [1399] think about it like why do all [1400] supermarkets price their groceries at [1402] like 197 it's because your reptilian [1406] lizard brain will see the one and be [1407] like oh that's $1 even though it's 97 [1410] it'll still be anchored at $1 uh so I [1412] could have gone [1413] 4893 something like that that would have [1415] worked just fine just just go up or down [1418] like a few cents or something like that [1420] you'll be okay um like don't do [1421] something like $ 49.99 because then [1423] people will think they'll be like a this [1424] person is trying to be like a grocery [1425] store guy he's trying to scam me on like [1427] bananas or something um so just just [1429] make it seem as if you put some thought [1431] into it which now you have uh that is [1435] that let's talk a little bit about the [1436] description now um and that's this is [1438] really really important this description [1439] and a lot of people screw it up uh I [1442] have a very very interesting pattern on [1444] my description which I rarely see I only [1447] started seeing this after I started [1449] showing people to do this and [1451] immediately after showing people how to [1452] do this I've started seeing it a lot [1454] more but before that like there was [1455] nobody on upwork using this design [1457] pattern except for me what is the design [1460] pattern well I thought to myself huh [1462] sorry about that I thought to myself uh [1465] if people are landing you know if I [1466] apply to a job people are landing on my [1468] profile right and if people are landing [1469] on my profile what's the very first [1471] thing that they see on website uh cro [1474] conversion re optimization we call this [1475] above the fold so what's above the fold [1477] what's the header look like what's the [1478] very first thing that people see well [1480] they're going to see this right they're [1481] going to click on the thing and they're [1482] going to see exactly what what you're [1483] seeing right [1484] now meaning that there'll be a little [1487] right up here and then somewhere down [1489] here there'll be a more button that you [1491] can click and after you click the more [1493] button then this extends all the way [1495] down right the reason why that's [1497] important is because people don't [1499] actually see anything as up from this [1502] character count I don't know how many [1503] characters it is like 100 and something [1504] I believe uh but they they literally [1506] don't see anything after 100 and [1507] whatever characters unless they [1508] specifically click on the more button so [1509] your job is to cram all of the greatest [1513] catchiest most clickbaity [ __ ] and stick [1516] it right up there at the front you want [1518] to stick it up as high as humanly [1520] possible so that everybody that sees [1521] your upor profile goes like holy crap [1523] that person is huge I wonder what else [1525] they've done then they click more so [1526] what I've did to capitalize on this is I [1528] separated my upper profile into a two-c [1531] version and then a longer sit down [1534] version um so realistically um this is [1536] like the real juice my work is over 50 [1538] million reads much more now I've written [1540] for nordvpn semrush upwork wise hulet [1543] Packard and coo and I've been featured [1544] in a few high-profile Publications like [1546] Popular Mechanics and Apple news so [1548] obviously if you think about it the vast [1550] majority of people that you're competing [1551] with an upwork have no social proof they [1554] have no experience they've never worked [1556] with anybody and from a client's [1557] perspective especially a bigger client [1559] perspection they're going to look at [1559] that and they're like who the heck's [1561] this guy right they're not going to [1562] worry about that at all um they're not [1564] going to spend they're not going to give [1566] you any additional time basically at all [1568] so to alleviate this you basically just [1570] want to cram this first section with as [1571] much Social proof as humanly possible [1573] and you just want them to at least stop [1575] for a second and be like hm 50 million [1577] reads hm uh Popular Mechanics [1579] fascinating I need to learn at least a [1581] little bit more about this and the [1582] second that you've got them in the room [1584] with you so to speak then you can dive [1586] into your super long super deep [1589] personality funny Pleasant skills and [1593] all that [ __ ] this is the juice right [1595] here the 50 million reads the nordvpn [1597] the the wise the COO right so this is [1600] what I front modad this is what I show [1601] to everybody and then I also include a [1603] link to my website and the reason why is [1605] kind of like growth hacky but it's just [1606] because I was trying to rank my website [1608] at the time and I knew that I was doing [1609] like 50 upwork applications a day that's [1611] 1,500 a month I had probably about half [1613] of those people click through to my [1614] profile and I had about 750 additional [1616] website hits because of that you can do [1618] that if you want um but also my website [1620] just looks really nice it's very sexy um [1622] you know if I open it up excuse me um [1626] you know it's where I talk about my my [1629] my mindset my writing and and all that [1631] stuff 3841 in my first monetized day on [1633] YouTube I almost completely forgot about [1635] that very cool okay great another thing [1638] that I want to talk about here that not [1640] a lot of people talk [1642] about um and I realized I kind of [1644] skipped ahead of this but [ __ ] it I [1648] thing that I talk about that not a lot [1649] of people talk about is uh features over [1652] benefits or sorry benefits over features [1654] um the difference between a feature and [1655] a benefit remember how earlier I talked [1657] about the buying ladder and I talked [1659] about how the vast majority of people on [1660] upwork are on upwork because they are [1663] looking to make a decision between which [1664] service professional to to choose right [1666] they're not learning about the solution [1668] they're not learning about the problem [1669] they already know all that stuff the [1671] only thing they really need to do is [1672] just say hey I like that one better than [1674] that one H she looks way more [1676] intelligent you know what she's worked [1677] with all these companies that guy hasn't [1679] worked with I'm going to go with her [1681] right that's what they care about and so [1683] when you want to write a good [1684] description what you want to do is you [1685] just want to focus on what makes you [1686] different from all of the other people [1687] you're competing with you do not want to [1689] focus on the problem you don't want to [1690] wax poetic about the solution you don't [1691] want to do any of that just focus on why [1692] you're the best pick compared to him or [1694] her or [1695] anybody so uh social proof is the best [1698] way to do so essentially What Makes You [1700] Different you need to quantify it so you [1702] need to say you know I drive between 17 [1706] to 35 booked qualified appointments per [1709] month for small to mediumsized [1711] businesses in the brick-and-mortar [1716] flower space I don't know like bists uh [1720] you need to say my work is over 50 [1721] million reads you need to say stuff like [1723] I've helped drive over [1725] $125,000 for B2B SAS companies in just [1728] the last month uh you need to say I've [1730] worked with Microsoft I'm an X Amazon [1732] engineer you basically just need to put [1733] all of that that new stuff that nobody [1735] else has up at the top of your [1737] description and what you need to avoid [1739] is you need to avoid what you do what [1741] you need to avoid is is is you don't [1743] want to say um like for marketing [1746] automation specifically what I see all [1748] the time is uh I provide chat GPT [1750] services and AI services and this [1752] service and that service and that [1753] service nobody wants to see that [1755] especially up here maybe you can touch [1756] on it all the way down at the bottom of [1757] your profile but you don't want to put [1760] that high because that doesn't mean [1761] anything new or relevant to them that's [1763] not helping them make a decision that's [1764] just wasting their time and filling up [1766] words that they frankly do not have the [1768] time to sift [1769] through so yeah that's more or less that [1773] um frontload was social proof write [1774] about what makes you different from [1775] other people and really focus on that um [1778] and then quantify just add some numbers [1780] the second you add a number you've [1781] instantly put yourself apart from 95% of [1783] the rest of people on this platform [1785] because 95% of the rest of people on [1786] this platform like really they just [1788] haven't spent any time thinking about [1789] that and if you're one of those 95% [1791] that's now watching my video just [1792] Implement a couple of these changes and [1793] I guarantee you will [1795] crush okay uh the last thing I'm going [1797] to mention about the description is just [1799] make sure your English is good um you're [1802] probably going to be working in English [1803] because that's the number one language [1805] that people Source jobs for on upwork if [1807] you're working on another language and [1809] make sure that language is good but just [1810] like pass everything that you're writing [1812] through some type of grammar checker [1813] like grammarly um some online grammar [1816] service or even just chat gbt don't [1819] don't write like chat gbt don't ask it [1821] to like hey like make this sound [1822] professional um just like just just do [1824] it in your own words but then fix up the [1826] grammar fix up the syntax I find that [1828] when you get AI to make something [1830] professional for you usually sounds like [1831] [ __ ] they just use really big words that [1833] nobody cares about so that's that um [1836] let's talk a little bit about this video [1838] here on the left hand side you're [1839] probably wondering Nick why do you look [1841] super stoned and how could you possibly [1843] think that that was a good haircut for [1845] you uh it's a good [1847] question this is my upwork video now I'm [1849] going to have to start this and pause it [1851] really quickly because it some audio on [1852] the background so one [1854] sec okay great I paused it before we [1856] even played it um so you know step one [1859] is not looking like this obviously no [1861] the point that I'm making is despite the [1863] fact that my video to be honest looks [1865] like trash and sounds pretty crappy um [1868] the important part is that I have a [1869] video and the people can see my face and [1872] they can also tell that I'm fluent in [1873] English which is obviously very [1874] important if you're working on an [1875] English writing project like duh um and [1878] that uh you know like I I don't know [1880] supposedly like I like I have enough [1882] attention to detail and wherewithal to [1883] at least have like a reasonable looking [1885] camera wearing like a an okay looking [1887] shirt [1888] this is just your opportunity for [1889] clients to feel like they're working [1891] with a real service professional and not [1892] just some dude living in his mom's [1894] basement wearing boxers so I always have [1896] a video in terms of the contents the [1898] video it's not super important and you [1899] can feel free to like check out my video [1900] if you want but it's basically a rehash [1903] of this introductory section up at the [1904] top I basically just go through and say [1906] hey how's it going I used to run a [1907] digital agency um today I write SEO [1909] articles that rank my work has over 50 [1911] million reads I've written for all these [1912] companies and I'm really excited to work [1914] with you too um I want to gain more [1915] credibility and exposure on upwork and [1917] this is how I'm going to do it so that's [1919] all you really need just some little [1921] video stick that up there um I found [1923] that before I had the video I was [1925] receiving maybe like a 25% conversion [1926] rate after I sent after I did the video [1928] I Wasing like 35% or so so it's about a [1930] 10% Improvement which is obviously [1932] pretty chunky in terms of hours per week [1934] um I basically make this my full-time [1936] thing all the time and I say I'm more [1938] than 30 hours a week my response time is [1940] less than 24 hours you don't State this [1942] it just calculates this for you so in [1944] order to get a less than 24-hour [1945] response time you just need to make sure [1947] that any message that's coming and you [1948] respond to within a day this is very [1950] important ideally I'd have like an 8 [1951] hour response time but you know just [1953] with the unfortunate demands of business [1955] and that sort of thing it's been [1956] difficult to prioritize epw workk um but [1958] yeah very very important opens a [1961] contract to hire um basically these are [1963] all just different ways that you can [1964] show customers that you're willing to [1966] work with them at whatever capacity the [1967] important part isn't necessarily just [1969] getting the exact perfect job that you [1971] want because on upwork you're not going [1972] to do that at the beginning what you [1973] want to do is you want to make your top [1975] of funnel as wide as humanly possible [1977] get as many people interested in talking [1979] to you and then filter at the end right [1981] if a contract isn't entirely to your [1982] liking don't say no to it immediately [1984] say yes yes yes all the way up until [1986] they literally give it to you and offer [1987] it to you otherwise you're just shooting [1988] yourself in the foot especially on a [1990] platform like this for languages just [1993] choose um Native uh bilingual fluent [1996] whatever you are if you're not very good [1998] in English I'd advise you to improve [2000] your English substantially before you [2001] get on upw workk obviously you can do um [2003] them hand inand you are going to have a [2005] harder time doing well on upwork if you [2007] don't speak English if you work with [2008] English clients because this is like the [2010] number one thing that they use to [2011] distinguish between good or bad service [2012] providers I don't say that to be [2014] offensive I just say that to be real um [2016] I put French here conversational even [2022] though but uh I don't know I'm sure you [2024] could have a really stilted one-way [2026] conversation with me if you wanted [2027] to verifications they'll ask you to [2030] verify your ID so do that I'm not a [2032] military veteran I could add my military [2034] veteran thing here if I was I'm not so I [2035] don't and then you have the opportunity [2037] a bunch of licenses um they're just like [2039] if you're a if you're a lawyer if you're [2041] a physician if you're a nurse all that [2042] stuff you know the government of your [2043] country will have given you a license [2045] that you can just add here and then last [2048] but not least U for education on the Le [2050] hand side here um I have personally not [2052] found anybody ever reference my [2054] University degree I think that [2057] realistically this probably provides [2059] like some very soft increase to my thing [2063] because I'm in you know the my profile [2064] was first made for writing purposes and [2066] I think people probably just go all [2068] right that's cool but it is not the make [2070] or break you don't need a degree if [2074] I like could go back in time and then [2077] not finish my degree and then just do [2079] all of this instead I would because I'd [2081] probably be a Deca millionaire by now I [2085] don't know Deca millionaire I'd have at [2087] least $10 million in the bank if I [2090] didn't spend five years on that not [2092] saying that I don't love University and [2094] all that it stands for but uh yeah you [2097] know you don't need a University degree [2098] to thrive on this platform linked [2101] accounts just link everything Talent [2103] clouds you're going to be invited to [2104] join Talent clouds just accept [2106] everything um that's the 8020 here okay [2110] so that's the whole left-hand panel [2112] that's the description consultations um [2114] this is a recent feature that upwork [2115] added one big Trend that you're going to [2117] see is that you should just always [2119] accept all of the features that upwork [2121] provides you the reason [2124] why is because upwork wants to test and [2127] see whether or not a feature makes a [2129] difference to the quality of average [2131] client contracts as reported by the [2133] client uh because they obviously want [2135] their platform to be the best right so [2136] they're always releasing new features [2138] they're always testing new features and [2139] basically they're just rewarding you for [2141] using them um they're going to make it [2143] easier for you to rank if you use a [2144] feature because they just want to like [2145] get some data on them so create your [2147] first consultation um I haven't created [2149] a consultation here because as I [2150] mentioned upor is no longer my my number [2152] one priority um but I should so I'm [2154] going to click this create a [2154] consultation button so you see you have [2156] a bunch of choices to choose for [2157] marketing consultations design [2159] consultations lifestyle consultations [2161] this isn't like super important so I'm [2163] just going to um go back the important [2166] part is that you just fill out every [2167] part of your profile the consultations [2168] the [2170] portfolio uh the skills uh your project [2173] catalog and then your testimonials so [2176] I'm not going to dwell on like every [2177] specific section because upwork is [2179] always changing these this week it's [2180] test or consultations next week it might [2182] be something different the point is just [2184] make sure to fill all of them out same [2186] thing with the portfolios uh there are [2187] many different like categories or ways [2189] to do portfolios now this has always [2191] been changing from like dayto day week [2194] to week so just add some portfolio [2196] pieces as you see from my writing [2197] business I [2199] uh sorry we have a big party going by [2203] but we had uh writing here you know like [2207] my design and my my content writing for [2209] blogs and that sort of thing over here [2213] um I ran a cannabis near me it was like [2215] a cannabis I find her in CU they [2218] legalized it it was a big business [2219] opportunity um this is like a little [2221] website that I had basically I just made [2223] it all look quite pretty if I'm honest [2225] and I think that helps a [2226] lot okay let's CH let's chat a little [2229] bit about reviews here um because I've [2230] covered I think basically everything [2231] else I've covered the fact that you [2233] should just fill out all of the things [2234] on your profile I obviously have a [2235] boatload of testimonials certifications [2238] employment history other experiences you [2239] just want to fill them all out but let's [2240] chat a little bit about reviews reviews [2242] are incredibly important and you need to [2244] make sure that you do two things you [2247] need to make make sure you do whatever [2249] the client needs in order to give you a [2251] positive review um you need to maximize [2254] the quality of their experience and then [2255] afterwards what you need to do is you [2257] need to explicitly ask them for a [2258] written review now not all of your [2261] clients are going to give you written [2262] reviews as you see here I got a five [2263] star for [2264] 1.6k just uh the other week I got a 3.8 [2267] unfortunately um couple weeks ago for [2269] 630 bucks what you want is you want [2271] stuff like this you want reviews where [2275] people like literally write heartfelt [2278] message talking about how great you are [2280] and how amazing your service providing [2282] is and all that stuff and basically if [2286] we could just go back here a little [2288] bit um in order to do this you need to [2290] send somebody a message at the end of [2292] the contract now I've actually went and [2293] created a bunch of message I've created [2296] a DOT called message templates what I've [2298] done is I've just gone through my own [2299] messages on upwork and I just copied and [2301] pasted them all in here uh we're just [2303] going to use this as a template file now [2305] my swipe file because you know this [2306] stuff helped me make [2308] 500k uh so I've removed names and [2310] identifying info I've just replaced some [2311] of the stuff with X and Y but um what I [2313] mean to say is like if you want to do [2315] well on upwork you actually need to like [2316] literally ask every one of your clients [2318] for review and I know it seems sort of [2320] annoying I know it seems sort of like [2321] presumptuous but it is basically [2323] required because if you don't they're [2325] not going to leave any written section [2326] most clients don't know how this [2327] platform works and they just don't [2328] really give enough of a [ __ ] they're [2329] really busy people um so unless you can [2331] sort of make your point that they're not [2333] going to do it for you so uh I just have [2335] a bunch of different templates here you [2337] can like swap for you uh three in three [2340] in particular this first one says would [2342] you mind ending the contract and leaving [2343] an honest review of your experience [2345] honest written review of your experience [2347] mindu that's the important word this [2348] would help me on upwork a ton if you're [2350] new to the process I went and found a [2352] guide for you just in case so I actually [2354] show them everything that they need so [2355] they don't have to ask me how they do it [2357] then I say I can also walk through it [2358] myself I'll leave you one too which will [2360] help Freelancers choose who to work with [2361] and how your job ranks I'm saying this [2363] because I specifically want them to [2365] think that this is going to help them [2366] right I need be mutually beneficial here [2369] they've already paid me money so if you [2370] think about it how else are we going to [2371] make it more mutually [2373] beneficial this is an Ask would you mind [2375] closing the contract for now and leaving [2376] a written review it tends to help me [2377] rank up a fair bit an uper search [2379] feature which gives me access to a bunch [2380] of new jobs I'll happily work with you [2381] again anytime you just have to send me a [2382] new offer and accept the contract let me [2384] know if you have any [2385] questions the reason why I do this is [2387] because a lot of clients especially on [2388] fixed price deals uh they'll just leave [2390] the contract open forever and they're [2392] going to leave it open forever that [2393] means that they never close it that [2394] means that you never get a review so [2396] this is just a quick way to politely ask [2398] them to close the contract for you and [2400] leave a written review um and then you [2401] know you provide some justification and [2403] if you did a good job and they're still [2404] sort of Basking in the warm glow of your [2405] service you ask them this they're going [2407] to do it for [2408] you the last thing is saying hey could [2411] you do me a favor and be the one to end [2412] our contract together as I mentioned um [2415] most people will leave their contracts [2417] open they don't really realize that they [2418] can close them Freelancers can also [2421] close contracts but if a freelancer [2422] closes a contract then the client isn't [2425] prompted to leave a review immediately [2427] and the likelihood they're going to [2428] leave your review is much much lower so [2431] if you forcing them to close the [2432] contract then it says leave a written [2435] review for freelancer optional and then [2437] they're much much more likely to do it [2440] this is about as data driven as you can [2441] get I've probably done this several [2443] hundred times at this point and uh I [2446] encourage everybody that's watching this [2447] video to follow this exact flow every [2450] time that you want to close a contract [2451] for [2452] yourself so yeah as you can see here my [2455] own one over the course of last few [2456] weeks has been pretty trash there was a [2458] good period here where I wasn't getting [2460] any I could go all the way back in time [2463] I don't know if I will but what you want [2465] is you just want like two or three of [2466] them in a row just like this one here [2468] Nick delivered exceptional work [2469] exceeding expectations with their [2470] attention to detail and creative [2472] approach their ability to meet tight [2473] deadlines though compromising quality [2475] made them a valuable asset Nick [2476] absolutely knows what he does no long [2478] explanation necessary good for his [2479] proposal minor changes quick completion [2480] this will make upw work such a wonderful [2482] platform whenever I need help further in [2484] writing I know where to go to so you [2486] want a couple ones like these these will [2487] really help you [2488] out all right all right so that's [2490] reviews that's how you get them um [2493] project catalog is just a way for people [2495] to search projects for you and then you [2497] will create a listing that they can [2498] click on um this make.com when I [2500] actually get a ton of traffic on so [2502] that's pretty [2504] interesting this one here I didn't [2506] really get any traffic on nobody was [2507] really interested in unfortunately so I [2509] think it's not necessarily like luck of [2510] the draw but it's just another one of [2512] those features where you know if upwork [2514] just released it you're going to want to [2515] do a really good job um and and [2517] basically bang in it as quickly as [2519] humanly possible mine was like a lead [2521] generation system I charge 1.4 2.8 or [2525] $4,000 for um 10% of this is upwork fees [2528] obviously but uh yeah performs pretty [2530] well as I was mentioning to you and then [2533] what's down here at the bottom right [2535] these are testimonials um as you see [2536] nobody really cares about them because [2538] they stick them all the way down at the [2539] bottom people care a lot more about [2541] reviews but if you don't have any [2542] reviews testimonials are positive to do [2544] as well they're just ways that you can [2545] import your work from previous clients [2547] into upwork and have people see them so [2550] I went through and I got like 20 of my [2552] clients that I worked with on other [2553] projects and I basically forced them at [2555] gunpoint to uh leave me written reviews [2557] here upor will reach out to them over [2559] email and be like hey here's a little [2561] form could you please fill out you know [2563] could you please fill out a a [2565] testimonial for Nick and some of them [2567] are awaiting responses because these [2568] people just haven't really left me one [2570] yet and that's okay certifications [2572] you're just going to want to get some [2573] certifications simplest and easiest one [2575] get the HubSpot inbound CT did that in [2577] like an hour or something like that very [2579] straightforward um there are a bunch of [2581] other ones from LinkedIn and Google and [2582] stuff like that just make sure you have [2583] like one or two if you do the one from [2585] HubSpot it'll actually say verified by [2587] upw workk which is why I like it just [2588] makes me look more legit and I think [2590] that this logo just looks sexier than [2591] whatever the hell this is last but not [2594] least employment history other [2595] experiences you guys notice how this [2596] shit's all the way down at the bottom [2598] well it's all the way down at the bottom [2599] because very few people care about this [2600] and I mean to be real we're we're at a [2602] point in my profile that less than 1% of [2604] people probably get to so you really [2605] don't have to worry too much about about [2607] this just fill this stuff out make sure [2608] that it is filled out my only rule of [2611] thumb here would be make your present [2612] job not um a business owner for a [2617] business that does exactly your service [2619] because if you do that this early before [2621] you've like developed strong [2622] fundamentals and have a bunch of reviews [2624] people are just going to think that the [2625] purpose of this profile is to farm work [2626] out to this business um and it's not the [2629] purpose of this thing for you is not to [2630] farm work out it's basically to like [2632] grow your business do most of the work [2633] yourself and you know get a leg up at [2635] least initially um so would just not [2637] write that I am the business owner [2640] entrepreneur founder CEO like just leave [2642] words like that out of here um there's a [2644] certain power Dynamic when you are a [2645] freelancer and you don't necessarily [2647] want them to think that you're going to [2648] be like some big CEO Hot Shot uh you're [2650] actually going to do the work with them [2652] and for them right all right so that is [2653] how to optimize your profile let's talk [2655] a little bit about my own application [2657] strategy and why I consider it the best [2659] application strategy on planet Earth so [2661] the simplest and easiest thing you can [2662] do right now to do all of your app a [2667] optimization and just set it all upright [2670] is to spend a few moments just seeing [2672] how your profile looks from the client [2674] perspective what do I mean by this well [2677] I mean actually posting a job if you [2679] have a job that is able to be posted um [2682] if you have a client account like I do [2685] or I mean um you know just finding like [2687] a screenshot or you know in my case [2689] watching this video but I have a client [2691] account here um and you know I've used [2693] this to hire a bunch of people as you [2694] could see down at the bottom and what [2696] I'm going to do do is I'm going to go to [2697] all job posts and then I'm just going to [2699] walk you through what the process looks [2700] like when you actually try and hire [2701] somebody so if you want to hire somebody [2703] on upwk you got to go to post new job [2704] it's going to ask you a ton of questions [2706] you fill them out and then basically [2707] this is what happens you post something [2709] that looks like [2710] this in my case I was looking for [2712] editors to uh run my YouTube channel [2715] well not run but do some video editing [2717] simply because it was getting um a [2719] little too difficult and so I wanted [2721] some people to create some short-term [2722] assets in this job and then I wanted uh [2724] some people to work with me on like an [2726] editing basis on another job and this is [2728] a post that I wrote you know I've [2729] recently monetized my community I'm [2730] making a website right now I want high [2732] quality digital design assets blah blah [2733] blah blah so I post this job right and [2736] then the next thing that the client will [2738] see is they get a page called invite [2741] Freelancers where they can specifically [2742] go through a list of people that have [2744] all of your keywords in their [2745] descriptions then you can actually like [2747] physically click their profile and [2748] invite them so I could go to this lady [2750] here and I could click hire or I could [2752] click on her profile read about her read [2755] um her various reviews and stuff like [2756] that P all caps is a certain type of [2759] energy for sure um and then you know I [2761] can I can short list her or I could [2763] invite her to the job after You' done [2765] the invitations what you can do and this [2768] is really the part that matters for you [2769] before you go and apply you want to see [2771] what your applications look like uh you [2772] can look through all the people that [2774] have actually applied to your job and [2775] this is exactly what it looks like the [2777] client's going to get a list of [2778] proposals that people have sent and in [2781] this case I think I got 12 but I'll be [2783] real most of the time you're going to [2784] get like 30 40 50 it really depends on [2786] uh [2788] like the rate that you put in your job [2789] and that sort of thing I think I was [2790] quite low here I was probably like [2792] between 10 to like 25 bucks an hour I [2794] was looking for somebody um overseas in [2796] like a lower cost of living country so [2797] that I could Arbitrage my money to their [2799] time right uh so you know I got 12 but [2802] realistically most jobs are going to [2803] like 30 40 50 100 and the way that the [2807] profile stuff works and I kind of want [2809] to go through this with you um line by [2811] line is you'll first see that the top [2815] few results at the top like the top few [2817] results the first two or three are [2818] always going to be boosted what does [2819] that mean well if you zoom in here [2821] you'll see this little lightning sign [2823] and it says boosted if you Mouse over it [2825] this freelancer spent more on this job [2827] to get noticed we'll cover how that [2829] works in practice in a moment but [2831] essentially every time you apply to a [2832] job you have the opportunity to bid now [2835] this is a relatively new feature that's [2836] put out I think like a year and a half [2837] ago but if you bid uh more money then [2839] you're more likely to appear at the top [2841] actually you are going to appear [2843] wherever you bit first place second [2844] place or third place they might even [2846] have a fourth place [2847] now so if you want to appearer at the [2850] top which you do you just need to make [2852] sure to boost every single application [2854] you should never not boost what you'll [2856] find is 99% of your jobs will come from [2858] boosted gigs because you are the first [2860] place that people see and because upwork [2862] is so competitive this is just naturally [2864] a way to filter out the intent of [2865] Freelancers people that are ambitious [2867] that want to make more money are going [2868] to be spending more money on their [2869] marketing as well um people have varying [2872] opinions about this but my opinion is [2874] like mathematically logically you should [2876] be boosting every single thing because [2877] the Boost will cost you a dollar or [2879] something like that per application uh [2881] and then the amount of money that you [2882] make from a client that pays you a lot [2884] can be several thousand dollars so to me [2886] it just makes sense to boost everyone [2888] and then if a client doesn't actually [2889] click on your profile then you get a [2890] full refund of your Boost so if they [2892] just didn't click in then you know it [2894] wouldn't be a big deal all right so [2896] that's the first thing so make sure to [2897] boost everything the second thing is [2898] just look at the profile pictures like I [2900] was telling you about before right some [2901] profile pictures instantly jump out to [2903] you this one was one of them because [2904] this person clearly did some editing [2906] their profile make sure looks a little [2907] different um they have like good form I [2909] can see their face and they're also [2910] smiling right they're unique essentially [2912] if I scroll through the rest of these [2913] you'll see that most of these are not [2915] like that there are a few this guy jumps [2917] out to me this uh guy jumps out to me as [2919] well this guy's profile looks pretty [2921] interesting although I will say the fact [2922] that he's in smiling here I think kind [2923] of hurts him same thing with this guy [2925] just on profile quality line i' probably [2927] go with this fella here he's wearing a [2928] nice clean shirt um cool blue background [2931] it's sweet I wouldn't go with somebody [2933] like this why would I like want to hire [2935] somebody whose eyes I can't see that [2936] sounds really silly um Allan needs to [2938] work on his [2939] profile abishek if I'm pronouncing his [2942] name right crushed it with this this [2943] looks super unique I mean he is yeah I [2945] mean there's a reason he made $100,000 [2947] on this right like obviously um that's [2950] somebody that's put some thought into it [2951] the point that I'm making is you can [2952] sort of see where all of these little [2954] optimizations are coming from if you [2955] just put yourself in the client shoes [2958] what are some other things that we [2959] noticed right off the top uh well you're [2961] noticing that the people that tend to do [2963] well on this uh the people that sort of [2965] crush most of these jobs [2967] um the guys with more money on their [2969] profile basically tend to have more [2971] keywords so abek has graphic designer an [2973] adobe expert video editor [2975] WordPress [2977] um let's see here you know you'll see [2979] that there's some patterns like a lot of [2980] people will do some separation here [2982] between the [2983] titles all right experienced designer [2985] branding uiux print design granted uh [2988] Kar hasn't earned any money so maybe [2989] he's not the perfect example here but I [2991] think you guys see what I'm saying uh [2993] basically the idea is like heyy you know [2994] I want somebody that photoshopping figma [2995] this guy do photoshopping figma okay [2997] he's probably the right pick or buy is [2999] the right pick because he's a Photoshop [3000] expert and I'm looking for somebody I [3001] use the word Photoshop in my post so [3003] that's something else you can sort of [3005] get a lot more real estate over here [3007] just by adding a few of these terms [3009] another thing that jumps out to me is [3011] the location the person's from Grant you [3012] see the country you don't actually see [3013] the city until you click on their thing [3015] but the country is important right like [3016] Philippines uh I think in the Western [3019] World people from the Philippines that [3021] work on gig platforms probably have a [3022] reputation to be substantially cheaper [3024] same thing with people that are in [3025] Pakistan or or or India for instance [3028] right and cheaper doesn't necessarily [3030] always mean like it's the same quality [3032] for less money sometimes it means lower [3034] quality for less money as well and so I [3036] don't know I can imagine a hypothetical [3038] situation in which you're on the border [3039] between two countries and maybe you [3040] spend some time in another country uh [3042] maybe have the opportunity not to be in [3043] the Philippines we have the opportunity [3045] to be I don't know in Singapore or [3047] something like that I I don't actually [3048] think that that is ever a situation that [3050] would reasonably exist because I believe [3052] the two countries aren't exactly side by [3054] side but I I think you guys get my point [3056] um if you can brand yourself as not [3058] necessarily somebody in a lower cost of [3060] living country um that'll be to your [3061] benefit because people aren't really [3062] going to be thinking H this person's [3064] only worth 10 or 15 bucks an hour you [3065] might be able to get away with charging [3066] 150 200 bucks an hour right like like I [3069] am being here in Canada so that's [3072] another thing that jumps out to me um [3075] the rate obviously jumps out to me [3076] notice how this guy's $10 an hour $6 an [3078] hour $17 an hour $17 an hour 1537 I mean [3083] what was I telling you about before I [3084] was telling you that basically everybody [3085] on this platform just uses the same [3087] round number here and to be honest if [3089] after you've seen enough of them you [3090] start being like really how the hell do [3091] you know you're worth 25 an hour now [3094] imagine if you saw somebody here at the [3096] top that was boosted that was [3098] 1732 wouldn't your inclination be hm I [3100] wonder why he charges so so precisely or [3103] specifically that's a little hack um the [3105] 40K earned $700 earned obviously it's a [3108] distinguishing Factor but notice how [3110] there are people all the way down at the [3111] bottom here they have 20K earned 10K [3113] earned and they're still below Zan who [3115] only has 700 um he's at the top because [3117] he boosted it right job success is [3120] important again it can be overridden [3121] through boosting then top rated is [3123] important and you know when you're [3124] comparing yourself you're comparing a [3126] specific freelancer to other boosts [3128] you're going to be looking at Job [3129] success you're going to be looking for [3130] the presence of these jobs you're going [3131] to be looking for that and you're going [3131] to be looking for that so you know I [3133] know that bu if I'm saying his name [3135] right is probably one and a half to two [3136] times as much money as isan but I [3138] probably also feel a lot more confident [3140] and comfortable working with ban versus [3141] isan because I mean what's the [3143] differential here like 60 times or so [3145] he's made 60 times more money on [3147] platform and in addition to doing 60 [3149] times more work he also has uh 12% more [3151] job success guy probably knows his stuff [3154] right these are all things that you're [3155] subconsciously thinking about when you [3156] decide to hire all right so after that I [3160] want to talk a little bit about the copy [3162] um and I'm going to show you why my [3163] application strategy tends to work [3165] really well for me um it's because [3167] upwork allows you to include a cover [3168] letter in every single app right what do [3171] I mean by cover letter I mean uh you can [3173] actually write something specifically to [3174] the person that created the job and you [3175] can say hey how's it going uh you know I [3178] looking for your particular job and your [3180] particular job spoke to me because of X [3182] Y and Z you basically have what looks [3184] like about two lines and maybe I don't [3187] know 150 characters or so to like really [3189] grab their attention right this is going [3192] to give you a few percentage points [3193] conversion rate uh this is going to give [3195] you a massive Improvement in conversion [3196] rate your titles are going to give you a [3197] little bit the amounts of money you're [3198] charging well the job success store well [3200] but this right here this is going to [3201] make up the rest of it and so this is a [3203] massive lever that you can pull like a [3205] like a like a uh [3207] it's like a slot machine like this is [3208] something that you can pull and it'll be [3210] directly correlated with your [3212] Revenue what happens if I like one and I [3215] want to click on it well as you see it [3218] got cut off right over here before [3221] apparently he's looking for a long-term [3223] relationship well well well uh thank you [3225] and God bless the thank you and God [3227] bless part actually got cut off here [3228] right I go back here says I just ended [3231] it and I'm dot dot dot so what you want [3233] to do is in order to really crush on an [3235] upwork you want to make sure sure that [3236] like the juice the highi part is between [3240] here and here or maybe here and if it is [3245] um you'll be able like they'll actually [3247] read the stuff you write if you don't [3248] put it up here I'll be honest a lot of [3249] people aren't going to read [ __ ] they're [3251] literally not going to read anything [3252] that you wrote because they're never [3253] going to actually click through it I [3255] only personally click through maybe a [3257] third of the portfolios that I see [3259] because two-thirds of them just are not [3261] worth anything this guy looks like he's [3262] worth it right so I actually clicked [3263] through I actually read it but you'll [3265] notice that he also really screwed up [3267] because he attached a a portfolio down [3270] here um think of how much work I have to [3272] go through in order to get this done I [3274] have to like click on this button then I [3276] have to wait like 10 15 seconds then I [3279] have to download this guy's whole [3281] freaking thing and then I have to like [3283] feel comfortable opening a PDF from some [3285] dude I've never met in a country who is [3288] typically associated with you know I [3290] don't know like phone scams and stuff [3291] right like um I get a lot of phone scams [3294] from people in the Philippines my own [3295] personal [3296] thing is when I see a a phone call [3298] coming in from that [3300] number um you know I'm I'm much mess I'm [3302] much less more I'm much less likely to [3304] pick it up if I was born and raised in [3306] the Philippines and I've only ever [3308] worked with or lived with people in that [3309] area I probably wouldn't like put those [3310] two together but because I'm in Canada [3312] because I'm in the Western World I've [3313] worked with tons of companies that hire [3314] on upw workk I know that this is a [3315] legitimate concern so I'm actually not [3317] going to like want to click on this [3318] attachment realistically imagine if this [3320] was just a link or something I'd be so [3321] much more likely to want to give it a [3322] little tap open up the portfolio and [3324] then maybe if it was arranged in a [3325] beautiful way we'll be so much easier [3326] for me to say yes to one so you know I'm [3330] not saying this because I want to offend [3331] anybody I'm just saying this to be very [3332] ruthlessly pragmatic here and if you [3333] want to crush it on this platform this [3334] is what you need to do as you can see [3337] the rest of the profile is highlighted [3339] and out here and stuff I'm not going to [3340] cover all that but um yeah this is your [3342] opportunity this first line here is your [3344] opportunity to really make a splash and [3346] if you can make it easy for somebody [3347] that is going through 10 or 15 [3348] portfolios in like 30 minutes if you can [3351] make it easy for them to see why they [3352] should hire you they're going to go over [3354] here and click this beautiful bright [3355] green button [3356] uh and actually make something [3358] happen so yeah those are the questions [3361] that you should be asking what do the [3362] best apps have in common how about the [3363] worst ones what could you put in the [3365] first few words or sentences to maximize [3366] the probability of a click now the main [3369] question next is okay well let's say [3371] I've learned that once I have how do I [3373] actually go about applying and I'll show [3375] you exactly what I do basically every [3377] time what I'll do is I will create a [3380] customized loom video at the very top [3384] the very very top of the message that [3386] exact same place where you saw the cover [3387] letters I will have a loom video URL [3390] then inside of that loom video I will [3393] have a video of me literally talking [3395] them through what I have done for other [3396] people and what I would do for them [3398] there are some niches where this works [3400] really well for automation for instance [3402] this crushes why because automation is a [3404] very visual sort of industry and if you [3407] are delivering automation projects to [3409] people if you just tell them hey I [3411] delivered an automation project it looks [3413] nowhere near as cool as if you actually [3415] open up a video and then walk them [3416] through hey here's a system that [3417] generates all these leads here's how it [3419] works watch right and you actually you [3420] actually run them through it so what [3422] I'll do is I'll create a customized loom [3424] video for every application that I send [3425] out for this Niche and I think you can [3427] do the same for basically any Niche you [3428] could do graphic design you could do PPC [3430] you could do Google you could do like [3432] 99% of niches you could do a customized [3434] loom video um writing you might not be [3436] able to do a customized loom video but [3439] 99% of the niches you do and then you [3441] have a templated message underneath that [3443] explains all of the rest of your service [3445] I'll show you exactly what I mean in a [3447] moment and then if you run through the [3449] unit economics the way that this works [3450] is you spend 2 to four minutes recording [3451] a video then it takes you maybe another [3453] 30 seconds to a minute to click apply [3455] what this means is it takes you about an [3458] hour to do around 20 applications these [3461] are all customized applications you send [3462] 20 per hour the way that this works is [3464] about a third of the people are going to [3466] respond sometimes more some I've had [3467] days where 50% of people respond um and [3470] when they do because you put all this [3471] time effort and energy into developing a [3473] customized thing they're going to [3474] respond extraordinarily positively to [3476] you they're going to say holy crap Nick [3477] this is exactly what I was looking for [3479] dude you you took the words right out of [3480] my mouth how do I pay you these are the [3482] sorts of responses that I routinely get [3484] when I do this approach on upwork for a [3485] few days I just go to my inbox and [3487] everybody's like dude thank you so much [3489] wow this is incredible wow you really [3490] know your stuff I mean in addition to it [3492] working how much more pleasant is that [3494] rather than have people harass you over [3496] your raid well uh you charge a lot like [3498] can we get a discount right so like [3501] mathematically you get the same result [3503] for about the same amount of time spent [3505] it's just the the the the sorry you get [3507] the same quantifiable result as you do [3510] for the same amount of time spent as if [3511] you were to try and do some Mass [3512] application approach but because you are [3515] applying to fewer jobs you spend less [3516] money on boosts and then you also spend [3518] less money on uh you spend less time [3521] dealing with people that aren't [3522] interested in working with you so what [3524] you end up with is if you do about 20 [3525] customized applications per hour and you [3527] have a responser about a third you get [3529] about six new leads in a freaking hour [3531] that's stupid that's the dumbest thing [3534] that I've ever heard in my life if I [3535] could transport this back to my [3537] fledgling door knocking times uh when I [3540] was busting my ass you know getting like [3542] three booked appointments for an 8 hour [3544] day um it would be crazy because that's [3546] like how much more effective is that [3547] like six times eight times more [3549] effective something like that and then [3552] all it cost you was about 10 minutes per [3554] lead and about $3 each and then what to [3557] do during the application just always [3559] boost and then always at a placeholder [3560] to fix price gigs that probably means [3561] nothing to you so we're actually going [3562] to go ahead and do it [3564] together so what I do is um first things [3566] first upwork has recently deprecated [3568] their RSS feed but I used to have an RSS [3571] feed [3572] here um [3575] somewhere and the way that this RSS feed [3578] would [3579] work is it allowed us to query up work [3582] and then grab um specific jobs [3588] basically oops sorry about that let's [3590] open this puppy back up again my [3592] internet's a little slow today [3593] unfortunately just doing like 17 things [3595] in the background [3600] apparently I'm having allergies as well [3602] uh okay and then what this RSS feed [3604] would do is it would get the title it [3605] would get the description it would get [3607] um a copiable message template and what [3609] I could do is I could copy this message [3611] and then and then post it so let's say [3612] I'm looking for like an automation job [3613] I'm just going to type in [3616] automation uh and I like this ghl [3618] assistance one that was published 2 [3620] minutes ago I'm going to click apply now [3622] you can read through all of this of [3624] course um you know you can see that this [3626] person is new to upw work they have one [3627] open job they spend $766 on that one job [3630] it's pretty reasonable but they're [3631] probably look for something like low to [3633] mid price um but in terms of how to do [3635] the actual application here here's what [3636] I would do so I have my template saved [3638] right like I have that little copyable [3639] message and I'll show you what that [3640] looks like in a second what I do here is [3643] I would make note of the title ghl [3645] assistance less than 30 hours per week [3646] what I do is I scroll down I would bid [3648] whatever my hourly rate is for this job [3650] so I'm actually going to apply with my [3651] marketing automation specific job which [3653] is 11750 an hour for the schedule a rate [3656] increase I would go never and then I [3658] would scroll down here and I'd paste in [3660] my cover [3661] letter [3663] so this is what my own CV looks like I [3667] say hi this is exactly what I do for a [3669] living so I actually recorded a video [3670] for you to build and explain the system [3672] you want imagine if we were churning [3674] through portfolios earlier and then [3676] somebody did that wouldn't you want to [3678] at least give that a click especially if [3679] they were boosted the top result [3681] wouldn't that person instantly seem like [3683] the best f for the job probably and then [3685] what about if after you clicked on their [3687] profile you went through everybody [3688] else's profile and you saw wow that [3689] person didn't customize anything W that [3691] person didn't even write me a message [3692] wow that person just copy and pasted a [3693] portfolio and then attached it like how [3695] much more likely you to get the job [3696] right way more likely so what I'll do is [3699] I'll say hi this is exactly what I do [3700] for a living so I recorded a video for [3702] you to build and explain the system you [3703] want and then I will record my loom [3706] video and it just you know URL looks [3708] like this usually cuts out somewhere [3710] around here the reason why I do that is [3712] because then they have to click through [3713] to the vi to the video like they [3714] actually have to click into my profile [3716] they literally have to click into my [3717] profile to click the video so I just [3719] look like growth hacked them into being [3720] on my page right then down here I have [3723] this message um this is specific to [3725] HubSpot and air table so it says I've [3727] successfully integrated HubSpot and air [3728] table for various clients including a [3729] multi-million dollar San Diego real [3731] estate brokerage also provide detailed [3732] outlines of my work for future [3733] troubleshooting and configuration um [3735] that's just kind of specific to whatever [3737] they're asking um well in this case it's [3739] not because this isn't specific to this [3741] job but specific to another job but you [3742] get my point um and then down here is [3744] this whole templated bit where I'm an AI [3746] developer with 5 years of process [3747] automation experience of lied dozens of [3749] high performing systems for service [3750] firms and e-commerce businesses many of [3751] which is scill to $1 million plus in [3753] sales I use a variety of platforms I [3756] also write a popular newsletter um I [3758] wrote I should probably update that it's [3760] been like a year and a half or two um [3763] and then this I don't know if I can [3765] realistically say this anymore should [3768] probably cut that in half just because [3770] it's been a while um but anyway uh so [3773] then I just have the rest of my message [3774] down here and then what did I just get I [3776] got them to click into my profile I [3778] chopped this in half so they had to then [3780] they watch my video and then after they [3781] watch my video I explain everything I do [3783] in my video um then then they go right [3785] over here and they want to read the rest [3786] of it so it ends up being quite [3789] impressive it ends up being quite [3790] valuable and then what I do next is you [3792] can drag or upload files but I don't I [3793] just link them to my resources instead [3795] they're way more valuable that way right [3797] but what I'll do next is uh profile [3799] highlights I can add an upwork job add a [3801] portfolio project add a certificate so [3802] what you can do is if you have any jobs [3804] any uh previous jobs you done that are [3806] similar to this job you can actually [3807] really quickly scroll through and then [3808] you can like connect that if you have [3811] any uh portfolio pieces that are [3812] particular to what you want to highlight [3814] you could actually connect them right [3815] here so um in this person's case you [3818] know we're talking systems uh I don't [3821] really have too many of these systems [3823] specific ones I guess I could select my [3824] blog which talks all about systems so [3826] when people click on that they'll see [3827] that um and then maybe I could [3830] do my certificate as [3834] well let's see here maybe I could do [3836] that to Showcase my um let's do the [3839] medium too and then what I do next is [3842] and this is the most important part I [3843] will boost the proposal so you see [3845] nobody here has boosted yet right it [3847] just says live proposals first place 10 [3849] connects so one person boosted a minute [3850] ago what I'll do is I'll set my bid and [3852] I'm actually going to bid anywhere up to [3854] about 25 connects if I don't see a bid [3856] if I do see a bid I'm like let's say [3858] this is 50 connects what I'll do is I'll [3860] just bid one more connect I'll bid 51 [3863] the point is I don't always want to be [3864] in the top uh but I want to be somewhere [3866] in the top three like I don't have to be [3867] first if the person is so like if the [3870] person I'm competing with is so [3871] motivated that they bid like 100 [3872] connects which is about 15 USD I'm not [3874] going to bid 101 because I don't want to [3875] spend 15 freaking dollars in a job but [3878] if uh they bid like 20 30 40 50 I'll [3881] usually just bid one more so I can be in [3883] place one and then remember um if the [3886] client doesn't interact your proposal if [3887] they just skip on by you actually get [3888] your money refunded which happens in [3890] about half of cases so mathematically in [3892] your head uh you should just sort of [3893] figure out you should just sort of like [3895] think okay I wonder how much what what [3897] the likelihood of somebody opening my [3898] profile is what's the lik of them like [3900] actually going ahead with my profile um [3902] what's the likelihood of you know me [3905] getting a job once they give me that [3906] click and talk to me and ask me [3907] questions and stuff do the math in your [3909] head but you'll find that the the cost [3911] per successful proposal is actually very [3912] very low anyway that's personally what I [3916] would do um and that's personally what I [3917] have done in the past um if I go to my [3921] previous proposals down here I go to [3923] find work and the proposals you'll see [3925] that um there're a bunch here from a [3927] while back but the ones that I submitted [3930] I'm just going to walk you through a [3931] couple of [3933] these you know they they look exactly [3936] the same like what I showed you a moment [3937] ago this is obviously a job that [3939] somebody created using chat GPT numbers [3942] wise they don't look super good but [3944] that's okay hi this is exactly what I do [3946] for a living so I actually recorded a [3948] video for you to build and explain the [3949] system that you want if we give that a [3951] click We Now open up a loom video here [3954] and I'm going to have to really quickly [3955] pause this CU I don't want the audio to [3956] play there you go and what I do in this [3959] is I'm wearing my characteristic black [3962] toque that's my closing toque and then I [3965] uh I record a video where I run through [3967] my experience and then I run through my [3969] YouTube channel and I say hey I do all [3970] this fun stuff on YouTube Here's why you [3972] should work with me and then what I do [3974] next is I actually walk through every [3975] line in their freaking job description [3977] and I say here here's what I do for that [3979] here's what I've done in the past for [3980] that here's what I do for that now [3982] obviously you have to be able to present [3983] your work on camera and you have to be [3985] pretty smart about about it right but [3986] I'm assuming that if you're at this [3988] point in your career where you're [3989] looking to make money on upwork odds are [3991] you guys know how how this sort of thing [3993] works you you you understand the service [3995] that you are looking to get jobs for [3996] right same thing here with this proposal [3999] um exact same approach as you could see [4001] down here they ask a couple of [4002] additional questions and that's okay um [4004] but yeah not that uh not that big of a [4006] deal um it's very straightforward it's [4008] very simple and streamlined all you have [4010] to do is just follow the approach that I [4012] I outline here all right now that we [4014] understand how to make a job application [4015] let's talk a little bit more about how [4017] to scale once you've actually found [4020] upwork product Market fit I just coin [4022] that term but upwork product Market fit [4025] you've made a few thousand in upwork and [4027] you're actually thinking [ __ ] I really [4028] like this can I make a business out of [4030] the service that I'm providing or maybe [4032] you already have a business and this has [4033] just been a way to supplement your [4034] income the question becomes how do I [4036] start having other people do the work [4038] for my clients on upwork instead of me [4040] so that I can sort of remove that cap [4042] and scale higher than I thought that I [4044] used to be able to now the first thing I [4045] want to say is this isn't like [4046] inherently evil or anything like that um [4048] it's an incredible place to start a [4050] business on you just have to approach it [4051] right and you also have to approach it [4053] ethically upor is inherently not very [4055] scalable because it's somebody else's [4057] infrastructure it's not your own uh they [4060] obviously control all the messages that [4061] you send they have all of the data that [4063] you send and receive back and forward [4065] they control the money because of their [4066] escro system a lot of the time if you're [4068] on an hourly contract they control when [4069] that is dispersed you are certainly at [4071] their Mercy uh which is why you need to [4073] treat them with respect and you [4075] obviously need to pay dues to the person [4077] or the platform that is making you all [4079] this money in the first place the issue [4081] is if you're a service professional and [4083] you start freelancing or something [4084] you're doing all the work yourself so [4086] you will inevitably cap and that cap is [4087] usually somewhere between 5 to 10K a [4089] month I found in practice um I was doing [4091] about that much before I was just like [4092] holy crap there's nothing more that I [4094] could do here if you want to grow Beyond [4097] you're going to have to do a few things [4098] I'm going to talk about that now so the [4101] very first thing that you're gonna have [4102] to do is obviously you're going to have [4103] to start a business you're gonna have to [4105] have some other people working with you [4107] that means that you're going to have to [4108] find a way to subcontract the workout to [4111] a service professional of similar [4112] latitude of similar skill of similar [4114] ability you do not want to be farming [4116] work out because if you farm work out [4118] super low skilled lowcost people your [4121] clients will notice your upward profile [4123] will take a dip and this isn't even [4125] getting into like the ethical [4126] implications of you know running that [4128] that sort of business [4129] model essentially what you need to do is [4132] if you want to run this model [4133] strategically um you need to do fix [4135] price contracts instead of hourly [4137] because if you do fix if you do hourly [4139] rather there's something in like upw [4140] Works terms of service that I think [4142] prohibits you from doing this um I'm not [4143] entirely sure uh but essentially what [4145] what I'm saying is in order for this to [4147] work you need to do fixed price jobs so [4148] if you do hourly jobs just be careful I [4150] think this can put your profile at risk [4152] or something like that the definition of [4154] a fixed price job and an hourly job is [4155] is different in most jurisdictions where [4157] up work works so I think that like [4159] legally speaking they get to write some [4160] of it off as like a like an employment [4163] relationship where if it's a fixed price [4164] job maybe it's a contract a relationship [4166] which is why it's easy to subcontract [4168] not sure um and I also wouldn't do this [4169] too early I wouldn't do this before [4170] you're hitting like a few thousand a [4172] month maybe 5K a month minimum um once [4174] you're at that point then you can start [4175] wondering about how to grow your [4177] business but okay basically here here's [4179] exactly what I did and what I would do [4180] to you too the first thing is I would [4182] send messages to all of my current [4183] clientele just letting them know that [4185] I'm expanding my capacity most people [4187] treat this in a very poor way and they [4188] say Hey listen would you mind if maybe I [4192] got somebody else to do your work like I [4194] don't want to do it anymore [4196] that treats it all as a negative what [4197] you want to do is you want to reframe [4198] this you want this to be a positive so [4200] don't provide the impression that you're [4202] passing off their work to an underling [4203] don't provide the impression that like [4205] you're like oh I have a massive agency [4206] with a billion trillion clients now and [4208] then somebody else is going to take care [4209] of it I'm too important what you want to [4211] do is you want to show them that you are [4212] improving your offering and you're just [4214] looking for somebody to help um you know [4217] help you do X Y and Z you don't want to [4220] uh pitch it as them doing everything you [4221] don't want to pitch it as like you just [4222] again farming off the work you want to [4224] pitch it as like hey this this person is [4225] a very very professional um talent in [4229] this industry I just want to have them [4230] come on give me a fresh uh par of eyes [4234] see if they can help me provide the [4235] service that I'm offering to you I'll [4236] show you templates on this in a second [4239] the next thing is do the first gig in [4241] any deal yourself this maximizes the [4243] perceived quality and the retention then [4245] it also gives your first few hires a way [4246] to model the quality of the work and [4247] then what you did specifically for that [4249] client like uh when it comes to you know [4251] automation work for instance if you're [4253] trying to grow and then and then scale [4254] your business and you're using upwork as [4256] lead generation method as a freelancer [4258] you'll cap at it you know 5 to 10K and [4259] then when you bring your first person on [4261] if they don't already know the working [4262] relationship and the style you have with [4264] that with that customer um and it's the [4267] first few times you've done this they're [4268] they're going to screw it up you're [4269] going to screw it up you're basically [4271] risking burning that bridge uh just so [4274] that you could do another job while they [4275] do theirs well like it doesn't really [4277] make sense to do that because you could [4278] have just done that job instead of the [4279] other one uh done one fewer job and then [4281] made the same amount of money [4282] considering that person's probably not [4284] going to want to work with you again the [4285] point that I'm making is just do any [4287] first gig in to deal yourself because [4288] that's the highest Roi part of a working [4290] relationship if you make a really good [4291] impression on that first gig people are [4292] going to be a lot more forgiving about [4294] any potential screw-ups later on that [4296] may or may not be necessarily your [4297] fault um and then once you're done with [4299] that then you can start subcontracting [4301] then you can start working [4302] collaboratively with people if it's a [4303] big automation project you might have a [4305] virtual assistant or something like that [4306] your virtual assistant does some of the [4308] more like repetitive tasks like setting [4309] up email inboxes that sort of thing and [4312] that enables you to focus on the higher [4313] leverage stuff and maybe by setting it [4315] up that way now you make twice the [4316] amount of money and your total margin is [4317] just like dropped by 5% or something [4320] totally worth it for you right the last [4322] thing is eventually you're going to [4323] scale so big that upwork is no longer [4325] going to be sufficient to be your [4326] primary lead source and when you find [4328] yourself doing that you need to create a [4329] project management system to house your [4331] work um usually for this a simple stage [4333] based pipeline is sufficient and I'll [4334] touch on what that means more in a [4337] second but in terms of like the [4339] templates that I would use for this I'm [4341] going to scroll down here past regular [4342] follow-ups of scaling service [4344] fulfillment and these are messages that [4346] I've sent to people um the italicized [4348] portions the parts with like X Y and Z [4350] these are just placeholders so feel free [4351] to swap them but this is the this is the [4353] way to frame this well um hey X I had a [4356] blast working with you on that last [4357] project for our next I'm thinking if I [4359] can make X portion even better and I'm [4361] looking for a consultant like uh you [4363] know I'm looking for an immigration [4365] attorney or something like that to help [4366] me with understanding the the finer [4368] points behind this would you mind if I [4370] had them look over our work together [4371] before I submitted the Milestone thank [4373] you Nick if I were to deliver that [4374] message to somebody consider the frame [4377] that they are taking it in they're [4378] thinking oh wow so Nick really wants [4380] like go the extra mile here and make [4381] this project even better gez this guy is [4383] really working on improving his ability [4385] to fulfill this service I really like [4386] him of course I'm down with that man [4388] what else do you need another thing you [4389] can do is you can frame this as a [4391] request uh load sort of thing where [4394] you're saying hey I know you have a lot [4395] of requests coming in next month for [4397] graphic design I'm going to be a little [4398] bit bottleneck with uh fulfilling a [4401] really big project I just want to make [4402] sure I can accommodate you uh my friend [4404] or my cousin or my colleague is actually [4406] a professional graphic designer he's [4407] worked with Taylor Swift I was wondering [4409] if I could just have him look over [4410] things before I submit the next batch to [4411] you maybe touch up the corners that sort [4413] of thing um I learned most of what I [4415] know from them so this is going to be [4416] even better than the service that I [4418] usually provide you I'm just charging [4419] the same rate because I know that these [4420] are important obligations for you I just [4422] want to make sure you don't miss any um [4424] does that sound reasonable can I get [4425] their input awesome okay great let's [4427] continue this is a very easy and simple [4429] and straightforward way to start the [4431] offboarding procedure um and it's one [4433] that you know I've done multiple times [4435] in terms of creating a project [4436] management system to house your work [4439] um if I [4441] go [4444] here all I mean by this is uh and I've [4447] shown my own project management system [4449] like a billion times but all I mean by [4451] this is basically just a system that is [4452] separated into stages for whatever [4454] you're doing so this is my own pipeline [4456] it has a bunch of different stages on [4458] hold awaiting revisions these are [4459] writing specific so they don't really [4461] need to be in your industry if you're [4462] not writing um but a waiting assignment [4464] that's like a c [4465] assigned is where like a worker a [4468] project person like a person that as [4470] part of your fulfillment staff they know [4472] that a project is now assigned to them [4473] and they're basically like waiting and [4475] and project managing it writing is in [4477] our case when somebody starts the [4478] writing process editing is when somebody [4480] starts the editing process then we have [4482] uh ready for submission which is after [4483] the editing and we used to have this one [4485] stage here called review and this other [4487] one here called client review we don't [4488] really use that anymore in [4490] practice so I I don't mean that you need [4492] to make it super complex this is in [4494] clickup which is my my personal favorite [4495] project management system but you could [4497] use it whatever platform you want [4499] monday.com clickup ass Trello there are [4501] a million in one of these and I'm not [4502] going to make the purpose of this video [4504] project management all right if you've [4505] made it to this point in the video [4507] congratulations because we now covered [4508] most of the main upwork topics the [4511] general ones so to speak what we're [4513] going to do next is we're going to dive [4514] into some Advanced upward Concepts in [4516] particular the jss or job success score [4519] um some Badges and I'm also going to [4520] briefly cover invitations I'm not going [4521] to spend a lot of time on that but uh [4523] yeah we're going to talk about [4524] invitations as well so what the hell is [4526] jss that stands for job success score [4529] and it is basically your upwork SEO job [4532] success score is what you see if you go [4535] to your [4536] profile and then you see this here 99% [4539] job success uh if this is high you're [4541] going to crush it on upwork if this is [4543] low it's going to be very difficult for [4544] you to move forward the good news is [4547] there's some Nuance here jss is equal to [4550] conceptually the successful outcomes [4552] minus the negative ones divided by the [4554] total number that you've had [4555] what this means is if you have a ton of [4557] successful ones and very few negative [4559] ones you'll have a ton of successful [4561] ones so a ton divided by a ton that's [4563] close to one right like 100% uh if you [4566] have a ton of negative ones then um [4568] you're going to end up with like a very [4569] low number right sort of mathematically [4572] how this works um if you have like a [4574] single outcome and that one is trash [4575] your jss going to suck if you have a [4577] single outcome and it's good your jss is [4578] going to be awesome uh basically it's [4580] just like a weighted average the way [4582] that this functions specifically is I'm [4584] pretty sure they take a weighted average [4585] of 6 months 12 months and 24 months so [4587] it's probably like 50% month 6 50% um 12 [4590] month and the 50% 24 that just means [4592] that contracts over six months old [4594] probably just contribute less to your [4596] jss they're probably most focused on the [4598] near-term ones that would just make [4599] sense there's no hard literature on this [4600] this is just my guess I know that [4602] they're rated in 612 and 24mth intervals [4604] so uh after my time on this platform I I [4606] I think that this is how they would want [4608] to structure it it's weighted by the [4611] total contract value as well this isn't [4613] really included in my formula but uh [4614] total outcomes just includes like total [4616] amount of money made on upw work so your [4619] total contract value if you do one job [4620] that's $100,000 and you try and compare [4622] that with a job that's $100 it might [4624] really screw up that $100 job but if you [4626] did really well in that $100,000 job [4628] your jss isn't really going to change [4630] another thing is um something that a lot [4632] of people don't realize is that if you [4633] have a notoriously shitty client like a [4635] client that is just a bad person and [4637] they just get on upw workk and they just [4638] try and get the cheapest client or [4640] cheapest freelancer and then they give [4641] them the most incredible ridiculous [4644] demand [4645] and then are obviously dissatisfied with [4647] their work if they've done that more [4648] than like twice before maybe once even a [4651] pork will not use their shitty review on [4653] you um in your job success score so you [4657] actually don't have to worry too much [4658] about that obviously you should try [4659] fulfilling clients to the best of your [4660] ability but if you actually find a total [4662] jackass like I found a couple of [4664] jackasses in my time 570 jobs maybe 10 [4667] of them have been [4669] jackasses uh if you if you get a huge [4671] jackass uh then just know that that's [4673] not really going to impact you too much [4675] as long as you just focus on like the [4676] new positive contracts that are coming [4677] in it'll have an extraordinarily minimal [4679] impact to your [4680] jss if you think about it logically what [4682] this means is that on upwork it is in [4684] your best interest especially early on [4687] to take as many jobs as you can [4689] especially if the client has more than a [4691] couple of positive reviews this just [4693] logically makes sense right you're going [4694] to want to get people that aren't shitty [4697] clients essentially and you can very [4699] easily verify that just by checking to [4701] see what the reviews are um again I [4703] wouldn't actually do this ahead of time [4704] I would should just send all my [4705] applications and stuff and just worry [4706] about the client rating at the end um a [4709] lot of the time they also have like [4710] reasonable explanations for their client [4711] rating suck and if they actually [4713] legitimately had a bad freelancer and [4714] you come in as a good freelancer it can [4716] actually be to your benefit so keep that [4718] little bit of nuance in mind so that's [4719] what job success score is um and again [4722] that's just this part right over here [4723] even if you don't have this badge on [4725] your profile um they're still [4726] calculating your job success score and [4728] it's still basically dictating where [4729] you're going to rank so just keep that [4731] in mind this job isn't necessary to have [4732] a job success score um a lot of people [4734] that are new to the platform like [4736] actually have a jss they just like it's [4738] not visible the second thing is Badges [4741] and I don't know why it says invitations [4742] down here I just meant to combine that [4743] up here um but bear with me um what is a [4746] badge and upwork well a badge is this [4748] right over here it's like this you know [4750] it is it is this job success badge it is [4752] this expert vetted top rated all that [4754] stuff and badges are really really [4756] important on up because they make you [4757] stand out like crazy um for one and then [4760] for two um they help your SEO and for [4764] three um there are a couple badges that [4766] like if if a freelancer has one of these [4768] badges it's basically guaranteed that [4770] they're going to do a pretty good job so [4771] upor is very careful about who they give [4773] these badges to obviously and [4775] Freelancers are obviously also like [4777] constantly hungering for these badges [4779] too so the most important one is this [4781] percentage job success this is why it is [4784] the first thing that you see um and it's [4785] why it has a really sexy blue crown with [4787] it with a percentage score um so I'm [4789] pretty sure you can get 100% job success [4791] I think I've had it a bunch of times [4792] right now I'm at 99% it's pretty good [4795] pretty good it's quite good um if you're [4798] between like 95% 9 100% you're you're [4801] probably going to do fine on that end [4802] don't worry about optimizing it too [4804] much the way that the other ones work [4806] are there are three there are top rated [4808] top rated plus and expert vetted so I [4811] have the best one now it's called exper [4812] vetted but um for a while I had top [4814] rated and what top rated means is it [4815] just means you're in the top 10% of [4817] Freelancers on the platform as judged by [4819] the total dollar value multiplied or [4822] something by your job success score it's [4824] like another little algorithm that [4825] they've created so that's the top 10% [4828] top rated plus is top 3% so we're [4831] getting closer to the cream of the crop [4833] then expert vetted is the top 1% and in [4836] order to get an expert vetted badge you [4838] have to be the top 1% then upor has to [4841] reach out to you and say hey how's it [4842] going you're freaking amazing and we [4843] love you and come here uh and then they [4846] they're going to interview you and so I [4848] had an interview with a lovely lady [4849] whose name I am not remembering but she [4851] was great and she ran me through a bunch [4853] of questions about upwork and but my own [4855] service fulfillment and basically what [4857] they're looking to check for is hey does [4859] this person one provide a really good [4860] service but two are they like very [4862] professional do they seem like a really [4864] qualified service professional the [4865] reason why they want to find that out is [4867] because you're basically representing [4868] upwork at this level and because if you [4870] get the expert vetted BGE they'll put [4872] you in a pool of very high value jobs [4875] typically they work with Enterprise [4877] businesses so one of the reasons why I [4879] have um all of these big names here is [4881] because some of these big names were in [4883] this high value job pool and they only [4885] show me jobs from these big names [4887] because I have this expert vetted badge [4889] and if you have like two or three of [4891] these big names putting a job up every [4893] day if you just apply consistently for a [4894] week or two you will get one of these [4896] big Enterprise companies that are worth [4898] hundreds of millions if not billions of [4899] dollars pretty fast so the exper vetted [4902] badge is actually if you think about it [4904] from a growth hacking perspective one of [4905] the highest Roi ways that you can add [4907] credibility to your life how much more [4908] credibility do I have in my life now [4910] because I have actually worked with wise [4912] or upward like I've literally worked [4913] with upor like the platform to do [4915] writing how much more credibility are [4917] you going to have um on this business [4919] venture and any future ones if you could [4921] cite that right so for me the second [4923] that I realized this I was like oh crap [4924] expert vage that is a huge priority I [4926] need to do whatever I can to get that [4928] badge because that isn't just going to [4929] help me with my writing business it's [4930] not just going to help me with my [4931] freelancing it's going to help me with [4932] literally everything else I do after and [4934] when I was starting my automation [4935] company that's what I started after my [4937] my writing business um I used my social [4939] proof from this all the time I was like [4941] yeah you know I used to work with [4942] nordvpn yeah I used to work with upwork [4943] I used to work with Co huet Packard [4945] right I basically like step laded my [4948] social proof all because of upor and [4950] it's something that you can do too as [4951] I'm sure you're [4952] aware so that's that the cool part is [4956] once you get something like exper vetted [4959] um you tend to start getting uh more [4962] invitations as well and invitations on [4964] upwork are pretty interesting I think [4966] they move them around but in the top [4967] rightand corner [4969] here should be [4971] invitations yeah right over here uh you [4974] start being part of this pool of [4975] invitations remember earlier when I [4977] showed you guys what the jobs look like [4979] from the client POV you guys saw that [4982] there was a button you could click that [4983] said hire or invite a freelancer well [4985] this is this is that section if you are [4987] expert vetted you're in a pool where you [4988] can accept an interview and as you see [4991] this uh fellow over here Doug he invited [4994] me to take a look at the job that I [4995] posted I wager there's a very high [4998] likelihood that one of the reasons why I [4999] was added to that pool of jobs and was [5001] at somewhere near the top most likely [5003] was because I was expert vet [5005] so do whatever you can to get that [5006] expert vage uh badge rather or at least [5009] the top rated badge uh those do very [5011] very well for your business anytime I [5013] had the top rated badge versus didn't uh [5015] my business would basically double in [5017] the weeks that I had it so you know like [5019] August the 7th to 14th I would do like [5022] $3,500 because I had the badge and then [5024] August 14th for whatever reason maybe [5026] somebody left me a crappy review 14th to [5028] 21st I might only do like $1900 as you [5030] see like there's a very big difference [5032] in the volume that you get as a result [5034] to [5035] this okay and then the last badge is [5038] this one called Rising Talent um I [5040] couldn't actually find any just here off [5041] the top of my head unfortunately But [5042] Rising Talent just looks kind of like [5044] the um top rated badge I think it just [5046] has an arrow that goes up and this is [5048] just a way for upwork to incentivize new [5050] bees to the platform and to get them [5052] into the job pool like meaningfully very [5053] quickly it's very difficult for somebody [5055] new to the platform to like get in [5057] because if you think about it logically [5058] somebody has to take a risk on you right [5060] somebody has to say you know this [5061] freelancer hasn't done anything ever why [5062] the hell would I work with him if I [5063] could just work with some some else even [5064] if I pay a little bit more money to that [5066] other person I'd feel a lot safer I'd [5068] feel a lot better don't know why that [5070] happened going to go back here um so [5074] yeah you know just just keep that in [5075] mind Rising talent's a good badge to [5078] have uh basically pops up if you've [5080] gotten a few festar reviews in your [5081] first couple months on the platform the [5083] last thing I'll mention here in small [5085] text is invitations uh invitations are [5089] yeah super important as you saw and um [5091] having an expert beted and a top rated [5094] bet BGE and high job success score these [5095] are just all going to increase the [5097] volume of of invitations that you get [5099] another quick way you can increase [5100] invitations just this available now [5101] badge like we talked about where you [5102] just basically do a little bit of [5104] bidding um yeah and then you can also [5107] boost your profile down here um if you [5110] want to get more invitations too and [5111] personally I I boost my profile quite a [5113] bit as you see I spent 4,000 connects [5115] received about 170 clicks uh the way [5117] that this works is if somebody types in [5120] like I don't know automation [5123] here and then oh I don't know they're [5125] looking for Freelancers rather [5126] Talent um what the boosting of this does [5129] is it just ensures that I show up at the [5131] very top it's almost like Google ads you [5132] can kind of think of it just for um yeah [5134] it's a Google ads for face sorry Google [5136] ads for Facebook it's Google ads for [5138] upwork it's obviously a little late and [5140] I'm going to have to take a nap at some [5143] point okay so yeah that's that uh in [5146] terms of upwork message templates I [5148] linked this Doc and I've shown it to you [5150] guys already getting written reviews was [5151] up here regular follow-ups sort of in [5153] the middle um the regular follow-up [5155] section that's the only part that I [5156] haven't covered so I'm just mentioning [5157] it really quickly right now basically [5159] every now and then about once a month I [5160] run through my whole upw work from top [5162] to bottom and you can imagine I have [5163] several thousand like contacts now so it [5165] takes quite a lot of time uh but what I [5167] do here the purpose of this is just to [5170] give all of these people a little ping [5173] and remind them how great I was to work [5175] with and if they have any needs that may [5178] or may not have come up in the last [5179] month to send them to me instead they're [5182] very simple I'll just do something like [5184] hey X Hope Spring is treating you well [5186] wanted to check and can I still help you [5187] with this I have a fair few clients on [5188] retainer now so happy to work with that [5190] or on a per word basis as you can tell [5191] this is from my writing time let me know [5193] what you think thanks [5194] Nick this was a really cool one that I [5197] ran for quite a while where basically [5199] every time I'd get a win I had attribute [5200] that win to one of their portfolio [5203] pieces and I would always say hey X I [5205] know this is out of the blue but I just [5206] want to thank you for our work together [5207] last year I used one of our pieces in my [5209] portfolio and it won me a huge contract [5211] with big company um to be fair I didn't [5214] actually know if that won me a contract [5215] with the big company um but the [5217] portfolio piece definitely did so I just [5219] copied and pasted and copied and pasted [5220] this message like a thousand times and [5222] this got me a ton of business so you can [5224] do that as well just make sure by the [5225] way I'm just realizing anytime you use [5227] one of these templates you remove the [5228] dash Nick at the end that could be bad [5231] and then you know just like asking a [5232] little bit about their Year and that [5234] sort of deal as you can imagine it's you [5236] know you build strong relationships with [5237] these people over time right so it's [5239] important to uh ensure that they're [5241] always top of mind all right and that's [5243] that thank you guys so much for making [5245] it to the end of the video as you could [5246] tell this video took so long that it [5248] literally went from being beautifully [5250] bright and perfectly lit to pretty sad [5252] and depressing I'm going to go Retreat [5254] back in my cave in a sec but before I do [5256] that here are some closing thoughts the [5258] first is that upwork is very high Roi if [5260] you let it be and if you're diligent [5262] about it the second is that there are so [5264] many lwh hanging profile optimization [5266] fruits um that you can make in 5 minutes [5269] or so and you can solve and then [5270] completely elevate your profile to the [5272] next level so please if you haven't [5273] already already done all of those things [5275] just go back to that section it'll take [5276] you a few minutes and it will make you a [5278] lot of money over the course of the next [5279] year uh the third is that you can scale [5281] a business on upwork despite there being [5283] a ton of controversy and and Bs and [5286] nagging to the contrary you can actually [5288] do really well on this platform as long [5290] as you approach it in the right way like [5291] I showed you how frame all of this as a [5293] positive be very transparent and upfront [5295] with what you're doing people are going [5296] to like and respect you a lot more for [5298] it and then the fourth is use my [5300] templates they're in the gamma which you [5301] can find linked to the bottom of the or [5303] top of the video video description [5305] really appreciate you guys sticking it [5306] out if you guys have any questions just [5307] drop them down below as comments [5309] otherwise if you could do me a massive [5311] favor and like comment subscribe do all [5314] that fun YouTube stuff to get me to the [5315] top of the algo and I'll catch you on [5317] the next

[47] with what I've taught you in previous [48] videos You'll essentially be able to [50] make every system known to mankind in [52] make which is quite incredible in order [55] to do this I need to show you a couple [57] of things and now I don't want this to [58] be a very detailed technical [61] extraordinarily nerdy sort of video I [63] want this to be something that's [64] accessible to the vast majority of you [66] regardless of where you are in your [67] make.com journey but in order to really [69] get it and to really get that 8020 we're [72] going to have to cover a couple of [73] computer science Concepts so what I'm [75] going to do is we're going to start [76] there in a gamma slideshow and I'm going [79] to explain these Concepts then while I'm [81] explaining and after we're going to move [82] back over to make.com and I'm actually [84] going to run you through them all uh in [86] this scenario editor here so the things [88] you need to know in practice from top to [90] bottom you need to know about the two [92] different types of websites static and [93] dynamic and the differences there're in [96] you need to know a little bit about [97] parsing and how it works and then from [99] then on out I'm just going to scrape the [100] websites live in front of you both [102] static and dynamic and I'm just going to [103] do it so many times that you'll have no [105] choice but to learn how to do it this is [107] how I learned how to do this I just [108] looked over the shoulder of a friend of [110] mine that was quite good at this stuff I [111] watched a bunch of YouTube videos and I [113] basically hammered my brain into [114] submission until I knew everything that [116] I needed to know about scraping I [118] pattern matched it essentially and [119] that's what we're going to with you too [121] so let's start with the two types of [122] websites that start with this little bit [123] of theory essentially some websites are [126] statically generated and others are [128] dynamically generated I'm going to talk [129] about those just in a few seconds but [131] just keep those in mind they're static [132] websites they're Dynamic websites but we [136] take one step further back uh what the [137] hell is a website anyway well websites [140] are made up of [141] HTML H being hyper text hyper T being [146] text uh M being markup and then L being [148] language but what the the hell does that [150] mean essentially this hypertext markup [153] language is just a convention that a [156] bunch of people happen to agree on about [158] 30 years ago bunch of people got [160] together shook hands and I think the [162] guy's name was Tim something which I [163] mentioned in a previous video um but he [165] invented this hypertext markup language [167] just as a shared set of symbols that [170] everybody from then on out if they [172] wanted to put something on the Internet [174] would use in order for it to be rendered [175] nicely if you think about it logically [177] why do you need one unified language [179] well it's because because if you want to [180] build [181] infrastructure um that'll just work on [183] every computer work on every browser you [185] need to make sure that the data is being [186] represented in the same way right so [188] sort of makes sense now because the web [190] Builds on itself we've used HTML ever [193] since when HTML was made all of a sudden [195] you know a couple of months or weeks or [197] years later whatever uh some person [199] would make some change to it or they'd [201] create their own coding library that [202] would add on to HTML do something cooler [205] um and so since HTML was the beginning [207] basically everything else has just been [208] building on top of it and so now we have [210] all these crazy Frameworks and we have [212] all these styling languages and all of [214] these different approaches but at the [215] core these approaches just output HTML [217] because HTML is what everything else [219] runs on now HTML is the code but code is [222] for machines it's not what you see I'll [224] give you a quick example if we go back [226] to our scenario editor if I just I don't [228] know I'm just going to make an HTTP [229] module here the get a request and then [232] I'm just going to right click here and [233] then I'm going to press inspect this is [235] going to open up a little window on my [237] right hand side here called the Chrome [238] developer tool conso [240] and the real value in this isn't like [241] I'm not going to run you through this [242] because this that pretty complicated but [245] uh the point that I'm making here is [246] just that everything on this website [248] like literally everything on this page [250] is actually HTML and if I scroll through [252] it on the right hand side [254] here you'll see that um as I scroll [257] through some portions you'll see that [259] portions get illuminated other portions [261] don't and that's because the code here [263] actually like is referring to a specific [266] element on the page this code div class [269] equals IMT I panel space in style [272] whatever this is actually like being [274] rendered by my browser right now as we [276] speak and it's adjusting how the page [280] looks if I change this little style [282] parameter here say I want it to be 150 [285] you see how it has some Downstream [287] effect on the module [288] itself now that's the code it's not for [292] people what what's for people is this [295] right the stuff we see on the left hand [296] side the right is code that's for [298] machines the left is for us [300] so in order to convert that stuff on the [302] right into the stuff on the left um your [305] code the HTML needs to be rendered by [307] your browser there needs to be some [308] process that takes place and that's [309] really all browsers do browsers will [312] take in HTML they'll take in code and [314] then they will do some process on it and [317] then they will convert that into what we [319] see on the left hand side here so the [322] job of chrome Safari Netscape Internet [325] Explorer if uh y'all are still with me [328] is to read the HTML the web page and [330] then to turn it into something pretty [331] for human [333] beings so that's that now we need to [335] talk a little bit about clients and [337] servers and I've mentioned this in a [338] previous video on HTTP requests if you [340] guys watch that you'll already know all [341] about this but just to reiterate your [344] computer is a client okay in order to [347] access a website it needs to send a [349] request over to a server this is an HTTP [352] request a hypertext transfer protocol [354] request and what happens is it sends a [356] request to the server and inside of that [358] request it says hey how's it going I [360] want to get the full HTML of this [362] website can you send it to me can you [363] send it to this web address and the [365] server just because it they speak in a [367] very specific protocol and all this [369] stuff's been worked out many many years [371] ago um says okay great and then it sends [373] the HTML back to your computer then it's [376] rendered in your browser as we mentioned [378] earlier and then because your computer [381] screen is made up a bunch of pixels and [382] there's some relationship between the [383] pixels on the screen and the area and [385] placement of the HTML on your browser um [388] that is what allows you to visualize [390] them and you know see elements on the [392] page and drag things around and exit out [393] of them and that sort of [395] deal so we need to understand client [397] server terminology because it's used all [399] the time in web scraping and I just want [400] to make it clear that there's nothing [402] complex about it your computer's the [403] client the server is just some resource [405] out there on the cloud really it's just [407] some big rack which is running your [409] website more or [410] less let's talk a little bit about the [412] static versus Dynamic websites because [414] now we know everything that we need in [415] order to make this work static websites [417] are very easy to scrape I scraped them [419] in my previous video I've scraped them [422] hundreds of thousands of times by now um [424] and I can build a scraper for a static [425] website in less than 30 seconds flat [427] which I'll show you in a [428] moment Dynamic websites are a bit harder [431] and make.com doesn't support them [433] natively okay you can't natively scrape [436] a dynamic website using make.com you [438] need to use a third-party platform [440] luckily most of these thirdparty [441] platforms work with make.com so you can [443] just drag a little module in connect it [445] to that third party platform and [447] basically the rest of your flow is the [448] exact same in this video I'm going to [450] show you how to do both because both are [452] important now in terms of what static [454] and dynamic actually mean in this [456] context all a static website is is it [459] just means that there is literally a [461] file somewhere on a hard disk somewhere [464] right on that server with all of the [466] HTML of the website it's static because [469] it doesn't change it just exists and [472] what happens is when you send the [473] request to the server the server just [475] says oh okay great we got this file just [476] take the file here you go it's the same [478] file every time basically which is why [480] it's static it's not changing these are [483] easy to scrape as you can imagine [484] because all you have to do is you just [486] type in the URL stands for Universal [488] resource locator you pump it into your [490] make.com request module then it goes and [492] it grabs the [493] website so if I were to do this live in [495] front of you I said 30 seconds right I [498] got a couple of other sections here but [500] let me zoom in if I wanted to get the [503] data of my own website all I would do is [506] choose change this to Raw change this to [508] Jason leave everything else same then I [510] right click and I press run and if I [512] zoom in here and go to data I have all [514] of the HTML the website available to me [516] now to do stuff with I wasn't kidding [518] when I said it was easy to scrape a [519] website with make.com especially if it's [522] static if it's a dynamic website it's no [526] it's no longer just one HTML file [528] somewhere in a server what it is is the [531] website is a set of rules it's usually [534] rules in a different programming [535] language and what happens is you will [537] send your request your request will [539] include some information about who you [540] are um the type of browser you're using [543] some information you're requesting [545] whatever and then the server will take [546] that information and then it will apply [548] it to the big set of rules and then it [550] will generate HTML a new essentially and [553] then send it back to you now because the [556] HTML isn't there because it you know [558] it's something that that first of all [560] takes a little bit of time although [561] there's a big debate on what's faster um [563] server side or or server generated or [565] static generated um but first of all it [567] needs to be generated um but essentially [569] what that means is when you make the [570] request with something like make um you [572] don't actually get the the whole you [574] don't get all of the data uh you get a [576] little thing that says JavaScript is not [578] enabled for this browser or you know [580] there's nothing at this resource or you [582] just get like sort of an empty website [584] and so you can't actually scrape those [585] in make.com I can't just go back and do [587] that for you in like half a second [588] unfortunately but I'll still show you a [590] way to do so and to solve that problem [592] for you so that's the difference between [594] static and dynamic if you know that you [596] know more than 99% of people do about [598] web scraping on [600] the next thing I want to talk about and [602] really the last thing I want to talk [603] about before we can actually jump into [605] this puppy and start scraping let me [607] just move these around a little [608] bit it's bothering me uh is parsing so [613] when you scrape a website notice what we [615] did back there we typed in my website [616] left click. a then we pressed run and [619] then what did we get we got this this is [621] just a bunch of [622] HTML now HTML is nice and all but as you [626] mentioned it's not for people it's for [628] machines right it's for browser it's to [630] structure the website and all that stuff [632] realistically if I'm going to left [636] click. which is right over here my [638] website and I want to scrape something I [641] don't actually care about scraping the [642] HTML what I want to scrape is I want to [644] scrape the the page links I want to [647] scrape the description I want to scrape [649] the the testimonials I want to scrape [651] the pricing right I want to scrape the [652] case studies that's what I care about I [654] don't care about the [656] HTML the thing is [663] it's not what I wanted to do let's go oh [666] man we got a lot of tabs [675] over so in order to do that you need to [678] pull out the data from the HTML you need [681] to turn it into some type of structured [683] object or something and that's what [685] parsing is that's what parsing allows [686] you to do parsing just refers to the [688] process of breaking down the HTML into [690] its tiny little parts and then pulling [692] out the that you want so I want the [694] text I'm pulling it out I want the [695] pricing I'm looking for stuff with a [696] number sign pulling it out or I'm [698] looking for a specific element or tag or [700] div or or [702] whatnot now in the past as you can [704] imagine this is pretty difficult right [705] like you used to have to create a ton of [707] specific rules for literally every [708] element you had to you know if you [710] wanted to get like an email address you [711] had to like type an email address [713] identifier if you wanted to grab the [715] pricing you needed to like go and find [716] the specific element or the division and [718] then pump that in [720] these days it's actually really easy and [721] you can do it 99% of the time just with [723] AI you literally just say hey extract [725] this element I'm going to show you in a [726] second hey extract this element um [728] output only this element here's a whole [730] website and then it'll go and it'll find [731] it for you there's also a bunch of [733] platforms out there specifically one [734] called data for SEO that make this a lot [736] easier as well they structure the [738] outputs for you um and I'll I'll walk [740] through all of this over the course the [741] next little bit but first i'm going to [743] drink my tea because I'm realizing that [744] it's getting quite [747] cold o that is a zingy tabag all right [751] so now that we've covered all of this [752] let's actually go into scraping some [753] sites live let me actually show you what [756] this looks like what we're going to do [758] is we're going to use the HTTP module [759] just like I just did and then we're [761] going to do three examples the first is [762] we're going to scrape contact details [763] from our website so you are you have a [766] big list of websites and you're trying [767] to pull the email address of people at [770] every single one of these websites well [771] you can actually do that yourself just [773] by creating a little web scraper that [774] takes you less than 5 minutes to do [776] which I'll show you how to do in a [777] minute the next thing we're going do is [779] we're going to feed a website into um [782] our make.com flow and we're going to [784] have our flow tell us something about [786] the website it's going to convert this [788] big site into structured data using [791] artificial intelligence the value there [793] is you can use the structured data in [795] literally any other flow that you want [797] you can convert this into whatever type [799] of structure data that you want you [801] could have it tell you the number of [801] pages you could have it tell you what [803] the website is about you could have it [804] tell you the average price of the [805] service what the testimonials are about [807] what the testimonials say what what [809] they're like what sort of images are on [810] the website you could have it tell you [811] all this stuff basically then you could [814] feed that into a flow maybe to [815] personalize some Outreach to them or [817] maybe to do a competitor analysis and [819] give you a quick quick lay of the land [821] in 5 seconds or something like that the [823] last thing I'm going to do is I'm just [824] going to grab a bunch of Fiverr listings [826] Fiverr is a very popular freelance [827] platform and I just want to show you how [828] you can apply everything I'm going to [829] show you today in make.com to like [831] actually go out there and then scrape a [832] bunch of fiber listings which is a very [835] like large tabular data uh which then we [837] can use to do cool stuff with like maybe [839] you wanted to Market to each of these [840] Fiverr guys or maybe you're making a new [842] Fiverr profile and you wanted to I don't [843] know like very quickly click a few [845] buttons and then get a whole lay of the [846] land [847] again so without further Ado let's jump [850] back into our make.com scenario editor [852] as you see I was playing around with [853] this just before the video and it's kind [854] of messy and dirty and I don't really [856] like it but I do need a few of these [857] modules what I'm going to do here first [859] I'm just going to [860] delete this I'm just going to [865] delete that and then that as well [869] and then um our first example is going [871] to be scraping contact [873] details so I'm going to call this one [875] scraping contact [877] details then our second example here is [880] going to be oops it's not what I wanted [882] to do [884] um take extracting structured data right [887] which I've already done and then the [888] third [889] one let's just call this uh grabbing [893] Fiverr listings that looks [895] good it's just called a scraping Fiverr [898] and then after I'm done this I'm [899] actually going to save this blueprint [900] and give it all to y'all so you know [902] everything that I do and you can just [904] use this as like a training playground [905] if you want to all right so what [908] websites in particular are we going to [909] scrape well I was looking for a website [911] that had contact details on it and I [912] just typed in Calgary Plumbing Calgary [914] is the name of the city that Elon and uh [917] I found like 20 websites very quickly [919] using Google Maps I literally just [921] opened up the top five and like sorry [923] top the top 20 and something like uh 15 [925] out of the 20 of them had contact [926] details on them so that's great if you [928] wanted toate a scraper you can imagine [930] how you could scrape the phone number [931] really easily or you could scrape the [934] email address really easily obviously we [936] could do this manually you could pay [938] somebody in a lower cost of living [939] country a few dollars an hour to go out [941] and do this for you but you could do it [943] 100 times faster and probably with 100 [944] times better data quality honestly if [945] you just do it automatically not to [947] mention it would be like basically free [949] you know be the cost of Ops which in our [951] case would probably be like 50 cents or [953] something so let me show you how not to [956] just scrape data from this website but [957] how to scrape data from any website that [959] you feed in that's static that fulfills [961] uh the parameters that I mentioned [964] earlier all right so I'm going to go to [968] our make scenario here called scraping [969] contact details and let me just exit out [972] of this um full screen mode so I can [973] actually copy the URL the copy the URL [976] of this website is icon Plumbing so I'm [979] going to go over here paste that in the [981] very first thing we're going to do is [982] we're just going to run this the reason [984] why is because you should always run [986] your HTTP request once to see what the [988] the data looks like see if there any [990] gotas see if there's anything weird a [992] lot of the time you'll see whether it's [993] a static or dynamic website by doing [995] this um and we can obviously put in [996] rules later on that will like do this [998] for us but um this looks like a very [1000] simple static website you see there's [1003] tons of data here there's meta data [1005] right there's the title of the website [1007] right over here in these title tags if [1009] we were to scroll all the way down [1010] there'd be a bunch of text and that sort [1011] of thing now what we want is we want the [1013] email address right so basically we want [1015] to take all this and we want to feed [1016] this in then we want to grab this the [1019] problem though is right now this is a [1020] bunch of HTML and there are two issues [1022] with this one it's really long like this [1024] is 2451 characters so if we wanted to [1026] use this in some flow we'd have to [1028] consume 2451 characters worth of that [1030] flow this isn't a problem if it's like a [1032] a parser which I'll show you quickly uh [1034] in in a moment but if it's an AI then [1036] that's a problem because it's 24,000 [1038] characters it's going to cost us a fair [1039] amount every time we run this because of [1040] token [1041] usage so the first thing that we want to [1043] do is we basically just want to take all [1044] the HTML away and in order to do that [1047] I'm going to go click on this Orange [1048] module here and then click HTML to text [1051] this is going to take in all of this [1053] ugly HTML which again is not for humans [1055] it's for machines and it's just going to [1058] convert this into a bunch of [1059] text and now basically what it's going [1062] to do is it's just going to give us a [1063] bunch of links and these links are going [1064] to be in these brackets here and then [1066] it's just going to give us a bunch of [1067] text our team read our FAQs giving back [1070] Plumbing if we were to scroll all the [1072] way down here you'll see that there's [1074] all of the text on the page and most [1076] importantly if we scroll even further [1078] down you'll see that we have our email [1080] address and the email address is put in [1082] twice um just because they added a link [1084] to the email so you just give it a click [1085] and then open up your email then they [1086] also have the email address same thing [1087] with the phone [1088] number so the question now becomes how [1090] do I extract that well there's a really [1093] simple and easy way the first is AI you [1095] could do this yourself in a few seconds [1097] again I'm literally going to be building [1099] on a general purpose scrape before you [1100] that works on any static website to [1101] extract an email address and I'm going [1103] to do it live you could do this with AI [1105] literally just by clicking on your AI of [1107] choice so I'm I'm using anthropic Cloud [1109] right now because I find the quality is [1110] a little bit higher personally these [1111] days this may be different by the time [1113] you're watching this maybe gp4 is back [1115] or maybe there's some new model um I go [1117] to create a prompt over here then what I [1119] do is I'm just going to connect this I [1121] pick Claude 3.5 I make the max tokens [1124] 4096 and then all I do is I say hey let [1127] me move this over here extract the email [1129] address from the following website data [1131] output only the email address your only [1133] token should be their email address an [1135] at symbol and then their domain you [1137] don't have to use this prompt I just [1139] wanted to get this prompt right the [1140] first time because I'm not giving it any [1142] examples of what I'm looking for and [1144] then all I'm going to do is I'm going to [1145] feed in the text the [1148] website the system prompt is your a [1150] helpful intelligent web scraping [1151] assistant you find emails and don't put [1153] out you don't output anything else and [1155] that's it okay so this is going to be [1158] extract email I'm going to give this a [1161] run and let's see what happened you'll [1164] notice that this is the longest taking [1166] module here but essentially we started [1168] with our HTML right it's super long and [1170] ugly and not really meaningful to us [1172] then we went to this text parser and we [1174] made it a little bit nicer to look at [1176] but it's still not that great what we [1178] want is we just want the email and what [1180] you see is there's this text response [1182] but um variable in the output which has [1185] the email that we're looking for service [1186] iplumb [1188] doca so what we could do is we could run [1191] this and then what we could do is we [1193] could have let's say a big list [1196] of um I don't know instead of Plum let's [1199] just let's just call this like websites [1201] and then we could output the email [1204] address of every single one of these so [1207] what I'm going to do is I'm just going [1209] to use this Google sheet just for um [1211] example purposes for two or three of [1212] these is I'm going to feed in instead of [1215] me doing this on a one by one basis [1217] right this is just for testing I'm going [1219] to feed in a list of these and I'm going [1222] to have um gp4 sorry uh [1226] Claud um find the the contact details [1230] and then I'm going to have it update [1231] that same [1232] spreadsheet so the way to do this is I'm [1234] going to use a search rows module then [1236] I'm just going to map this to my [1237] specific Google sheet which I'm going to [1238] call big list of websites very [1243] fancy big list of websites there we [1248] go we're going to go sheet one and then [1251] that's that and delete the filter just [1254] click okay now if I right click on this [1256] press one sorry I think there's an error [1258] cuz I closed a little too fast I'm a [1260] little um too fast with my fingers [1263] here make sometimes needs a second there [1266] you go so I'm going to right click press [1267] run this model only and then oh sorry I [1270] didn't actually put a a website there [1272] that's my B I'm going to go back over [1274] here put a URL in and then why don't I [1278] go Calgary Plumbing again let's just see [1280] what other websites there were because I [1282] need I need at least two websites right [1283] otherwise it's going to be sort of [1285] meaningless let's go Calgary Plumbing [1288] and then why don't I go to maps and why [1290] don't I just pick like the first three [1294] plumbers let's go here we'll go website [1297] website website website okay so this is [1300] icon right okay we have another one here [1303] Mr Mike's Plumbing let's do that so I'm [1305] just going to do this in the case of two [1307] but you can imagine how you could easily [1308] scale this up to the case of 30 or 40 [1310] you can also imagine how you could [1311] easily get another scraper to um [1314] populate this and then use this to pump [1317] into our our other scraper and then you [1319] know get us all the emails so I just [1321] gave this a quick run just to make sure [1323] I could get the specific one I'm looking [1324] for and now I'm going to change the [1326] maximum number of return rows to two and [1329] if I do this it will then go through [1331] every single one of them now the flow [1333] right now is going to scrape the contact [1334] details parse the text extract the email [1337] but what I want to do is I want to [1338] update my [1340] row basically I want to take the [1342] specific row and then I want to feed [1344] that email back in [1348] so I'm going to go over here and then [1350] I'm going to call this big list of [1351] websites I'm going to map the sheet as [1353] per [1357] usual looks like it's going to rain soon [1359] that's unfortunate it's goingon to go [1361] for a lovely [1362] walk that ain't happening uh we're going [1364] to put the row number in here we're [1366] going to grab this row number from the [1367] first row that way if it gets a row for [1370] Icon Plumbing when we update it it's [1372] going to update the email address column [1375] and then we're going to grab the text [1376] response from Claude we're not going to [1378] change URL we don't need to update [1380] that okay now we're going to run this [1383] twice okay just ran once updated the [1386] column and if we go back here we'll see [1388] that why is it doing service at Icon oh [1390]  sorry I hardcoded the URL my bad my [1393] bad um let's feed in the [1395] URL [1396] classic all right and we're going to do [1398] this one more [1401] time all right icon [1404] plumbing and then General Mr Mike's [1406] Plumbing all right these areca because [1408] I'm Canada but yeah these works for for [1410] any sort of website out there now [1412] imagine if we failed in 100 of these [1414] maybe we'd get like 50 um email [1416] addresses uh you've essentially just [1417] built something that people on the [1419] internet charge hundreds or maybe [1421] thousands of dollars for if I'm being [1422] honest and as you see this is something [1424] that realistically you can build in [1425] three minutes or so very very simple and [1430] straightforward so I mentioned that this [1432] was Ai and this was kind of costly it [1434] was very easy to do and to set up but it [1436] sort of costs a fair amount of money how [1438] can we do this in the more General [1440] case well I'll show you the way that you [1442] do it in the more General case is [1444] instead of using [1446] AI right maybe you use AI really quickly [1449] to determine sorry let me just unlink [1450] this to determine whether or not the [1451] flow works and then after you actually [1453] build a dedicated infrastructure for it [1456] but the way that you do so is you use um [1459] what's called uh a reg a regex I was [1461] about to say regx but the last video [1463] where I talked about Rex I got shat on [1465] people like it's regex man I'm like I'm [1468] sorry sorry I'm [1469] Canadian uh anyway so um our reg X is [1473] just like a uh it's a pattern matcher [1476] and what it'll do is it will take in [1477] this whole string here and it will [1480] simply apply a couple of rules and it'll [1482] look for emails that are formatted like [1484] this something an at sign something else [1487] dot something else now I have one here [1491] um that I've just validated works for [1493] the vast majority of domains I've tried [1494] it on I've tried it on over 100 domains [1496] I use this one basically every time I [1497] want to do this statically um so I'm [1499] just going to copy this and put this in [1500] the description as the email regx but [1503] basically what's going to happen is I'm [1504] going to feed in the text from the [1505] previous [1507] module and let's why don't we just run [1509] this as an example first before we [1510] update the [1512] row and then it'll go through and it [1514] will do the exact same thing that we did [1516] before it's just going to go one step [1519] further and it'll also give us the name [1520] and then the domain and the reason why I [1522] split this up in a name and domain in in [1524] the regx and you'll do it too you'll get [1526] this too if you just use the same module [1528] um is by doing this uh if this is a [1531] first name I can pass this into Ai and [1533] and have it say hey check to see if this [1535] is somebody's first name if it is update [1537] the first name variable so this way I [1539] don't just get the email address I also [1541] get one additional piece of data which [1543] is their first name because a lot of [1544] people will sign off with their first [1546] name Josh at Icon Plumbing Peter left [1548] click. that sort of thing then when I [1551] put this into an email sequence now I [1552] can say hey Peter I don't have to say [1554] hello dear hiring manager [1556] whatever think you get my point so if [1559] you wanted to map this full flow out I [1561] would just feed in this to the email [1562] address module then I'd run this thing [1564] one more time and I mean you know I [1567] didn't delete the email address so it's [1568] not going to update but I think you guys [1569] get my point we just ran through the [1571] scenario one more time now in order to [1573] do this magic module you got to go to [1574] this Orange um section again and then [1576] what you need is match pattern this is [1579] the module that I selected up here and [1581] this is the one that you'll need in [1582] order to make work and basically your [1584] regex or this little code string um this [1588] goes up at the very top and then the [1590] textt that you supply goes down to the [1591] bottom if you wanted to look for [1593] multiple instances of email addresses [1595] let's say there's like five email [1596] addresses on a domain then just go [1597] Global match and turn that on I'm I was [1600] only looking for one and I was [1601] comfortable stopping after the first so [1603] that's where I stopped all right if [1605] you're still with me at this point we've [1607] done something pretty miraculous and [1608] incredible in make.com and it really [1610] took us just five or 10 minutes um I've [1612] shown you how to take a giant list of [1615] websites excuse me iterate over those [1617] websites to grab the URLs and then [1620] scrape those website HTML scrape the [1623] HTML of those websites rather feed that [1626] HTML into an HTML detex module and then [1628] extract only the thing that we want from [1630] the this system here is something that [1633] if you go on upwork or Fiverr and you [1635] say build me a system that scrapes [1637] company emails or or whatever this is [1639] basically the exact same system they're [1640] going to be building for you they might [1642] just do it in code or they might do it [1643] in make.com but it will not look as sexy [1645] as this so we did something pretty cool [1648] here but this is just the beginning of [1650] scraping because this is the simplest [1652] case and this is one of the simplest [1654] things that we could do which is to [1655] scrape contact [1657] details okay why don't we kick this up a [1660] notch as Gordon Ramsey says why don't we [1663] just add a little bit of olive oil and [1665] why don't we get some structured data [1667] from these websites instead so what do I [1670] mean by structured data well why don't [1673] we just actually use this Google sheet I [1674] wasn't planning on doing it but that'd [1676] be pretty cool iterating over stuff is [1678] way better than just like hard coding it [1680] in because this immediately shows you [1682] guys that you can apply this to other [1683] data sources which is pretty [1686] sick okay so what we're going to do in [1688] this instance is we're going to scrape [1690] the contact sorry we're going to scrape [1692] the HTML the website instead now what [1694] we're going to do is instead of getting [1695] the contact details we're going to try [1697] and get something about the site we're [1698] going to have them tell us about them [1700] we're going to have them give us a brief [1701] little summary let's say what they do [1703] and we can use that brief little summary [1704] later on and some sort of later on flow [1707] to maybe personalize some Outreach to [1710] tell us something about our competitors [1712] that sort of deal so how are we going to [1714] do this well we're going to follow the [1716] exact same structure we did up here [1718] where we have the HTML the website then [1721] we have a text parser to turn that into [1722] text and then we're going to do [1724] something else with then we're going to [1725] dump it back in our sheet so I'm going [1727] to go over to my AI module is somewhere [1731] around here I guess I deleted it let's [1732] just use the same one we did to extract [1734] the emails instead of extract email I'll [1737] say gener right [1741] summary and then if we're going to um do [1744] this we need to change the prompt so I'm [1745] just going to dive in now what I'm going [1747] to say [1748] is the following is a website is text [1753] from a website [1755] scrape in Json return a summary of the [1763] website [1764] um well I mean we're probably not going [1766] to be able to do who because most [1768] websites don't have that name but maybe [1770] like what the website [1772] does okay why don't we do this we'll say [1774] what the website [1782] does and their key value [1787] props return in this format we're going [1790] to say [1792] um [1795] description uh and then we'll go double [1798] quotes if you haven't seen my previous [1799] tutorial on Json I recommend it then [1802] we're going to do [1805] um maybe we'll just do description and [1808] then we'll do value [1810] props then I'll just say value props go [1813] here and then description goes here the [1815] reason why I'm doing this [1817] um is because I don't want it to like [1819] output a bunch of sub things like a [1822] bunch of sub objects or [1825] whatnot I'll say don't output anything [1828] but the [1832] Json okay great and then I'm just going [1834] to feed in if you think about it um I'm [1836] just going to feed in the oh jeez you [1838] know I forgot to parse the text my bad [1841] let me go over here grab this paste that [1843] in you guys are probably watching for [1845] the last minute with like a palm in your [1847] face okay let's turn that into text [1849] first let's feed that in here okay great [1854] and then I'll say your helpful [1855] intelligent web scraping [1856] assistant you extract data and only [1859] output Json [1862] awesome okay now let's see how this [1864] works on our first [1868] example we got to do a couple more [1869] things to make this flow functional but [1871] I'm going to walk you through [1873] regardless okay as we see here um we got [1877] a pretty intense or deep description of [1879] what's going [1880] on and this looks good to [1882] me looks like they have eight different [1885] Valley props honestly a lot but whatever [1888] the thing is sorry for zooming in and [1890] out in so fast um this is in Json format [1892] and we want to convert this into a [1893] format that we can actually use so to do [1895] this what you need to do is click on [1897] this little button type Json find that [1899] and then use parse [1900] Json what you want to feed in as the [1902] input is this text response this will [1904] parse it and turn it into mappable [1906] fields that we can use later on I'll [1909] show you what I mean in a second let me [1911] unlink this let me click [1913] run now instead of our output being text [1915] our output is going to be a bunch of [1917] nicely structured Json that we can [1919] massage and do whatever the heck we want [1920] with see this there was that nicely [1923] formatted Json I was mentioning now what [1925] we can do is we can feed that back into [1927] our sheet and then I don't know maybe [1929] instead of email or why don't we do this [1930] uh we'll do [1931] description and then we'll do value [1935] propositions right and what we're going [1937] to do is we're going to take the same [1939] data we're going to update the row [1940] number which I grab here and then we're [1944] not going to update email address what [1945] we're going to update is we're going to [1946] grab description and then value props [1948] note that these don't have headers [1950] because I need to update the module but [1951] I know that it's still column C and [1953] column d right column C column D um so [1956] the scenario is still going to work [1958] regardless and what I want to do is I [1960] want to go back here and change the [1961] maximum number of return rows to two [1963] because I wanted to iterate over all of [1964] my [1965] data okay let's give this a quick little [1970] run looks like we got number one [1973] done we got number two done wonderful [1976] now I'm not going to stretch these out [1977] super wide but I hope it's clear that we [1981] got descriptions of all these companies [1983] and we also got the value propositions [1985] and you know we could do some better [1986] training of the model or better examples [1988] to avoid the fact that this one has a [1989] one in it and this one doesn't right [1991] this one's listing them sort of 1 2 3 [1992] four 5 this one doesn't this one isn't [1995] but uh it's not that big of a deal as of [1996] right now I think you guys get where I'm [1997] coming from and that's the most [1998] important [2000] thing all right so that is number two [2003] why don't we do number three now which [2004] is to grab a bunch of Fiverr listings [2006] now Fiverr seems pretty int ating for a [2008] lot of people right I mean oh I guess I [2010] already got it right over here um [2012] because it's pretty big and pretty [2014] jam-packed freaking website if I'm [2015] honest a lot of people think that make [2017] doesn't work for this well I'll show you [2019] that it does when I go to digital [2021] marketing here just going to click off [2024] and let's just hypothetically say we [2025] want to scrape this digital marketing [2026] page um why don't we go to social media [2029] marketing specifically and we just want [2031] to like I don't know get a bunch of [2032] these and then do something with them so [2035] I'm going to give this a copy and then [2037] I'm going to go back to scraping Fiverr [2038] I'm just going to feed this in as the [2041] URL and then I'm going to scrape this [2045] text and then I'm going to use Ai and [2048] we're not using parsers here because I [2050] just want to be able to do this quickly [2051] you can imagine now you could build [2052] parsers to extract the various pieces of [2054] information you wanted [2056] to and let's see what sort of data we [2059] have here I think we have the [2061] name I think we have the I don't know if [2064] we'll be able to grab the level can we [2065] grab the level I don't think so because [2067] the this level two is it a design or oh [2071] no no no okay no we we actually can't [2072] grab level so let's grab the name the [2075] level and let's grab the title and then [2078] the cost let's do that so let's scrape [2081] all [2084] these name the level of the freelancer [2089] the title of the job and the [2093] cost return in this format we'll go name [2097] name goes here we'll go [2100] level we'll go level goes here we'll go [2104] uh title we'll go title goes here and [2107] then we'll go cost and then we'll go [2110] cost goes here I think my Jason's right [2112] I don't know for sure so I'm going to go [2113] to Json formatter give this thing a [2115] little paste and then I'm going to click [2117] format okay looks good to me go back [2120] here and just make it look nice and [2121] pretty and then as input I'm going to [2123] feed in this text parser so this is just [2125] sort of a a little test we're going to [2127] see how this works first um and I'm not [2129] going to attach it to a Google sheet or [2130] anything all I'm going to do is I'm [2131] going to grab the parsejson module [2133] attach it and I'll just show you guys [2134] that you can do cool stuff with this dat [2136] and actually why don't we also do one [2137] more thing let's set set a [2140] variable to we'll put that at the very [2142] end for now I'm just going to say x is [2144] equal to [2146] Y okay um looks like we oh sorry about [2150] that I did not map the correct data [2152] because I haven't actually used this yet [2153] and I mapped that I think no I didn't [2156] need to map the text response here [2158] awesome let's give this k a little run [2161] through let's see what happens so we [2163] just scraped Fiverr we got a 200 request [2165] and we got a ton of HTML it's very very [2167] long right odds are when I see HTML [2169] that's this long I got what I needed [2171] okay it looks like there was an issue [2173] here but that's all right um the next [2175] thing is we converted all that to text [2177] it's still hella [2178] long the next thing is we generated a [2181] summary of that [2183] text it looks like we only got one [2188] one person which kind of sucks I think [2192] it's because the input was way too [2194] long yeah so I think the input was a [2197] little too long um and we probably need [2199] to train this a little bit if we want to [2200] 36,000 tokens I'm be paying that bill [2203] pretty soon uh it was so long that it [2205] actually screwed up and provided the [2206] Json so yeah that's not very good okay [2209] so when we scrape a data resource that's [2211] this long what we basically need to do [2213] is we need to find a way to slice this [2217] data into subsections and so that's what [2219] I'm going to do here I'm going to find a [2220] way that I can slice this data which is [2223] super crazy long into subsections and [2225] then feed in that subsection um [2228] iteratively into uh the thing that I'm [2230] I'm looking for [2232] okay so let's see here we got a bunch of [2235] categories okay seller details all right [2238] sort by best okay so first of all we [2241] don't need anything above uh yeah we [2243] don't need anything above sort by [2245] bestselling so the very first thing I'm [2246] going to do is I'm I'm going to grab [2249] this and then I'm going to add another [2251] module [2255] here Zoom this out a bit I'll use the [2258] set variable [2262] module uh and you know what let's [2263] actually do two set variable modules [2265] here and first I'm just going to call [2269] this split um [2274] header I'm going to feed this in and [2276] then I'm just going to split this entire [2278] thing by this text sort by bestselling [2281] so I'm going to feed in oh sorry the [2284] name should not be this uh this should [2285] just be let's just say [2288] Sellers and then I'm going to split this [2291] by the text sort by bestselling I know [2293] this looks kind of weird right now but [2295] in order to test this I'm going to [2297] download the output bundles copy all of [2299] this then I'm just going to run this [2303] paste in all of that text and I'll just [2304] see if I can turn this into two okay [2306] great I can turn this into too notice [2308] how the second part is a lot [2312] easier wonderful um that looks pretty [2316] good to me now that I've done this what [2319] we need to do and let me actually just [2320] split into [2322] sellers is I'm going to wrap this in a [2324] get I'm only going to grab the second [2326] result of that array and then I'm just [2328] going to add a different a second [2329] variable here just for Simplicity in [2330] reality I would not actually normally do [2332] this I would just do it all in in one [2333] module but what I'm going to do now that [2335] I have all of this is I'm going to look [2337] at the text I'm going to look for a way [2338] that I could scrape [2340] this sorry that I could separate this it [2342] looks like there are two new lines here [2345] and it looks like if I were to look for [2347] these new [2348] lines there are 21 on this [2351] page so I bet you if I were to split [2355] this whole thing [2357] sellers by new line new [2361] line I would get 21 [2365] different um results [2368] then for each of those 21 results I [2369] would feed that into [2377] Jason and then we should be able to get [2380] exactly what we're looking for here okay [2383] let's give this a quick little [2385] try and I actually don't need this okay [2389] give this a run and we'll see how our [2391] wonderful Fiverr scraper which I [2392] developed in five minutes is five [2395] minutes for Fiverr [2397] looks like the source is not valid Jason [2399] there's probably a reason [2401] why H okay no the splitting didn't [2403] didn't work actually uh why didn't the [2406] splitting work that's [2407] interesting we grabbed the [2410] data which looks like it did work oh I [2413] know why it's because when you feed in [2415] new lines um it actually into a set [2419] variable module it actually parses them [2420] this is a a very much like a gotcha in [2423] make uh so you need to instead of [2426] splitting by the back slash n where the [2429] heck is this you actually need to split [2431] by the presence of an Elon and I think I [2433] need to split by two I'm not sure we're [2434] going to give it a try I wonder how many [2435] times I could scrape fiber before they [2436] rate limit me okay I had to take a [2438] little break there just to work out the [2439] logic but uh just finish it up going to [2441] give it a quick run here and we're just [2444] going to grab the first record um so [2446] that we we got an output uh okay so [2450] essentially what I did was nothing [2451] changed to the scraping module same [2453] thing nothing changed to the text [2455] parsing module same thing um what I'm [2457] doing here is we're getting splitting [2459] the text sorting by best selling so [2461] nothing changed there I'm then splitting [2463] these by the presence of a new line plus [2465] a new line you don't actually need this [2467] plus I find I think make just like [2469] inserted that for me um and then what I [2471] did is I changed the prompt here um to a [2473] couple of things one I said do not [2475] output anything but Jason your first [2476] token should be this I also said of [2478] there multiple records return the first [2480] this is just sort of a quick and dirty [2481] hack um you could also add a pre-step [2483] here where you preformat multiple [2485] records into one record and then just [2486] iterate through them and then I just [2488] gave it like one example of what I [2489] wanted to do uh basically if you want a [2491] a to work for you just give it an [2492] example it'll eliminate 99% of the BS so [2495] I gave it an example um then feeding in [2497] the split text and then I changed the [2500] system prompt so it includes your first [2501] character is always that what you end up [2503] with that is um you'll feed in the the [2506] text and then you'll get an output um [2509] you know in Json as a result which is [2511] quite nice so we have it right there and [2513] then when you feed that into the parse [2514] Json module right just the the pure text [2516] response what you get get is you get [2518] these variables which then you can later [2519] use to you know fill out a spreadsheet [2521] or something like that so uh yeah you [2524] know I can follow the exact same flow [2525] that I've done here with the Google [2526] Sheets I'm not going to just for brevity [2527] and I want to make sure this video isn't [2528] like 17 hours long but I think you guys [2530] get my point you can scrape more or less [2531] any data source that you want as long as [2534] it's static um sorry you can scrape any [2537] data source you want with the HTTP [2538] request module as long as it's static [2540] and it doesn't really matter how complex [2542] it is um we saw examples from getting [2545] like one piece of data from one website [2547] to getting you know multiple pieces of [2548] data um from you know like a more [2551] grandiose uh typically like secure [2553] website like Fiverr which if you sort of [2555] think about it like logically speaking [2557] should be one of the highest security [2558] websites just given the volume and that [2559] sort of thing but that is static [2562] websites if you made it up until this [2563] point congrad you freaking relations [2565] we're now going to dive into Dynamic [2566] websites which are similar they're [2568] really not that different um all we have [2570] to do is that initial scraping step [2572] where we get the HTML like right over [2574] here we just have to replace that module [2575] essentially or we have to fill it in [2577] with some type of like API um call to a [2580] service that does this for us so you [2582] know I mentioned that the majority of [2583] websites are static nowadays and that's [2585] just because static websites are faster [2586] to load and typically less complicated [2588] for small to midsize businesses if you [2590] are starting I don't know like a [2591] plumbing store for instance you're [2592] probably not going to go with some big [2594] Dynamic single page application you're [2596] not going to need a bunch of database [2597] logic you're not going to need to do any [2598] of that stuff um there are Frameworks [2600] out there like View and react that do [2602] all this crap for you sorry um there are [2605] Frameworks out there like nextjs and n [2607] .js um which sort of just like do the [2609] static Generation stuff for you if you [2611] have a coder doing it um if you're doing [2613] like WordPress nowadays I'm pretty sure [2614] the vast majority of Wordpress uh [2616] websites are rendered to static Pages uh [2619] you know basically any other major um [2621] website platform is going to be doing [2622] that which is quite nice the only real [2624] instance in which you need Dynamic [2626] websites are usually when you're [2626] developing like some type of Enterprise [2628] or big or like multi-million dollar [2630] application one where you really need to [2632] format the data that's coming in you [2634] need to like have the rules of that HTML [2637] I'll be different maybe for different [2638] users depending on different places in [2639] the world or depending on like very [2642] short-term updates you want to make to [2643] your application with it displays and [2645] that sort of thing so that's a mouthful [2647] but essentially I just mean it's harder [2649] but it's certainly doable um your data [2651] source instead of being the HTP request [2653] module is just going to be um apify [2655] which is a thirdparty scraping tool [2657] which I talk about quite often on this [2658] platform I love it it's amazing they [2660] also give you $5 of like free Tri [2661] credits uh which last for me anyway for [2664] like the last couple of months or you [2666] can use hidden apis I've talked about [2668] hidden apis in a previous video I'm just [2670] going to like Drop That and Link that [2671] down below um I'm also going to mention [2674] this really quickly um in the next [2676] module in the next page so um you know [2679] if you guys want more information on if [2680] you want like a full guide just [2681] dedicated to Hidden apis then check that [2684] out any who the rest of the flow is [2685] going to be the same I got two examples [2686] here similar to the three examples [2688] previously um where we had the icon [2690] Plumbing my own website and then Fiverr [2692] what I'm going to be doing here is I'm [2693] going to be scraping these two cryptoart [2695] and billybilly so I'm just going to open [2697] up crypto art over here and I think you [2698] guys will kind of get the idea it's an [2700] nftr collection that tells the history [2701] of ethereum very cool painting 9,893 all [2705] these blocks like look it's like a super [2708] deep art piece here and you can I guess [2710] buy a bunch of these abstract um [2712] geometric shapes and and that sort of [2714] thing I personally uh did not get into [2716] the nft craze I mean calling it a craze [2719] but I know a ton of people did make a [2720] ton of legit money on it but I [2722] personally didn't really get into it so [2724] my knowledge stops here looks pretty [2725] freaking cool let's hypthetically say we [2727] wanted to scrape this resource how are [2729] we going to do it well first things [2731] first I'm going to just duplicate like [2733] for the purposes of this I'm just going [2735] to duplicate these [2736] two and I'll go down here I'm going to [2739] call this for [2742] scraping uh what is it crypto [2745] art and then I'm going to move the [2747] schedule here I'll paste oops that's not [2750] what I want to do I got to paste in this [2751] URL I'm going to get it and the reason [2753] I'm doing this is just to show you if I [2755] right click and press run module only um [2757] this is what I get so doc type HTML blah [2759] blah blah I get the title of the website [2761] which is nice I get the meta description [2763] which is nice but then I get basically [2765] absolutely nothing else and this is more [2766] or less what's going to happen if you [2768] are loading a dynamically generated [2769] website like this you're not going to [2771] get the stuff that you're looking for [2773] you're just going to get a wrapper right [2774] you're just going to get like um [2775] everything that goes around that HTML so [2778] that's unfortunate we can't actually [2780] scrape this there's no real data here [2781] like for instance um painting number [2783] four like if I look at painting number [2785] four there's no number four here there's [2787] no text that represents that number four [2788] meaning that we just haven't gotten the [2790] HTML yet U basically what happens is [2792] after you load this page there's some [2793] JavaScript on the page there's some [2795] function that calls that database or [2797] receives it and then and then the code [2798] of the website is built uh we don't [2800] really have that yet which is why we [2801] can't access it all right so how exactly [2802] do you go about doing this with apify [2804] well it's pretty easy just go to apify [2808] Doom sign in here I got a free plan [2811] account with like $5 worth of tokens or [2814] something then go to store and then type [2817] in web scraper that's the one that you [2820] want and then what you want to do here [2822] is just type in the URL the website this [2824] is just an example so I'll show you how [2825] to do it with one and then we can talk [2826] about how to do it with multiple [2827] websites and then you need a little bit [2829] of code in order for this to work like [2831] if you want to store the page HTML you [2832] do need some code um what I do is I just [2836] copied some code from another one so I'm [2838] going to do this and I'll say page HTML [2842] so what you need is you need to [2843] basically say const page HTML equals [2846] document do doent element. outerhtml [2848] what this is going to do is it's going [2850] to in JavaScript the document is just [2853] the entire object of the page the page [2855] instance document element is just a way [2857] to select a particular element on the [2859] page and outer HTML is just the selector [2862] of the whole page is outer HTML um so [2864] that's HTML including the HTML tag which [2866] is important what we want to do is we [2867] just want to return this too so I'm just [2869] going to go down here and then just go [2872] page [2873] HTML this is now the function of the [2875] page this is now going to run this code [2877] basically every time it works through [2878] what we want it to work through uh which [2880] is pretty sick so then all you do is you [2882] press start and it's actually going to [2884] go out there and it's going to run the [2886] website and then deliver all of the code [2888] to us which is pretty cool when this [2889] happens you're going to see the memory [2891] go from 0 to 4 gigabytes that's totally [2893] normal this is now just running the [2894] scraper and you only have a certain [2896] number of me or amount of memory that's [2897] allotted to you uh and so by doing this [2900] um apfi is just letting you know that [2902] hey man you got something going on right [2903] now uh we're going to wait until it [2905] finishes [2907] you then obviously have a bunch of uh [2910] console log things so it's going through [2912] this and then what we want to do is I'm [2915] going to go to [2915] Output we're going to do Json and then [2919] notice this um item right here HTML head [2922] blah blah this is the one that we want [2925] so just going to export both of these [2928] results in [2930] Json and I'm just going [2933] to actually I don't want to export the [2935] results on my do I'm just going to [2936] preview them [2938] okay and now if we type number four oops [2941] um painting number four now if we type [2944] number four notice how we actually get [2946] the painting number four that we didn't [2947] get before um this is just all the code [2949] for the whole website so since we're [2951] outputting it here we can now get it in [2953] in make.com as well like we're we're not [2955] limited to doing this in apify I just [2957] showed you how to do this manually apify [2959] just to show you how this works um all [2961] you have to do is click on this little [2962] button go to apify and then watch actor [2965] runs that's what you're looking for and [2966] then you do have to connect your hook so [2968] you have to like connect apify to um [2971] make.com it's really simple they have an [2973] API key just type in apify API [2976] key actually no I don't even think you [2978] need the API key sorry you literally [2979] just go here no no you do you go here [2982] you click connection add and then you [2984] add in your API token yeah I just [2985] realized I don't have it so let's [2986] actually do this for me it's probably [2988] the best way to show [2989] you going to want to copy this and then [2993] actually you know what I'm going to [2995] add oh weird I don't know if I have the [2998] ability to do [3000] this oh yeah I can uh this one's just [3002] going to be called like uh YouTube [3004] example just that I remember to change [3006] it or delete it later I'm going to copy [3008] this and then we're going to go back [3010] here I'm just going to paste in this is [3011] going to be called like Nick left [3015] click okay cool save wonderful wonderful [3020] then we go to actor and all I want is I [3021] want that web scraper that I had a [3022] second so apify web scraper right give [3024] that a click save [3027] now the other thing you need to do is go [3028] to apify and then you need to get data [3030] set [3032] items for whatever reason apify splits [3034] this into two different parts there's um [3036] the watch actor run which is the trigger [3038] and then this actually helps you get the [3040] specific items like the ones that we saw [3042] earlier and and in order to get this [3044] just go to search items type in data set [3045] and you want default data set ID format [3048] Json limit 100 all that stuff is [3051] cool um and then now we can actually run [3053] our [3054] flow uh I'm just going to go back into [3057] apify for now and then go to the [3061] specific actor in question which is web [3063] scraper I think I have some code here [3065] that like adds an extra example so I'm [3068] not actually going [3070] to add that in I don't [3074] think yeah I don't think I'm going to do [3076] that I think I can just delete this and [3077] it should be fine um and basically what [3079] I'm doing right now is I'm running this [3080] manually so I'm running this like myself [3083] um but you can also run this using apify [3086] and Jason what you would do is you would [3088] go over here then you'd go run an [3092] actor actually first you'd run the actor [3095] maybe you do that in a different [3101] scenario um you know so You' go web [3104] scraper and then you would go here to [3108] where were we right here and you just [3111] copy all this Json you paste it in here [3113] oops sorry should be good right here um [3116] and this is [3119] uh I know this doesn't look very well [3122] formatted we might be able to format [3123] this better if we go to Jason format let [3125] me [3126] see yeah it doesn't really format it [3128] because of all these new lines but [3129] that's all right um You you feed this [3130] input Json in and then what you want is [3133] uh where it says crypto art. this is [3136] where you'd feed in your list of URLs um [3138] and notice how this is an array in Jason [3141] so all you would do is you just feed in [3142] a big list of URLs formatted just like [3144] this then you'd be able to run it you [3145] run it in a different scenario and then [3146] you catch it in this scenario so I'm [3148] just going to catch it in this scenario [3149] for Simplicity um but what I'm going to [3151] do is I'll I'll watch the ACT runs I'll [3152] get the data set it so I'm going to [3153] click go over [3156] here go save and [3159] start and the same thing's going to [3161] happen so on the leftand side here where [3163] it says memory you're going to see that [3164] it's going to go up to 4 gabt um and [3166] then it's going to go through that whole [3167] scraping procedure I did remove a little [3169] bit of code um so just going to double [3172] check that that works um we may have [3174] like referenced the URL after or [3176] something [3177] yeah it says one succeeded I go to [3179] Output I have the output here what I'm [3181] doing now in make because I'm watching [3183] that actor run awesome looks like it [3185] finished and then in here I got the uh I [3189] got the page HTML and this page HTML [3192] object all right so that's pretty [3193] straightforward now that we have it [3195] inside a make what do we do well it's [3197] pretty simple hella zooming got a love [3200] the Zoomies we'll um put this back here [3203] and we'll feed in that page HTML item [3206] now because I don't want to wait for [3208] this to run again I'm just going to copy [3209] this whole thing oh boy this is long as [3212] a hell I'm just going to copy this whole [3214] thing just for the purposes of this [3215] demonstration it's the exact same thing [3217] as if I just left this in here and ran [3218] it one more time but I'm just going to [3220] oh actually you know what no I'm not [3222] going to do that I'm going to go back to [3223] page HTML then I'm actually just going [3225] to hardcode the data set ID instead that [3228] way I can still actually like run this [3229] module and it's not going to be total [3231]  uh unlink we'll go back here [3233] okay now we're going to run [3235] this and not notice that now what we [3237] have is the exact same thing that we had [3238] before we have like a text Data [3241] essentially um so that's pretty valuable [3243] as you can imagine and now we can do [3245] whatever the heck we want with this um I [3246] don't really know what we want to do [3247] with this if I'm honest maybe we just [3249] wanted to tell us something about the [3250] website again so why don't we just copy [3253] these two [3254] here and even though this is a dynamic [3261] website um even though this is a dynamic [3264] website right should only output Jason [3267] but I guess we're going to find [3269] out and then this for9 text response uh [3272] even though it's a dynamic website we [3273] can now scrape it fully so we don't have [3276] to worry about whatever [3278] happened um you know uh I received a [3280] couple one of the reasons I'm doing this [3282] video is cu I received a couple [3283] questions on my last one like hey like [3284] for some reason when I do this I don't [3285] see the HTML on the website well this is [3289] how you do it um you can have two routes [3291] you could theoretically you wanted to [3292] scrape any website use this first route [3295] here where you feeding the URLs and then [3297] try getting the structured data using [3298] HTTP requests and then if you end up [3300] getting data that's maybe less than a [3302] certain length or maybe you feed this [3304] into Ai and say hey is there HTML here [3306] if no then return no if yes then return [3309] yes then you just use a router and you'd [3311] split it into um static website or [3313] dynamic website if it it's a dynamic [3315] website then you run an apify actor and [3318] in another scenario you catch the result [3319] and do what I just did over here um and [3321] that's how you you know go through the [3323] the dynamic arm uh you can also use a a [3326] few other services for this there's one [3327] called data for SEO data for SEO is [3330] pretty good in my community um [3331] everybody's now talking about [3333] it people really really love this stuff [3337] um and essentially the way that it works [3338] is just G to close you Nikita [3342] oops so sorry Nikita we share the same [3345] name how could I do this to you uh yeah [3349] so this is just like a powerful API [3351] stack for SEO purposes it'll basically [3353] allows you to run like what I just ran [3356] and apify I'm just doing it through one [3359] single module in make.com um it's [3361] reasonably straightforward they have a [3363] little portal which you can [3365] access [3367] here just go back [3369] here um where you have a certain balance [3371] they give you like a free dollar or [3372] something like that I apparently have [3374] like five years or four and a half years [3376] left and then all you need to do to [3378] connect this to make is just go through [3380] their API [3381] documentation which you can find inside [3383] of the data for scr module when you try [3384] and connect it and then you just need to [3385] put in a username and password literally [3387] the simplest authentication I've ever [3388] seen in my life and then the module that [3390] you want is you want pars uh parse page [3392] content right over [3394] here and this this is just another way [3396] to do the same thing U but you'll see [3398] the output is going to be a little bit [3399] different so what's this website [3400] cryptoart just going to copy this URL [3402] pasted in here and you're just going to [3404] click emulate browser rendering yes um [3406] what you're going to see is when I run [3408] this I'm not going to get the code of [3409] the page I'm actually going to get the [3410] parse text already it sort of does both [3412] of these things in one so I receive a [3414] tasks array big ID [3416] path this is just the endpoint path so [3419] V3 slon pagecontent parsing live again [3422] some API just return a ton of [3423] information to you whether or not it's [3425] particularly relevant here's a bunch of [3427] data and then you here you have the [3429] result the result is what matters so we [3431] have an items array inside of the data [3433] and we have a one and then page content [3435] Jesus Lord this is nested what you want [3438] is the secondary topic it's an array [3439] with 20 items and this is just all of [3442] the data on the page that I found so [3444] this is just the text Data it literally [3446] just goes and finds the text for you you [3448] don't actually have to do the whole text [3450] HTML thing that I talked about earlier [3452] the problem is you'll notice that this [3453] is a barried an array with 20 elements [3456] you can actually cheat um and just do [3457] all of this without having to iterate 20 [3459] times uh the simplest way to do it the [3461] one that I personally do is I go to Json [3463] and then I go transform to Json what [3465] I'll do is I'll feed in the object that [3467] I want and the object that I want is [3469] this page content element and now if I [3472] run this look at what happens [3476] it's going to go grab the website it's [3478] going to do the loading and then voila [3480] now I have a ton of HTML here instead so [3484] um this is the same thing basically [3486] sorry ton of HTML ton of Json instead so [3489] now now I have a bunch of Json and what [3491] you what can you do with the Json well [3492] now you can just feed all this stuff [3493] into AI just in one shot so instead of [3495] having to iterate over 20 different [3496] elements and trying to extract data from [3498] each now you just feed it into AI you [3499] say hey here's a bunch of Json from a [3501] website you know from a website scraper [3502] which does the parsing for us uh just [3504] like extract the following elements from [3506] it or you could try parsing it manually [3508] too if you really wanted to presumably [3510] I'm looking for something to do with [3511] painting so here's the painting one [3513] painting two it's buried within an hcore [3515] title object you could do a lot with [3516] this but I'm not going to hit the nail [3518] over the head a million one times but [3521] okay so that's how you do it with crypto [3523] art how about this other website Billy [3524] Billy uh looks like Billy Billy I [3526] actually I don't even know what language [3528] that is geez I need to work on my Asian [3532] knowledge um I think that's Chinese but [3535] I [3537] maybe like offending like a quarter [3541] billion people if it's [3543] Korean I don't know probably more than a [3545] quarter billion what's the population of [3547] Korea it's really really interesting 51 [3550] that's it 51 million why did I think [3553] there were so many more people living in [3555] Korea well I guess that's South Korea so [3558] with North Korea it's 76 but anyway um [3562] whatever it is a lot of the people on [3563] here like anime and let's say you wanted [3565] to scrape that damn I'm going to copy [3567] this URL we're going to go back here and [3569] we're just going to give this a try [3571] using uh one of these HTTP request [3574] modules also let me just [3577] um name these um scraping crypto art I [3581] think this one's also scraping crypto [3585] art we'll just do like data for SEO I [3589] I'm just going to give you all of these [3590] modules and this one here uh I'm just [3593] going to use as an example to show you [3594] what happens when you try and scrip [3596] scrape Billy Billy without a like [3599] browser on page automation so I got a uh [3602] sorry [3603] browser whatever the heck it's called Uh [3607] Dynamic like web scraping service so I [3609] just ran this um and then I got if you [3613] scroll down here I got a ton of website [3616] data but you'll notice the vast majority [3618] of this is just like svgs and stuff like [3619] that I'm not actually getting like a lot [3621] of the text on the website that I want [3622] to get unfortunately it's sort of [3624] dynamic and um looks like I do get some [3627] card information here um and in [3629] hindsight picking a service whose [3631] language I do not understand may or may [3633] not have been the best choice here neck [3635] um but that's okay I'll show you how to [3636] do the exact same thing assuming this is [3638] a dynamic website just using apify [3640] instead as you can imagine nothing [3643] different from what we've already done [3645] just going to copy all of this paste all [3648] of this here okay so scraping Billy [3649] Billy uh for the purpose of this I'm [3651] just going to assume that we ran this in [3652] like um another flow and I'm just going [3654] to run this manually myself so I'm going [3656] to go over here grab the URL paste the [3658] URL in here and then I'm going to click [3660] save and start it's now going to go [3662] through the website and find me some [3663] stuff um what I'm going to do while this [3666] is [3668] working I'm just going to click run once [3670] because I really want to get the oh [3672] sorry you know what I'm actually using [3674] the wrong data set items uh oh that's [3677] rough I'm using the hardcoded data set [3679] items from the previous run is that [3682] going to be a problem no that's not [3683] going to be a problem all right so so [3686] it's just running right now um and it [3687] just uh I think it just finished I [3689] believe not 100% sure yeah it just [3692] finished and we go to Output we get a [3694] bunch of HTML on the website as well so [3696] that's nice uh what I want just for the [3697] purpos of the demonstration is I want [3699] this default data set ID I'm just going [3701] to go back here I'm just going to feed [3702] the default data set ID and the only I [3704] just want the most recent item so I'm [3705] going to set limit to one okay so what [3707] I'm going to do in this example is I'm [3709] just going to generate a summary again [3711] and I skipped ahead a bit just cuz I had [3712] some prompt finagling to do the impr [3714] prompt is I dragged in the open AI or [3716] sorry Cloud uh module here then it says [3719] the following is a text from a website [3721] scrape and Jason return a summary of the [3722] website what they do how they do it [3724] let's just do that and the language if [3727] the website is in another language make [3728] sure to write the summary in English [3729] return in this format then I have don't [3731] output anything but the Json because I [3734] like telling robots what to do [3736] clearly and uh I just clicked run once I [3739] got the data set items and now it's [3740] going to generate the summary and it [3743] gave me an example description here [3744] along with the language which may be [3746] useful if you're doing I don't know some [3748] type of parasite campaign where you're [3749] going um to content in different [3751] languages and you're attempting to [3752] reproduce the content in another [3753] language you can imagine how that might [3755] make sense for markets that are a lot [3756] less saturated than let's say the [3758] English or the Chinese markets um you [3760] know I mean how many people on planers [3762] speak English [3765] right uh 400 million 1.5 billion to two [3769] billion and then there are 1.3 billion [3771] Chinese speakers what if you tried to I [3773] don't know convert that into Vietnamese [3776] um well now you have 86 million people [3777] which is I don't know one 15th of of [3781] English so you could easily do like a [3783] parasite campaign where you're [3784] translating content on a website from uh [3786] Chinese or English to maybe Vietnamese [3788] or something and then populating it on [3789] your own uh you could also just have it [3791] yeah you could have it just translated [3792] word for word you could have it tell you [3793] specifically about what page was posted [3795] the most recently as you can imagine [3797] there are like a million one things that [3799] are possible but that is how you scrape [3801] Dynamic websites Live Hope you guys [3802] appreciated that tutorial um really [3806] really love the ability to scrape both [3808] static and dynamic and I think that any [3810] like worthwhile web scraping solution is [3812] just going to have routes that handle [3814] both so you're going to have a route [3815] that handles um presumably static [3818] websites and then if it doesn't work out [3820] can have that second like filter that [3822] allows you to call a dynamic service [3824] like this to do it instead for you I [3825] wouldn't just scrape everything using [3827] this Dynamic Services simply because it [3829] probably be pretty cost prohibitive at [3830] higher um operation counts higher lists [3833] that's okay all right all right the last [3836] thing I want to talk about to really [3837] make this a master class I want to talk [3838] a little bit about hidden apis what are [3840] hidden apis well you know how right now [3843] we're scraping HTML if you think about [3844] HTML is the output of some process [3847] specifically in the case of dynamic [3848] websites essentially what happens is the [3850] dynamic website will go through that [3851] list of rules on the server and it will [3853] use that to generate the HTML for us [3855] well part of the list of rules will be [3857] like the data that it wants to show you [3859] so maybe its U uh directory website like [3861] Billy Billy presumably all of those [3864] fields are stored somewhere in a [3865] database anyway and what's happening [3866] when you access billyb billy.com is [3869] there's some function that goes out [3870] calls the database elements and then [3871] uses that to populate the HTML well how [3874] cool would it be if you could just grab [3875] the database elements directly instead [3877] of having to do all this BS you could [3878] literally just go out and then get [3880] everything in perfectly format at Json [3883] I'll show you how to do so using an [3884] example um what I'm going to do is I'll [3886] do this in [3888] Loom because Loom actually has a hidden [3890] API uh this was just some roast that I [3892] did to one of the members of the [3893] community as you see here I was pretty [3896] freaking Tire wow I don't know if I've [3897] ever looked like that much of a [3900] douchebag that's so funny uh anyway so [3903] I'm going to hold shift command and C [3906] I'm going to right click on the page and [3908] then press view page Source oops I lied [3911] right click on the page and press [3912] inspect what inspect is going to do is [3914] it's going to open up this menu on the [3916] right these Chrome Dev tools uh we don't [3918] need this first page what we need is we [3919] need the network tab over here what I [3922] want to do is I I basically just want to [3923] refresh this page want to see what loads [3927] what you'll notice what loads is ton of [3929] these graph ql calls so basically every [3932] line here this is a resource that is [3934] being grabbed using a network request [3936] just like our own HTTP request module [3938] earlier um our browser is making a ton [3940] of these little HTTP requests to other [3942] services so um I've gone to preview here [3945] and I'm just thumbing through all of the [3947] different and like all the different [3948] resources the files that we're we're [3950] getting and you'll see that some of [3951] these files are JavaScript some of these [3953] files are Json some of these files are [3956] HTML some of these fils are just data um [3959] right we can just scroll all the way [3960] through here and there's just a million [3961] in one what's interesting is what you'll [3963] find on a lot of websites is a lot of [3965] websites when they call a resource um [3967] they'll receive a response that looks [3969] like [3971] this and you'll notice that this is just [3974] this is Jason right this is um just Json [3977] format and a lot of the time the things [3980] that they return in Json if you call an [3983] endpoint so if you send a request to an [3985] end Point um you can actually get it to [3987] return that Json directly to like [3989] make.com instead of this and like [3991] instead of your browser I know that [3993] sounds a little bit complicated right [3994] now but let me show you a practical [3996] example um I'm just thumbing through all [3998] these graphql requests because I'm [4000] noticing that these all have the Json [4003] that I'm looking for and it looks like [4004] most of them like send me organization [4005] data that's cool uh user followed stream [4008] get workspace setting home state density [4010] that's pretty funny they actually [4011] collect a ton of data on you and looks [4014] like they use this to communicate [4017] honestly um they have some data on the [4019] video which is pretty cool with some [4021] comments they they have a list of [4023] comments uh fetch autoc comment display [4025] controls fetch video transcrip okay so [4027] what I want to do is I want to I want to [4028] call this video transcript and I want to [4030] get the whole video transcript you see [4032] what happens is when the page loads it [4033] makes an H sorry it makes an HTTP [4035] request to this URL here called caption [4038] Source URL and if I paste this [4042] in you'll see that I literally get the [4045] entire [4046] caption of my video so you can imagine [4049] that this is a pretty useful thing to do [4051] that you you could develop some app that [4053] uses the loom API or something like that [4056] Loom hidden API and then use it to call [4058] the specific resource at this specific [4060] URL but if I just copy this URL and then [4063] I go back here and I try and do like an [4065] HTTP [4068] request let's see what [4070] happens just going to pump the URL in [4072] here with a get press okay I'm going to [4075] run [4077] okay actually we got the whole thing [4078] which is pretty sweet yeah that's pretty [4081] sick okay so um that's great so [4083] literally this URL here just has the the [4086] list of all of our captions so all we [4087] have to do now is we just have to [4089] reproduce the same request that resulted [4091] in this response so in order to do that [4093] go down to payload and what you do is [4095] you basically copy um the entire [4098] structure of this request [4101] payload and then we also have to do is [4103] you go to [4104] headers here [4107] and then you have to copy all of these [4108] headers down and the Really the most [4110] important one here is this cookie that's [4112] what you want so basically what I'm [4114] going to do now is I'm going to um go to [4117] this URL and I'm going to set up a [4121] request here calling the [4124] graphql uh the request method is [4127] post let's go over here to [4130] post um if you guys don't know what I'm [4132] doing by the way feel free to check out [4133] my um my API call tutorial where I cover [4135] all of this and then I'm going to go [4138] down here to let's see request header [4140] cookies probably the main one so I'm [4141] just going to go back here I'll go to [4145] Raw Json application Json then I'll just [4149] uh actually it's probably a header right [4151] so I'm going to go to [4153] headers cookie I'll paste this [4155] in um it's usually all honestly that we [4158] really [4159] need we may need some more data [4162] actually let me just see here [4165] uh okay let's give this a try and if [4167] this doesn't work then I'm just going to [4168] add the rest of the headers in here but [4170] maybe it [4171] won then I need to send in some request [4173] content as well so we'll go to payload [4176] and I'll view this [4179] source and I'm just going to copy this [4181] as [4184] well then what I'm going to do is I'm [4185] going right click press run this module [4187] once received a um 200 status code we [4192] have the data with the actual URL the [4194] video that we want to access which is [4195] pretty sweet so I just got the [4198] transcript myself inm make.com using [4200] looms hidden API now if you think about [4203] it um what do you need in order to make [4204] this work well you need a video ID how [4207] do you get the video ID well 3 e3b [4209] that's just my URL so if you wanted to [4211] do like a cool project with this I'm [4212] just like off the top of my head here if [4214] anybody here spent more than 30 seconds [4215] thinking about this you'd probably be [4216] able to come up with something better um [4218] but you could just uh I don't know you [4220] could scrape a big list of loom URLs [4222] maybe there's just some resource out [4224] there with a big list of looms or maybe [4227] Loom has its own repository with a big [4228] list of looms or maybe you have access [4229] to some giant database just filled with [4232] looms or something like that you feed in [4233] these URLs to make.com you parse out the [4236] ID you then um have a module like I just [4238] showed you the HTP request module where [4240] you swap out this video ID with maybe a [4242] specific cookie or something like that [4243] and then you use that to get the um you [4245] essentially use that to get the uh video [4248] transcript every single time which is [4249] pretty [4253] sweet let me see if there's an example [4258] Loom that maybe I can [4260] use hopefully Loom does its uh video [4264] supports using [4268] looms [4271] um let me see if maybe I have a [4274] loom oh you know what I could probably [4275] do I'm just going to go to this URL here [4278] I'll go I'll go site loom.com share [4282] let's do that [4285] type this in grab this video here and [4288] what I want is I just want this ID so [4291] I'm just finding a random video out on [4292] the internet and I'm just double [4293] checking that I can do this with um a [4295] video that isn't just mine just to show [4297] you [4298] guys and then what I need to feed in is [4301] this video ID right here paste that in [4305] run this module only and as you see uh [4307] you can do this on on literally any [4309] video um not just my own video so now I [4312] have this person's whole video [4314] transcript which is cool [4315] uh you could then I don't know maybe you [4317] want to like feed that into some other [4318] flow which turns that into some blog [4320] post or something there's like a million [4322] billion trillion different things you [4323] can do I'm sure you can [4324] see all right so that's that I hope you [4327] guys enjoyed this video tutorial [4329] masterclass and web scraping on a lot of [4331] fun putting it together I think this [4332] thoroughly irons some of the holes in my [4334] last video which discussed specifically [4336] web scraping on a static basis this is [4338] now web scraping dynamically which means [4340] you can do basically anything and then [4342] um hidden apis are part of web scraping [4343] which is why I cover them in so much [4344] detail but if you guys want more [4346] actually have a whole video where I just [4347] like run through hidden apis how they [4349] work and more or less what I showed you [4350] here just in a little bit more detail so [4352] yeah web scripts is a really deep topic [4354] but what I just showed you was the 8020 [4356] um you can use it to determine more or [4357] less anything that you want um you can [4360] use it to get any sort of static website [4362] summarize that data turn that data into [4364] something valuable scrape certain [4366] entries scrape a you know URLs uh and [4369] then ultimately like call graphql hidden [4371] apis or other hidden apis to receive [4373] things that are valuable like video [4374] transfer scrips if you guys have any [4376] questions about what I showed feel free [4377] to drop a comment down below I know some [4378] of this was a little bit dense [4379] particularly the end otherwise if you [4381] could all do me a favor and like [4382] subscribe do all that fun YouTube stuff [4384] to help me out and uh get me to the top [4386] of the Alo and I'll catch you on the [4387] next video thanks so much bye-bye

Title: 4 Terrible Mistakes to Avoid When Delegating Your Automation Agency
[0] what's going on guys Nick here recording [2] live from my Airbnb in Vancouver in this [4] video I'm going to be talking about four [5] huge mistakes to avoid when delegating [8] in your AI automation agency these are [10] mistakes that I see people making all [12] the time and this is uh I mean these are [14] mistakes that are so big that they might [15] as well just kill your freaking business [17] but in this video I'm going to show you [18] how to avoid that as per usual uh just [21] so you know this is just my process it's [22] not the only way to get there or to [24] delegate it's just what got me to 72k a [26] month with mine so take whatever makes [28] sense to you out of this video that you [30] find valuable and discard what isn't [32] irrelevant last but not least no [33] gatekeeping I'm just going to show you [35] everything plus give you the sauce every [36] time that I've done that on YouTube [38] before I've just been rewarded [39] disproportionately so I'm going to keep [41] on going so uh the four delegation [44] problems that I want to talk about today [46] are as follows and this generally [49] happens when you start delegating [50] systems to your first few staff members [52] note that when I say delegating systems [54] your first few staff members I don't [55] mean like delegating to salespeople I [57] don't mean delegating to accountants or [60] admin staff I mean specifically [61] delegating systems to be built U by [63] primarily Engineers so you can imagine [66] that this happens pretty often in [68] companies like this this is a very [70] simple um agency pipeline as well [72] whether you're doing graphic design [74] Creative Design anything like that um or [77] PPC campaigns right I'm just listing off [79] agency service models at this point but [81] I think you get my my uh my point [83] essentially you get your business to a [86] certain status with Revenue $25,000 a [89] month $30,000 a month or more and you [92] find that there's no longer any way that [94] you can fulfill the work yourself so [96] naturally what you look to do is you [97] look to hire like a second in command [99] you look to hire some type of uh whether [102] you want to call them an assistant [103] whether you want to call them an [104] engineer uh whatever that's basically [105] what they are and this is like a very [107] simple and and common road map for [109] automation agency owners as well simply [112] because it's usually one of the first [113] businesses that they've ever started I [114] talk about why um employing the whole [117] like hiring a second in command approach [119] is bad in when a previous video so I'm [121] just going to leave that there and if [122] you guys want to check that out feel [124] free to but generally this leads to a [127] number of very major problems and [129] they're problems that you weren't really [130] expecting and they're problems I'm I'm [132] going to go over right now the first is [134] what I like to call the coordination [136] problem so when you have one person in [139] your business or when you work on that [141] business yourself time to complete a [143] project is just equal to the amount of [145] time that it takes for you to build set [147] project so physically the time that it [149] takes for you to sit down on your [150] keyboard and your mouse and to drag and [153] drop modules and to get something done [156] but when you have two people the time to [158] complete a project is now not just the [161] time to complete the project but it's [163] the time to complete each [164] portion plus the time spent [167] communicating and coordinating about [169] each portion plus the time spent waiting [173] in between the communication and in [174] between the coordination [176] periods and those last two bits there [178] are extremely important and they can [180] take way more time than the actual [182] entire [183] project um and it's something that you [185] know if you're just a solar preneur or [186] you're a freelancer you're coming from [187] that sort of background and you start [188] building you don't really realize until [190] you start you know essentially having to [192] do project management more than the [193] actual [194] work this scales with the number of [196] people so I have an analogy here when I [199] solve this problem for you in a moment [201] um but you know if you hire two people [202] to do something you're not doing it [203] twice as fast you're essentially doing [205] it about half as fast you are three [207] people to do something you're not doing [208] it three times as fast you're doing it [209] about third is fast I found the quality [212] of the end result can certainly go up [214] but if you're building a produ ised [216] automation agency or really any type of [217] productized business model the quality [220] doesn't really matter because it's [221] usually just the same every time right [223] now this is a major business killer this [225] is probably the number one business [226] killer which is why I put it here uh and [228] again you know if you're unfamiliar with [229] any sort of project management this is [230] going to crush you so I'm going to show [232] you how to solve this problem in a [233] moment and um it's a lot easier than [234] most people think but keep that one in [237] mind the second major issue is what I [239] like to call the motivation problem and [242] that's essentially where you notice a [243] major difference between your motivation [245] and theirs this isn't usually a big [248] problem when things are going well in [249] the business but when things aren't [251] going well in the business it tends to [253] be essentially you can derive this [256] problem from the fact that it is your [257] business whereas for them they just [259] happen to be in it you bear [262] responsibility for the ups and the Downs [263] of the company they don't I mean sure [265] you know the the the bounded downside [267] there the worst thing that can happen is [269] you let them go [270] but if you think about the worst thing [271] could happen for you your business could [273] go bankrupt you could be financially [274] devastated you could be insolvent I mean [276] depending on obviously how you stru your [278] assets and whatnot but obviously there's [280] a big difference in the risk there's a [281] big difference in the incentive [282] structure so I'm going to show you how I [284] personally like to solve this problem um [286] in a few [287] moments the third issue when delegating [290] specifically to Engineers is they often [292] don't have full contact surrounding the [294] project and this is what I call the [295] context problem you can kind of sum it [298] up as follows basically you most likely [301] you or if your company's a little bit [303] bigger your sales team sold the deal in [305] order to sell the deal they needed to [307] get on a call with the prospect they [308] need to walk them through what their [310] problem was that they were suffering [312] from they need to press on those pain [314] points and then they need to close the [316] deal and so essentially what happens is [319] because they closed the deal and then [321] they passed it off to the engineers [323] essentially what ends up happening is [324] there's like this game of telephone [326] between um the sales team and then your [328] back end where what the sales team [330] understood was a little bit different [331] from what the engineers understood and [333] even if that difference is like only a [335] little bit just 10% well the client is [338] going to be judging you on what they [339] told the salesperson whereas you know [342] the result that you're going to be [342] giving them is what your engineers did [345] so that game of telephone is [346] extraordinarily important and um this [348] leads to a ton of issue um not [350] necessarily I wrote here completing task [352] can certainly lead to an issue [353] completing the task but moreover it just [355] leads to how it is perceived by the [357] client is substantially less valuable [359] usually [361] the last thing is um what I like to [363] refer to is the engineer myopia problem [366] and that's basically just like if you [367] were to hire Engineers or people on the [369] back end these people tend to be a lot [370] more detail oriented right and because [373] they are more detail oriented they [375] usually sort of lose the forest for the [377] trees they just don't really understand [379] the reason why these systems are being [380] built for the business like a very [382] simple question to ask is hey why is [385] this automation valuable to my client [387] it's a question that basically no [390] engineer will ask themselves out of the [391] box and I'll show you to solve this [393] problem by guiding them through a couple [394] of quick questions I'll show you a [395] little form that I set up to do this uh [397] in my own business and I know this [399] doesn't sound like that big of a deal [400] you know Engineers let them be Engineers [402] is what I'm hiring them for but business [404] value is literally all your current [405] clients will care about that's why they [406] hired your salespeople in the first [408] place right so if your engineers the [411] people that are building these systems [412] they don't understand the real business [414] utility here the systems that they do [416] build are going to be almost necessarily [418] shitty or if not just shitty they're [420] just not going to be as good as they [422] could be for sure so these are the four [425] big delegation problems um they've been [428] major issues in my own business if I had [430] solved them earlier I'd probably be much [432] better off than I am right now and I've [435] solved all of these in due time some of [437] them have taken me a few weeks some of [438] them have taken me a few months I've [440] tried dozens of different approaches [441] what I'm just going to do now is I'm [442] going to run you through how I [444] personally solve this and this is going [446] to be really valuable to you if you're [447] at the stage in your agency where you're [449] just a about to hire somebody or you've [451] already hired somebody and you're [452] wondering what the hell's going on why [454] can't I grow why is my agency a [455] revolving door or that sort of thing so [459] the first problem I want to talk about [460] is the coordination [462] problem it goes kind of like this if you [464] hire people to dig a well then two [467] people will do the job twice as fast as [468] one person two shovels two people you [472] know two outputs right one person does [474] it at speed x two people will do it at [476] speed 2x [478] approximately but in knowledge work [481] let's say Building Systems or the [483] example I have here writing articles [485] writing a paper that does not work and [487] it does not scale if you hire two people [490] to write a paper uh your end result is [492] not the fact that you get a paper in [493] half the time you're probably end up [496] you're probably going to end up getting [497] that paper in twice as long essentially [500] because of a few [502] reasons the first is that time spent [505] communicating is necessarily time not [507] spent working on said problem [510] so I don't want to call it wasted time [511] because obviously there's value to the [513] business but they're not working on the [515] problem they're working around or about [517] the [517] problem the other big issue is most of [520] us these days use messaging platforms [521] most of us these days use slack these [523] are remote businesses that we're [524] operating right it's one of the main [525] reasons why you'd want to operate you [527] know a digital agency because it's [528] remote but when you use messaging [531] platforms like this there's always going [532] to be a lag between when your message is [534] sent and then when it's received and [536] moreover um like when it's read by the [538] person and understood by the the person [541] so for instance I might send a message [542] to Sally at 4 p.m. I'll say hey Sally [545] thanks so much for working on this I [546] just had a quick question about XYZ do [548] you mind helping me out with that Sally [551] maybe is going to she's busy working at [553] her desk she's going to get this at I [555] don't know 5:15 or something but maybe [557] her shift ends at 5:00 so I'm not [559] actually going to get a response until [561] maybe the next day at like 9:00 a.m. or [563] something and then it's going to take me [565] a little while to digest what she said [567] and then I might send another message [568] back but if you think about the time [570] between 400 p.m. and then 9:00 a.m. the [572] next day I mean that's what uh 16 hours [576] and so we've essentially added 16 hours [578] to a loop that doesn't need to be 16 [579] hours not only that when you add in [581] other time zones shift starts ends [583] unfortunate holidays um stuff like that [587] miscommunications even even minor [588] miscommunications weekends you can you [590] can literally add like weeks to a [592] project that is just completely [594] unnecessary you do not need and then [597] another issue that I mention here that [598] just came to me [600] is essentially that when you do this a [601] person has to sort of remember what the [604] problem is about if you send Sally a [606] message at 5:00 p.m. one day and then [608] she doesn't see until 9:00 a.m. the next [609] day um sorry at 4 p.m. and she doesn't [612] see you till till 9:00 a.m. the next day [614] well Sally now needs to just run through [615] oh yeah what the hell was that problem [616] about and so there's some sunk time that [618] she needs to spend literally like [620] rebuilding this problem in her head and [623] because it's knowledge work you know [624] that isn't always perfect it's not [625] always right it doesn't always happen [626] very easily and that leads to a number [628] of other issues [630] so um how do you actually solve the [632] coordination problem well the biggest [635] and probably number one way that I've [637] solved this in the past is I just make [639] it a rule not to split up my [641] projects I will basically always hire [643] one person to do an automation project [645] from end to end which eliminates all [647] communication costs entirely it'll also [650] solve the context problem which I [651] touched on at the beginning and I I'll [652] do a lot more in detail in a moment but [655] essentially by having one person do [657] everything even if the tasks aren't [659] necessarily all in the exact same flavor [661] or type of task we avoid that massive [664] message window we avoid the we [666] avoid basically that that big time lag [670] um and then the person you know just [671] gets to do the task very [673] quickly another way that I've solve this [675] is I just written documentation on how [677] to do everything in the business before [680] I start hiring what I mean by that is I [682] have Sops for basically every task that [685] uh I or anybody else has ever done and [688] we have a rule in the business where if [691] we have to do something more than twice [693] then it needs to be written about [695] essentially obviously there more of a [697] cultural thing um the simplest way to do [699] this would just be to start writing [700] documentation on all the Sops in the [702] business all the major tasks all the [703] major systems in order for this to work [706] you do need to standardize your offering [708] which is good to do anyways obviously if [709] you want to productize but really the [711] benefit here is by reading a [712] documentation piece of documentation [714] rather uh nobody needs to wait to send [716] or receive a message there's also no [718] communication time there might be [720] reading time researching time but that's [722] sort of like one directional it's not [723] bidirectional it's not like something [725] you have to wait for um and it solves a [727] ton of issues just having documentation [729] on stuff obviously uh you also need to [732] make sure the person that you're hiring [733] is capable of reading said documentation [734] you need to make sure to instill that in [736] the hiring process and that sort of [738] thing that like hey if you don't get [739] something we have documentation for [740] literally everything um you need to make [742] sure the person s sufficient but this is [744] the these are the two simple ways that I [747] in the past have solved the coordination [748] problem and doing the first one [750] especially this one here this has [752] completely changed my business because [755] before I'd always try and squeeze out as [756] much margin as I could by delegating [758] task a which is really simple to maybe [760] virtual assistant in lower cost to [761] living countries where I don't have to [763] pay them as much uh but the issue with [765] that is now we have substantially longer [767] turnaround times because one the time [770] zone issue that I mentioned earlier and [771] then two the time to coordinate and and [773] message about the problem and then what [775] I end up finding is you know the clients [777] are so much less likely to pay me money [779] if they you know if my project takes 3 [781] weeks to deliver as opposed to one week [783] you know they they're they're they're so [784] less likely to want to work with me on [786] followup projects that essentially just [787] like eliminates the margin increase that [789] I was able to achieve anyway so just [791] sort of pointless so I think that what I [794] just did here looks way cooler so we're [796] just going to do that from now [797] on uh okay so how to solve the [799] motivation problem right the first [801] problem was the context problem sorry [803] the coordination problem this one is the [804] motivation problem the motivation [807] problem basically looks like this uh [809] your business is your business so if it [812] fails your business completely [814] disappears to you that's financially [816] devastating whereas to your staff member [818] uh they're merely out of a [820] job why well if it's your business you [823] are 100% owner you will bear the vast [825] majority of the risk you will also bear [827] the vast majority of the [831] downside in addition to that not only do [833] you bear the vast majority of the [834] downside you also get the vast majority [836] of the gains and you also get the vast [837] majority of the upside so when things go [840] really crappy right you suffer when [843] things go really amazingly then you [845] benefit and this wild roller coaster [848] ride of business is not the same for [850] your staff member your engineer will [852] either be paid hourly or they'll be paid [855] projectwise or at least the vast [856] majority of us will hire them at least [857] initially because it mitigates risk on [858] our end but this leads to a different [860] type of risk which is that you now have [862] very different incentives like the [864] incentives of your staff member are 100% [866] different than yours because when you [868] win they don't necessarily win when you [870] lose they don't necessarily lose when [873] you need to really get a project done [875] time crunch wise 5:30 p.m. but maybe [878] their shift ends at 5:00 I personally [880] don't even like doing the time things [881] but I'm just I'm just trying to make [882] this as applicable as possible uh like a [885] daily schedule um you know are are they [888] going to be willing to take that call [889] and then go back to their laptop and [892] then maybe finish out a few extra [894] changes in the system they need to make [896] probably not right and uh you know they [898] cult reasons for that obviously but [900] there are also valid reasons which is [901] just that they don't really they're not [902] incentivized to do they don't really get [904] anything [905] extra so what can I do to fix it well [908] the first is just incentivize them uh [910] pay based on performance instead of just [912] time pay a percentage of the project [914] amount that you closed pay a percent [917] bonus at the end of the month or end of [918] the year based off certain Milestones [920] pay them a multiplier based on delivery [922] time right if your delivery time is one [924] week they finish the project in six days [926] give them a 1 over7 bonus for the [928] project right one extra day remaining in [930] the in the project time pay them I don't [932] know give them equity in your business [934] if they're one of your founding [934] Engineers right do whatever you can to [937] make it so that when they go on that [939] upside then they rejoice and then when [942] they go on that downside and they really [943] suck and they suffer then they you know [947] the they're not having a good [949] time note that not everybody is going to [951] want this the people that do want this [953] are going to be substantially more [955] internally motivated and they're going [956] to end up being much better staff for [957] you so those the people that you work [959] with essentially the people that are [960] willing to be intrinsically motivated [963] essentially the term is an internal [965] locus of control because they will be [967] willing to suffer alongside you and then [969] Rejoice alongside you as well [971] essentially much more responsible of a [973] group of [974] people so that's a motivation problem [976] the next big issue is the context [978] problem and I've touched on this earlier [980] but the context problem is a really big [982] one and it's also a silent killer a lot [984] of businesses that people don't realize [986] is going on I think if I were to take [988] this problem and show it to a lot of big [990] software development agencies big [991] software consultancies people that are [993] making1 to100 million a year they'd be [997] uh very unlikely to to fully understand [1000] this so here's the issue most companies [1003] will play telephone most company will [1005] will split themselves up into a front [1007] end and a backend the front end is [1009] responsible for selling the thing the [1010] backend is responsible for fulfilling [1012] the thing there's some inter dep [1014] departmental communication between the [1015] two but you know as your company grows [1017] that gets more difficult get more [1019] strenuous and there's let me just put it [1021] this way there's a reason why basically [1022] every sales department hates the [1025] engineering or fulfillment department [1026] and every engineering or fulfillment [1027] Department hates the sales department [1029] because the sales people will promise [1030] one thing and then the engineers will be [1032] having to be responsible to fulfill it [1034] and then when the salesp people promise [1035] the thing the engineers can't fulfill it [1037] you know they end up just hating each [1038] other [1039] essentially the purp the the problem is [1041] that what is Lost in Translation is [1043] never recovered a client will say one [1045] thing to a salesperson then the [1046] salesperson will pass it through their [1048] own filters by biases knowledge lack of [1050] knowledge and incentives and then tell [1052] that to the engineers right so the [1055] engineers are basically working off of [1056] information that is completely [1059] completely opposed or different right [1061] people that sell have different [1062] incentives than people that build they [1064] also have different knowledge Bas they [1065] understand things differently they're [1067] often unable to communicate the exact [1069] client need or understanding to the [1070] backend that just means that the backend [1072] team when they get the project they [1074] think the project is something different [1075] than it actually is doesn't it sound [1077] like so godamn simple but it's a major [1080] problem at most at most [1082] agencies basically if you work with the [1084] wrong Source material even if it's 90% [1086] of the way there it doesn't matter how [1087] good you are the results are going to [1087] suck the client is always going to be [1089] judging you on what the project that the [1093] sales team sold them is not what the [1095] project the engineering team thinks [1097] is so how do you fix this the simplest [1101] way to do so that I have done for myself [1103] is we just record the sales call with [1105] the Prospect and then it's required [1107] viewing for the engineers before they [1108] build the system so you can imagine how [1111] if you sell a system you get the money [1114] and you shake hands on it you then just [1116] send that sales call recording to the [1118] engineer alongside with the project [1119] scope project request project brief [1121] whatever the hell you guys filled out [1122] together right whatever your internal [1123] system is so now your engineers actually [1126] see things from the source material [1127] they're not hearing things from the the [1129] game of telephone and I know you're [1131] thinking well man that sales calls [1133] an hour that hour is going to save you [1135] dozens of hours both in client [1137] dissatisfaction and then in multiples on [1139] your engineer's time when you get that [1141] retention uh get that retainer you get [1143] that next deal that sort of [1145] stuff the second thing you can do to fix [1147] it is to make sure your proposal Scopes [1148] are very clear make sure that you only [1150] talk in terms of deliverables in your [1151] proposal or in your sales process and [1153] then what you send to your engineers [1155] like what the thing that they work off [1157] of is not some internal reformulated [1160] scope or whatever you actually just send [1161] them the exact same thing that you sent [1163] to the client in order to sell them [1165] right it's basically like hey the client [1166] saw the same thing that the engineers [1167] are saying so the Engineers know exactly [1169] what they're working on is the primary [1171] material it's the same thing the client [1173] is judging them for it's not some [1174] distilled version it's not some internal [1177] brief thing right like uh so many [1179] agencies have very lengthy drawn out [1182] internal processes that are completely [1184] pointless the third thing is systems are [1187] very visual so when you're communicating [1189] between Engineers as you will sometimes [1191] have to do um do it with video I love [1194] using loom personally because Loom is [1195] just the simplest way I click one button [1197] and then a little window appears on my [1199] screen and then 3 seconds I'm talking [1200] about the system people see [1203] it and then that said you know videos do [1206] also have a downside which is that [1207] videos can be unclear especially because [1209] human beings are unclear when they talk [1211] so to solve that problem use a bunch of [1214] text actionables at the end of every [1215] video that just outline exactly what [1217] party a is requesting or maybe what [1219] party B wants or something like that [1221] right some deliverable some some asset [1223] some resource whatever what I mean by [1225] that is combine the best of the Both [1227] Worlds right text is extremely [1229] but it often lacks uh you know an [1231] understanding of the broader picture [1232] because it's just a it's a very low [1234] bandwidth format video is [1236] extraordinarily high bandwidth but [1237] because of all that bandwidth some [1238] information could be lost and because [1239] it's linear and time based and people [1241] forget things you know sometimes they [1242] don't always ask for everything they [1243] want to do so solve that problem by [1245] having um a video where you discuss what [1247] you want to discuss then down at the [1249] bottom just have here are the [1250] actionables XYZ and just have a culture [1253] and anop in your business that where [1254] whatever is written under the actionable [1256] section is whatever the other person [1257] does [1259] these are how I solved the context [1260] problem and um they made a major [1262] difference to my own business they can [1264] probably make a major difference to [1265] yours all right so the last problem is [1267] called the engineer myopia problem now [1270] if you're unfamiliar myopia just means [1271] nearsightedness essentially means an [1273] inability to see very far and I call [1275] this the engineer myopia problem because [1277] what you'll find is that when you work [1279] with Engineers when you work with really [1280] detail oriented people they're detail [1282] oriented so they're used to looking [1284] really close like this but that [1285] necessarily means that the stuff behind [1287] them is kind of blurry they can't really [1289] make it out fully so when a client hires [1291] you to solve a business problem they're [1293] hiring you because they obviously care [1295] about you solving the business problem [1296] right it's kind of trivial but when you [1299] delegate a task to an engineer the task [1302] now becomes removed from said business [1304] problem because the engineer is now [1306] focused in particulars the scope and [1307] particulars the task as opposed to what [1309] the client wants the system to solve [1312] they care less about the benefits they [1313] care more about the [1315] features the reason why is incentives [1318] you or your sales team's job was to sell [1319] the system the engineer job is to [1321] complete the system so sort of like [1323] evolutionarily you're both going to [1324] arrive at different solutions to both [1325] those problems the other thing is that [1328] Engineers are Engineers so they don't [1329] often have practical business experience [1331] meaning they struggle with understanding [1332] like practical business use cases they [1335] don't understand the various industries [1336] that are that they are working with they [1338] don't understand the problems that [1339] they're suffering from they rarely have [1341] had to reformulate the features into [1343] benefits to sell because they don't [1344] sell and again you're hiring them [1346] because they're detail oriented right so [1348] they're focus on details and a lot of [1350] the time you know people can't be grade [1351] at everything they might be better at [1352] being detail oriented than they are um [1354] at being big picture thinkers and you [1356] know that's part of the value that they [1357] have in the business but it's a problem [1360] when they're tasked to fulfill systems [1361] that solve client problems because they [1363] don't understand the client problem [1364] fully well then they're not going to be [1366] able to solve said client [1367] problem so how do you fix it well the [1370] first is same thing I talked about [1371] before record the sales call with the [1373] prospect make it required viewing before [1375] they build the system because now you're [1377] anchoring the problem in the cont text [1378] of exactly what the client wants the [1380] words that came out of the client's [1381] mouth we're not making enough money I [1382] want more XYZ I want more leads I think [1385] our margins are really crap [1387] whatever and then the second thing and [1389] the thing that really really made a [1391] difference was as part of your [1392] delegation process have your engineer [1394] answer three [1395] questions and I have a form for this [1397] I'll show you in a second the first is [1399] literally like alongside you delivering [1401] this project ask the engineer what is [1404] the problem the client is suffering from [1406] after they watch a video [1408] what value does this system have in [1410] solving that problem what are we [1412] building what we are building will solve [1415] their problem so how is it going to [1416] solve it why is it going to solve it and [1419] then assuming the system does solve that [1420] problem what else do you think we can [1422] explore to help them and this is our you [1424] know put on our thinking cap and just uh [1426] pretend that we're not the engineer here [1428] we're actually like the salesperson [1429] we're the consultant we're we're [1430] attempting to move their business [1431] forward not necessarily just finish this [1432] one system this is the bigger picture [1435] thinking the way that I personally do [1437] this is with a type form I'll just just [1438] attach a type form to the project um [1441] it's reasonably straightforward I think [1443] essentially what you do is in whatever [1444] your project manager is you just have a [1446] form that form is linked to the specific [1448] project I do so by using a clickup ID [1451] and so this is type form over here if I [1452] go to logic and then I go to personaliz [1454] with data and then variables sorry um [1456] hidden Fields is what I [1458] meant you'll see there's a clickup ID [1460] field and so I have the URL of my form [1462] it's you know www. form.com whatever [1464] clickup ID equals whatever the record is [1467] and then I have a questions and the [1469] questions are same questions that I [1471] asked and you can make it so that the [1472] project manager or the sales team or [1474] something can just read through this [1476] before the engineer starts and just make [1478] sure that they are accurately [1480] understanding the problem and that they [1481] can reformulate it and phrase it in [1482] their own [1483] words and that's the wrong screen and [1486] not only will this make them a better [1488] engineer on this particular problem [1490] it'll accumulate and make them better [1492] Engineers on all future problems that [1493] they work on because even just doing [1495] this exercise three or four times a [1496] month is enough to consistently Ang them [1498] back in the real world like this isn't [1500] all just ones and zeros this is a real [1503] business problem that we're solving to [1504] you know improve the throughput of of a [1507] client's [1508] business all right awesome so those are [1510] my closing thoughts uh you have four [1512] problems here coordination motivation [1515] context and myopia just means [1516] nearsightedness if you solve these now [1519] as opposed to solving them as the [1520] problems come up you're going to save [1521] yourself probably hundreds of thousands [1523] of dollars over the course of the next [1524] year assuming that you're scaling your [1526] agency well and and you have the [1527] fundamentals in place place that I've [1528] talked about before um I personally [1531] would be several hundred, ahead probably [1534] millions of dollars ahead had I solve [1536] this not just with this agency but way [1538] back when when I was first starting to [1539] hire for one second copy of my writing [1541] agency um simply because the difference [1544] in incentives and the difference in [1545] coordination I know it sounds simple [1548] sort of when you're looking back but [1549] everything sounds simple in retrospect [1552] um when you're looking forward and [1553] forced to solve these problems yourself [1555] can be pretty intimidating but [1557] identifying the problem is 90% of [1558] actually solving it so I hope that I've [1560] helped you do that in this video if you [1562] guys have any questions about these four [1564] issues please just drop a comment down [1565] below more than happy to help otherwise [1567] please like subscribe do all that fun [1568] YouTube stuff and I'll catch you on the [1570] next video and I will be back to my [1572] normal setup as well for those of you [1574] that were wondering thanks so much [1575] bye-bye

Title: How I Build Better Make.com Scenarios With Iterative Testing
[0] what is going on everybody Nick here and [2] in this video I'm going to talk a little [3] bit about my preferred way to build [5] scenarios in make.com it's called [7] iterative testing and it's something [9] that in my many years of experience on [10] this platform I rarely see anybody do so [14] I'm going to teach you how to do it I'm [16] going to teach you how to save a ton of [17] time and I'm also going to teach you how [19] to um essentially this a system you can [21] use to train any Junior Engineers that [23] you want in your team to be able to not [26] only get up and running quicker but for [27] their flows and systems to be a lot more [29] maintainable as as well so if you guys [31] are wondering why I look kind of like a [32] K-pop Star right now it's just because I [34] don't have my mic stand so I'm just [36] going to be holding this one with one [38] hand and we're going to be doing some [39] work with my other as always this is my [42] process it's not the only way that you [44] can do this it's just what I prefer and [46] in the case of iterative testing [48] specifically it is easily the most [50] powerful like uh building method that I [53] have found for make.com and I think when [55] a letot you guys see it it's just going [57] to click that said I'm sure there are [59] other ways that you can technically [60] build scenarios so take whatever makes [62] sense to you out of this video and then [64] just discard whatever is irrelevant and [66] last but not least uh last but not least [68] no gatekeeping I'm just going to show [70] you everything and then even give you [71] guys whole systems that you guys can [74] sell all right so um when most people [77] think of the word test I find personally [80] they have a very specific definition [82] especially in [83] make.com when people think test they [85] usually think it's a large integrative [87] endtoend test that runs every single [89] module and every single scenario in your [92] flow essentially if this is our scenario [94] over here and this is just an example [96] that I whipped up for my community where [99] I show people how to build not only [102] scenarios but actually like full [103] automation businesses from start to [104] finish this is just something I was [106] doing for a CRM test and [108] clickup but you know if you're thinking [110] about an endtoend test the scenario this [111] essentially involves starting at the [113] very beginning all the way on the left [114] hand side here with this watch responses [116] module and then proceeding sort of [119] logically from left to right ending with [121] this um clickup [123] module and intent testing is important [126] and you should most definitely do it [127] before you consider an automation done [130] you can save yourself a ton of [131] development time if you use my iterative [133] testing method instead not only does [136] iterative testing save you tons of time [138] and money um by confirming that your [141] expectations match what's really going [142] on and I'm going to get into that in a [144] second but you'll probably save several [147] hours every project by doing this not to [150] mention a ton of gray hairs because my [152] biggest issue when I first started out [153] in make.com um and you know just [155] automations more General and hell even [156] like software development was I wouldn't [159] understand where my bugs were taking [161] place and then I wouldn't understand why [163] my bugs were taking place and iterative [166] testing um solves both of these [169] problems so this is going to be a quick [170] and easy video we're not going to spend [172] too much time on this um I find that the [174] benefits of iterative testing become [175] immediately clear but essentially if you [179] iteratively test as you build you're [181] never going to be spending hours working [182] on silly little bugs you're never really [184] going to have to worry about tiny things [187] like you guys missing a curly brace or [190] you guys not including you know the [192] right kind of quote or Dash you're never [194] really going to have a what the hell is [196] going on and why isn't this working [198] moment because if something doesn't work [200] you'll know exactly where in your [202] scenario from start to finish the logic [204] is failing or things are [206] breaking ultimately your flows will [208] break a lot less often meaning when they [210] do you'll be able to fix them faster and [212] all of this is going to collaborate and [214] essentially help you build much better [216] scenarios in a much shorter amount of [219] time so uh one of the reasons why I [222] think people like watching me build [223] these make.com flows so much is just [225] because I'll jump around pretty fast and [227] I'll do just a bunch of really quick [229] little hacks here or there and I'm going [231] to be developing a much longer video on [233] this in the future but for the purposes [235] of iterative testing if you really want [236] to be able to do this quickly um you're [238] going to need to to understand if few of [240] these and so what I have here are I have [242] four quick little workflow building [244] hacks that I'm going to go through um [246] and I'll essentially just show you how [247] you can uh use these to iteratively test [251] and then afterwards we're actually going [252] to go through and then iteratively test [254] and build that same scenario that we saw [256] right over here including like on a [258] module by module basis and then we're [261] actually going to just end to end test [262] the whole thing as well so I'm just [263] going to show you exactly what my actual [265] testing process looks like uh in [266] make.com and I think it's going to help [269] um you know a lot of you guys not only [271] build faster but just build more [273] maintainable flows that that [275] last okay so the very first hack here is [278] to separate the trigger module from the [281] list module now if you guys have seen my [284] previous videos you'll know that I do [285] this sort of thing quite a [287] bit but what does this really mean well [289] essentially in make.com you typically [291] have triggers and actions right the [293] trigger is a lot of the time it's like a [296] web hook or something if I rightclick [298] this type form responses module let me [301] just get it a full screen so we can [302] actually see what's going on I right [305] click this type form watch responses [306] module essentially what it's doing is [308] it's waiting for me to fill out a form [310] or somebody else to fill out a type form [313] and the type form in question is this [314] one right here this is just a quick [316] little proposal generator form that I [317] put together for um day eight of my [320] 14-day agency course and in this I'll go [323] through and I'll ask a bunch of [324] questions like hey who's the prospect [327] Give me a oneline summary of their [328] business what's the problem they're [330] suffering from what's the solution you [332] pitch what are the deliverables how long [333] will this take to deliver and how much [335] will you price and essentially we fill [337] out this form which I'm going to fill [339] out right now just um sort of as a [343] test I'm going to do this with one hand [346] because the other hand is going to hold [348] my mic like a K-pop [351] Star we're just going to go [355] ASDF unfortunately I cannot fill this [357] out without typing in an email address [359] kind of feel like I'm texting right [363] now um we're g to type that in do couple [368] of brief little summary pieces [375] here okay so say that I'm filling this [377] out [378] now and I have my module here which is [381] watching my [382] responses I click the submit button this [385] has now been caught right the issue with [388] this though is [390] obviously I just filled in a bunch of [391]  but the issue with this is [393] let's say I wanted to test the scenario [395] again I would have to go back to my form [398] and every time that I wanted to test [400] that scenario I would have to do that [402] process which if you had a watch and [405] timed it would probably be at least 15 [406] or 20 [408] seconds now what this uh design pattern [411] here what this quick hack allows you to [412] do is it allows you to store that [414] response and then just pull from that [416] response the one that I just filled in [417] once every single time you test your [419] scenario from here on out so instead of [421] spending 15 seconds now all I'm really [424] doing if you think about it so I'm just [426] right clicking this pressing run module [427] once and then voila I have basically the [430] same data right over here as completely [433] useless as it is and so in practice in [436] order to do this what you really need to [437] do is you need to um have a watch module [443] and I'm using a type form here as an [444] example but realistically you could use [446] any sort of flow any sort of uh form [449] soft sofware that you could possibly [450] want uh you can't necessarily do this [452] with Google forms you can do this with [453] jot form you can do this with I think [455] you can do this with paper forms and you [457] can do this with a variety of like CRM [459] um form based uh Solutions right like [462] click up as a form solution embedded [464] within it Monday has a form solution [466] embedded within that sort of thing but [468] essentially what you do is you will go [470] to your desired form platform of choice [474] and then you will connect a watch module [476] or a trigger [478] module and then you will add a sleep [481] module between the watch between the [483] trigger and I usually use 3 seconds or [485] so and then immediately afterwards you [488] will add a [489] list like so and the value of doing it [493] this way is well now when you catch the [497] scenario or sorry when you catch the web [500] hook response come in because really [501] that's what this specific module is [503] doing in the background you're then [505] sleeping for a couple of seconds just to [507] make sure the database is okay I find [508] just in practi if you don't do this [510] there's like a 20% chance that it runs [513] so quickly it doesn't even have the time [514] to add it to the database but anyway um [518] you'll wait a few seconds and then [520] you'll just grab the very first [523] record uh immediately afterward which [525] just ends up being the fir the first [526] record okay the record that was just [528] submitted and then if you want to test [530] this in the future then all you have to [531] do is sort of unlink this then drag the [535] trigger to the beginning of the flow [537] starting at your list responses module [539] or basically starting at whatever module [542] just grabs from your database or your [544] data [545] source and so this specific flow um you [547] know should be pretty self-explanatory [549] but basically what we're doing is we are [551] U we're creating a proposal and then [553] we're embedding it inside of clickup [555] which is our customer relationship [557] management [558] platform and uh in order to test this we [561] no longer have to go through all of the [562] rig roll all the BS basically filling [565] out the form I mean I just put in a [567] bunch of fake data here because um you [569] know I only had one hand but uh now we [572] just click run once and then it goes [574] through the rest of our scenario for us [575] which is quite nice now I did just put a [577] bunch of L's and J's in here so I doubt [579] that it's going to proceed as I imagine [582] that it would um if you know you filled [584] it out with actual information but I [586] think you guys get my [587] point the second quick hack I actually [590] showed in the previous quick hack which [592] is that you can just right click any [593] module and then press run this module [596] only surprising but a lot of people [598] don't know this and this is is easily [600] one of the biggest timesavers um that [603] you could use because instead of now [604] testing the entire flow and waiting for [606] your whole make.com scenar from start to [608] finish to complete you can just [610] rightclick and then you can just run the [612] specific module that you want and then [614] you can look at the input modules and [615] then the outputs right and then you can [618] compare those inputs and outputs you can [620] just determine whether or not what you [621] are doing is like the desired Behavior [623] whether you're feeding that module in [625] the desired [626] input now this is the first time you're [628] doing this a wa you'll notice is modules [630] that have a bunch of data in it or uh [633] sorry modules that have a bunch of [635] variables in it when you right click and [637] try to run it only um it'll actually [638] pull out a module or a modal like this [641] and it'll say what's the problem they're [643] suffering from what are the deliverables [644] how long will this take to deliver give [646] me a on line sumary of their business [647] these are all variables essentially that [649] I was pulling from the type form well [651] because I'm now right- clicking and [652] running this module only I need to fill [653] this in somehow so if you are running [656] one of these modules you are going to [657] have to fill it in with some test data [659] but if you think about it that's kind of [660] the whole point because you can simply [663] enter that test data in every single [665] time you run that specific module um [667] just to determine whether that test data [669] works for that module input or output [671] and in practice I found this is [672] particularly relevant with AI modules [674] large language model uh modules stuff [677] like anthropic Cloud stuff like gp4 that [680] sort of [681] deal I mean it looks like it actually [683] went with my LK jlk and in this case it [688] you know basically hallucinated a bunch [690] of um but maybe you know that's [692] our desired Behavior maybe that's [694] something we're looking for maybe we're [694] trying to test how it works on ljk LJ [698] nonsense inputs right well now we can do [700] that without also like wasting five [702] operations for the entire scenario run [705] and uh you know we can do it in a [706] fraction of the time so collectively if [709] you think about it I mean these two [710] hacks alone just saved us I don't know [712] 30 seconds every time we try to test the [713] scenario and what I find in practice is [716] that we usually test scenarios like 30 [718] times at at least um before we before we [721] deliver the project before we consider [722] it done so 30 * 30 seconds right you're [725] saving yourself at least 15 minutes just [726] combining these two things if you're [728] doing a templated sort of thing that [730] normally would take you an hour well [731] congrats you just got 25% more [734] efficient so these are pretty [736] entry-level hacks and most people that [738] have watched my videos up until now will [739] probably already instinctively [740] understand them just because you've seen [741] me do them a bunch but one thing that U [744] most people haven't seen is this [746] download input or output Json hack and [749] this one's really cool basically you see [752] this module here that we just completed [753] for anthropic Claud well if you click on [755] this little bubble obviously you get the [756] input and then you get the [758] output but if you go up here to this [760] little download icon you can actually [762] download the output bundles and if you [765] click on this you'll see that no longer [767] is this in uh make.com variable format [770] now this is all just in [772] Json and you'll see there are a couple [774] differences here from what we saw in the [776] variable uh field for make.com and what [779] we're seeing in the Json namely every [781] time that there's a new line we now have [782] a back sln and then before um every [786] quote we now have this sort of like um [788] slash it's sort of annoying but this is [791] a very quick and easy way to basically [792] get data in and then use it to um do [796] something which I'll show you in a sec [798] basically fill in the next uh variable [800] for you so you don't have to run data [802] heavy modules [803] anymore what I mean by this is this is [805] all just adjacent right so if you um [808] take out all of the backs slash ends all [810] of these extra new lines then if you [812] remove all of these backs slashes that [814] are before every quote well now you have [816] functional Json essentially this is now [817] Json that works and so you can just pop [820] this into a parse Json module and then [822] voila you now have um basically all the [824] same data it's just now you have the [826] same data without having to run the [827] module if that makes sense the value [830] here is that well sometimes every module [832] that you run like the cthr a cloud [834] module does cost you a little bit of [835] money it also takes a fair amount of [837] time and most important [839] sometimes there rate limits [841] involved like a video that I'm currently [843] doing right now is on web scraping I've [846] been asked to do a big web scraping [848] tutorial and as part of this web [850] scraping [852] tutorial I'm scraping [854] fivr you know the purpose is just to get [856] a bunch of listings for instance so I'm [858] just going to run this what this is [860] doing is this is sending an HTTP call to [862] a specific Fiverr um URL but check out [866] the file size it's you know 1,523 3,184 [870] characters and if I go to the da
