Title: How AI Helps Me Get 100K Views/Day Consistently (Copy Me)
[0] Hey, every day I get over 100,000 views [2] consistently. 12 months ago I was [4] getting less than 1/100th of that. The [6] differences between then and now are [7] time and a series of content automations [9] that I built that allow me to scrape and [11] find an infinite number of content ideas [14] and then produce content without [16] necessarily having to increase the [17] amount of time I spend doing so. If you [19] don't know me yet, my name is Nick. I [20] made over $170,000 last month using [23] automation primarily through content and [25] an inbound funnel that now routes to a [27] pretty thriving community product. In [29] this video, I'm going to run you through [30] everything that you guys need to know if [32] you guys want to get started on the same [33] journey. Let's get into it. Just so [35] we're all on the same page here, I have [36] three major content channels. The first [38] is my YouTube, which just hit [40] 67,296 subscribers. The second is my [42] daily updates channel, which just hit [44] 2557 subscribers. And then the third is [47] my Instagram, which just hit 76,700 [50] followers. This is the one that's [51] growing the quickest due to a few viral [53] videos I've posted. On average on [54] Instagram, my videos get anywhere [56] between 20,000 to 800,000 views. Um, and [60] we're implementing a variety of [61] strategies which I'm going to talk about [62] on my Instagram, my main YouTube, and [64] then also my daily updates channel, [66] which is just where I talk every day [67] about something that I'm doing. Okay, so [70] this is how AI helped me get 100,000 [72] views per day consistently. I'm going to [73] give you everything you need. I'm going [74] to give you all the sauce. There's no [76] gatekeeping here. You guys could just [77] take my entire strategy and copy and [79] paste it yourselves. Just before I get [81] into the actual systems, I want to talk [83] about a system, but a system that isn't [86] the sort of automation system you're [87] probably thinking about, but is more so [88] just like a work and productivity [90] system. Okay, so the main reason that I [92] have found that most content creators [94] fail when they try making their own [95] content is because they are like this [98] lovely meme, okay, where you are [100] focusing on quality over quantity. Now, [103] I know our entire lives we've been told [105] that we need to focus on quality over [107] quantity. That the number of things is [109] less important than the quality of the [110] thing. But this is a great exception to [112] that rule because the more quantity you [115] can produce in content, generally the [116] faster and better you get at doing it. [118] And it becomes easier and easier for you [120] to upgrade that quality as well. So, I'm [123] going to go kind of against the grain [124] here and I'm actually going to recommend [125] that if you want to be big on content on [127] social media, start a brand or start a [129] funnel similarly to me making similar [131] amounts of money. You need to focus on [133] quantity more than quality. And there [135] are a couple of important points I'm [136] going to make here. Okay, most creators [138] always focus on perfection over [139] consistency. They do so because they [141] are, to be honest, probably a little bit [144] narcissistic. They're really worried [145] about how they come across. They're um [147] kind of um they're they're afraid of the [150] pain of embarrassment, right? And [151] because of that, they focus on trying to [152] make their first piece of content the [154] best piece of content. But because [156] they're faced with that big hurdle of [157] making that first piece of content the [158] best piece of content, they never [160] actually get started. They never [161] actually make it anywhere. So if you [162] want to crush it, you do have to more or [163] less just drop the shame. You have to be [165] willing to be embarrassed. It's sort of [166] a fundamental point. And I'm embarrassed [168] constantly when I look back at some of [170] my earlier videos. As you can see, I got [172] a number of points here. Um, another big [173] one is 99% of content creators only [175] generate around 1% of the total views. [177] So just want everybody to keep that in [179] mind here. The vast majority of people [181] on the internet right now are doing [183] absolutely nothing in terms of [185] production. They get so few views that [187] it's laughable. The 1% of content [189] creators that have understood what I'm [191] telling you here generate 99% of the [193] total views. So there's a very big [195] what's called power law difference [196] between the content creators that make [197] it and then the content creators that [199] don't. This is more or less the way that [200] it works. You're also competing against [202] 1 million creators, and I said 1 million [204] here, but I really should have said like [205] 1 million a day in a very saturated [207] detention economy that is now highly [209] sophisticated and literally built to [210] extract as many user watch seconds as [213] humanly possible. So, if you get [214] started, it's very difficult for you to [216] do so without something that stands out. [218] So, a point that I'm going to make is [220] that people watch creators who have [222] achievements. They don't just watch good [224] content. It's not enough that my content [226] is good. my content is good, but you're [228] also attracted to watching it because [229] you're like, "Wow, Nick has done [230] something that I want to do. Nick has [232] achieved some sort of milestone, whether [233] it's a revenue milestone or in this case [235] maybe like a like a view milestone or I [237] don't know, personality milestone, [239] whatever the hell it is, something [240] that's interesting, something that [241] stands out." Because when you see an [243] expert in their field doing a thing, [245] it's just so much more inherently [247] fascinating. Why do we watch soccer [248] players? Why do we watch football [250] players? Why do we watch people at the [251] top of their sports or in their crafts? [253] Because seeing somebody at the peak of [256] whatever it is that you might have [257] wanted to do at some point in time or [259] what whatever form of of of excellence [261] is just inherently fascinating to other [262] human beings. If you don't understand [264] that, it's going to be very difficult to [265] stand out. So, how I relate that to my [267] own strategy? Well, the second that I [269] hit $72,000 a month with my automation [271] agency, I started talking about it. The [272] reason why is because I figured that was [274] a top 1% sort of achievement. the second [276] that I have a top 1% sort of [277] achievement, well, now I have some [278] reason to justify why somebody should [280] listen to me and not the million other [281] creators out there that are all talking [283] about AN automation. Okay, so believe it [285] or not, the quality that you are [287] generating is actually secondary to your [288] credibility and your output volume, [290] which we'll get into a second. I know [292] that this is a catch 22. I call this the [294] creator catch22. You kind of need views [296] to build authority, and then you also [297] need authority to build views. But the [299] way that I got around this was I didn't [301] start with content. I had existing [303] expertise in success somewhere else [305] which in my case was cold outreach and [307] then through an AI automation agency and [309] a content writing agency. Then after I [310] made some money and I had some standout [312] achievement that's and only then then [314] and only then is when I decided I would [316] finally make content and when I had some [318] real results to share then you know my [320] my channel blew up. So just to give you [322] guys some context my early videos [324] average about 100 or 200 views until I [325] demonstrated over $25,000 a month in [328] Upwork success. The second that I [329] started doing that, I started talking [330] more candidly about my finances [332] regardless of how embarrassing or or [334] cringeworthy it might have been for me [335] at the time. Um, I was able to uh, you [338] know, carve a towhold in this industry [340] and make more. This is the same sort of [342] system and approach that I recommend [343] everybody here do. And then ultimately, [345] if you start with zero authority and you [347] have nothing, you need at least 10 times [348] more content to break through. It's just [350] not really worth it for me. I'd rather [351] go I'd rather recommend that you go and [353] you make money doing something else. And [355] once you have some achievement or [356] something, then double back. Finally, [359] once you've done that, AI systems are [361] going to let you create 10x the content [362] without 10x the time investment. So, [365] let's actually get into talking about [366] the systems right now. Okay? And I got a [368] bunch of flowcharts and stuff. Feel free [370] to check the description for all of [371] this. You don't need to memorize this or [373] try taking screenshots. Here's my AI [374] powered content machine infrastructure. [376] That is me IRL. We totally AI upscaled [379] this too, which is really funny. Okay, [381] so here's more or less the way that it [383] all works. I built my content machine [384] around minimizing friction, not [385] maximizing quality. So let me run you [387] through exactly what that looks like [388] down here with this flowchart. Then I'll [390] double back up top. Okay, so my content [392] machine is composed of three parts. The [395] first is idea [396] generation. The second is uh production [400] and the third is distribution. So, the [402] way that idea generation works is I have [404] a variety of systems that I've built [407] that do things that let me create [410] content that is hyper specific to what [413] my audience wants to see. This is the [415] number one key insight I have for [418] anybody that is trying to grow. If you [420] have established some foothold, if [422] you've gotten your first few hundred or [423] maybe thousand subscribers or something, [426] you have a base of people that have [428] demonstrated that they really like the [430] stuff that you are currently doing. So [432] these are the people that you want to [433] listen to when creating future content [435] moving forward. Okay. So the way that I [438] do it is I have two major systems. On [440] YouTube, I have a YouTube comment [442] scraper. This will go through every one [444] of my videos. It will scrape all of the [446] new comments published since the last [448] time it ran. It will find all of those [450] comments, filter out those that aren't [452] suggestions or questions, and then what [454] remains is a giant list of things that [456] people basically asked. They say, "Hey, [458] Nick, can you make a video talking about [460] this? Hey, I wish you talked more about [462] this. Hey, I love when you talked about [464] this. Didn't like when you talked about [466] that. Hey, it would be really sweet if [468] somebody made a video on this. All of [470] the things that they talk about. Then I [472] run through another system which [474] generates content titles and now I have [476] a giant list of basically exactly what [479] my audience wants me to create in front [481] of me at any point in time. On [483] Instagram, I do something pretty [484] similar. I have an infinite idea [486] generator flow which takes because the [488] channel is a little bit different. When [489] we do AI news, it takes all of the [492] trending AI platforms using other [494] Instagram reels, using newsletters, and [496] using other content sources. It then [499] takes a transcript of all of these [500] videos, turns that into um basically a [503] list of content, uh list of platforms, I [506] should say, that I could create content [507] about, and then it actually does a [509] little bit of automated research on the [511] back end, compiles a quick, uh [513] step-by-step how to get up and running [514] with this platform. And then from there [516] I have a script that I feed into a [517] teleprompter and say on the screen. So [519] these are fundamentally different [520] systems but these are both my idea [522] generation systems. And if you think [524] about it both of these are doing the [525] same thing. Okay. Both of these at the [527] end of the day are allowing me to create [531] content [532] for my [534] audience. For my audience. Okay. I [538] create content that generally people [540] want to see. If I see a lot of people [542] asking questions about something, that's [544] what I make my content on. The reason [546] why is because this leads to very high [548] watch times, which I'll talk about in a [549] second. Once I have high watch times, [551] telling the algorithm that um you know, [553] my videos are good. That gets me a ton [556] of extra discoverability, a lot more [558] people start flooding uh my YouTube [560] videos and stuff like that. At least [561] this is uh this is our current [562] understanding of the system. So these [565] two feed into some sort of GPT [566] processing which I then um add to a [569] content calendar which I then try and [571] publish every single day. The second [573] system is my production system. So if [576] you think about it production is [577] composed of a couple of things like in [579] my case I need to know the thing to talk [580] about. So that was the idea generation [582] and we just dealt with that. Okay now [584] that I have the idea generation what [585] else do we have to do? Well in [586] production we have to take a video and [588] then we have to convert a video into [589] some sort of finished product. So [591] usually there's some sort of editing [592] there. So, um, the best way to template [594] this out is to have a Premiere Pro [597] productionready template that I just [599] drag and drop my finished video into. It [601] applies a couple of stylistic changes [603] and a few edits and then it poops out a [605] high-quality video with minimal editing. [606] So, we're templating out every aspect of [608] the production process essentially. [610] What's another way to do things? Okay, [612] that's my recording preset. Well, um, if [614] you think about it on YouTube and on [616] Instagram, another component of the [617] deliverable that I need to provide in [619] order to publish a video is I need to [621] have some sort of thumbnail, right? [622] Right? So, I need to have some some [623] visual thing that incites the audience [625] where they click on. What's really [627] interesting that I found out about this [628] is the actual thumbnail that you have is [631] less important than just making good [633] content consistently for a while. [634] Because if you answer questions that [636] your customers like, then as long as [638] they see you in the thumbnail, the [640] average click-through rate on that [641] thumbnail will be a lot higher simply [643] because they've associated you with good [644] content. So, believe it or not, I don't [647] have like a super intense, [648] extraordinarily well-ressearched [650] thumbnail process. I usually just have [651] two or three templates and then I'll [652] just cycle through those templates. And [654] the key is actually making it so my [656] thumbnails are simple and predictable [658] and boring enough that people can very [660] easily see and say, "Oh, that's a Nick [662] video. That's not a insert other person [664] video. That's a Nick video. So that's [665] the one I'm going to click on." So in [667] that way, we have a couple of Canva [669] templates. I'll just drag and drop [670] various pictures of myself into it. [672] Automatically crops out the background [674] and then voila, I'm I'm done. Likewise, [676] we need some sort of script template. [678] Now, why do I use script templates? I [680] didn't use scripts or anything like that [681] until very recently, but essentially um [683] you know the way that hooks are [685] formulated tend to have a big impact on [687] watch time and stuff like that. So now [688] what I'll do is I actually script out [690] the intro and I'll try and say something [691] that's like 90% similar to this. I'll [693] try and hit every story point or bullet [695] point at least. So these are all [697] templates and the reason why I cover [698] these is because they allow me to [700] produce a large amount of content. I [701] basically get to if I have these [703] templates produce every day without [705] additional added time aside from just my [708] recording time. All I have to do is [709] record. And then if you think about it, [711] like it's basically recording time. It's [715] the worst C I've ever drawn in my life. [718] Recording time plus um thumbnail time [723] plus editing time. [727] Okay, so this scales every minute of [731] recording results in an additional [733] minute of content that I generate. Okay, [735] so this kind of looks like this. [738] But this this just looks like this. And [741] this this just looks like this. Because [743] it doesn't matter how long the content [744] is that I'm generating. If it's 60 [746] minutes, it'll still take me 30 seconds [749] to do the thumbnail. It'll still take me [751] 30 seconds to do Well, not really 30 [753] seconds. Let's say 5 minutes. Let's not [754] be reasonable here. Take me 5 minutes to [756] do like the Premier Pro edit or [758] something like that. So, in order for me [759] to create a piece of content that's 60 [761] minutes, how much time did it take? It [762] took 60 minutes plus 30 seconds plus 5 [766] minutes. meaning I get a ratio of 65.5 [770] minutes of work to 60 minutes of content [772] that can later be consumed and devoured [774] I should say. Okay, so um that's how [777] that works. After I do daily output, [779] then I obviously grow my channel. I got [780] a lot of new people coming in. That [781] feeds back into my idea generation flows [784] and then I get a bunch more ideas. Then [786] finally, I have the distribution. Now [788] what's interesting is I don't actually [789] have any systems for distribution. A lot [790] of other people have systems where [792] they'll post on YouTube and then they'll [793] post on a bunch of Reddit threads and [795] then they'll post in a bunch of other [796] places. I'm not doing any of that right [797] now. Could this be a missed grow growth [799] opportunity? Possibly. But when I think [801] about this, this to me just sounds like [802] a bunch of additional time that I need [804] to add to the end of every video that [805] goes out. Why would I want to spend all [807] this time making my life super hard if [809] my main goal is to publish content [810] consistency and maximize my quantity [812] more than it is to maximize the quality [814] of every individual video? Does that [816] make sense? Now, because I've done so [818] much content, the quality tends to be [819] fantastic, right? But that's not my main [822] goal. My main goal is the quantity. So, [823] I created a bunch of these systems and [825] these basically let me maintain massive [827] daily output for about 3 months or so. [829] My daily updates channel is getting up [830] to that point right now. It's a video [832] every day. It's 30 to 40 minutes. This [834] channel I'm going to be uh trying to go [836] for every day. In reality, I think we're [838] probably at sixish days a week for the [839] rest of the year. The key idea here is [841] the ALGO actually rewards watchtime [843] accumulation. It doesn't reward [844] individual video performance. Okay. What [846] I mean by that is I and a good friend of [848] mine, Matt Lson, the other day did like [850] a calculation and a comparison. Okay. We [852] took the total number of minutes of my [854] published content and we compared it [856] against a bunch of other creators that [858] were my size, smaller or bigger than me. [860] And what we found was that there was a [862] very strong correlation between the [864] number of minutes of published content [866] and then the total subscriber count in a [869] given year. Now, if we zoomed out and if [871] it was over multiple years, this [872] correlation kind of went away. But for [874] channels that started around the same [875] time as me, the channels that published [877] similar amounts of content to me ended [879] up with similar levels of growth. And [880] the con the people that publish maybe [882] half the content as me got, you know, a [884] third to maybe half of as many [885] subscribers. The people that publish [886] more content than me got even more. So [888] what am I trying to say here? I'm [890] literally trying to say that growth is a [892] function of watch time. If you are good [894] at what you do and you've demonstrated [895] success, you're like one of those soccer [897] players I was talking about earlier [898] that's just pretty damn great. As long [901] as you just make interfacing with the [903] market your number one concern, you will [905] inevitably grow like wildfire. And so [907] what do we do as people like care about [909] process optimization like most the [910] viewers of this channel? Well, we [912] process optimize. We build systems that [914] enable us to stick to that. How can we [916] maximize the total number of content [917] minutes that I produce over the course [919] of the next year? Okay. Then I focus on [922] on systems that eliminate decision [924] fatigue. When I say decision fatigue, I [926] was referring to my thumbnail systems [927] earlier. Why would I spend an hour [929] trying to find the perfect idea or [931] concept for a thumbnail when I could [932] just drag and drop it into a thumbnail [934] template, get 80% of the way there, and [935] then still enable me to produce content [937] in the time that I wanted to do. So, my [940] YouTube comment scraper and my Instagram [942] idea finder, I covered these, but [943] essentially they're just high-quality [944] ways to um make sure that the content I [947] produce is specific for what my audience [948] is. And then my entire workflow [950] basically just eliminates this what [952] should I talk about today question, [953] which to be honest is what the vast [954] majority of content creators are [955] struggling with right now. Hey, if you [957] wanted to sell something to content [958] creators, you would sell them this [960] because this is one of the biggest pain [961] points that any content creator with a [963] successful channel has. It's literally [964] like, holy crap, what the hell do I talk [966] about today? Right? Um, anyway, the [968] point I'm making is none of this stuff [970] is perfect and none of this stuff is [972] super complex, okay? It's just effective [974] enough that I can get up and get going [976] and then I worry about sorting it all [978] out later because I focused on [980] frontloading the quantity. The quality [982] eventually just work themselves out. If [983] you just do things enough, eventually [985] things get better. I'm reminded of a [987] study that was done. I believe it was a [988] study or it was a university class or [990] something and it was um a test of two [993] groups of people. The first group was it [996] was a photography class. The first group [997] was told, "Hey, I want you to take as [999] many photos as possible with this [1001] camera. Then by the end of the month, um [1004] I want you to, you know, we're going to [1006] have like some photo test and then uh [1007] your goal is going to be to show this [1009] photo as part of the test." So that was [1011] the quantity group. Then there was the [1012] quality group. The quality group was [1014] instructed, hey, I want you to take a [1015] single photo over the course of the next [1017] month, but I want it to be the highest [1018] quality, most amazing, most beautiful [1021] and insightful photo, and that's the one [1022] we're going to present. Okay? So, one [1024] focused on quantity, the other focused [1026] on quality. Which one ended up with [1028] highly rated uh much better scores on [1031] that photography test, which I [1032] understand is subjective, but bear with [1033] me here. It was obviously the quantity [1035] group because the quantity group just [1036] got to work through the motions. They [1038] got to, you know, figure out uh the [1039] right shutter speed. They got to figure [1041] out the right time is to take a photo. [1043] They got to pattern match between [1044] content that works and content that [1045] doesn't. They got to make cool YouTube [1047] thumbnails. I hope you guys are getting [1049] the point that I'm making. Okay, so [1051] that's my second major point. My third [1054] major point are that there are variety [1056] of systems and tools that are actually [1057] pre-built that enable you to multiply [1059] your output without actually having to [1060] spend a boatload of time doing all this [1062] stuff yourself. So, I'm going to run you [1064] through my own stack for us. Um, that's [1066] me IRL, just a little bit less green. [1068] Okay, so most creators spend 80% of [1070] their time on tasks that can be [1072] systematized. So I'm going to share with [1074] you um three categories of tools that [1076] have essentially transformed my workflow [1077] and enabled me to do a lot more and a [1079] lot less time. Every tool solves what I [1081] call a friction point in my content [1083] production process. So the first is that [1085] YouTube comment scraper. Okay, so this [1087] pulls audience questions directly into [1089] my my uh GPT for processing. GPT being [1092] generator pre-trained transformer. You [1094] can just chat GPT or whatever. Next is [1096] my Instagram idea finder which [1098] identifies high performing content in [1100] adjacent niches to repurpose. And then [1102] here's where I get into my thumbnails. I [1104] have a simple Canva template. Okay, I [1106] have Premiere Pro templates with most of [1107] my animations and stuff like that baked [1109] in. And then I get into my actual live [1112] production templates. I will use OBS [1114] scenes in order to go back and forth [1116] with my content. You know, whereas most [1117] other people, they'll actually record [1119] two separate streams of things that [1120] they're doing a screen share. One will [1122] be a video like this and another one [1123] will just be um let me just turn this [1125] off for you guys. Another will be [1128] basically a video like this. And then [1130] what they have to do is they have to go [1131] into post and then they have to stitch [1132] them together, right? I don't do that. I [1134] actually just record the entire thing at [1136] once. Let me show you what I mean. This [1138] is my OBS Studio right over here. I [1141] actually have a screen as you guys could [1143] see on the left hand side. If I click [1146] this main button, I go to this. Then if [1147] I click on the button to the right, my [1149] screen share, I go to this. So, what I'm [1150] trying to say is I do what's called live [1152] production. Um, just like a I don't [1155] know, a a newsroom or something like [1157] that. I don't actually record the [1159] footage and then deal with it later. I [1161] actually record it and then do the [1162] production live so I can eliminate as [1164] much time as humanly possible later on. [1167] Do I end up with as high quality of [1168] finished product? No. But do people [1170] really care? Not really. Most people [1172] just care about the stuff that I'm [1173] talking about. They don't necessarily [1174] care about the look and the vibe. And as [1175] you can see, I still achieve a big chunk [1177] of that look and that vibe pretty [1178] easily. You know, there's a couple of [1180] other things I do. One thing I didn't [1182] write over here is I use a capture card [1184] to capture my YouTube videos. So, I [1185] don't actually record it with my camera [1187] and then take out the memory card and [1189] plug it into my computer, export it, [1191] then have to take the memory card and [1192] put it back in my camera. Why would I do [1194] that? That's an additional like 10 [1195] minutes, 20 minutes of work that I have [1196] to do every time. No, I want to [1198] eliminate the friction. So, this capture [1199] card actually is basically just screen [1201] recording my camera and then when I turn [1203] on OBS, I get the file kind of at the [1205] end of my recording. Everything's 100% [1207] done right there. A couple of other [1208] things I obviously have, you know, a [1210] batch recording setup. So, when I do my [1212] Instagram videos, uh, for instance, what [1214] I'll do is I will load up all 20 reels [1217] on a single long script, just one after [1219] the other after the other. I'll put it [1220] on my teleprompter. I'll press go and I [1222] will literally just sit there and I will [1223] say the entire thing. I produced 17 [1226] reels in less than 9 minutes the other [1227] day. 17 reels in 9 minutes. Talk about [1230] easy. My total recording time for 17 [1232] days of consistent published content was [1234] literally 9 minutes. And then finally, I [1236] have content calendar automations which [1238] automatically sort and schedule based on [1240] audience demand. We've tried a variety [1242] of these. I don't really think mine work [1243] in practice as well as they could be, [1245] but you can imagine how there could be a [1247] niche that's blowing up right now or [1248] something and you have 20 scheduled [1250] videos. We could actually find the niche [1252] that is blowing up. You could actually [1253] scrape a list of competitors that are [1255] talking about specific things. look for [1257] market demand and actually publish [1258] specific videos at specific times. That [1260] said, I think the highest leverage and [1262] biggest alpha thing here is just if you [1263] publish every day, then if you're in an [1265] industry that changes quickly, like mine [1267] is a and automation, you can actually [1269] choose what to talk about that day, [1270] which is really cool. So, baking in [1272] consistency and systems into this [1274] process is a big chunk of it. Yeah. So, [1276] my my best performing videos almost [1277] always just come from ideas my audience [1279] explicitly asked for. And I think that's [1280] really the key thing. Variety of [1281] different ways to do this. Um, I got the [1283] idea generation systems here. YouTube [1284] comment scraper, Instagram idea finder, [1286] audience question tracker. These [1288] ultimately just allow me to create [1290] content that resonates with my audience. [1292] If I do this, I get more watch time. I [1294] also get a much higher click-through [1296] rate. And all of these are signals which [1298] tell YouTube and other content [1300] platforms, hey, you should recommend [1302] Nick's content. What happens then? Well, [1305] then I get much higher discoverability [1307] basically. And then, you know, I'm in [1308] everybody's browse page. Next, I have a [1310] production flow that's streamlined. I [1312] have a teleprompter system for my [1313] Instagram videos. I'll batch record a [1315] bunch of them at once. Then I also have [1316] a bunch of OBS scene templates as well [1318] as like my capture card and my YouTube [1320] videos which allows me to instead of [1321] having to export a card and then plug it [1323] into my computer, whatever. I just press [1324] a button and then at the end of it I [1326] have like a 90% of my video. Then [1328] finally, um you know, just in terms of [1330] my distribution, I have the the [1331] thumbnail templates. I have some [1332] templates for my description. Then I [1334] also have a multilog platform manager. [1336] I'm now starting to have some people [1337] that assist me with things like posting [1339] and whatnot. This basically allows them [1341] just to come into my apps and accounts [1342] and do some of that posting for me so I [1344] don't actually have to like take any [1345] more time than I have to. It's [1346] interesting because one thing that a lot [1348] of people constantly say is, "Nick, you [1349] seem like you're all over the place. [1351] You're on my school communities and then [1353] you're on my YouTube and then I see you [1354] on Instagram and then I also see you [1355] with this daily updates channel." Well, [1357] the whole idea is every minute of [1359] content that you're watching took me [1361] basically about a minute to make. That's [1363] that's it. That's the whole magic there. [1364] It's not like most other channels where [1366] if you make an hour of content, it took [1368] the creator like 10 hours to make [1369] because you had to sit down, think about [1371] the ideas, and do all this stuff. It's [1372] like, no, the reason why you can think [1373] that I'm everywhere is because you [1374] probably only end up consuming 20 to 30 [1376] minutes of my content a day. And I will [1378] sit down and record for more than 20 or [1380] 30 minutes every day. It's sort of like [1382] a magic trick if you think about it that [1383] way. But obviously, it's less magic when [1385] I tell you how it works, huh? [1387] Regardless, here is my step-by-step [1389] implementation strategy for massive [1391] output. If you guys wanted to start a [1392] YouTube channel or a Tik Tok or an [1395] Instagram or a LinkedIn or or or [1397] anything, this is more or less exactly [1399] what I would do. I'm going to talk about [1400] this just in terms of AV or [1402] audiovisisual content just because [1403] that's what I know best, but you can [1404] apply the same methodology to any sort. [1407] Okay, so the very first thing I would do [1409] is I would try and internalize that the [1411] first 30 days are critical. The way that [1413] these platforms work is almost all of [1415] them give you some sort of like [1416] short-term algo boost. They do that when [1419] you're new because you don't really have [1420] any videos and you haven't really proved [1421] yourself. So, I don't know if you guys [1423] have ever played chess, but it's kind of [1424] like how when you make a new chess [1425] account on any one of these platforms, [1427] they assume that your rank is, I don't [1428] know, like a thousand or something. What [1430] usually happens is most people suck. So, [1431] they start at 1,000, then they [1433] immediately go down to like 500 or so. [1435] But some people are good, so they start [1436] at 1,000, then they go up to like 1500. [1438] It's it's it's a short-term boost. And [1440] so, what you want to do is you want to [1441] take advantage of that short-term boost [1443] by publishing as consistently as [1445] possible for at least the first 30 days. [1447] and I recommend the first 90. So, I [1449] experienced virtually no growth during [1451] my first 14 days of daily posting. It [1453] wasn't until like day 14 or 15 or 16 or [1456] something that I got like one of my [1457] videos getting more than 100 views. And [1459] the vast majority of creators, they just [1461] quit during this what we're calling a [1463] desert phase before all of these systems [1465] start allowing you to compound. [1467] The way that I would set up my physical [1470] environment is I would basically ask [1472] myself, what sort of setup can I create [1474] that will enable me to con to produce [1475] content every day for the next year? I [1478] care less about how to optimize my [1479] recording setup so that one video is as [1481] high quality as it could be. All I care [1483] about is, okay, if I set myself up in [1484] such a way, if I get a nice comfy chair, [1486] if I get my light in like a place that's [1488] sort of out of the way so I don't have [1489] to like move it every time, if I get my [1491] my camera so all I have to do is click a [1493] button, you know, like if if I set all [1495] this stuff up, does this increase the [1496] likelihood of me being able to record [1498] every day for a year? And, you know, [1499] that's basically my guiding question. [1501] So, I I start with that. The way that [1503] I'll do this in practice is I always [1504] mount my camera. I will always have my [1506] microphone connected. I will always have [1508] an OBS window open somewhere on my [1510] computer. Then my lighting is always [1511] preset and everything's at like the [1513] exact same numbers and modes. I don't [1515] have to fiddle around or anything like [1516] that. I literally just walk into the [1517] studio, which in this case is just in [1519] the middle of my kitchen, uh, the Airbnb [1520] that I'm staying at. And in doing so, I [1522] eliminate a big chunk of the setup time [1524] per video. So, I'd recommend you guys do [1526] that as well. You might not have all the [1527] equipment. You might not have like the [1528] fancy lights or the nice microphone or [1530] whatever, but take the analog, which is [1532] take the analogy, which is just have [1534] everything set up so that all you need [1536] to do is press one button and start [1537] recording. and it'll substantially [1539] decrease your friction. And we're [1540] animals at the end of the day. If you [1542] could decrease your friction to do [1543] something, if you could put a treat in [1544] front of an animal, it's a lot more [1546] likely to want to do that thing, right? [1548] Next up, implement some sort of decision [1550] minimization system. I recommend [1552] recording first thing in the morning [1553] before you have any sort of decision [1554] fatigue. You know, creating content's [1556] hard. You're putting yourself out there. [1557] So, if this is one of the hardest things [1558] you're going to do all day, I recommend [1560] that you just frontload it and you do it [1561] first. I will literally wake up, I'll do [1564] a couple of administrative tasks and [1565] then I will come sit down and just click [1567] a button and start talking to the [1568] camera. That's just another way that I [1569] can ensure some level of consistency [1571] before later on in the day my my [1573] motivation and discipline starts to [1574] wayne. Um I can I can talk myself out of [1576] it. I know this because I've had that [1578] situation occur a number of times. So [1580] just believe it for me. If you guys [1581] could start earlier or whenever your [1583] willpower or your ability to maintain [1585] consistency is the highest, you'll be a [1586] lot more likely to stick with it. Um, [1589] for my Instagram videos, I will [1590] pre-write the scripts and then load them [1592] in the teleprompter like I talked about. [1593] And then in doing so, I'll batch record [1595] five to seven videos in a single [1596] session. Okay? That way, you know, I [1598] don't have to worry about doing this. I [1600] don't have to like constantly be [1601] checking and stressing and being, oh, [1602] did I make a video today or not? My [1604] Instagram is just taken care of for [1605] several weeks of at a time. For YouTube, [1607] I just like to wake up and do it every [1609] morning. I find that that like adds a [1610] fair amount of consistency to the rest [1611] of my life. Um, and if you think about [1613] it, that's sort of like Brian Tracy's [1615] eat that frog idea where you start and [1618] do the hardest thing that you do all day [1621] immediately basically the second that [1622] you wake up. So, you know, eat that [1624] frog. Do your hard piece of content [1625] immediately and you'll be so much [1627] further ahead than most other people [1628] are. Last but not least, here's a [1631] practical quality improvement framework. [1633] Okay. Now, contrary to what most people [1635] would recommend, I actually recommend [1637] that you don't improve anything for your [1639] first 14 days. I recommend that you [1641] don't touch a single thing. The only [1643] thing that you should worry about is [1644] producing. You will inherently and [1647] naturally get better at production over [1648] the course of your first 14 days. If [1650] you're talking if you're doing videos, [1651] you'll get more concise. You'll become [1653] um better and more articulate. Your [1655] video quality will probably improve a [1656] little bit just cuz you'll like shimmy [1657] around your light and whatnot. Don't [1659] make any material changes aside from [1661] that. Just keep doing what works because [1662] the big thing here is the only skill [1665] you're attempting to cultivate right now [1666] is your ability to stick to a habit. [1668] Okay? After you've published two weeks [1671] worth of content, then you can start [1673] making changes, you don't need to worry [1675] about anything up until that point. [1677] After that, my recommendation is you [1679] just find one thing to improve. Okay? [1682] Then after 30 days, after you've done [1684] another two weeks at least, then and [1686] only then can you actually review your [1688] analytics to identify your highest [1689] leverage improvements. I did this with [1692] my own channel. So many people that I [1694] was competing with and talking to about [1696] this kept on running into issues and [1699] wondering, "Hey, Nick, uh, I my [1701] thumbnail, I'm optimizing my thumbnail [1702] setup." We're like, "Hm, my microphone [1703] isn't very good. I should do blah blah [1705] blah." Okay, I didn't do any of that. [1706] What I did is I published starting here [1709] every single day. And I did that for the [1712] full month, doing the exact same thing. [1715] And only around March time, after this [1717] big spike of 12,285 views in a day, that [1720] was a month into my channel, by the way, [1722] did I start asking, okay, great. How can [1724] I actually start optimizing this, you're [1726] not seeing all the publish videos here, [1727] just because this is pretty far back uh [1729] in the past. But, um, if I had [1730] configured this correctly, you would see [1731] it'd be video, publish, publish, [1733] publish, publish, publish, and so on and [1734] so on and so forth. Now, obviously, [1736] we're getting into a higher tier level [1738] of publishing and we're getting into the [1739] point where my views are getting higher [1740] and my revenues are getting higher and [1742] stuff, but when I started out, I just [1743] did not worry about making any changes [1745] whatsoever. It was just constantly, [1747] let's steamroll that content and make it [1749] work. Now, the other point that I'm [1751] going to make is a lot of people think [1752] that their videos fail. They're like, [1754] "Oh, this video didn't get any views or, [1756] you know, um, maybe this LinkedIn post [1758] didn't get any views." I want you guys [1760] just eliminate that notion of fail from [1761] your vocabulary because what is actually [1764] happening is you are building a giant [1768] pile of black powder that the second one [1772] of your other videos or pieces of [1773] content will take off will explode. The [1777] more content that you have that doesn't [1778] take off, as long as it's still good [1780] quality content, what'll happen is [1782] somebody will come in through your top [1783] of funnel through your really viral [1784] piece, which will always eventually [1786] happen if you're consistent enough. and [1788] then they'll love you so much that [1789] they're just going to watch all the rest [1790] of your stuff anyway. So, you making [1792] that content still made you a lot of [1795] money and it still got you a ton of [1797] brand adherence and popularity and [1799] stuff. It's not like the work that you [1800] do on videos that don't pop off or [1802] pieces of content that don't pop off [1803] don't matter. They do. Because when you [1805] have that thousand true fans idea, when [1808] you find the people that really like [1809] you, they're all going to inevitably [1810] watch or consume them anyway. Meaning [1812] that none of this is wasted time. All of [1814] this stuff is actually just storing up [1816] potential energy. Even my failed videos [1818] from literally the first few that I've [1820] ever published, they get tons of views [1821] now. And I get lots of comments saying, [1823] "Wow, this is like a gem. I can't [1824] believe that I didn't see this. My god, [1826] this is the best piece of content on the [1828] channel." So, just keep that in mind. [1830] This is a 30-day implementation road map [1832] that'll show you days 1 to 7, talk about [1834] exactly what you need to do. Then, I'll [1836] cover days 9 8 to 14 in terms of how to [1838] optimize your setup. Then, afterwards, [1840] how to scale your growth. Okay? So [1843] follow this word for word and you guys [1845] will get to the money eventually. Okay. [1848] And then finally, I just wanted to cover [1849] the compounding effect and uh what I'd [1851] consider to be long-term strategy. So [1853] after your first initial 30 days, after [1855] my first initial 30 days, what was I [1856] thinking? Well, the great thing about [1858] content is most other things are linear. [1861] Linear just means if this is one unit of [1865] effort, then this is one unit of result. [1868] This is two units of effort, this is two [1869] units of result. This is three. Now you [1872] get three units of result. Okay, content [1875] isn't like [1876] that. Content follows an exponential. So [1880] content will start off as requiring much [1884] more effort to get to an equivalent [1887] result. [1888] Okay? But very quickly we'll surpass all [1891] of that. And then eventually your units [1894] of effort so to speak, your one unit of [1896] effort will result in 8 million units of [1899] result. [1900] So, um, 90% of the results that you're [1903] going to get will come after the first [1905] 90 days of your consistent posting. And [1907] I want you to think about each piece of [1908] content just being that potential energy [1910] idea. If you go back to like, uh, a [1912] physics class or grade school class, [1914] this is potential energy. You are [1915] building yourself up higher and higher [1917] and higher. You're building tinder and [1918] black powder and gunpowder to the fire. [1920] When you inevitably take off, and you [1922] will, as long as you're consistent and [1923] don't give up, then all of that will [1925] just help propel you even more. [1928] Now, um, after you're done with this, [1930] okay, my recommendation is, you know, [1933] you're done with 90 days or so. Now, you [1935] can begin some analytics driven [1936] optimization. You can review the topics [1938] that worked best. You can identify [1940] patterns in terms of your audience [1941] retention across video types. You know, [1943] all of the questions that you've been [1944] receiving. Hey Samantha, can you make [1946] content about this? Hey Samantha, I [1947] loved when you talked about X, Y, and Z. [1948] Hey Sammy, I love that you're blah blah [1950] blah. I wish you talked less about this. [1952] you can actually like sit down, lay all [1954] of those comments out, and now start [1955] making datadriven decisions based off [1957] what your audience likes. So, you can [1959] double down on formats with highest [1960] engagement. And then ultimately, you [1962] could let your data and not just your [1963] intuition guide your content um [1965] decisions. But keep that in mind. The [1967] first 90 days or first 30 to 90 days, I [1969] should say, you did not worry about [1970] that. All you did is just worry about [1971] producing because that's the most [1972] important lever. After maybe 90 or so [1975] days, you might actually start being [1976] able to delegate non-critical tasks like [1978] editing and distribution. And then um [1980] when you get to like day 180 plus, you [1982] could focus exclusively on highest [1983] leverage activities like I'm doing now. [1985] This really just depends on your growth [1986] and the amount of money that you're [1987] making. Like I'm making um you know I [1989] made 170k in profit the other month. So [1991] it's worth it for me at this point to [1992] spend a few percentage points of my [1993] margin on somebody else dealing with [1994] most of the complexity. But you know if [1996] you're making a tenth of what I'm [1998] making, it might not really be worth it [1999] to hire a full-time editor or a [2001] full-time videographer or full-time [2003] whatever the hell you might need in [2004] order for your content process to be [2005] good because obviously all types of [2007] content are going to differ, right? [2008] Anyway, content is just not wasted [2011] effort. It contributes to an eventual [2013] breakthrough. Just a matter of building [2014] up that potential energy to the point [2016] where, you know, it's so explosive that [2018] the second that you light it a single [2020] spark, your content channel just goes [2021] straight to the moon. All right, that's [2023] that. Hopefully, you guys appreciated [2024] this walkthrough and behind the scenes. [2026] Every system that I've talked about [2027] here, I've recorded a video on or done [2030] some sort of walkthrough on either on [2032] YouTube or in my community, Maker [2034] School. So, feel free to check them out. [2036] Check out the Gumroad link below in the [2037] description. You'll find tons of content [2039] systems for idea generation, scraping, [2042] and so on and so forth. And if you guys [2044] like the idea of running a similar sort [2046] of business like I do, an AI automation [2049] agency, and you guys want to figure out [2051] how to get your very first few clients [2052] with that business model, then check out [2054] Maker School for sure. We're just under [2056] 1500 members as of the time of this [2057] recording. The second that we hit that [2059] 1500, I'm going to be increasing the [2060] price again just to illustrate the [2062] improved value in the community. Um, if [2064] you guys already have a business and you [2065] guys want to scale it a little bit [2067] further, check out Make Money with Make. [2068] That's sort of my mid ticket. Uh, if you [2069] guys could do me a big solid aside from [2071] that, like, subscribe, all the fun [2072] YouTube stuff that has consistently [2073] gotten me to the top of the algo [2074] recently, I'd really appreciate it. And [2076] I will catch all y'all tomorrow. Thanks [2077] so much. Bye.

Title: How I Made +$100K/Month As An AI Solopreneur (Step-by-Step)
[0] in this video I'll show you how I made [1] $100,000 per month as a solopreneur in [4] the AI space that is no employees no [7] contractors and really just me plus a [9] bunch of Leverage systems and artificial [11] intelligence should note that none of [13] this is theoretical I actually built out [14] this whole road map for the exact [16] business that I'm operating today over [18] the course of the last few years and [20] I've really just been implementing on [21] that road map ever since so this video [23] is essentially going to be a summary of [24] that road map distilled into four key [27] phases that you and anybody watching can [29] Implement to achieve similar levels of [31] success to me also a lot of people are [33] doing this right now it's not just me at [35] the $100,000 a month as an AI [36] solopreneur there are dozens if not [38] hundreds of people starting businesses [40] right around this time that are taking [42] advantage of the unlocked leverage of AI [44] to do the sorts of stuff we're going to [45] talk a little bit about that in a minute [47] so as I've mentioned we're looking at [48] four phases here and these are distinct [50] steps that I followed throughout my [51] journey we'll start with my own story [53] before I show you how you can actually [55] practically implement this yourself the [57] first step was frontloading client [59] acquis position as quickly as humanly [61] possible now I know what a lot of people [63] are thinking Nick are you just telling [64] us to get clients yeah I am and no [67] right but I don't think a lot of people [69] put as much value on this step as they [70] probably should and I'm going to talk [72] about some concrete ways that I um got [74] my first few customers and clients ASAP [77] now the reason why this is so valuable [78] is because if you think about it like [80] clients and customers aren't just a part [82] of a business they're actually the [83] entire business if you have no clients [85] or customers what you have is a fancy [86] knick-knack that you work work on during [88] the weekends you don't actually have the [90] rest of the company you can build up the [92] most amazing back end of your AI [94] automation agency or content writing [96] company or videography business or [97] whatever but it means nothing at all [99] unless you have people going through [101] that system right so in addition what a [104] lot of people think about when they [105] start a business is they think that [106] they're at like the start line okay so [108] they think that they're I don't know [109] like let's say we have a graph right [110] they think they're at the zero point the [112] reality is when you start a business [114] you're not at the zero point where [115] you're at is you're actually at like [116] negative 100 you're at negative a th000 [119] actually [120] when you start you're already in debt [122] Alex horos and a couple other people [124] talk about this but you're in skill debt [125] technical debt client management debt [127] you're in a ton of debt essentially that [129] will compound very fast unless you [131] consciously and intentionally manage it [133] and control it and that's why you need [134] to get your first customer ASAP I would [137] recommend getting your first customer [138] knowing what I know now before you even [140] build out your product go and find some [141] contracts lock those things down and [143] then worry about building out the rest [144] of the systems later but that's in the [146] side let's talk about what I actually [147] did so when I first started my [150] um I mean I started a number of [151] businesses my door to-door agency back [153] when I was in my early 20s and more [155] babyfaced than I am now you know I had [157] no brand I had no portfolio I had no [160] referrals I had basically nothing the [161] only thing that I had was a ton of [164] conviction and then a lot of ambition [166] but the reality is I had very little to [167] back it up like probably a lot of you [169] guys in my shoes um so the the thing is [173] I had a bunch of predispositions around [174] the sorts of customers and clients to [176] get I had watched a lot of content from [177] like these big gurus that were like you [179] you don't work hourly you don't do this [181] you don't do that you tell the customer [183] a price they accept it and then you you [185] do business but I had all these [187] presuppositions and predispositions but [189] when I went out there and I tried to get [190] customers using those approaches nothing [191] mattered and so I was actually kind of [193] in that weird like uncanny valley of no [195] business for a very long time and it [197] wasn't until I just consciously said [198] okay screw it screw what I've learned [200] before I'm just going to try and get [201] clients as simply and as quickly as [203] humanly possible that I was actually [204] able to make some progress so in my case [207] what I ended up doing um was I opted to [209] go on a freelance platform called upwork [210] now upwork you know big green logo badge [213] um a lot of people have said bad things [215] about it namely that clients on that [217] platform are super cheap namely that if [219] you work on upwork you'll never really [220] be able to escape their service fees and [222] stuff like that you can check out other [223] videos that I posted on why I don't [225] think those service fees are really any [226] big deal at all they currently charge [227] you 10% maybe 15% of some contracts but [230] they also deal with Payment Processing [232] which is 3% they also deal with X escro [234] which is usually a fixed fee they do a [236] lot for you that makes it really not [237] that much money but anyway um the point [240] that I'm making is I'd heard all these [241] negative things about upwork but then I [242] decided you know what screw Market [244] Opinion let me actually give this a try [245] myself and that's a recurring theme that [247] you're going to see throughout the rest [248] of this um these four phases so my idea [251] was I was going to frontload client [252] acquisition get client relationships as [254] quickly as possible and then I'd worry [255] about the shape of these relationships [257] later I'd worry about optimizing my my [259] my packages and my retainers and stuff [260] like that after I'd already done some [261] work and had some money and that turned [263] out great because the main benefit to [265] platforms like upwork or Fiverr or toptw [267] or these these million in one freelance [269] business [270] is that like when you when you're a [272] beginner and you have all that debt that [274] I was talking about one of the main [275] portions of that debt is your sales debt [277] you probably don't know how to sell and [279] selling is actually quite a refined [280] science like in order to get good at [281] this stuff it takes a long time it took [283] me almost a decade to get to where I'm [284] at today and I wouldn't even consider [286] myself that good compared to some of the [287] other people out there and the reality [289] is sales is composed of basically at [291] least three things at least um but in my [294] opinion you need to you need to [296] understand a customer problems okay then [299] you needs to be able to eloquently and [301] succinctly State why you're you have a [303] solution to that problem and then the [305] customer needs to pick between you and [307] the million other people that have done [308] that so it's kind of a three-stage [310] problem I call this the buying ladder [312] essentially upwork solves two of those [315] for you and those are the hardest two [316] for initial and beginner sales people to [318] get so upwork okay if you think about it [320] somebody posts a job on upwork upwork [322] has already solved the problem because [324] if somebody posts a job post on that [326] platform saying hey I'm looking for an [327] automation engineer I'm looking for [329] Conta for my blog or whatever they [331] already know that they have a problem [332] okay also you've Loosely solved the [335] solution as well because they usually [336] know the shape of the solution that [338] they're looking for right if somebody [339] posts a job looking for an AI automation [340] engineer they know that their solution [341] is going to involve an AI automation [343] engineer no right so you've [345] actually gotten two-thirds of the work [346] done the only thing you have to do is [348] you just have to convince people as to [349] why you're the best pick for that [351] particular thing um so there's a little [353] bit of nuance there but the point that [354] I'm making is it just solves a lot of [355] the work for you in exchange you pay [357] some connect uh fee that's like the the [359] way that you you essentially make [360] applications on the platform sort of [361] like credits and then you also pay them [363] a a small little cut of the revenue that [365] you make on a project now um you know my [369] approach to upwork was very [370] fundamentally different from most other [371] people's and I learned this from a [372] business partner that I had um Noah and [375] essentially the key to making this work [377] for me was not just submitting copy [378] paste applications to everybody's job [380] post like everybody else was doing what [382] I did was I created a customized video [385] recording it was usually between two [388] sometimes even 10 minutes where I'd [389] actually go and I'd solve their problem [391] so this is a quick example of one that I [392] actually sent hey my name is Nick I'm a [393] process automation engineer and I just [395] came across your posting with somebody [396] to help you with AI and automation for [398] social media you mentioned basically [400] wanting a way to streamline your social [402] media and your workflows I thought I'd [403] blow this video out of the park for you [405] and just make it a no-brainer as to why [407] you wouldn't want to hire me um you [408] talked about developing AI models so I'm [410] more than happy to assist you with this [412] I don't know to what degree we'd [413] actually be developing the AI models [414] though I think probably more [415] realistically what we'd be doing is be [417] using pre-existing AI models to generate [419] social media but a very quick and and [421] easy example of the social media [422] automation I set up a while ago was one [424] that generated um basically like social [428] media automations using uh Banner bear [432] which is a social media platform that [433] essentially allows you to like create um [435] assets automatically so this is a quick [438] quick little example of a social media [440] animation that I put together that [441] basically got um a templated image and [443] then it added some information down here [445] with you know the name of the company so [447] I do this sort of thing pretty often and [448] uh I'm confident be able to help you [450] with it it doesn't have to be obviously [451] real estate brokerage it could be more [453] or less anything um and then I can also [455] show you how to post it automatically [456] onto Facebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn [459] uh Tik Tok you know Etc any hope this [463] makes sense you any questions about this [464] or you want to get in touch just give me [465] a call we're happy to help thanks so [467] that video is 2 minutes you could see a [468] bunch more videos like this where I [469] actually sell real upwork contracts in [471] maker school um the point that I'm [473] making is this approach immediately sets [475] you apart because you actually spend a [476] few minutes solving their problem and [478] there's kind of a sneaky benefit to this [479] as well if you're a total Noob like I [481] was you actually learn how to sell by [485] rot repetition you become better at [487] articulating the solution and talking I [489] mean you're talking into a void kind of [491] like I'm talking to a camera right now [492] but you get better at talking about a [494] particular problem and than a particular [495] solution um and there there's no cost to [497] it it's not like you're getting on a [498] sales call and you get super nervous or [500] anything there's somebody judging you no [501] you're literally just talking to your [502] camera not to mention I think talking to [503] a camera is probably one of like the [504] most in demand and probably best skills [506] you could have just look at what it's [507] enabled me to do with my channel so [509] anyway the point that I'm making is I I [511] got started really quickly and then I [513] front-loaded client acquisition on a [514] platform that basically everybody else [515] was crapping on talking about how [516] terrible it was that have now made well [519] over half a million dollars on by the [520] way and um I I just I just got going [523] with this uh loom video approach where I [525] was just you know creating a customized [526] walkthrough of exactly how i' solve the [527] client problem I was providing a ton of [529] value up front now once I'd gotten my [531] first few clients because this worked [533] obviously if if you do this like many of [534] people in maker School you will get your [536] first client in you know your first week [538] or so as long as you're consistent you [539] send a certain number of of videos um [542] you know once I'd got my first few few [544] customers and clients I would take [546] something like 30 or 40% of all of the [548] earnings that I made from this and then [549] I just shoved it straight into cold [551] email campaigns okay cold email [553] campaigns being the other up-and-coming [555] technology or Approach at the time um [557] that was renewed because of AI and [559] personalization but essentially I would [561] send several hundred sometimes 500 [563] sometimes a thousand cold emails a day [565] to a variety of Industries trying to [567] pitch them on my service and you're [568] probably like okay next so which [569] industries did you Target and the [571] reality is I had no idea I had no idea [573] which Industries to Target I had no idea [575] which Niche I should go into I had no [576] idea about any of this stuff I mean I [578] this is true back when I was going door [579] to door by the way it's true when I was [581] selling content with one second copy [582] it's true when I started my automation [584] agency left click I never knew which [586] Niche is to Target never had any idea so [588] what I did instead was I picked like 10 [590] maybe 15 okay I picked 10 or 15 niches [594] then I developed specific offers for [595] each basically saying hey I noticed [597] you're probably having a trouble with [598] this so I'm going to solve this hey you [599] know I know a big common issue with [601] recruitment businesses is this so I'm [602] going to solve this hey I know a big [604] issue with plumbing companies is that so [605] I'm going to solve that then I just sent [607] them out to as many people as I possibly [608] could and obviously my copyrighting [610] wasn't half bad which is why I you know [611] got some traction initially and then [613] from there um I just like ran a [615] retrospect of one month or two months [617] later and I saw okay which nichas [619] responded best to my offers which you [621] know offer has resulted in me booking [623] the most calls and from there I was [625] essentially able to refine and find a [627] small subset of niches that worked [629] really well for me so at this point what [631] i' done is I basically said screw [633] everything else screw my whole business [635] I'll figure it all out on the back and [636] once I have customers all I'm going to [638] do right now is focus on getting [640] customers and then I did a bunch of [642] things that don't scale I set um you [644] know up work profiles up I submitted a [647] bunch of loom applications where I [648] recorded videos of myself right 10 [650] minutes of video required at least 10 [652] minutes on my end sometimes more to do [653] research and to get to the point where I [655] knew what the hell I was talking about [656] but the point that I'm making is I I [657] worried about all of that stuff at the [658] very end [659] and I just said yes to as many [661] opportunities as humanly possible [662] because I knew that I had a ton of debt [663] that I need to pay down as you do this [665] and as many people in my communities [666] maker school and and products and stuff [668] like that quickly learn when you say yes [670] to a bunch of stuff you grow very [672] quickly but you inevitably cap out [674] pretty low as well and the reason why is [676] because when you say yes to a bunch of [677] stuff you're usually working with sub [678] toer clients and then you're also um [680] doing a lot of custom work okay and this [682] is great again from getting from zero to [683] one but there's only so many custom [685] projects you can do there's there's only [687] so much custom uh work that you could [688] essentially [689] so in my first three three months I [691] landed eight or nine clients through the [693] methods that I'm talking about and these [695] were custom projects that range from [696] $1,000 all the way up to about $10,000 [699] each you can think stuff like me um [701] building out crms for uh I don't know [703] specific you know like SAS company or [705] something like that or me managing [707] outbound for a recruitment business or [709] something so anyway I granted these [710] custom projects for about six months I [711] was hidden as I mentioned between 20 to [713] $225,000 months sometimes a little bit [715] more sometimes a little bit less um but [717] I found that I was hitting a ceiling and [719] that's really the next stage hitting a [721] ceiling and you know this this this [723] phase of my business was very important [725] because it taught me a lot about what [726] works taught me a lot about my own [728] skills and competencies taught me a lot [729] about what other people do to try and [731] fix this problem and it also taught me [733] that you know with a little bit of [733] Ingenuity and with a little bit of [735] systems thinking you can do more [736] yourself than dozens of people can and [738] which is why you know I'm capable of of [740] running such a high margin business [742] there's nothing unique or special about [743] me I just thought a little bit about how [745] exactly I was going to set up my [746] business before I did it and also I was [748] in a Ved position because I was able to [751] take a little bit of my money and [752] experiment and and and attempt new [754] approaches before actually doing so and [756] the reason why is obviously because I [757] frontload of clown acquisition now I had [758] a little bit of money to play around [759] with if you guys never even get to the [761] point where you have the money to play [762] around with obviously you're not going [762] to be able to do this next step so you [764] do have to do them sequentially anyway [766] so at the time when I hit the ceiling I [767] was juggling five or six clients my [769] sleep schedule was I was stressed [772] out as hell I was tearing my hair out if [774] you guys see a gray hairs here I don't [775] know if you guys can but all of that was [777] due to that period um [779] it's really hard and this is where a lot [781] of businesses just plateau and they just [782] they never grow and so this freelancer [785] ceiling sort of gives you two options [786] okay the first is it's kind of fork in [789] the road you can um you can well I guess [791] there's three options you can continue [793] doing what you're doing and then never [794] get anywhere and then you can just [795] operate a business at between $ 15,000 [797] to $25,000 a month you can get a pretty [799] good lifestyle and still a pretty high [801] margin business let's be real if you're [802] operating at like 80 90% margins you're [804] still taking home more than like 90ish [806] 95% probably um of all the people that [808] are you know in your in your country so [810] this isn't bad by any means I think a [811] lot of people probably rest here not [813] because they can't go further but [814] because they just say well how important [816] is work to me it's not really that [817] important so I'm just going to I don't [818] know go surfing on the weekends or [819] whatever and rent really nice cars [821] that's fine that's kind of option one [823] okay option two and this is what I ended [826] up doing is you try hiring now hiring is [829] obviously where you take everything that [831] has worked for you to get to that point [833] 15 20 [834] $25,000 then you just try and duplicate [836] yourself you try and distill all of the [837] knowledge that has allowed you to you [839] know operate at your current level and [841] give it to like a miniu and then you say [843] okay now you're going to do the client [845] fulfillment you're going to do the work [846] B2B and then I'm going to go find us [847] some more clients and then that way you [849] know we're going to go from $20,000 to [851] $40,000 because they're two of us so I [853] tried this I tried this a number of [855] times when I was going door knocking [856] like a decade ago all right I brought on [857] a couple of guys um you know commission [859] only guys like most door knocking [861] businesses operate as and uh that was [863] where I first realized that like you [865] know how the the old adage like like [866] managers are just like a giant waste of [868] time it's like you know how many [869] managers does Coca-Cola have how many [871] managers does Google have it's like oh [872] they're just their leech is sucking on [874] the business no management is actually [875] very very important because it's very [877] difficult it is very difficult to [879] squeeze as much value as you can out of [881] people to consistently motivate them to [883] do the thing that they signed up to do [885] to to hold them accountable to deadlines [886] and to make sure that they do um you [888] know the the work that your organization [890] needs to have done in order to grow and [892] you know if I'm honest my management [894] shops just were not were not it dog so I [896] mean I tried hiring with my door-to-door [897] business did not work well I tried [899] hiring with my um writing company and [901] that was fine because I wasn't actually [903] responsible for the vast majority of the [904] day-to-day management um I tried hiring [906] for my my my automation agency and my AI [908] company as well and I got to be honest I [911] am just I don't know whether it's that [912] I'm not a good manager I don't know [913] whether it's that I expect too much out [915] of people for the money that I pay them [916] I I don't know I just have some problem [917] with it um which I'm really grateful for [919] by the way because it made me not have [920] to go down this route but for whatever [921] reason hiring just did not work so I [924] spent quite a large amount of my time um [926] in that hiring milu um and yeah you know [929] it was it it was okay it was okay I'm [931] not going to say that it was like [932] terrible uh but you know one month I [935] might have made like $35,000 but now I [937] had to like pay $155,000 to three staff [939] members so it's like okay previously [941] when I was solo preneur I was making [943] $20,000 and it was just me and I didn't [944] have to deal with any management [945] headaches now I'm making $155,000 and [948] I'm also responsible for three people's [950] you know occasional screw-ups training [952] management I got to do meetings I was [953] working even more at that point and yeah [956] um you know like my calendar ended being [959] packed with even more meetings so like [960] is that really the sort of Lifestyle I [961] wanted to live no um not to mention you [963] know at the current stage of my my [965] ceiling I was also running into an issue [967] where like a lot of my my repeat Revenue [969] like some of my repeat Revenue would [970] churn because of the poor quality [971] experience that they had with one of my [973] um you know one of my contractors or [975] Engineers so this is was not this was [976] not a good idea this just did not enable [978] me to to make any money so the root [981] problem I realized was not necessarily a [984] lack of Manpower okay it was not that [986] you know I had this thing which enabled [987] me to go from zero to 20 to 25k a month [990] which was these custom projects it's not [991] that I just took that thing and then I [993] scaled it up and doubled and tripled it [995] okay the real problem was that what got [998] me here won't get me there I can't just [999] duplicate that approach if I want to do [1001] something bigger at scale um I needed to [1004] find like a fundamentally new way and so [1006] I found that fundamentally new way and [1008] the fundamentally new way was that third [1009] route which I haven't talked about yet [1011] the third route is finding leverage so [1014] the third major phase that I had to go [1016] through involved me breaking out of that [1018] $25,000 mon ceiling was creating [1020] leverage through productization if [1022] you've watched a couple of my videos on [1024] business Consulting and sort of systems [1025] before you'll know that I've talked [1026] about productization quite a bit and [1028] there a variety of leaders that I looked [1029] up to that have taught me a lot about [1031] what I know um regarding productization [1033] but at the time okay all I really knew [1036] was that I need to take all of the stuff [1038] that I'm doing right now and I just need [1040] to list what am I actually giving [1043] clients okay how much of the work that I [1045] am doing is actually going towards the [1047] end product that my customers are seeing [1049] okay what results are my customers [1051] paying for because it's one thing to [1053] like build a custom project where 90% of [1055] the work that you put in is invisible [1056] and nobody sees it okay and it's another [1058] thing to think about it from this [1060] perspective where it's like what do [1061] customers actually see of all the work [1063] that I do sure I'm building automations [1065] or writing content or whatever there's a [1066] lot of work that goes into things but [1067] how much of that is actually making it [1069] to like the customer's desk and how much [1070] are they actually evaluating how worthy [1073] or how much value my services based off [1075] of so what I did is I basically took all [1077] the custom projects that I done over the [1079] course of the last few months and I [1080] broke them all down okay when I broke [1083] them all down I noticed that they were [1084] grouping into three or four major bins [1086] the first was cold email lead gen [1087] systems I was doing a ton of cold email [1089] lead genen systems primarily through [1090] instantly a couple through other [1092] platforms where basically I would go and [1094] I'd find leads for a business I would [1096] scrape them using some sort of scraper [1097] that I developed usually custom I would [1099] process those leads enrich them maybe [1101] I'd throw in some personalization here [1103] or there and then I would add them to [1104] this big mailbox called Outreach [1106] platform and then spam out a bunch of [1107] emails and you know because very few [1109] people are doing this at the time and [1110] because I was doing it for myself I kind [1111] of had like that unfair advantage and [1113] you know I ended up uh delivering a ton [1115] of value for these clients relative to [1117] the money that they were paying me the [1118] issue is was obviously not standardized [1121] another big thing I was doing I was [1122] doing proposal automation workflows so [1124] um many of you guys have probably seen [1125] me build out these proposal generators [1127] but essentially like when you're on a [1128] sales call with a customer quick and [1130] easy um thing to do in that sales call [1133] is for you to have a little form in [1134] front of you you to ask the customer [1136] questions like okay like what is your [1138] name you know uh what is your email [1139] address all right awesome cool so what [1141] would you say your major problem is then [1142] you actually go through and you you you [1143] write some summarized version of their [1145] problem then you just press okay on a [1147] form and then before the meeting is even [1148] done you have a nice beautiful proposal [1150] generated by AI in your hands that you [1152] can give to them so this is something [1153] that very few people are doing at the [1154] time now it's relatively common place [1156] but um this is something that you know a [1157] lot of people wanted from me um data [1159] processing and just Integrations just [1161] just in general like kind of oneoff [1163] connectors okay um you know uh like like [1166] like like like data Pipelines a lot of [1169] people had data in one place and they [1170] wanted to duplicate to another place I [1172] realized that you know I could I I could [1175] group a bunch of these projects together [1176] and then it ended up just being very [1177] similar it was sort of just like a [1178] connector a USBC Port that went [1180] somewhere in there standardized the way [1182] the data went from one spreadsheet to [1184] another and then another one was a [1185] monthly automation maintenance so I had [1187] a lot of people that were asking me to [1188] like maintain systems like content [1189] generators and stuff like that hey Nick [1191] can you make a little update here hey [1192] Nick can you make a little update there [1193] and I thought to myself okay like why [1194] don't I just group this under the [1195] umbrella monthly automation maintenance [1198] and so you know basically previously [1200] what I was doing was every time I get a [1201] new client I would do a super in-depth [1203] consultation with them I'd ask them all [1205] about their needs I'd walk them through [1207] my own process and which at the time is [1209] just a hodge podge of a bunch of BS if [1210] I'm honest and then I would go and I do [1212] their custom thing but once I realize [1214] that these four groups of mine are [1217] basically just the same thing every time [1220] the only thing is sometimes it's with [1221] this software platform sometimes it's [1223] for that software platform sometimes [1224] they want to log to a Google sheet [1225] sometimes they don't when I realized [1227] that it was all just the same time the [1229] same thing I I realized wait a second [1231] why aren't I just templating this like [1232] can't I just like create templates of [1234] all these things that get me 80% of the [1236] way there and then I could still provide [1237] the custom experience but then I could [1239] just sell cold email Legion systems [1240] proposal automation systems data [1242] connectors crms U monthly automation [1244] maintenance why don't I try that so I [1248] mean you know for a guy that prided [1250] himself on on automation I definitely [1252] was not automating my own workflow you [1254] know so for cold email systems for [1256] instance I developed a very simple [1257] framework that could be customized for [1259] different Industries but um maintained [1261] for the same like core architecture like [1262] like it was always basically the same [1264] idea so like you know four steps I would [1266] I would I would identify the lead Source [1267] I would scrape the lead Source I would [1268] enrich the lead source and then I'd like [1270] do copyrighting and and run the [1271] campaigns right um previously this old [1275] this cold email system because it was so [1276] customized and I was always rebuilding [1278] the damn same wheel from scratch sorry I [1279] just got something in my eye it would [1281] take me like 30 to 40 hours to build it [1283] would basically be like a full-time [1284] thing like for one particular Clan I [1285] don't know I might make like 5,000 bucks [1287] off it or whatever but like think about [1288] it that's a that's a crazy amount of [1289] time how are you supposed to scale your [1290] business if you got 160 hours a month [1293] and you spend a quarter of those hours [1295] every week then you can only ever make [1296] you know four times whatever that [1297] project is making you per week in my [1299] case about $220,000 so if I kind of just [1302] compare the two before productization I [1304] would do a custom project it would cost [1306] me 40 hours okay and maybe I would do [1309] $125 an hourish I'd make $5,000 okay [1312] meaning that I would my my my Revenue [1314] per hour my my hourly rate which is all [1316] I really care about is $125 [1319] now after I productized I would build a [1321] templated solution that gets me 80% of [1323] the way there so now it only takes me 5 [1326] hours okay five hours times my internal [1328] hourly rate of $125 an hour means like [1331] you know if I hired an engineer do this [1333] or whatever which I always like to [1333] calculate in my head it would cost me [1335] $625 to do but I would still charge my [1338] client $5,000 or maybe I'd make some [1340] allowances $4,000 $5,000 here okay so I [1343] just want you to think about it um the [1344] first scenario was $5,000 divided by uh [1348] 40 That's equal to 125 the second [1351] scenario is $5,000 divided 5 that's [1354] equal to ,000 so my hourly rate had [1356] literally skyrocketed to $1,000 an hour [1360] with one simple trick that the gurus [1361] won't tell you uh which is just a make [1363] freaking make.com templates and you know [1365] I was suddenly eight times more [1367] efficient I just want you to think about [1369] that if my previous cap was 20ish th000 [1371] a month $25,000 a month uh if I just [1374] multiplied that by eight I could be [1375] making like $100,000 a month right so [1378] that is that's scale that's [1380] leverage um and because of that you know [1382] and because all of a sudden that stopped [1384] being a bottleneck the amount of work [1385] that I was doing I did lower prices so [1387] instead of me charging $5,000 for that [1388] same system I might now charge $2,500 [1391] and make $500 an hour instead of $1,000 [1393] an hour but then I'd get you know one [1395] and a half times as many clients then [1396] I'd also get all the additional benefits [1397] that having many customers gives you [1399] like every customer that comes into your [1400] business has what's called a referral [1401] multiplier there's some small chance [1403] that if you work with them they'll give [1404] a referral to um somebody else to you so [1407] maybe it's like 10% in which case if [1409] somebody pays you $2,500 they're not [1410] actually just paying you $2,500 they're [1412] paying you like 1.1 time 2500 which is [1415] $2,750 if you just think about it that [1417] way customer lifetime value math can get [1419] really deep but I'll leave it there um [1421] the point that I'm making is I was able [1422] to like make some strategic shifts in [1424] terms of how I did my business um that [1425] enabled me to grow and then reach more [1427] people more people than I'd ever met [1428] before uh and then my next major step [1430] was you know I took this this system of [1433] oneoff projects basically that I'd [1435] created and then I started shifting them [1437] all from these oneup projects to monthly [1439] retainers and then I also started [1440] shifting my monthly retainers into like [1442] subscription packages which did not take [1443] me an hour so just from a bird's eye [1445] view what what I'm doing here is I'm I'm [1447] not just scaling up my business like [1449] most other people think I'm [1451] fundamentally changing the shape and [1453] nature of my business as I grow so that [1456] um you know I I I double and triple and [1458] quadruple down on what works I cut out [1460] all the fluff and then essentially I can [1461] still continue growing without having to [1463] sacrifice my margins and without having [1465] to hire a big slow expensive team so you [1468] know obviously there's a lot that I can [1469] go into detail on that there but I think [1471] I'll just leave it at that every [1473] approach every new client every template [1477] every that I did was just [1479] 100% like I I turned every one of those [1482] things into an asset and then I took all [1484] of those assets and then you know those [1486] would help my next client so my business [1488] just became this snowball which was [1490] pretty fantastic and uh yeah I consider [1492] that true leverage right but one thing [1494] that I'll say is and this is the end of [1496] phase three and the beginning of phase 4 [1498] which is where I'm at right now one [1499] thing that I'll say is there are still [1501] limitations to this obviously the bigger [1504] that you grow the harder that it is to [1506] maintain all this and so because um I [1509] thought that there were some inherent [1510] limitations to the agency model I [1512] decided I have to I would have to change [1514] the shape of my business even further if [1515] I were to continue growing as a solar [1517] printer anyway and that's the constraint [1518] that I put on myself that's what got me [1520] to phase four which I call um content as [1523] leverage so even with my business which [1525] I'd scaled at that point to $72,000 a [1527] month even with my business running [1529] efficiently with very very high margins [1531] I started noticing that you know there [1532] were only a certain number of clients [1533] that I could personally manage and I did [1535] like to personally manage these CLI [1536] because obviously have great [1537] relationships with them these people pay [1539] me a lot more money when they like the [1540] work that Nick does they're a lot more [1542] likely to want to work with Nick after [1543] right I also noticed there was a direct [1545] relationship between the time that I was [1547] spending and then my income and then I [1549] also had a lot of Reliance on outbound [1550] marketing methods by that point like [1551] cold email for instance which was doing [1553] you know the vast majority of my [1554] business I was still doing upwork [1556] applications and stuff like that but um [1558] yeah definitely more more towards cold [1559] email just because of how leverage it is [1561] so because of these you know I kind of [1563] had a thought to myself and it kind of [1565] all came to a for like what is the [1567] maximum hourly rate that I could make [1571] logically as an agency not the hourly [1573] rate that I am showing to people but the [1575] hourly rate that like I'm getting paid [1577] kind of behind closed doors I was just [1579] talking earlier about a th000 bucks an [1580] hour for a system right and you can make [1582] a th000 bucks an hour for a system um [1584] you know but like how much more can you [1586] make I kind of did some math I kind of [1588] thought a lot about it I thought a lot [1589] about the opportunity and the various [1591] systems I could do and I tried building [1592] out a bunch of products and services or [1593] whatever this this last me maybe a month [1595] or so but I realized like okay I'm [1596] probably not ever going to be able to [1597] make more than like 2,000 bucks 3,000 [1600] bucks an hour somewhere around there and [1602] I mean that's amazing I mean that's some [1603] people's whole monthly wage and you know [1605] if you can make it an hour fantastic but [1607] you know there's there's some additional [1608] Nuance there as well it's like okay like [1610] you can make $3,000 an hour if you have [1612] available work but can you find that [1614] much work no you're outbound lead [1616] generation and you as a sole salesperson [1618] do eventually end up being um a big [1620] bottleneck sorry just getting a call so [1622] logically I have a ceiling to that [1624] hourly rate with this business shape [1625] right so I'm gonna have to change [1626] business shapes if I'm going to want to [1628] succeed so I thought about this for [1630] quite a bit I actually ended up taking a [1631] trip to Mexico with one of my really [1632] good friends his name is Zach um we went [1635] to a small island in the Caribbean and [1637] the whole point was just to like unwind [1639] and just do a bunch of like business [1640] reflection and stuff like that and Zach [1642] came from this coaching and Consulting [1643] background he came from a background [1644] where he was working essentially as like [1646] the first mate or partner to a bunch of [1647] you know big big dudes that were running [1649] their coaching and Consulting offers all [1651] the way up to you know maybe a million [1652] dollars a month or so so he inherently [1655] understood the scalability of that [1656] business model and you know I also being [1659] a very intelligent guy we just kind of [1660] like rocking back and forth on like the [1662] rooftop of some Airbnb you know with the [1664] sun setting smoking fat cigars we kind [1666] of worked through some of the issues [1667] that I was having at the time and one of [1669] the main major issues was obviously that [1670] arly rate another major issue was okay [1672] like in order for me to sell right now [1673] I'm getting on a call and I'm working [1675] through people and his solution was [1676] basically like well listen you know what [1677] a lot of people are to do now a lot of [1679] people with money that have successful [1681] agencies is they will start these [1682] content Brands and they will use these [1685] Brands as passive sales materials that [1687] will sell people in your audience on [1690] your value so that you don't actually [1691] have to be there in person on a sales [1693] call talking them through it you don't [1695] you know actually have to be like the [1696] one recording the loom video to you [1698] don't have to do one loom video per [1699] person okay you can do one video sell to [1702] 10,000 people and you know he's like [1705] that's super high leverage then you [1706] could form some sort of information [1707] product then maybe you could like Branch [1709] out so that you're not entirely rying on [1710] your agency revenue and I mean like it's [1712] not like he just like gave all this to [1713] me in a you know gift box or whatever [1715] like obviously there was a lot of back [1716] and forth and we kind of like hammered [1718] out exactly how I was going to take that [1719] next step and I'm forever grateful to [1720] him for that but yeah after that trip [1722] you know when I got home I I sort of Hit [1724] the hit the ground running with renewed [1725] Vigor like at the point you know I I was [1727] making consistently somewhere between 50 [1729] to $70,000 a month I had a lot of money [1732] and income and I had a lot of you know I [1736] I had a lot of resources so when you're [1738] at a point where you have a lot of [1739] resources but like you you're kind of [1740] capping out in plateauing what you have [1742] to do is you basically have to take a [1743] portion of those resources and you have [1744] to invest them in research and [1745] development your R&D fund big companies [1747] do this all the time but my R&D fund was [1750] YouTube I was like all right cool so you [1752] know we talked about contentless [1753] leverage we talked about like [1754] information products and then we talked [1755] about um selling while I slept [1757] essentially so what are some ways I [1758] could do that and one of the ways that I [1760] thought to do that was YouTube so what I [1762] did is well I actually ended up letting [1764] a client or two of mine go just because [1766] the time demands were so crazy I took [1768] additional time and then I spent it [1770] directly on recording content every day [1772] and I just did this as a total [1773] experiment it was like research and [1774] development basically for about a month [1776] or so um and I said to myself you know [1778] I'm just going to take the same [1779] principles that have enabled me to be [1780] successful here at this agency uh which [1782] you know in large part are consistency [1784] and then I'm just going to I'm just [1786] going to do a video every day just [1787] talking about my success and I'm just [1788] going to see where I land so that's [1790] exactly what I did I started recording [1791] consistent YouTube videos in February [1792] the 7th I recorded like 30 until March [1794] the 7th or 8th or something like that [1797] then by the end of the month I had some [1798] like 3,450 subscribers so my subscriber [1800] count had actually gone up a ton which [1802] is pretty sweet and you know obviously [1804] um the second that you start having [1805] subscribers you start having [1806] distribution you could start thinking [1807] okay like now that I have this what can [1808] I do with it but I want you guys to know [1810] that this whole time I was I was not [1812] 100% sure this would work this is [1813] literally just another experiment that I [1815] was doing I was going to experiment with [1817] dozens of different approaches dozens of [1818] different platforms and dozens of [1820] different ideas I just so happened to [1822] land on YouTube as my second or third [1825] and then that just so happened to [1826] actually work okay so I didn't actually [1829] make any money off this for the first [1830] couple of months by the way um the [1832] videos were not selling entirely for me [1834] but one thing that I found really [1835] interesting that I noted was the people [1838] that I was getting through cold Outreach [1839] okay they would actually like Google me [1842] and they would find some of my videos [1843] and they would watch my videos and then [1844] when they' come on the call they'd say [1846] something like hey you know it's crazy [1847] you know I was just watching one of your [1849] videos can you give me this thing and I [1852] was like huh so my sales actually became [1854] a lot easier the second that I had my [1856] warm content selling for me basically [1858] because even if I got somebody totally [1859] cold once they were interested enough to [1861] want to sit down on a call with me [1862] what's the number one thing that people [1863] will do they'll obviously Google you and [1865] if the first five things are just like [1866] links to a video about you building a [1868] system some of them which are very [1869] similar to the systems that that I said [1870] that I was going to build for you [1872] obviously you're a little intrigued [1873] obviously watch some my content so yeah [1875] what's really interesting is a bunch of [1876] my initial Subs were actually like [1877] people that I had sent Outreach to [1879] through cold email and stuff like that [1880] um and I got so lucrative well it got so [1885] interestingly there was so much [1886] Serendipity that I I eventually started [1888] adding lines at the end of my emails [1889] like PS Google me if you're curious so [1892] that a bunch of people that even weren't [1893] entirely sure whether they wanted to [1894] work with me would still Google me [1895] they'd watch my videos and they'd come [1896] into my funnel so that was great another [1900] thing that I talked about with my friend [1901] Zach just before I ended up doing this [1902] was that content provides compound [1904] returns in a way that Services never do [1906] because a service deliverer generates [1907] Revenue once okay for for the most part [1909] there's some exceptions with some [1910] automated systems but if I created a [1912] YouTube video today I could [1913] realistically see returns off of that [1915] YouTube video for the next 5 years [1916] assuming it's Evergreen content and that [1918] is leverage right I've made a lot of [1920] money off of YouTube now but if I [1922] stopped recording and stopped publishing [1923] today I would still continue making [1925] money off of YouTube for the next five [1926] or 10 years it's crazy right like [1928] obviously not all of my content some of [1930] my content is very time specific hype [1931] specific bubble specific whatever you [1932] want to call it but some of my longer [1934] content is like you know Timeless [1936] Concepts that I will realistically be [1937] able to make money off of for a very [1938] long time so yeah YouTube is in my case [1942] just ended up being so many different [1943] forms of Leverage for me it was a 247 [1945] sales team that worked while I slept it [1948] was a lead nurturing mechanism it was a [1951] um and you know it ended up being like a [1953] like a discovery or distribution [1954] mechanism um and then it ended up even [1956] paying me ad revenue on top of that [1957] which is crazy now the ad revenue is [1958] like you know very small portion of my [1959] total income but still so yeah you know [1963] as as my channel grew I started looking [1965] at opportunities to do that information [1966] product route that uh my buddy Zach was [1968] telling me about and I sort of bended it [1969] into a few categories one of them was um [1972] templates for the systems that I was [1973] building um another one was coaching and [1975] consultant Services which was separate [1977] from my my agency Services which [1979] primarily did like implementation um [1981] another one was like I ended up starting [1982] a community and Community products are [1984] fantastic because they're basically like [1985] coaching and Consulting but they're like [1986] a Mr based thing which is f like it's [1989] seriously crazy [1990] Revolution um and then because of that I [1992] was able to you know massively improve [1996] both my distribution continue doing all [1998] the stuff that was making me money up [1999] until that point like with my agency [2000] services but then unlock this whole new [2002] tier of products and I was able to do it [2005] this entire time without ever really [2006] struggling for or wanting for money [2008] cuz one thing that nobody will tell you [2010] is if you try starting a business model [2012] that is super scalable like a SAS [2014] company or an information Product [2015] Company and you have nothing you're at [2017] the start line like I was it takes way [2019] longer to see success than it does if [2021] you start something that's less scalable [2024] like a freelancer or an agency outfit [2026] the way that it works is the scalability [2028] of a business model is basically a [2029] direct odds with the amount of money [2031] that you make right off the bat of that [2033] business model so if you really want to [2035] get both that's what I tell people in [2037] make school and make money with make all [2038] the time if you really want to get both [2041] the key thing that's working today in [2042] the mid 2020s is you start a a freelance [2046] or an agency outfit delivering a service [2049] then eventually you transition to an [2050] information product or a coaching [2052] company teaching people how to do the [2053] service then once you have a massive [2055] distribution pipeline then you build a [2057] software product selling the thing that [2059] that service used to do to a bunch of [2061] those people that are interested in it [2063] or selling something that helps people [2064] deliver that service better key point if [2067] you look at basically anybody that's big [2070] this is more or less what they all did [2071] and how they all started anybody over [2072] the course of the next uh last five or [2074] 10 years now people that are making [2075] hundred million plus that last bit is is [2078] really important and it's something that [2079] I'm considering going into eventually as [2080] well so that seems to be the pipeline [2083] anyway here are a bunch of ways you can [2084] apply these principles to your own [2085] business because this one thing to hear [2086] me yap on and on um story time for [2089] freaking half an hour and I really [2090] appreciate everybody that's still with [2091] me but you know most of you guys are at [2092] the point where it's like all right Nick [2094] how do I actually employ these [2095] approaches in my own company and you [2097] know use them to to hit $100,000 month [2099] Revenue figures and so on so I wanted to [2101] take all of these highle strategies and [2103] high level stories and then convert them [2104] into like a step-by-step list that you [2105] guys could use um here it is and it's [2108] not specific to a automation by the way [2109] you can do this for any business model [2110] as long as it's a B2B [2112] primarily or at least I have experience [2114] with B2B step one is to start with [2117] custom work to understand Market needs [2119] okay when I say start with custom work I [2121] mean don't worry about developing a [2122] product don't worry about developing [2124] anything aside from just your ability as [2126] a service provider or a freelan or an [2128] agency so even though custom projects [2131] are not scalable long term they are the [2132] fastest way to just get your foot in the [2134] door in an industry because the supply [2136] of people willing to do custom projects [2138] is so low that naturally the demand for [2140] your services will be substantially [2141] higher even if you have no other skills [2143] um pay close attention to the problems [2146] that you are consistently asked to solve [2148] these are going to be the foundation of [2150] these products that you're going to [2151] build later like they were for me which [2153] parts of your process as a custom uh [2155] specialist are repeatable so which ones [2158] do you find yourself doing over and over [2159] and over and over again what results the [2161] customer values the most so like when [2163] you actually give your deliverable what [2164] are they focusing on and and and what [2166] are they getting and then how much money [2168] are they paying you for the services and [2170] the ability to solve their needs focus [2171] on your hourly rate now the way that I [2174] see it is custom work is basically a [2176] paid research phase it's like um the [2179] market is paying you to very quickly and [2181] easily accumulate experience uh you know [2184] money and a foothold in the industry now [2188] you're still going to have to do some [2188] work obviously but as long as you treat [2190] this as almost like an information [2192] gathering exercise I find that the work [2194] is is usually nowhere near as big of a [2195] deal like when I'm inherently interested [2197] about something and I inherently want to [2198] uncover and and learn more about how to [2200] do a product or a service or deal with a [2202] new technology it's not really work to [2204] me it's just it's it's fun it's play so [2207] if you frame that first phase in your [2209] mind as play it'll be a lot easier for [2211] you to make it to the second speaking of [2213] the second the second is to document [2215] everything and start creating templates [2217] so you know most people will cap out as [2219] I mentioned and they'll instead of doing [2221] this hire a team that works off of [2223] crappy templates instead okay record [2227] processes for every deliverable my [2228] recommendation is using loom or Google [2231] doc Sops break these complex tasks down [2234] into a step bystep so make sure that you [2237] have them to the point that basically a [2239] monkey could do it not because you're [2240] going to be hiring monkeys but because [2242] this is important in the age of AI where [2244] you can take a step-by-step breakdown [2246] and actually hand it to a model and have [2247] it get 80% of the way there and then [2249] create reusable templates for everything [2251] from proposals to deliverables to client [2253] Communications you should not really be [2255] sending customized emails after I don't [2258] know I want to say like your your [2259] $25,000 to $30,000 month Mark the [2262] communications that you send okay should [2264] not be willy-nilly haphazard you should [2266] actually have like a bank of templates [2267] where after you deliver a project you [2268] just take your client delivery email you [2271] copy and paste it and maybe make a minor [2272] adjustment if you don't get in the habit [2274] of doing this then your ability to scale [2276] past this $225,000 Mark is is it's very [2278] unlikely I guess so just make sure that [2281] once you make it past that custom work [2283] phase and now you're getting more into [2284] higher level projects that you're just [2286] relentlessly documenting everything not [2288] because you're going to hire a team if [2289] you do end up hiring a team later on [2291] down the line fantastic you now have a [2292] giant knowledge base you can hand them [2293] basically for free get them up and [2295] running quick but more for yourself and [2296] for this next phase which is going to be [2299] packaging your services into distinct [2302] products here you take these custom [2304] services that you've been offering and [2306] you transform them all with very clearly [2308] defined um timelines deliverables Scopes [2313] pricing and then concrete outcomes and [2315] time frames okay make sure you know [2318] everything that there is to know about a [2319] particular product and how to deliver it [2321] once you're at that point you can [2322] basically the way that I see it it's [2324] it's like analog versus digital okay [2326] when you listen to like a record player [2329] spit out some amazing music it's really [2331] highdef andite super high quality right [2333] and there are a lot of people out there [2334] that are like oh like you know Bluetooth [2336] headphones sound so different I got to [2338] get get my record in my living room the [2340] reality is 99.9% of people they'll never [2342] be able to tell the difference and [2344] Bluetooth and MP3 these these compressed [2347] file formats and these compressed [2348] technologies that make it really [2349] convenient to to listen to music these [2352] are sufficient or great for 99.99% of [2355] people digitize your work turn your work [2358] from this analog flowy artistic thing [2361] into a concrete set of steps that you do [2364] the same every time if you do 99.9% of [2367] clients will be more than happy with [2369] that and then you'll be able to copy and [2371] paste like you can In Mp3 that same [2373] approach into millions of people's [2374] businesses as well so what I mean by [2377] this is don't sell social media [2378] management anymore okay sell a 30-day [2381] LinkedIn engagement package where you [2382] have specific outcomes specific [2383] deliverables where you have a specific [2385] number of posts that you make and so on [2387] and so on and so forth and then finally [2389] um create systems that reduce your time [2391] investment so once you're done with this [2393] this is where Ai and automation [2394] basically become Force multipliers in [2396] addition to the the productized um [2398] Solutions is leverage like I was [2399] mentioning just now so use AI to [2401] streamline repetitive tasks I mean duh [2403] if you're not already using AI to [2404] streamline repetitive tasks then look [2406] through that giant list of step-by-step [2408] deliverables and step-by-step guides [2409] that you just created and have ai go [2411] through and try creating a bunch of [2413] assets build automated workflows for [2416] client onboarding and also client [2417] handoff just in case you never want to [2419] be spending more than maybe like 45 [2421] minutes to an hour dealing with like the [2423] the the the friction points of the entry [2425] and then exit of a client through your [2427] system system and then ultimately [2428] another big high leverage thing is to [2429] create self- serve resources for [2431] customers like create a Google drive [2433] folder where all of their assets will be [2434] uploaded to create slack channels per [2436] customer where you don't actually have [2438] to deliver the thing that they ask you [2439] for they just go to a slack Channel or a [2441] Google drive or some board somewhere and [2443] they just see everything that they need [2444] as well as maybe a I don't know their [2446] their analytics or their stats or [2447] whatnot we have a couple of additional [2449] steps um shift to recurring Revenue [2451] models this is like the Mr based model [2453] like I was talking about where you go [2455] from having the vast majority of your [2456] business be these one-off projects into [2460] recurring monthly services that deliver [2462] consistent Revenue to you you never want [2464] to be in a spot where like every month [2466] you make $25,000 and then the first day [2468] of the next month your revenue is back [2469] down at zero you want to be at the point [2470] where like let's say you're at 25 Grand [2472] on the 30th day of the last month on the [2474] first day maybe you know one of your [2476] clients turns and now you're down at 20 [2478] the Gap there is so much smaller and [2479] it's so much easier for you to project [2481] your Revenue start making plans then [2483] ultimately you know Implement them over [2484] longer time scales than just a month and [2486] then last but not least the thing that I [2488] did that really enabled me to scale past [2490] $100,000 a month I made over 150,000 [2492] bucks in Revenue last month was leverage [2495] content to attract pre-qualified leads [2498] so choose a platform like YouTube like [2500] LinkedIn um Instagram podcast whatever [2503] like whatever you do just pick one okay [2504] for now pre-commit to a 90-day period of [2508] producing content on that platform [2510] consistently and then just share your [2512] expertise now don't do this if you don't [2514] have a business don't do this if you're [2516] if you're just listening to me right now [2517] and you've never started a business or [2518] you're at the start line of your company [2519] haven't made five or 10 or $5,000 a [2521] month end don't start here okay because [2524] there are a million in one other people [2525] that are starting right where you are [2526] and they think oh I'm going to become a [2527] content creator I'm going to become a [2528] millionaire overnight the reality is [2530] there's so much Supply that there's very [2532] little demand for you I hate to say it [2534] but unless you have some cool [2535] accomplishment like I did when I started [2537] my channel I could confidently say I [2538] made $40,000 last month here's how I did [2540] it you know here's a system that [2541] generates me $20,000 a month unless you [2544] have some noal proof or accomplishment [2546] or something that makes stand out with a [2547] megaphone and the Sea of broadcast [2549] voices you're not going to make it so [2551] only do this at the very end of your [2553] journey only do this when your business [2555] is already big enough that you can mold [2557] it into this really cool content shape [2559] like what I've managed to do here and [2561] when you do it here's some tips to make [2562] sure that you nail it deliver value [2565] constantly your value to um ask ratio [2568] should be 99 to1 at least I recommend [2570] even more when you create content make [2572] sure that 99% of that content is just [2575] giving and if you do have a section in [2578] your content where you're asking to [2579] receive just make sure that it's like [2580] less than 1% of it okay my videos have [2582] like small little CTA sprinkled through [2584] them all but you'll notice they're very [2585] organic I mentioned a product here there [2586] I mentioned a community here there I [2588] really don't harp on it it doesn't even [2589] seem like I'm doing any sort of sales [2591] share your Frameworks share your [2592] methodologies share share everything um [2595] give people free templates give give [2596] people free lead magnets make sure that [2598] everything is as easy as possible for [2599] the customer or for your I guess viewer [2602] to take watch and then do something with [2604] and then ultimately build a library of [2606] content that serves not just as a [2609] distribution channel in of itself but [2610] it'll also help all of your agency and [2612] freelance um outcomes as well if you [2615] start with you know just trying to make [2617] it big on YouTube or whatever you're [2618] going to be missing like half the pie [2620] because that initial period is where [2621] you're going to be transitioning for B2B [2622] services or I should say um like agency [2624] or implementation services to primarily [2626] coaching Consulting ones right like [2628] you're going to miss that whole [2629] transition period where you could be [2630] nurturing leads and helping people solve [2632] problems I mean all videos are are [2634] templated Consulting if you think about [2635] it right so it's just another form of [2637] standardization and productization [2639] similar to what I was doing in phase [2640] three all right so that's all I have for [2642] you guys today I think I've Abed for [2643] almost an hour now so I'll leave it um [2646] the magic glowing rectangle is telling [2647] me I should probably do a CTA here so [2650] yeah let's wrap it up I recommend you [2652] start with custom projects now that got [2653] me at about $25,000 a month but [2655] obviously came with some serious [2656] limitations surrounding scale and I was [2657] also tearing my hair out after you're [2659] done with that you kind of have a a fork [2661] in the road where you can stay where you [2663] are you can choose to hire or you can [2665] build leverage systems I highly [2666] recommend you build leverage systems [2668] that's what I did and that's what [2668] enabled me to continue growing then [2670] eventually after you're done with all [2672] that stuff then you can start thinking [2673] about more scalable business models like [2675] a SAS company or maybe an information [2677] product coaching or consulting company [2679] like me I think that the most powerful [2681] Insight from this is that you know in [2682] today's economy software and services [2685] and artificial intelligence can actually [2687] like make up the bulk of a team you know [2690] if before I needed 10 people to do [2692] something now I have me but it's like [2694] 10x me and it's not because there's [2697] there's like 10 mini mes or I've trained [2698] 10 chat gpts or whatever but it's [2700] because I've been very intentional about [2701] how I set up my business and I always [2702] focus on the highest leverage action [2704] first so you know as you grow the [2706] highest leverage action is going to [2707] change of course when you when when [2709] you're at the beginning make sure that [2710] that's always lead genen when you're at [2711] the middle make sure that [2712] standardization and scaling then when [2714] you get bigger and bigger and bigger [2715] pass $100,000 a month make sure that's [2717] more focused on distribution and then [2719] building a product of some kind that can [2721] subsist uh persist without necessarily [2723] you being around to monitor it if you [2725] guys are interested in Ai and you guys [2727] want to learn how to start your own Ai [2728] and automation agency using the exact [2730] same road map that I implemented in my [2732] own business where I actually like the [2733] whole point of my community maker school [2735] is just to implement that road map and [2737] give it to you on a silver platter with [2739] day-by-day accountability then [2740] definitely check it out link is a first [2742] one that you see in the description um [2744] the price is going up we just hit 1,400 [2746] members so as of the time of this [2747] recording may be a little bit different [2749] when you're watching it do you guys have [2750] any other questions or anything like [2751] that just drop a comment down below and [2753] yeah do all that fun YouTube stuff you [2755] know like subscribe bump me to the top [2756] of the go I'll catch you in the next [2758] video thanks so

Title: The Most Overrated AI Agents (+ What To Sell Instead)
[0] Hey, so a lot of the automations and AI [1] agents that I'm seeing people build [3] online right now demo really well, but [5] they don't actually solve real business [7] problems. They don't actually deliver [8] real value. And as I'm sure you can [10] imagine, that's a problem when you sell [11] it to a customer and they're expecting [12] an ROI. So, what I want to do in this [14] video is I want to show you which things [16] not to sell, which things don't really [18] provide the value that they might be [19] marketed as having, and which systems [21] you can actually go out and sell for [23] anywhere between $1,500 to $10,000 a [25] pop. My name is Nick. If you don't know [27] who I am, I scaled an automation agency [28] to 72K a month. This is basically all I [30] do and I've seen more or less everything [32] in this industry at this point. So, I'm [34] just going to be breaking down the most [35] overrated AI automations and agents and [37] then what to sell instead. So, to get [40] started, this is your average AI agent [42] seller right now, a little bit burnt out [44] and probably not having a good time [45] because the vast majority of their [47] clients are turning. And then this is [49] hopefully going to be you. Super cool. [52] Giga chat. I was told that I should try [53] using memes in these videos. So, [55] engagement rate wise, uh, that's what [57] I'm doing. Okay. So, I got a lot I I [58] want to cover. I mean, like, if we just [59] zoom out a bit, I have a bunch of [60] systems on the right hand side that I'm [62] going to show you that you guys can [63] sell. And then I also have a bunch of [64] systems on the left hand side that I'm [65] going to highly recommend that you don't [66] sell. But let's just start with the very [68] simplest permutation of this, which is [70] what makes an AI automation or an AI [72] agent or a system useless, outdated, or [75] overrated. Okay? And there really a few [77] things the way that I see it. The [79] biggest is false autonomy. So, you know, [81] you'll you'll get somebody interested on [83] the other end of the line for some [84] automation, keeping in mind that the [86] whole the whole idea is that it's [87] automated and then you'll sell them a [89] system and then that system won't [90] actually be automated at all. It will [93] essentially require some sort of [94] constant human monitoring in order to do [96] the thing that uh you sold the person as [98] it being able to do. So, I'm sure you [100] can imagine if you guys sell something [101] that you market as autonomous and then [104] later have to do a bunch of maintaining [106] um you know, the person that you sold [108] the thing to is probably not going to [109] like it. That's going to lead to low [110] retention. It's going to lead to you not [111] getting a follow-up project with the [112] client, and it's going to lead to just [113] like general dissatisfaction, which I [115] think we should just avoid, right? We [116] want to deliver good things to to [117] clients. The next big thing is [118] unreliable execution. So, what I'm [120] seeing a lot of these AI agent flows do [122] in particular is, you know, they they're [124] really flexible and they're great, but [125] that flexibility with AI is always at [127] odds with reliability, right? Um, you [129] can see flexibility is both a pro and a [131] con. A lot of the time for an [132] established business, they have some [133] business process that already generates [135] them money and they just want you to [137] automate it and scale it up. So, if you [139] think about it in that way, flexibility [141] a lot of the time is not a benefit. It's [143] actually like a it's actually like a [144] drawback, right? You don't want the [146] system to be flexible. If you have a [147] pipeline that's working freaking [149] amazingly, okay, and I don't know, I'm [152] just going to draw a little pipeline [153] example from left to right. I swear that [155] is not what you guys all probably think [156] it is. Okay. Oh my god, that's getting [160] even worse. Okay. Anyway, um let's say [162] you have a pipeline. [164] Okay. I'm never beating the allegations. [167] And uh the way this pipeline works is [169] you know you have a new leads or [171] whatever on one end and then on the [173] other end you have a bunch of money. If [174] you think about it this is more or less [176] like a business. Okay businesses you [179] conceptualize any business is just a [180] pipeline where you get some lead in at [182] the front end and then you perform some [184] process in the middle and then that [186] process results in money. This is a very [188] particular sort of process. Why would a [190] business that already has one of these [192] things that's making, I don't know, [193] let's say 100K a month or something want [195] an AI agent that starts, you know, [198] putting stuff in other pipelines that [200] may not deliver the same sort of result. [202] Why would we want something that is [203] inflexible? If this is even a 1 to 5% [206] error rate on both sides of this, okay, [208] that's like, you know, you're you're [210] immediately shaving off like two to [211] maybe 10% of your profit and you're [213] diverting a lot of value from this [215] really well-established pipeline into [217] these errors and rabbit holes and other [220] sorts of processes. Businesses don't [221] really want this in practice. I know [222] that wasn't the best um explanation, but [224] if you guys want to be automation [225] engineers, automation specialists, don't [227] focus on like building new things from [228] scratch for customers to start. focus on [230] taking an established process that's [232] already generating some sort of revenue [233] for them and then just making that a [234] little bit better because a 5% [235] improvement to something that makes you [237] know 100 grand a month is going to make [239] the customer at least 105 grand a month [241] and then you can justify charging some [243] fraction of the five grand a month in [244] value you're providing the third major [246] problem that I see is no tangible output [248] okay and this is a really big problem at [249] the end of the day the automations that [251] we're building are pretty ephemeral [252] they're pretty abstract right they're [254] basically just a bunch of cloud services [256] that just connect between each other and [257] send and shuttle data to and to and from [259] If you think about it from the business [260] perspective, most business owners do not [262] inherently understand what these systems [264] are doing. They find it really hard to [265] ascribe value to the systems because [267] there's just a bunch of cloud server [268] HTTP calls and stuff, right? So, the [270] number one way to make your system a lot [273] more valuable and charge a lot more [274] money for it is when you provide some [276] sort of tangible output to the customer. [278] What I mean by tangible is focus on [279] things that they can like see, touch, or [281] feel. So, stuff like a document that [283] your thing outputs, stuff like an [284] update, some notifications, stuff like [286] some metrics, a dashboard, a [287] visualization. You know, if you generate [289] a lead for a client, don't just generate [290] a lead in a CRM or whatever. Generate a [293] lead in a CRM and then give them an [294] update saying, "Hey, we just generated [295] you a new lead." And what I see is a lot [297] of these agent systems, they I don't [299] know, they're just not really well [299] thought out for that purpose. I think a [301] lot of the things that people are [302] talking about now are probably they're [303] cool and they're focused on new [306] developments in the space, but they're [307] not actually focused on things that like [308] make money, you know? They're like [309] they're shiny objects essentially, which [311] is actually the the next thing that I [312] wanted to talk about. So, a lot of these [313] systems are shiny. They're focused on [315] novelty and like, "Wow, this new [317] gamechanging platform just came out. You [319] should really use it in your business." [320] But it's like, you're kind of putting [320] the cart before the horse. You know, [322] you're losing the forest for the trees. [323] Just because this new technology came [324] out doesn't mean you should apply it to [325] your business. What you should do is you [327] should see if that new technology allows [328] you to solve a pre-existing business [329] need better. And what are some [330] pre-existing business needs? Like [332] revenue, like like savings, payroll, [334] headcount, right? These are things that [335] actual good and valuable automations [337] actually focus on. Another one is high [339] maintenance. This sort of feeds into [340] that first one, but essentially a lot of [341] these flows that I'm seeing need [342] constant fixing, debugging, or handling. [344] So you might build a cool chatbot or [346] something for a customer. And then at [347] the end of the day, you know, after the [349] first day, like a client's going to be [350] like, "Hey, can you make this adjustment [351] to the chat bot? I don't really like how [352] it how it um how it talks, but like you [355] know, put yourself in the shoes of the" [357] and you know, a lot of you guys are [358] probably like actually experiencing this [359] right now cuz a lot of you guys got [360] stoked on selling chat bots and are [362] doing it. How much control do you [363] actually have over the output? Did you [364] train the AI model? No, you did not. Did [367] you put all the infrastructure and all [369] the GPUs in place to do it? Did you give [371] it the data set? No, you didn't do any [372] of that stuff, right? We're engineers [374] that are taking a a thing that's been [376] developed and then we're applying it, [377] but we actually have limited control [378] over the thing itself. Sure, we could [380] prompt better and sure we could tell it, [381] hey, can you please not say that thing [382] that the client doesn't want me to say? [384] But you you can't actually fully control [385] it. So then you need to constantly [386] maintain it. It's super annoying. You [388] constantly debugging. Another major [390] issue is that it's easily commoditized. [391] So what I mean by this is there's just [393] some lowhanging fruit here where you [394] know things are going to be replaced by [395] features from OpenAI, Microsoft or [397] Google pretty soon. So a good example of [398] that is like the image generators, [399] right? Like if you build your entire [401] business and AI automation isn't exactly [403] this, but let's say you started like a [404] SAS company and you build your entire [405] business around AI image generation and [407] then a week ago [409] GPT4's AI image generation drops and [411] it's just like way better than [412] everybody's and you could do it through [413] like a chat interface and now they're [414] dropping like a visual drag and drop [416] thing like you know how sustainable is [417] that business over the long term? [419] Probably not. Another one is uh that it [420] solves non-urgent problems. A lot of the [422] systems that I'm seeing don't tie [423] directly to revenue, cost or time [424] leverage. These are the three big things [425] that I always cite in my YouTube videos [427] and my communities. Maker School, make [429] moneywithmake.com. Essentially, these [430] are just things that business owners [432] actually care about. Like, let's be [433] real. We're all in business here to make [435] money. Like, it'd be nice if we could do [436] so with like our Optimus robots serving [438] us food and, you know, us listening to [441] AI generated music and all this stuff, [442] but all these are really distractions at [443] the end of the day. Like, the technology [444] itself is not the end goal here. I don't [446] think for most of us. The end goal is us [448] building, you know, a lifestyle that [450] enables us to not have to be wedded to [451] work. And then the fact that we can do [453] it all from our laptops is dragging and [455] dropping some modules across the screen [456] and having some sort of minimal contact [457] with clients. Like that's the end goal, [459] right? Uh security, safety, feed our [461] families, experience things that 99% of [463] people will never be able to experience. [464] That's that's the goal. I don't think [466] the goal is actually just like hunching [467] over some new piece of technology and [469] trying to understand like the [470] transformer architecture, right? As as [472] dope as that is and as as enjoyable it [474] is to be curious about that stuff. Most [476] people here aren't here for that. So, [477] just want to make sure that we're [478] solving the things that matter and the [480] things that actually drive us towards [481] generating revenue. Another one is lacks [483] defensibility. So, anyone can copy or [485] undercut it with a cheap subscription. [486] Um, I just mean like there's some SAS [488] products out there that just do some of [490] the things that we are, you know, that I [491] see people selling and they just do it [492] way better. So, it's like why don't I [494] just spend $5 a month for a SAS [495] subscription with a 99.9% uptime [497] guarantee. Then finally, there's a lot [499] that have bad risk to rewards ratios. [501] This is one of the most important parts. [502] I put this at the end here. Um, but uh [504] this is one of the most important parts. [505] It's like I see a lot of people trying [506] to automate things that will save them a [509] tiny bit of money. A good example of [511] this is like an AI outbound caller or [512] something. Saves them a tiny bit of [514] money and the cost is $100,000 a month [517] in opportunity. Okay, I'll I'll cover [520] more about exactly which systems have [522] all of these problems. Um but you know, [523] just from a bird's eye perspective, um [525] yeah, I just wanted to give you guys [527] sort of sort of a run through [530] um of what that looks like. So AI agents [535] don't make [538] money. Change my mind. I mean, I know [540] this guy's blowing up all over the [541] place, or he was a few years ago, but [542] yeah, this is this is basically me here. [544] Agents don't really make people money [546] right now. So, that's the reality [548] situation. So, let's start it off with [550] some things that you should not be [551] charging money for or things that I [553] don't personally recommend that you [554] build as of the time of this recording. [556] Um, I should also just add a disclaimer [557] like technology is going to get better [558] and so some of the issues that I'm [560] describing with these software platforms [561] and tools, they are going to improve. [563] So, you know, if you're watching this in [564] like 2032, like odds are a lot of these [566] problems have been solved, and maybe you [568] can actually go about selling them and [569] delivering an ROI. But I care about like [571] what we're doing today, and that's [572] really the value here. Um, the first is [574] basic chat bots and FAQ systems. So, the [576] idea is that you have some sort of Q&A [578] system on your website. It's usually [579] some sort of GPT powered bot, you know, [581] through like an NAN agent that just [582] regurgitates fat content. And the issue [584] with this is it's usually like rag. Rags [587] stands for retrieval augmented [588] generation which uh basically means like [590] your chatbot just performs a mini Google [593] search over your own data to try and [595] find the snippet of text that is [597] relevant to answer the question. Once it [598] finds that then you inject it into the [600] prompt then the chatbot uses that [602] alongside its prompt to answer. So I [604] mean you know it sounds really cool and [606] stuff but you know I've sold a few of [607] these at this point and um the promise [609] which is that they're 24/7 customer [611] support replacements. This is the [612] promise that most people are making not [613] the promise that I make. the promise [615] that it's a 247 customer support [616] replacement. Uh, I mean, it's it's it's [618] it's not really there. It's not really [620] at the point where it's a 247 customer [621] support replacement. Sure, you can [623] answer really simple questions, but I [624] got to be honest, if somebody's at the [625] point where they're like talking to a [626] chatbot to try and answer a question, if [629] they're that motivated to answer a [630] specific question and like there's a [632] section on your website that just [633] answers that question, then they're just [635] going to answer it in on the section on [636] their on your website. You know what I [638] mean? Like if you have a section of your [639] website on your lander called like the [641] FAQ, like they're just going to go to [642] the FAQ, scroll down, they're going to [644] see their question, they're going to [644] click it, they're going to read it. Like [645] you don't actually need to have this [646] back and forth cool, you know, chat [648] experience. This to me is like the [650] definition of losing the cart for the [652] horse. You know, you have some cool [653] shiny object in the bottom right hand [654] corner that just takes away from like [656] all the information that you are laying [657] out in your website anyway. Um why have [659] like a crappy answer when you could just [661] have the best answer ever? So, in [663] practice, uh, you know, people use these [665] and some companies are using these like [666] semi-successfully, but definitely not [667] for 24/7 customer support replacement. [670] The main cons are they have pretty low [671] engagement rates. In practice, most [672] visitors ignore them because they're [673] just like, "Oh, this is an AI bot, so [675] it's just bound to be low quality." And [676] most people, to be honest, just still [677] don't really trust AI. They don't really [679] think AI is as good as a human being. [681] And I think most of them are right for [682] it. It also can hallucinate answers and [685] outside their knowledge base. Has a very [687] minimal impact on conversion. like I [689] don't think this increases it at all, [691] but I did say that, you know, like could [693] increase it a little bit. Um, but again, [695] I I don't think this is actually really [696] improving things. I also find that in [699] order to like make it good and [700] consistent, it does require extensive [702] prompt engineering which just ends up [703] taking a ton of time and then there's [704] always that like back and forth with the [706] client on on, you know, this isn't [707] saying that sort of thing that I want to [708] do. Um, a lot of people like jailbreak [711] it and then end up just using it for [712] their own stuff. So, I don't know, like [714] generate me hot pics of Scarlett [715] Johansson. Most businesses also already [717] have FAQ pages that do the same job or [719] FAQ sections in their website. Or if [721] you're smart, to be honest, you will [722] just answer all the questions that a [723] person could ask the bot just through [725] the website itself. Like they read it [727] top to bottom. They know 90% of the [728] stuff and then they're motivated to buy. [730] This thing isn't really doing a lot that [732] um good website design or good [734] copywriting will solve. Obviously, there [736] are some limited pros, which is that it [737] takes like 5 minutes or 13 minutes or [739] however many minutes. in my previous [740] video where I showed you guys how to do [741] this setup can handle some basic [744] repetitive inquiries and it can reduce [746] support tickets for common questions. [747] So, um this is actually pretty good for [749] like a back-end system. So, like if this [752] is like a customer support agent and [754] they're already a customer and they're [756] asking like, "Hey, can you do this super [758] templated process? Can you initiate a [760] refund?" Like like Amazon has a great [761] example of this. They have like a refund [763] bot basically where if you go down the [765] refund route, you're like, "Hey, I'd [766] like a refund." The bot literally just [768] calculates. It's it's the funniest [769] thing. The bot literally takes how much [771] money have you spent with Amazon in the [772] last year or something and then how much [774] money have you requested in refunds and [776] if that ratio is below a certain thing, [779] they will just give you your money back [780] immediately. Like that's a great example [781] of a bot that's probably going to work [784] 99.9999% of the time because it's like a [786] procedural equation. Amazon's just like, [789] "All right, like let's just keep our [790] refund uh total down to like 3% or less. [793] If it's 2.5%, we'll just give them the [795] refund and then they don't need to worry [796] about it and they don't need to hassle [797] our customer agents like our actual [798] humans, right? Like that that's a good [800] example of one that works. But usually [801] on the front end, you're not doing that. [802] You're not giving people money and [803] you're not actually going through that [805] process. So yeah, the promise here is [807] that it's 24/7 customer support reduces [809] support costs, increases conversions. In [811] the reality, um it does basically none [813] of those things. Okay. Um there are a [816] couple of alternatives to that. [818] Obviously, human support for complex [819] queries, like if there's a human being [821] that's online that happens to be able to [822] answer that question, people are going [824] to want to communicate with that more [825] and you're going to get more perceived [826] like brand value if there's a person. [828] Um, you could also just get like a well [829] structured FAQ page or FAQ section, I [832] should say. And ideally, you just answer [834] those questions before, right? Okay. [836] Another really big issue is appointment [837] setting agents or AI. So, um, you know, [839] the idea behind this is this is an AI [841] system like like a go highle system or [844] something that handles booking, [845] rescheduling and the managing of [846] appointments. Um, these things are often [848] voice or chat based interfaces like a [850] Vappy agent or something. And the whole [851] idea is that the promise is that the [853] they're essentially a virtual [854] receptionist or a scheduling assistant [856] like, hey, you know, just hire virtual [858] Peter. Peter will do everything for you [860] at a millionth of the cost of an actual [862] person. So, we'll just install that guy [863] in your business and then you, you know, [864] we'll charge you $3,000 a month for [866] maintenance. It's like, that sounds [868] really nice. And the person gets to let [870] go of one of their staff members and [872] maybe start making a little bit of money [873] on the arbitrage. [875] Um, this is exactly what I was talking [877] about when I said losing the forest for [878] the trees. Here's how the math works [880] out. Okay, let's say we have two [882] options, okay? Like this is human and [884] before. Okay, let's say every time a new [887] um a lead comes in previously the new [891] lead was converting into a meeting at [893] something like a 30% conversion rate. [895] Okay. Um this is reasonable in practice, [897] you know, maybe 30 to 50% depending on [899] how quickly you can get back to them. [900] and then you know this meeting um should [902] it go through should 30% of the meetings [904] go through and you land a client I don't [905] know maybe you just make $1,000 very [907] simple math okay let's say you get a [909] hundred of these a month so basically [911] your business if you think about it you [913] get 100 people they go through the 30% [915] thing and then you know uh you basically [918] get uh $30,000 a month that's how much [920] money this business is making in [921] addition this $30,000 let's say the [923] actual customer support agent cost [926] $5,000 so you know what you're really [928] making is you're making $25,000 [930] after a cost of marketing and stuff. And [932] you're thinking, "Oh, that's great, but [933] we could probably save that $5,000, [935] right? Maybe I'm just going to build an [936] AI system to do it all for me." Well, [938] here's how that math actually usually [939] works out in practice. Okay? You have a, [942] you know, this is the AI version. You [943] have a new lead that comes in and then [946] instead of giving it to a human, you [947] give it to an AI. Okay? The thing is [950] when you give it to an AI, AIs make [952] mistakes and people really don't like [954] being sold to by AI. So, what is [956] inevitably going to happen? You may have [958] eliminated this customer support person [959] completely and saved yourself $5,000, [962] but you will also substantially decrease [964] your conversion rate. So maybe now you [966] only convert 20% to meetings. Okay? So [969] 20% times 100 leads is only [972] $20,000. So $20,000 minus I don't know, [976] you spend like uh $2,000 or something [978] instead of the $5,000 on an AI person to [981] handle it uh you know, like one of us [983] basically to handle it for you. Your net [985] is now $18,000. So, what actually [987] happened? Sure, you saved $3,000 by [990] replacing this person with an agent, but [991] then at the end of the day, you lost [993] $7,000 because you lost um your inbound. [997] So, this brings me to a general rule of [998] thumb, which is like at the first point [1000] of contact with a customer, you want [1002] that first point of contact to seem as [1003] human as freaking possible. And if AI [1007] and humans are still not exactly at the [1009] same point just in terms of like their [1010] quality, their ability to respond, um [1012] how the person on the other end of the [1013] line feels like you want to make sure [1015] that people feel respected when they [1016] reach out to your business. If they just [1017] feel like another cog in the wheel, the [1018] likelihood that they're going to goes [1020] down a lot. So the the main issue is if [1021] if you replace that with an AI agent, [1023] then basically what you're doing is you [1024] are you're saving a tiny bit of money, [1026] but then you're losing a massive amount [1027] of opportunity cost, aka money that you [1029] would have made had you actually had a [1031] human being in the process. So, don't [1032] lose the forest for the trees, I guess, [1034] is what I'm trying to say. And these [1035] appointment setting agents have a number [1036] of problems which interfere with their [1037] ability to do things. Now, I'm not going [1039] to go over all of these because, as you [1040] can see, um, we're getting kind of [1041] wallet texty, but they they have a big [1043] failure rate. Also, you guys are going [1044] to have this whole document down below [1045] in the description, so feel free to take [1046] a look at it. U, they have a big failure [1048] rate, especially with complex scheduling [1050] requests. Um, limited context [1052] understanding, which leads to more [1054] failures, okay? And it's difficult for [1056] them to do things like prioritize urgent [1058] versus regular appointments. If you try [1059] and build that sort of logic in, like [1061] there are some appointments that are [1063] significantly more urgent that you need [1064] to deal with than other appointments. [1065] And so in reality, if somebody's going [1067] to pay you $10,000, you want to make [1069] sure that they get dealt with first, [1070] right? This sort of second and third [1072] order logic is very difficult to [1073] implement right now with these with [1074] these schedulers. So you end up with [1076] these like very brittle systems that [1078] don't actually allow you to flexibly um [1080] deal with the front end of your [1082] business, which to be honest, I think is [1084] the most important part of your [1085] business. So don't sell appointment [1088] setting agents either. The marketing [1089] promise is that you get a virtual [1090] receptionist that eliminates scheduling, [1092] has 24/7 booking capability, but in [1094] reality you have very high failure rate, [1096] very poor rescheduling, you can have [1098] minor issues like time zone confusion [1100] and then also you kind of lose context [1101] in the clients which ultimately results [1103] in you know human intervention having to [1104] come in and you just like defeating the [1106] whole purpose of the savings. On the [1108] same vein, AI sales agents, so instead [1110] of inbound um schedulers, but like [1112] actual sales people suffer from all the [1114] same problems that I showed you guys [1116] earlier, except 10x that many problems. [1118] So they don't just suffer from, you [1119] know, like a 30% to 20% conversion rate. [1122] But considering that this is the entire [1123] sales arm of your business, this is even [1124] further ahead if you think about it than [1126] than that. This is like the most [1128] important part of your entire business. [1129] If conversion is over here, okay, then [1133] this is the part of the process that we [1135] are essentially trying to outsource and [1137] the closer something is to conversion [1139] generally like the less you want to [1140] outsource this, you [1143] know, less outsource. That doesn't make [1145] sense, but you guys catch my drift, [1146] right? So, there are some, you know, [1148] vague supposed benefits of this, like it [1150] can handle lead qualification. Um, if [1152] you're smart, you can use an AI sales [1154] agent to like immediately send somebody [1156] a text message or SMS the second that [1158] they like get to your business or [1159] whatever. These are minor little [1160] benefits, I would say. And there are, of [1162] course, some nuances, but yeah, you [1164] definitely don't want like an all-in-one [1165] agent that qualifies leads, handles [1167] objections, and closes deals because the [1169] gap between them and um a real uh human [1173] being that is like a closer is so much [1175] bigger than the gap between a real human [1176] being that's a setter. Uh, so if we were [1178] losing $7,000 in that example before, [1181] we're probably going to be losing like [1182] $15,000 here. Just doesn't make sense [1184] for most businesses. Another big issue [1185] is outbound voice callers. So I see this [1187] a lot now because I made a Vappy video [1189] where I covered, you know, how to have [1190] like an inbound agent essentially. [1192] Listen, outbound voice callers can work [1194] for particular purposes. One big cool [1196] purpose they can work with is end of [1197] year reactivation for like some sort of [1199] health clinic where you have some sort [1201] of benefits or insurance or something. [1202] You know, it's like December 9th, let's [1204] say. you have a secretary that's like [1206] overwhelmed and there's 500 people on a [1208] list that have insurance benefits [1209] expiring that you just need to find a [1211] way to call. Right? In that situation, [1212] it makes sense to get yourself one of [1214] these outbound AI callers and just have [1216] them blast the same message to all 500 [1218] people on that list. Save your [1219] secretar's time and then, you know, have [1221] some percentage of those people want to [1222] rebook some appointment to take [1224] advantage of their insurance benefits. [1226] That makes sense. I've sold that myself. [1227] I've made money off that. And a lot of [1229] people here have sold similar systems. [1230] Voicemail drops and stuff depending on [1232] legality and what not. that that can [1234] make sense. Onetime offers for I don't [1236] know like um free teeth whitening or [1238] like electric toothbrush or I don't know [1240] a free laser uh skin appointment or [1242] something that that stuff can make [1243] sense. But actually having like an [1245] outbound caller for I don't know like [1248] cold calling or whatever. Dude, that [1249] makes no sense right now. That makes no [1251] sense. It's not very good. And the vast [1253] majority of human beings the second that [1255] they smell that there's even a 1% [1257] probability that this thing is an AI, [1259] they're going to take their hands off [1260] the phone and they're going to click [1262] cancel. Okay. It just doesn't make sense [1264] for the vast majority of situations. How [1266] many AI phone calls do you guys [1267] currently get a day? And how many of [1269] them do you actually listen to? I [1270] probably get at least 50. Probably more [1272] than the average person because I expose [1274] my goddamn phone number all the time [1275] inadvertently. But how many of those do [1277] I actually listen to? Like one. It's [1279] when, you know, Safeway calls to tell me [1280] that they have an order for me or [1282] something. That that's it. So, you know, [1284] tons of cons here. Um the promise which [1287] is that there are scalable alternative [1288] call centers or SDRs. This is just not [1290] true right now. Maybe it'll be true in [1292] the next like two years. Who knows? But [1294] right now, we're not at that point. And [1296] if anybody's trying to tell you that [1297] they are, just be very careful. You're [1299] probably seeing like a manicured top [1300] .01% demo. You're not seeing like actual [1303] boots on the ground um grassroots uh [1306] systems that people would actually build [1307] in practice. Okay. And yeah, these are [1309] the limited pros. This is what I was [1310] talking about with the initial outreach [1312] attempts and then some sort of regulated [1314] industries, usually health, and then [1315] simple information collection and [1317] controlled environments. That might work [1318] as well. Anything else though, not [1319] really. So, here's that marketing [1321] promise again. Unlimited outbound calls, [1323] nope. Perfect compliance, consistency, [1325] nope. Cost effective call center? Nope. [1327] The reality is that everybody hangs up. [1330] More and more systems, calling systems [1332] are blocking them. Usually have some [1333] pretty crappy voice qualities that are [1335] still in the uncanny valley. And then [1336] you have um I don't know, poor [1338] conversation handling, I want to [1340] say. Okay, let me get to a pretty [1343] controversial point here. um because I [1344] made a system that was an u an SEO [1346] content producer and that was one of the [1348] systems that I think made me grow pretty [1350] big on YouTube. So these SEO AI content [1352] producers, they just don't really make [1354] sense for most businesses unless the [1356] content that they're producing is like [1358] hyper relevant and actually being read. [1360] If you're trying to game a system right [1361] now, aka the system of Google with SEO [1364] AI content, I don't consider that to be [1366] a very valuable thing that you can [1367] actually sell to customers at this [1369] moment in time. So what is the promise [1371] here? The promise is basically, hey, [1372] instead of you doing all this stuff [1374] manually, let me do um AI content [1376] generation, okay? And I'll make a [1378] content factory for you that'll just [1380] drive massive amounts of organic [1381] traffic. In order to do that, we're [1383] going to use GPT. We're going to use [1384] some similar models. It'll generate [1385] articles, blogs, and landing pages. And, [1387] you know, we'll essentially just be able [1389] to take in a bunch of keywords and a [1390] bunch of topics, and then we'll just be [1392] able to do thousands of blog posts a day [1395] or something like that. Um, in [1398] reality, Google is now actively [1400] penalizing AI generated content. But [1403] more important to that is that AI [1405] generated content just doesn't really [1407] like people are looking for alternatives [1410] to this stuff anyway at this point. AI [1412] generated content for most purposes is [1416] like it just tends not to be very deep. [1418] If a person's at the point where they're [1419] like clicking on like the f, you know, [1421] bottom of the first page of Google to [1422] look for something, they probably want [1423] like a very nuanced deep answer. and AI [1425] is just not really yet at the point [1427] where it can do that at scale [1429] consistently with most of the approaches [1431] that I'm seeing. The reality is if I [1433] were to just like pump in the same [1434] search query to chat GPT or GPT 4.5, I'd [1437] probably get like a better answer than I [1439] would if I went on that. And I'm not [1441] trying to say that like just because I [1442] could do that that invalidates this as a [1444] business process. But the way that I see [1445] it is there was basically a short period [1448] of time where it made sense to do this [1450] and if you did this you could actually [1451] go and you know you could make money and [1454] I think personally maybe some people are [1456] going to call BS and that's fine. Um, [1458] this was around like 2020, maybe like [1462] 2021, maybe like 2022. Okay. And I think [1465] that there was like kind of a big [1467] opportunity here, but then right over [1469] here, chatbt came out and a tons of [1471] search engines and everything started [1473] penalizing AI content. And I don't [1475] really think like if you consider this [1476] as the value of the system over time. I [1478] don't really think, you know, here us [1480] being right now, I don't really think [1482] that there's there's much value in this [1484] at all. [1485] So, my reasons for this are that you [1488] typically get poor engagement metrics on [1490] this content. And whether that's because [1491] Google or other search engines are [1492] actively penalizing um AI generated [1494] content or just because most of it [1495] sucks, I don't know. Um I do find that [1497] most implementations of AI content [1498] generators do blow. And so, because they [1500] blow, you just don't really get very [1502] good content. And if you don't get very [1503] good content and Google sees that not a [1504] lot of people are spending time on your [1505] website, that just tanks everything [1507] else. I think that um the good stuff [1510] requires human editing. And you know, I [1512] wrote defeating the purpose here [1513] probably a little bit preemptively. It [1515] doesn't defeat the purpose. You could [1516] use like AI content in concert with [1518] human beings and you could have that be [1519] pretty fine, but um you know, you are [1522] going to have to have some sort of [1523] editing essentially to make this viable. [1526] Now, there are some limited pros here. U [1527] my content writing company, 1 second [1529] copy, does this and we've been doing [1531] this for the better part of of many [1532] years now. um we will have AI generate [1534] or pre-generate content for you and then [1538] we'll have human editors and human [1539] writers go in and then refine the [1541] content but usually if you think about [1543] it like we'll do like 50% of the work [1545] with AI and then the other 50% of the [1548] work will be will be human and that's a [1550] far cry from what most people think [1551] which is most people want like 90% AI [1554] and then like 10% human so the bar is [1557] increasing right um I think this could [1559] work for extremely longtail or low [1560] competition keywords we're talking like [1562] really procedural stuff like um you [1564] could have AI generate like uh 5,000 [1567] small little regions or something like [1568] that in Arkansas or something and then [1572] you could like actually rank a very [1574] specific zip code based or region based [1576] search that might apply to like a very [1578] particular subset of people. I think [1579] that might work. Um and I I do use it to [1582] generate content outlines or research [1583] summaries. But yeah, just in terms of [1585] like mass SEO content websites and [1587] stuff, uh that opportunity was here. And [1590] I think a lot of people are still trying [1592] to sell the [1593] opportunity over here as if it was here. [1597] And it's like, no, no, no, man. There's [1598] a there's a big gap basically between [1601] what people are saying that the systems [1603] are going to produce and what they [1604] actually produce. And guys, if we just [1605] get in the habit of selling systems that [1606] don't work to customers, you also think [1608] about it just strategically, our entire [1610] industry gets devalued because there are [1611] a lot of empty promises and fake things [1613] being thrown around. If there is any [1615] industry to be devalued, to be honest, [1616] it is our industry because we're working [1617] with like the shiniest technology on [1619] planet Earth. But just wanted to show [1620] you guys my thoughts there. Okay, the [1622] next one are email agents and GPT [1625] responders. Um, I mean, like, you know, [1627] I've sold a bunch of these and I use a [1628] couple of these in my business. So, I'll [1630] show you guys what not to do and then [1632] what to do. Um, and then again I have a [1633] bunch of alternative systems that you [1634] guys can actually sell later on in the [1636] video. But uh, essentially these are AI [1638] systems that will draft, send, and then [1640] respond to emails completely [1641] autonomously. The idea is to process [1643] inbox coms with minimal human input. And [1645] the whole marketing idea is never miss [1646] an email again. In reality, you can use [1649] them to filter emails and stuff. That's [1651] fine. But actually going through the [1652] entire process of sending and responding [1654] to emails and like dealing with your [1656] whole email inbox, I think is just very [1658] silly because if you're at the point [1659] where somebody is sending a customer an [1661] email themselves, okay, that person is [1664] similar to a lead. It's like the highest [1666] quality sort of communication you can [1667] realistically get. It's the closest [1669] thing to money that you could ever get [1670] is like a a customer sending you an [1672] email in your inbox or or one of your, I [1674] don't know, in my case, community [1675] members sending me a message or [1676] something. Why would I automate that? It [1678] doesn't make any sense to automate. uh [1680] you can hand that off to another human [1681] being. You can delegate that, but the [1683] probability that an AI will actually be [1685] able to reasonably fulfill that request [1686] right now is still substantially lower [1688] than what a human could do with similar [1690] amounts of information. And so [1692] considering that this is one of the [1693] closest things to money, this is our [1695] conversion event again and it's dollar [1697] signs and this is like over here like [1699] it's really really close. You don't want [1702] to automate that. [1703] Okay. In addition, a lot of the time [1706] like you'll see it come out and then [1707] you'll have to edit it. It misses a lot [1709] of the relationship nuance. You'll get [1710] an email from somebody that you've known [1711] for like two and a half years or [1713] whatever and you'll respond to them like [1714] you've never talked to them before. And [1715] there's just like really weird tone [1717] mismatches all the time where I don't [1719] know your model will start using emojis [1720] or something even if you train it not to [1722] some percentage of the time because it [1724] screws that up. You can actually destroy [1726] client relationships like who's actually [1727] emailing you guys? Who's who's actually [1729] emailing you? Most of the time, if [1730] you're a business owner, it's customers, [1732] current customers or it's prospective [1736] customers or prospects or it's, I don't [1739] know, um, people that have a problem [1741] with what you're doing for whatever [1742] reason. You know, they have a problem [1743] with your product or service or [1745] whatever. These people are money. These [1747] people are also money. And these people, [1749] if not tended to correctly, are money. [1752] So, why would you have AI with a lower [1754] percent probability of being able to do [1755] it? Let's say even 20% versus I don't [1758] know I think like a human being might [1759] answer it 50% of the time fine that 30% [1762] gap means that you are losing onethird [1766] of all of your money. I mean that's [1768] crazy to me right? But people don't [1771] really think about it this way. They [1772] think about in terms of savings. Oh I [1773] get to save 10 minutes in the morning. [1775] Oh I get to save you know 45 minutes [1776] going through my email at the end of the [1778] day. It's like well that 45 minutes [1779] makes a third of all of the money that [1781] you make. So why would you why would you [1783] try and and farm that out? Sure, you'll [1785] save 45 minutes, but you're going to [1786] lose 33% of all of the dollars that are [1789] uh new dollars that are coming into your [1791] business. That is not worth it to [1793] me. Anyway, there obviously some some um [1796] nuance here. You could use a system like [1798] this to handle some basic [1799] acknowledgement emails. If you receive [1801] the exact same templated email from some [1803] service or something saying you get a [1804] new lead, obviously you can have this [1806] come in, you can process that, which is [1809] procedural, basically deterministic, and [1810] then have AI write some short little [1812] snippet at the beginning of an otherwise [1814] templated message and send that back. [1815] You can do that. I do this. A lot of [1817] people do this. This is like a very high [1818] ROI way of leveraging this technology. [1820] But don't just have it do everything for [1822] you. Okay? If you're going to have AI do [1823] stuff, have it generate some draft and [1825] then read through the draft, make edits, [1827] and actually make sure there's a pair of [1829] human eyes on everything that goes out. [1831] All right, so I mean, you know, the [1833] promise here is that you get to inbox [1835] zero automatically, which is just not [1837] true. We got to get back to red, which [1838] is scarier. The reality is that, um, you [1841] know, a lot of the time it's generic. A [1842] lot of the time you get weird tone and [1844] missing contacts, and then you hurt [1845] relationships with the people that [1846] matter the most to you, which is money. [1848] All right. Another big issue that I'm [1849] seeing is the idea of these all-in-one [1851] AI agents with false autonomy. So these [1854] are uh I think we've all seen these. [1855] These are like the really big crazy [1857] chunky N8N graphs with like you know a [1860] quadrillion nodes and then it looks like [1861] a giant piece of spaghetti. These are [1863] marketed as fully autonomous business [1865] assistants or I've seen these marketed [1868] this way. This thing will run your [1870] entire life. Sorry, I dropped my pen. [1872] You'll never have to do anything again. [1874] You'll never have to I don't know do [1875] your dishes cuz my AI agent's going to [1877] do it for you. It's like, do you really [1880] think that that's accurate? I don't. [1883] These models are not yet at the point [1884] where they could respond to your emails [1886] correctly. How are they going to run [1887] your whole life? And why would you want [1889] something that is like 50% as capable as [1891] you across every metric to run your [1893] whole life right now? Come on, man. [1894] You're not going to sell that to a [1896] business owner. And you're certainly not [1897] going to use that yourself for more than [1898] like super isolated things. So, yeah. [1901] Like the reality is these models um we [1903] tend to anthropomorphize them as much as [1905] humanly possible because that's just how [1906] humans work. anthropomorphiz just means [1908] we try and make them out to be like [1909] people, right? But they think very [1910] differently to people and they handle [1912] things very differently to people and [1913] we're just not yet at the point where it [1914] makes sense. I realize that this entire [1916] time I've been like a doomer, you know, [1918] being like these technologies aren't [1919] there. But like I want you guys to know [1920] I'm one of like the biggest proponents [1921] of AI. I have been invested in this [1923] industry for the better part of the last [1925] six maybe seven years. I went to school [1927] because I wanted to work with artificial [1928] intelligence. I dreamed of artificial [1930] intelligence like Openheimer dreaming [1932] about nukes in that in that uh um you [1935] know the recent movie. Okay, this is all [1937] I think about. There's a reason why I'm [1939] going so harsh on all of these systems [1941] that I'm seeing people sell, and it's [1943] because they just they just don't work [1944] right now. This technologies will get to [1946] the point where you can have an [1947] all-in-one AI agent assistant probably [1949] at some point in the next like few [1950] years, but we're just not at that point [1952] yet. It doesn't make sense to sell [1953] people false promises. And the reason [1955] why is cuz you're not going to make any [1956] money off that. You're going to sell one [1958] crappy project. You're going to get a [1959] terrible experience with the client and [1961] then you're just going to have wasted [1962] like a good 3 weeks of your life. focus [1963] on real business problems like what I'm [1965] going to be talking about in a moment. [1967] Okay. So, what are some issues here? 1 [1968] to 5% failure rate per query. Um, if you [1971] are losing 1 to 5% of every query, [1974] you're not losing 1 to 5% of your money. [1976] Like I had somebody point out a couple [1978] of videos ago in my comments. Uh, you [1980] know, if you screw up once for a client, [1982] okay, you could be you could be screwing [1983] up that entire relationship. Okay? If [1985] out of a hundred inquiries, you screw up [1987] one of them and you screwed up really [1988] massively, that client may just like [1990] take that entire business away from you. [1992] So 1% failure rate per query does not [1994] equate to like a 1% loss in [1996] revenue. No, it might equate to like a I [1999] don't know like a 30% loss in revenue or [2001] something. Is that really something that [2003] you can confidently sell to a client? I [2005] don't think so. Also, a lot of the time, [2007] you know, there's some unexpected [2008] scenarios that'll come in. Again, these [2010] are these are business scenarios. [2011] There's always like an ROI attached to [2013] you making a good move or making a bad [2015] move. Um, and then there's also some [2017] security risks which um I haven't really [2019] touched on a lot, but when you when you [2020] give an AI agent like full control over [2022] everything and you try and have it like [2023] do your invoicing and have it send and [2025] receive transactions and when you just [2027] like have it run your entire life [2028] basically, there are of course massive [2030] security issues with that. You're giving [2032] one company like every aspect of your [2033] entire life. Is that really something [2034] you want to do? Probably not. Um, [2036] moreover, like if there are any bad [2038] actors that take some of this [2040] information, you're you're screwed. And [2042] is that something you want to subject a [2043] customer to? Probably not. [2046] Yeah, limited pros-wise, like it's good [2047] for demos. It's good for proof of [2048] concepts. We're at the proof of concept [2050] stage, okay? We're not at like the let's [2051] use it in like a $100,000 a month sort [2053] of business yet stage. So, the claims [2056] are that it'll run your business. It'll [2058] um work without supervision. It will, I [2061] don't know, please your wife, like I [2062] said in that other video, which people [2064] find hilarious. It'll just do everything [2065] for you. But that's not true. In [2068] reality, they need constant monitoring. [2070] They have regular failures. They have [2072] the illusion of intelligence, okay? not [2074] actual intelligence. Okay. And then why [2076] don't we cover the last point here which [2077] is NANA agents. So um you know these are [2080] like I' I've sort of talked about NANA [2083] agents throughout this whole video. [2084] Nad's blown up and obviously the agentic [2086] feature is a big reason why but NANA [2087] agents just the way that they're [2088] constructed tend to just fail um a lot [2091] and they might be one of the most mature [2092] agent implementations currently [2094] available today. I think there are like [2095] a few better ones but most people are [2096] using NA AI agents. In reality just NA [2099] agents they just ain't it yet dog. Like [2102] I mentioned in one of my previous [2103] videos, they have very impressive demos. [2105] Um they do combine a bunch of interfaces [2108] into just one and they have like awesome [2109] debugging and stuff and I think there's [2110] some personal productivity use cases in [2112] which they can work but like you don't [2113] want to do that in a real business. [2114] Okay, so that 1 to 5% failure rate, same [2116] issue as before. You know, expensive [2118] development for minimal business [2119] advantage. All right, so now that I just [2120] spent half an hour talking about what [2122] not to do, let's actually get to the [2123] point where we talk about what to do. [2126] The reason that I tickled all of your [2128] hypothetical and proverbial balls with [2129] that was I just wanted everybody to be [2131] abundantly clear that you know if you [2134] sell these sorts of systems you're [2135] probably not going to make that much [2136] money and I just want you to make a ton [2137] of money. That's all I care about. So [2139] that is what not to do. What do we [2141] actually do now? Well, here's what a [2142] high ROI automation actually looks like. [2144] And let's switch to green cuz we're [2145] happy now. Okay. The first thing a high [2146] automation does is it solves a dire [2148] business need. There are three major [2150] business needs. The first is revenue [2152] generation. The second is cost savings [2154] and the third is time leverage. Revenue [2157] generation means stuff like increasing [2161] the leads [2162] flow. Revenue generation means [2165] increasing the average customer lifetime [2168] value. You'll see that acronym a lot. Um [2170] but that just stands for how much money [2172] you make in in in general um throughout [2174] a customer life cycle. Revenue [2176] generation means increasing the [2178] conversion rate. That is another [2180] three-letter acronym you'll probably see [2182] often when discussing sales. Okay. Um, [2184] and there are variety of other ways to [2186] increase revenue as well. And I think [2188] I'm going to be pushed off the side [2189] here. So, let's just do an arrow down [2190] here. Um, increasing retention. Okay. [2194] Which feeds into CLV, but a little bit [2195] different. So, these are all ways that [2198] you can actually add real value to [2200] businesses by providing mechanisms that [2203] increase the number of leads they're [2204] making, increase the retention of [2205] clients because you do a better job, [2207] increase the total lifetime value of [2209] clients, which is interrelated with [2210] this, and then increase the conversion [2212] rate on the front end. We're going to [2213] talk about all these. The next way you [2215] can add value is you could save money. [2217] So, how do you save money? You decrease, [2220] okay, headcount. When I say headcount, [2222] what do I mean? I mean people. Let's [2224] just, you know, we're under no illusions [2225] here. A big chunk of the work that I do [2227] has led to job loss. People leave like [2230] or they are let go because they can't [2231] justify the the the expense that they're [2233] providing the employer. If the employer [2235] can just hire a system or build their [2237] processes in such a way that we do uh [2239] five times the amount of work with half [2240] the staff members, what do you think is [2242] realistically going to happen to that [2243] organization? It's going to grow [2244] substantially more efficient and leaner [2245] and better. It's going to be much more [2247] profitable, but at the end of the day, [2249] we are going to lower the headcount, [2250] which is one of the biggest and worst [2251] expenses most businesses have to pay. Uh [2254] what are some other ways you could [2256] decrease let's say software [2259] expenditures? You could decrease like [2260] operational expenses but basically just [2262] decreasing opex. Okay. And then time [2264] leverage you are basically doing things [2266] that scale and you're just doing them a [2268] lot faster. Okay. And a lot of the time [2270] you're also specifically related to the [2272] founder time because the founder a lot [2273] of the time of a business is a [2274] bottleneck. So you are increasing the [2277] free available founder time. So these [2279] are all of the dire business needs [2281] basically that automations that make [2283] money solve. Okay, we're going to cover [2284] them in a moment. Now what else does a [2286] higher automation do? It produces clear [2288] deliverables. So it produces a tangible [2289] output. What's a tangible output? It [2291] might be like an email. Okay, might be [2293] like a notif of some kind on their [2295] phone. It might be like a document. It [2298] might be a PDF. It might be anything [2300] like that, but something that the [2301] customer it might be like a faxed out [2302] sheet. It might be like a like a like a [2304] book or something, right? I've helped [2305] people automate whole books. uh this is [2307] something that people can actually touch [2308] and feel and you know as a result it [2309] also needs to be visible to the client [2310] in that way. If it's not visible to the [2312] client and produces a deliverable [2313] doesn't matter. So we got to make it a [2314] deliverable and then we got to actually [2315] make it visible to the client. Ideally [2317] it's also templatable because if you [2319] build a templatable system then the next [2320] time you get a client you know instead [2322] of you going from zero to [2325] 100%. Okay you actually cut that down. [2328] You just go from 80% there to 100%. What [2331] is this in layman's terms? That's what [2332] we call 5x leverage. So instead of you [2334] having to build a system out from [2335] scratch, every single time you build a [2337] like a system that's almost done and [2338] just make some minor tweaks to it. And [2340] then quick deployment feeds into that as [2342] well. That's valuable because the more [2343] templated it is and the quicker you can [2345] deploy it, the more perceived value you [2346] can offer a customer to reduce their [2348] buyer's remorse. So what that means is [2350] when somebody sends you money, there's [2351] sort of like a gap right now. There's [2353] like a hm I've given Nick a ton of [2355] money, but I haven't really gotten [2356] anything in return for that money. Huh. [2359] You don't want people to feel that way. [2361] and you want to minimize how long they [2362] feel that way because the longer they [2363] feel that way, the less likely they are [2364] to give you more money in the future. [2366] So, what templated systems do that you [2367] can put together really quickly are they [2370] allow you to minimize that that time [2372] between when somebody gives you money [2373] and then you deliver the result. Okay? [2375] Cuz that's just how services work. It's [2376] not like a product where like you go to [2377] a store, you're like, I'd like that [2379] shirt to please and then you give them [2380] money and then you receive the shirt in [2381] one go. You know, you give somebody [2382] money and then it takes a little bit of [2384] time for that service implementation. [2385] So, the shorter we can make that [2386] turnaround time, the better. And then [2387] finally, ideally, good systems are [2389] platform agnostic. Uh that's just a [2390] fancy way to say you could build the [2391] same thing out on multiple tools so that [2393] if one tool stops being accessible you [2395] could do it on another tool or maybe [2396] instead of you doing it through like a [2398] make.com module you do it through an API [2400] call because the API call doesn't change [2401] maybe the make.com module does and then [2403] not vendor locked is important as well. [2405] So you know basically you have a [2406] template for I don't know some system [2408] that does it on instantly and then you [2410] also do it on smart lead as well. All [2413] great ways that you could do this. And [2415] then I'm not going to cover the low ROI [2416] traps just because I think you guys are [2418] probably seeing the the parallels here. [2420] Okay. All right. Let's now talk about [2422] some criteria for high ROI automations [2424] or agents and what you can do to make [2425] tons of money and be like Leonardo [2428] DiCaprio. This is pre25 is the oldest [2431] age I will ever date, I think. So, he's [2434] actually still he's still cool here. We [2435] we still like Leo here. Hasn't been [2437] cancelled yet. Okay. So, uh I'm going to [2440] get cancelled for that. [2442] uh here are things that actually matter. [2444] We're going to solve a dire business [2445] need. We're going to produce clear [2447] deliverables. We're going to template [2449] out most of it. They're going to be [2450] platform agnostic. We're going to focus [2451] on reliability to a pre-existing [2453] business process over flexibility. We're [2455] going to focus on measurable impact. [2456] We're going to focus on things that [2458] require human oversight but then apply [2460] it at particular points allow us to [2462] massively improve leverage. Then [2463] ultimately we're going to do some [2464] scalable implementations that can be [2466] deployed quickly with minimal [2466] customization. the very first probably [2468] one of the highest ROI systems that I [2470] put together now and it really is taking [2471] off is this idea of a deep [2473] personalization cold outreach system. So [2475] we're moving away from all those fancy [2477] shiny objects towards systems that [2480] actually help with something that a lot [2482] of businesses are using today to make [2484] money. So what is one thing that a lot [2486] of businesses are using today to make [2487] money? Cold outreach. And what does the [2489] system do? It takes a pipeline of cold [2492] outreach which is working okay I guess. [2494] Okay. you know, maybe it's generating [2496] 10K a [2499] month. And then what it does is it [2501] massively increases the diameter of that [2505] pipeline so that we can make I don't [2507] know 50K a month or something instead. [2509] This is what all successful systems [2511] basically automation systems do. They [2512] just scale up. So the way that this [2515] works is you have a system that works [2516] which is usually some sort of custom [2518] outreach where you will customize some [2519] message that you're sending or customize [2521] some video or or whatever and then with [2523] depersonalization you use AI to do [2526] automated research on the prospect [2528] something like perplexity or something [2530] like OpenAI's now web search API you get [2534] all this information and data on them [2536] maybe use Apify for this maybe use some [2538] other phantom buster scraper to grab [2539] their LinkedIn fields and then you have [2542] it take a template that is working right [2544] now an email that you are sending that [2545] is delivering results and then just [2547] modify it a little bit so that instead [2549] of it being like hello Peter um I do X Y [2552] and Z and I would be very happy to [2553] assist you with this you say hey Peter I [2556] love that you do X Y and Z I've been [2558] following you for a really long time [2559] just listened to your podcast with blank [2561] talking about this I wanted to put [2563] something in front of you to hear your [2564] thoughts on it okay you take a general [2567] template and you convert it into [2568] something super customized so this [2570] combines scraping AI generated [2572] personalization and then even automated [2574] email sending. And this significantly [2576] boosts reply rates. I said 20 to 40% [2578] improvement. I've seen reply rates of [2580] about 20% off of a cold email, which is, [2582] you know, for most people unheard of. [2584] Saves a massive amount of time compared [2585] to manual personalization, which a lot [2586] of people are doing before. Provides a [2588] measurable ROI through increased booked [2590] meetings and closed deals. And it [2591] reduces dependence on large sales teams [2593] for that initial outreach piece. It's [2594] easily templated. You just build out a [2596] system once in NAND. I've done so. You [2597] guys could look at one of my previous [2599] videos. I think it's titled deep [2600] personalization system. Integrates with [2601] tons of CRM. does email marketing [2603] automation tools and so on and so forth. [2604] So, how does the system actually work in [2606] practice? Uh, it's pretty simple. [2607] Usually feed in some sort of lead list [2609] and usually the lead list has like a [2611] name. Sometimes it'll have an email. [2614] Sometimes it'll have other fields like I [2616] don't know their job titles or whatever. [2618] You can get this list in a variety of [2619] ways. You could use a service like [2621] Ampify which scrapes Apollo. You could [2623] do something like LinkedIn. You could [2624] scrape off of like Instagram. I mean [2626] there, you know, just check my my last [2627] video which talked all about how to [2629] scrape every social media platform if [2630] you want an example of that. What you do [2632] is you take all that and then you use it [2633] to scrape public data using something [2635] like [2636] Perplexity or um OpenAI web [2642] search and then you pass it through an [2645] AI where basically you feed it a [2647] template with a bunch of these curly [2649] brace [2650] variables and you say, "Hey, can you [2652] fill these variables with hyper relevant [2655] information from all the data that I [2656] just gave you?" You then generate a [2658] custom message. Okay. And then what you [2660] do is you feed that into a platform like [2663] instantly or smart lead or [2667] whatever. When somebody gets back to [2669] you, then you update a CRM [2670] automatically. Okay, really cool system. [2672] There's tons of value that you could [2673] have um that you could provide for [2675] people that are running businesses based [2676] off cold outreach. And I want to say [2678] that like there are tons of businesses [2680] that are crushing it with cold outreach. [2681] If you were to take a deep [2682] personalization system and put it in [2684] front of them, they'd immediately save a [2686] ton of time because they're no longer [2687] personalizing all this outreach [2688] themselves. But then they'd also make a [2690] ton more just in terms of the [2691] opportunity cost because you know if [2693] they're sending templated emails and [2694] they're achieving reply to 3%. You could [2696] send that exact same volume of templated [2698] emails just using a depersonalization [2700] system and then you could have like 15%. [2702] You're literally 5xing the size of their [2704] business like this example right over [2706] here. Okay. All right. The second major [2709] system and these are all systems that [2710] people are selling right now is some [2712] sort of AI powered invoice and payment [2713] automation. Okay. The reason why this [2715] works is mostly because you are able to [2717] recoup a large portion of the invoice [2719] outstanding payments that people are not [2721] aren't giving you money um for early [2723] enough. Like what I find a lot of [2724] businesses do, especially like digital [2726] agencies, is they do what's called like [2727] net 30 or net 60 terms. Okay, for those [2730] of you that aren't familiar, that means [2731] that um you will provide a service, [2732] you'll sign a contract, you provide a [2734] service, and then 30 days later the [2735] person will pay you for it. This is in [2737] um contrast to what I was just talking [2738] about with the buyer's remorse. I always [2740] do my payments upfront, at least 50% of [2742] the payment upfront depending on the [2743] size of the project. And if it's a [2745] monthly, I just always get the payment [2746] up front. But this is like the old [2747] school way of doing things. And a lot of [2749] agencies and a lot of businesses that [2750] you are going to be working with, [2752] especially like um uh business models [2755] that have like time and materials, so [2756] like um general contractors, you know, [2758] like a lot of the time these like [2759] construction adjacent businesses, [2761] they're going to do some sort of net 30 [2762] or net 60 terms. The issue with this is [2764] the longer that you have to wait as a [2766] business for cash flow, okay, the less [2768] money your business makes. you have to [2770] wait 30 minutes to get a certain amount [2772] of uh 30 days to get a certain amount of [2773] cash flow. That means you have 30 days [2775] that you can't invest back in the growth [2777] of the business. So in practice, what [2779] these net 30 and net 60 and and whatever [2781] payment terms usually do is, you know, [2785] if this is the future where everybody [2786] gets paid on time and this is the [2788] revenue of your business, [2790] okay, this is like kind of what actually [2792] happens, okay, you end up with these [2797] plateaus. Why do you get these plateaus? [2799] because you just don't have the money [2800] yet. And so it just takes your business [2801] way longer to get to an equivalent [2803] growth level. I mean, this is almost 2x [2804] the time, right? So, what do these [2806] systems do? Oh, another thing is a lot [2809] of people just forget. And there's also [2810] a lot of issues where like if you just [2812] don't get paid for 60 or 90 days, like [2813] it's no longer a concern to the [2815] customer. Like the likelihood of [2816] somebody just skipping out on payments [2817] goes way the hell up. I've uh read so [2819] many stories of like construction [2820] businesses in particular that have [2822] failed because of these net 30, 60, [2824] 90-day terms where they're just waiting [2826] for money and because they don't have [2828] any money, they can't take on new [2830] projects, they're promising their team [2831] members stuff. Anyway, to make a long [2833] story short, what the system does is it [2836] just standardizes invoices. So, it [2837] automates the creation of invoices, the [2838] sending, the follow-ups, and even the [2840] tracking of these payments. It'll use AI [2842] to detect overdue payments, and then [2844] trigger personalized follow-up messages, [2845] very similarly to what I was talking [2847] about before. Okay, I cannot draw a [2849] straight line for the Okay, I'm just [2850] going to use the straight line thing. [2852] Um, a lot of the time, uh, you can also [2854] build it in so that it integrates [2856] seamlessly with common accounting [2857] software platforms like QuickBooks, Zar, [2858] etc. And the real value is it [2860] significantly reduces late payments, [2861] also just reduces unpaid invoices, [2862] right? Uh, it improves cash flow because [2864] now you're getting proactive follow-ups. [2866] The likelihood of you receiving [2867] something when you should have received [2868] it is way higher. Um, you save time [2870] spent on manual invoice tracking, [2872] collection activities, and then you [2873] provide clear tangible deliverables that [2875] are visible to the client. What are [2876] those tangible deliverables? Invoices, [2878] payment emails, payment statuses, their [2880] CRM, their QuickBooks, the money that [2881] they collected. This is money. That's [2883] what customers care about. So, this is [2885] super templatable. You just make one for [2887] basically every invoice platform, [2889] QuickBooks, Zero, whatever. Um, you can [2891] easily adapt it for various industries [2893] with minor changes in the wording. [2895] Platform agnostic, works across tons of [2897] different CRM systems, and it directly [2898] impacts cash flow, which is the hottest [2900] button business need. This is a more or [2902] less a breakdown of how it works, but [2904] I've actually created a video showing [2906] you guys how to build more or less this [2908] exact same system that is agnostic of [2910] platforms and you can use for anything. [2911] So, you deliver a product, you [2913] automatically generate the invoice, [2915] you'll send the invoice to the client, [2916] and then if the payment has not been [2917] received after, let's say, 3 weeks, [2920] you'll have AI powered follow-up start. [2922] And then you basically just go this way [2925] over and over again until you receive [2929] your money. Okay. Then finally, they do [2933] you update the accounting software with [2934] the payment and then you make that [2936] moola. This is super valuable to to sell [2938] to clients. If you're selling to a [2939] business that's $100,000 a month and [2940] they're in one of these industries that [2942] I was talking about and they are losing [2943] like5 or $10,000 a month to this problem [2945] that I'm talking about. You solve that [2947] $5 or $10,000 a month problem. You can [2948] charge like5 to $10,000 a month to to to [2951] fix it. Right? You're solving today's [2953] problem, but you're also solving future [2954] problems of scale. you're not only [2956] increasing um immediate cash collection, [2958] but you're also decreasing time that [2960] founders and other administrative staff [2962] have to spend constantly following up. [2963] So, you kind of deliver a ton of value [2965] with this. All right, another simple [2966] automation that I've put together [2968] recently and a lot of people in my [2969] community, Maker School, are putting [2970] together right now are just some general [2972] CRM automations. So, basically, you [2974] know, you get some new lead coming into [2976] that beginning of your pipeline. Usually [2977] have some sort of criteria based off [2979] that. So, industry, budget, engagement, [2982] uh project type, number of bedrooms in a [2985] house, whatever the business that you [2986] are working with does, home rena, or [2988] they do some sort of PPC, they're [2990] usually going to have some sort of like [2991] inbound funnel where they ask various [2993] questions, right? And the way that [2995] people answer these questions sort of [2997] slots them into like different um I want [3000] to say like different routes. Okay? [3003] And if you're smart about it, what you [3004] do is you typically as a business, I [3006] don't know, imagine this is a marble [3008] falling down one of these poles or [3010] whatever, right? One of those games that [3011] I think a Plinko or whatever, I don't [3012] know. Um, usually based off the route [3014] that they take, you'll do differential [3015] comps with them, right? So the value [3017] with this is once you're done with [3019] getting somebody in with a CRM [3020] automation, what you can do is you can [3022] actually enrich the lead data. You can [3023] use public profiles or third party APIs. [3025] You get a bunch more information about [3026] that person, which could substantially [3027] improve your ability to close them. And [3029] you are just using a CRM now. And so a [3032] lot of teams, they have these super big, [3034] chunky, amazing CRM, they just never use [3036] them and they never actually update [3037] them. So what this does is it just [3038] eliminates that issue where like when [3040] new leads come in, at least they're in [3042] the CRM. And usually once they're in the [3043] CRM, then clients can um um client sales [3046] teams can actually start to work with [3047] them. So this works with basically any [3050] CRM, HubSpot, Piper, Salesforce. I built [3052] this on clickupmonday.com. Um same [3054] energy across the board. You guys can [3056] watch some of my earlier make.com videos [3057] for this. Uh, essentially the way that [3059] it works is you'll get some new lead [3060] maybe through like a Facebook lead form. [3062] That's my usual example. Somebody clicks [3064] on an ad for I don't know some some [3066] plumbing or HVAC system or whatever. Um, [3068] comes in and then you enrich the lead [3070] data. You can actually use AI based [3072] qualification or you could actually send [3074] them a message using AI immediately [3075] after which we'll talk about. And then [3077] basically if it's qualified then you add [3079] to CRM with some tag or if they're not [3081] qualified you discard or tag them as [3082] some low priority or something. I don't [3084] actually recommend using a priority uh [3086] like the priority columns that are in [3088] most CRM just because I find if [3090] everything is a priority, nothing's a [3091] priority. But you can find different [3092] ways to do this. Bump it up to the top [3094] of the queue. Notify a salesperson. Do [3095] whatever you have to do. Okay. A fourth [3098] major system um that I've sold many, [3100] many times. I mean, I've probably made [3102] over $200,000 selling this exact system [3104] is a proposal and document generation [3106] automation. So the idea here is you are [3108] generating a proposal or some sort of [3110] PDF or some sort of estimate or some [3113] sort of quote or some sort of white [3115] paper and the whole idea is you do it [3116] based off of form inputs or CRM data. [3119] Okay, this includes client specific [3121] data, can include pricing, uh you can [3123] create beautiful deliverables and then [3124] you just have a PDF at the end of it [3126] which you can send via email, you can [3128] upload to a shared drive, you can add to [3129] something. Hell, you as I mentioned can [3131] print it out and then mail it to [3133] somebody for Christ's sake. So, there's [3135] so many different examples of this, but [3137] basically, let's say somebody's on a [3139] sales call. A good example of this, and [3140] actually where I started this way back [3142] in the day when I was doing videography [3144] sales, and I was actually inspired by my [3146] roommate at the time, who showed me what [3147] he was doing with this form system. But [3149] essentially, you fill out a form when [3150] you're on a sales call. The form is, [3152] hey, so like when is this wedding [3153] happening? When is this happening? When [3155] is when when do you want the video shoot [3156] done? And blah blah blah. You add all of [3158] that information into a form. Okay, this [3160] will insert all of that into a template. [3162] Your template is like a PDF. It's like, [3164] I don't know, um I don't know, it's a [3166] Google slide or it's a Panda doc or [3170] something. And then you generate a [3172] branded beautiful proposal using a PDF [3174] or a doc form that you can then use [3176] make.com, n any code tool to send to a [3178] client or upload to a drive immediately. [3180] Then you can update some CRM status. You [3182] could just start printing money. Um the [3184] value there is, think about it, sales [3186] team is getting all that information [3187] anyway, right? And if you get all that [3189] information, you could now just add that [3191] to a CRM, couldn't you? So, you can [3193] actually combine this with basically [3194] every other system that I've showed you [3195] here. And actually, what I would do [3197] personally is I'd round up every system [3198] that I've just showed you guys, and I [3200] would combine that into like one mega [3201] automation package. Then I'd try and see [3203] if you could sell that to somebody. My [3204] inclination is if you rolled all of this [3206] stuff up into some very, very mega big [3208] package, you could get in the habit of [3209] making these 30, 40, and 50k deals that [3211] I'm seeing people in make [3212] moneywithmake.com do. But I don't know, [3214] just a recommendation. Okay. Another one [3216] is a onboarding and client intake [3218] automation. This automates the client [3219] onboarding process after a deal is [3221] closed. You guys are probably seeing [3222] some similarities here. Every one of [3223] these systems is actually about a [3226] process that already exists in a [3227] business. It's not about new processes. [3229] It's about invigorating and improving [3231] old processes that people are using to [3232] make money. So, this is you've already [3234] signed a client. How do you improve the [3236] probability that that client is going to [3238] have a great experience and pay more [3239] money with you later? What this does is [3241] it collects client info via forms. [3243] Usually when you sign a new client, you [3245] would then send them an onboarding form, [3246] collect a bunch of key info, then use it [3248] to auto update a CRM or PM tool, and [3250] then you can do things like send [3251] automated welcome emails, schedule [3253] kickoff meetings by sending them a [3255] calendar link, create a bunch of PDFs [3256] and customized docs. Hell, you might [3258] even be make an API call. This is [3260] something that I saw that once that was [3261] really cool, make an API call to a [3263] service like Swag Box or something and [3265] actually generate custom branded assets. [3269] A little hoodie with your freaking [3270] company logo on it. A little mug that [3272] says, "Thanks so much for being a [3273] client." Okay? Little place business [3275] card holder for them to put on their [3276] desks. These are all so high value and [3279] basically nobody's doing them, which [3280] just breaks my freaking heart. So, when [3282] you do something like this, you create a [3284] professional onboarding experience, [3285] which people like. You eliminate all the [3287] back and forth that most people have for [3289] basic info collection. Usually, you'll [3290] start a business like, "Hello, thank you [3292] so much for uh working with us. Here's a [3294] list of questions. Could you please [3295] answer these questions?" You got to [3296] answer the questions. Then the secretary [3298] or front desk person has to read through [3299] the questions, add them to a system. Why [3301] don't you just eliminate that step and [3302] have them add to the system themselves, [3304] right? You reduce missteps and [3306] onboarding workflows. And yeah, it's [3307] just like super practical. You make a [3308] ton of money doing it. So you can build [3310] this out in Typform, um, Google forms, [3313] uh, Air Table, Notion, ClickUp, [3314] literally any CRM or any system. Um, as [3317] long as you have a form that like feeds [3319] into it, you're you're good. You deliver [3321] visible, tangible results, and people [3323] really really like that. Again, I've [3324] built this system out on video numerous [3326] times. Also, I have like an end to-end [3327] walkthrough of exactly what this looks [3328] like in Maker School. So, if you guys [3330] like this sort of thing, definitely [3331] check out my community for more [3333] information on that. Okay, the sixth one [3336] is some sort of customer support [3337] ticketing automation. Remember how [3338] earlier I was telling you guys um how [3340] Amazon does their stuff? This is [3341] essentially what I was referring to. So, [3343] you know, the idea is you have some sort [3345] of customer support ticket. You're [3346] running some SAS company or something, [3348] okay? And these tickets start taking a [3351] vast massive amount of time. They're [3353] usually like three or four categories, [3355] but they're just a little bit different. [3357] So, it's hard for you or your company to [3358] like deal with these things reliably. [3360] And this is a major cost. You now have [3362] to hire a bunch of customer support [3363] people. Any major SAS company has [3365] massive customer ticketing teams. When [3367] you hear about like a company uh that's [3369] a software business that has a thousand [3371] employees, usually the way it works out [3372] to is they have like a founding team of [3374] like three people, then they have like [3376] 10 engineers or 20 engineers, and then [3378] the other 970 are customer support [3380] staff. So, a good system like this can [3382] actually deliver massive savings and [3384] eliminate a lot of payroll BS. So, [3386] what's the idea here? Well, basically [3387] you have some sort of support u route. [3390] Okay? And then you feed that into AI [3392] which categorizes where that support [3394] route goes. Is it a problem with the [3396] software itself? Is it a problem with [3398] the payment? Are they asking for a [3399] refund? Are they doing one of various [3401] things? Okay. After that, then you [3403] either assign priority or department and [3405] create a ticket in a help desk tool and [3406] then notify a specific agent and then [3409] finally track the status and response [3410] time or what you do is you just say, [3414] "Oh, is this a refund request?" Okay, if [3418] so, then why don't I calculate how much [3421] money they've asked for refunds for [3422] divided by how much money they spent, [3423] and if it's below a certain threshold, [3426] I'll just give them their money back. If [3428] you do stuff like this, you could save a [3430] good 20 30% of all of these customer [3432] support inquiries and requests because [3434] refunds are in practice a very big chunk [3435] of why people want uh you know want to [3437] contact [3438] you. Okay. Uh we got a couple more here. [3442] The next is recruiting and candidate [3443] screening automations. So the idea here [3445] is this is another process that most [3447] businesses suffer from or have to go [3448] through. So they recruit things, they [3450] screen candidates and so on and so [3451] forth. Um, what this does is it [3453] automates the job application intake, [3455] the candidate pre-screening, and the [3457] scheduling of interviews almost entirely [3459] autonomously. In the past on my channel, [3460] I've referred to this as my hiring [3462] system. So, feel free to check that out [3463] if you guys want. Essentially, what [3464] happens is when a candidate submits an [3466] application, okay? Usually, they'll fill [3468] out some form or something. Okay? So, [3470] then we'll extract fields from that and [3472] then screen and score them. Now, I don't [3474] use AI to do all of the screening and [3476] scoring, but I'll just use AI to look at [3478] a couple of fields, right? Like, do they [3479] have a portfolio, for instance? how much [3481] do they want? You can either use AI to [3484] do that. You can also just do this [3484] entirely procedurally. The point is you [3486] get some threshold. If they're above the [3488] threshold, then you go to your applicant [3490] tracking system, which in my case is [3492] usually like a ClickUp hiring pipeline [3494] or something or a monday.com hiring [3496] pipeline. Then if not, you can send them [3497] an automated rejection email and [3499] archive. And you could even tell them [3500] why. This is really valuable because the [3503] vast majority of recruiting companies [3504] and stuff, they don't actually tell you [3505] why your application wasn't accepted or [3507] whatever. You can earn a ton of goodwill [3509] in the market just by having an [3510] automated email that says, "Hey, thank [3512] you very much for applying. You know, we [3513] we looked over your application. [3515] Unfortunately, at this time, we're not [3516] able to like have you proceed with the [3517] process, but I just wanted to let you [3519] know right off the top why we didn't so [3522] that you could take this and then maybe [3523] use it to improve in your other job." [3524] Instant way of getting a ton of [3526] goodwill, instant way of impressing a [3527] lot of people that maybe later on down [3528] the line you will end up having as [3530] candidates for some other service or [3531] something. So, super quick and easy, [3534] saves a lot of time. And then these [3535] applicant tracking systems are usually [3537] just nightmares for most recruiting [3538] companies to deal with. If you have a [3540] simple process like this that you can [3542] build entirely custom yourself in like [3544] two hours with my video or my series of [3546] videos, then uh you can deliver a lot of [3548] value to recruiting companies super [3550] quickly and super easily. Okay, next up, [3552] sales pipeline and follow-up [3553] automations. So this is something again [3555] that is a pre-existing process that most [3557] businesses will do. Most businesses will [3559] follow up with customers and the money [3560] is in the follow-up. it's like the [3562] third, fourth, fifth, nth time that they [3564] talk to somebody, the person will [3565] actually decide to pay them. So the [3566] whole idea behind these systems of these [3568] uh classes of automations is they [3570] automate the movement of deals through a [3571] sales pipeline based on the activity of [3573] the person or just a certain amount of [3575] time. You know, once a week they'll [3576] check to see how long a person has been [3577] in a stage. The person hasn't moved in a [3579] stage, then they will just send them a [3580] follow-up. You do this automatically in [3582] any major CRM platform today. Super [3584] valuable and super easy to get up and [3586] running with. From there, maybe you will [3588] send a specific sort of email for this [3590] stage to that stage, another email from [3592] this stage to that stage, another email [3594] depending on whatever. And then what you [3596] can do is you can take the same approach [3597] that I took earlier with [3598] depersonalization, then you can actually [3599] customize it based off of a log of all [3601] of the customer activity. Okay? So [3603] instead of saying, "Hello, I've noticed [3605] that you have not proceeded with our [3606] blank," you say, "Hey Peter, loved our [3609] chat last week about X, Y, and Z. Just [3610] wanted to like double check and see if [3612] there was anything I might be able to [3613] help you with cuz I noticed you hadn't [3614] filled out the next step in our [3615] program." These are all super valuable, [3616] as I'm sure you can imagine. And you're [3618] treating a customer like a real human [3620] being, which they tend to respect, while [3621] also knocking that follow-up task off of [3624] the chart. It's no longer something that [3625] human beings necessarily have to do. And [3627] you get to double or triple dip because [3629] now your CRM is updated and it reflects [3631] deal progress and it's really clean. [3633] Okay. The way that this works is the [3635] simplest variation is you literally just [3637] have your CRM and then you have some [3639] sort of like you know number of days in [3641] field [3643] um stage which you can just use as [3645] formulas in most CRM. So just see you [3647] know what date they moved to the stage [3648] and then um how many days it's been [3650] since that stage. Uh once you know that [3653] then just every day you run an [3655] automation that just goes through your [3656] whole pipeline and says okay how many [3657] days have all these people been in these [3658] stages. Then if you are um I don't know [3661] x days, let's say like three days, if [3662] you haven't moved or done anything in [3664] three days and there's no emails in the [3665] CRM, then you send a follow-up email [3667] using AI to customize. Then you update [3670] the CRM stage. If no, then you wait for [3672] response or activity before going back [3674] here. [3675] Okay. All right. Finally, let's talk [3678] about the last system, which is just a [3679] reporting and analytics automation. [3681] Essentially what you're doing is instead [3682] of you having to have some business [3685] development person go through and then [3687] compile a report, you just do it [3688] completely autonomously and and and [3690] automatically using AI and then some [3692] sort of data extraction. So the idea is [3694] you are automating the generation of [3695] weekly or monthly reports using data [3697] from multiple sources. For instance, you [3699] might take data from their CRM, you [3700] might take data from their Stripe, you [3702] might take data from their Google [3703] Sheets, you might take data from various [3705] project tools, whatever. But you have [3707] all this stuff dumped into some central [3709] database. I'll maybe use Google [3711] BigQuery. Um, sorry, I'll use BigQuery [3713] or I'll use something like Google [3714] Sheets. And then it'll format and [3716] deliver that as a dashboard in a [3718] platform like Looker Studio or Plecto or [3721] one of the very many alternatives. Um, [3724] so that the person can just look at it. [3726] When I say generation of weekly or [3727] monthly reports, by the way, I don't [3728] mean that you do this once a week or [3730] whatever. I just mean like you have a [3731] dashboard that you can pull from once a [3733] week. But that same dashboard is [3735] actually accessible anytime. It's not [3737] like, you know, you have to wait a whole [3738] week to get a PDF or whatever. It's [3740] like, no, this is a a real live [3741] dashboard on Looker Studio or Plecto and [3744] just once a week you get an email being [3745] like, "Hey, here is a link to the [3747] dashboard with the filter setup for [3748] progress over the last week." This saves [3751] so much time pulling manual data across [3753] all platforms. Saves so much time [3755] because you're standardizing the exact [3757] same thing every single week, which most [3759] small to mid-size businesses making less [3760] than maybe 200k a month just really [3762] struggle with. And it makes reporting [3764] feel proactive instead of reactive. [3765] You're not generating reports that [3767] you're looking at. What you're doing is [3768] you're looking at a a real time updated [3770] dashboard and then just getting [3771] notified. Okay. The way this works [3773] again, schedule trigger, pull data from [3776] all these tools, calculate the KPIs and [3777] metrics, and then generate a report. I [3779] recommend that you personally use a [3781] dashboard wherever possible, just way [3782] cleaner, then just, you know, email it [3784] over to stakeholders at decision makers. [3786] Okay, as you guys could see, there is a [3790] lot more BS on the left side of this [3791] graph. Okay, lot more BS on the left [3794] side of this graph. My earnest [3796] recommendation for you guys is when you [3798] are building out [3800] systems, focus on real pre-existing [3802] customer problems. Focus on situations [3805] where the customer is already making [3807] money or doing a good job in this [3810] sphere. So, how can we make them do an [3812] even better job by sprinkling a little [3814] bit of automation on it? Don't put the [3816] forest before the trees. Don't get so [3820] caught up in how amazing and enjoyable [3821] and exciting automation is that you guys [3824] forget what you are put on this earth to [3826] do with this business model which is to [3827] take a working process and just scale it [3829] up. Okay? Don't get caught up with a lot [3832] of the the crazy things you guys are [3833] seeing on YouTube that show amazing [3835] demos of technologies and stuff like [3837] that, but instead focus on actual [3839] practical ways of implementing [3841] triedand-true methods like I've shown [3842] you here to make more money. Because if [3844] you can make your customer more money, [3846] you can make your customer happy. And if [3847] you can not sell your customer [3849] then they're going to make you very [3851] happy financially and also just in terms [3853] of your relationship in return. Thank [3855] you very much for watching. If you guys [3857] enjoy this sort of thing, I highly [3859] recommend you check out Maker School. As [3860] of the time of this recording, we are [3862] just under 1500 members, and I'm [3864] increasing the price the second that we [3866] hit to 1500. So, Maker School is my [3868] all-in-one 0 to1 roadmap with daily [3870] accountability to show you guys how to [3872] sell the exact same systems that I just [3874] ran through here. I give you guys [3875] practical, actionable dayby-day [3878] essentially check-ins over Loom where I [3880] guide you through step one, step two, [3882] step three, and by the end of it, you [3883] guys will have a fully functioning and [3885] not just functioning, but thriving AI [3887] and automation business. Really [3888] appreciate all the time. If you guys [3890] have any questions, just feel free to [3891] drop them down below. You guys have any [3893] recommendations for future content, [3894] please do the same. And I will catch [3896] youall in the next video. Thanks so [3897] much.

Title: 80% of AI Automation Basics in Just 29 Minutes
[0] 80% of AI automation basics in less than [2] 30 minutes. That's what we're going to [3] be talking about today. I'm going to be [4] giving you guys the core foundational [6] concepts you need to start and then [7] scale an AI automation business in a [9] fraction of the time of your [10] competitors. I scaled my own a [12] automation agency to $72,000 per month. [14] So, I've learned a fair amount along the [16] way. I also now coach almost 2,000 [18] people on how to do the same. Naturally, [20] I pick up on a lot of patterns. So, [22] that's what we're going to be covering. [23] This is you unfortunate person faced [25] with a decision. Do you want to spend [27] 100 hours learning a bunch of BS or do [29] you want to spend less than an hour? [30] Let's do half an hour actually to [33] acquire 80% of the basics. I believe [34] you've chosen right. Why don't we jump [36] right into the very first point and it [38] is the most boring point ever. And [40] you're probably like, Nick, why did you [41] start with this point? Well, it's [42] because I think a lot of people see AI [44] automation as this hype train and this [46] big bubble. And I want to push back [48] against that. AI automation is not [50] really all of that. It is just like any [51] other business. Don't get caught up in [53] the hype. Don't get caught up in the [55] shiny objects. The skills that make you [57] a successful AI automation business [59] owner are the exact same skills that [61] make you a successful plumber. They're [63] the exact same skills that make you a [65] successful recruitment agency owner. [67] They're the exact same skills that make [68] you a successful e-commerce business [70] owner. I'm going to draw a business [72] model on the right hand side here. And I [74] just want you guys to kind of like see [76] what which business models this matches. [78] Okay, we start with our lead genen. And [81] there's a variety of things that we do [83] for Legion. We could do cold email. [86] Okay? Maybe we do PPC. That's paperclick [89] ads. Maybe we do referrals. These are [91] all ways of getting people interested in [93] your business. And what do you do with [95] all these lead genen mechanisms? Well, [96] you then shuttle them to some sort of [99] conversion. So, usually this is a sales [103] call. Okay. What happens on the sales [106] call? Usually you'll send a proposal of [108] some kind also known as a quote or an [114] estimate. After that point the person [117] becomes a client. When they become a [118] client you then [121] fulfill and ideally at the very end of [123] this there would be some sort of [124] retention mechanism that you know gets [126] them back in through some other call and [128] then you just repeat and this is this is [130] really what makes you money. Okay. So, I [132] just drew that and that is how all AI [134] automation businesses work. Um, but kind [137] of just like zoom out a little bit. If [138] if you squint, what you'll notice is [141] this doesn't just apply to AI automation [142] businesses. That exact funnel that I [144] drew literally applies to like 90% of [147] B2B businesses all over the world. And [149] so, I say this to mean the only [152] difference between an AI automation [153] business and the vast majority of other [155] businesses that you may or may not have [156] experience with, the only difference is [159] this section right here. It's that [161] little fulfillment section. Okay. So, [163] you know, in a plumbing business or [165] whatever, that might be, I don't know, [168] repairs. That might be, you know, new [171] pipes. In a recruitment business, that [173] might be a candidate being placed. In a [176] PPC agency, that might be, you know, [178] some ad creatives being developed or [180] something. The point is the fulfillment [182] is the different part. Okay? That's the [184] AI automation part. But everything else, [187] your ability to drive leads, your [189] ability to close those leads, your [190] ability to impress the hell out of those [192] leads, whatever, all of this stuff is [195] foundational and is shared with [196] literally every other major digital [198] business model today. So, the reason why [200] I say all this is because don't focus [204] 90% of your energy on that tiny little [206] bit at the end that just happens to be [208] AI automation. If you guys really want [210] to crush it at this business model, [211] focus the vast majority of your energy [213] on the same foundational concepts that [215] you'd have to learn in any business. [217] Focus on your ability to drive leads. [219] Focus on your ability to sell to those [221] leads. Focus on your ability to retain [223] customers after they've made it through [224] your pipeline. If you guys are [226] incredible at that, and even if you [228] happen to be second rate at AI [230] automation, you guys will make way more [231] money than if it was the other way [233] around. Okay? So the fundamentals are [236] always what make your automation agency [238] or business successful. It's never fancy [240] fancy tech. It's never your [242] implementation. Um don't overthink the [244] technical aspects like I see a lot of [245] people coming from, you know, [246] programming or development or [248] engineering backgrounds do. Um and and [250] certainly don't underthink the business [252] side of things because the number one [254] thing that I see when people enter uh my [256] communities and my groups and my [257] products, they're always like, "Hey [259] Nick, you know, I'm I'm an engineer and [260] I'm great at building products, but I'm [261] not very good at marketing." And I'm [263] like, "All right, well then you're not [264] very good at being a business owner. So, [265] we need to fix that first, right? Your [266] development and engineering skills, [268] those things can wait. We need to make [269] sure that you're a good marketer. We [270] need to make sure you're a good [271] salesperson. And ultimately, we need to [273] make sure that you're good at business [274] development if we are to develop a [276] business." Cool. So, I mean, you know, [279] understated hopefully, but uh yeah, I [282] think that's probably one of the most [283] important parts. Now that I've covered [284] that, we can actually start getting into [285] some technicals. Okay. So, I think a lot [287] of people that are watching this are [289] probably at the start line of their AN [290] automation business. I mean, if you [291] weren't, likelihood of you watching [293] content like this is probably lower. So, [295] um I know real Sherlock Holmes over [297] here, but one of the core foundational [299] parts of AI automation agency [301] fulfillment uh is your ability to use an [304] API. So, an API just stands for [306] application programming [309] interface and [311] um all that really means, did I actually [314] get that right? API stands for [316] application programming interface. All [318] right, cool. Good god. I don't think [320] I've actually spelled this out in a very [322] long time. Got to love acronyms. Um, all [325] that really means is it's just a [328] essentially for our purposes, it is a [330] server URL somewhere on the internet [332] that we can send a request to and then [333] we can get things back. And the cool [335] part about APIs for us is you know those [337] AI automation tools that we tend to [338] really know and love. Stuff like [340] make.com, stuff like nadn, stuff like [342] zapier, stuff like lindy, all these drag [345] and drop no code platforms which are [346] really what most people think about when [347] they think AI automation. Well, these [349] don't have built-in integrations with [351] every platform that you might want to [352] connect them to for business purposes. [354] Okay, in those situations, we need to [356] use an API or an application programming [358] interface to build our own connection to [360] those services to allow us to get a job [362] done. I want to say that if you only use [365] built-in integrations, not only is your [366] ability to do anything actually really [368] cool for the client severely limited. A [370] lot of the time the client scales just [371] do that stuff themselves by dragging and [373] dropping modules across the screen, but [374] not only is it super limited, you can't [376] really drive as much value as you [378] realistically could out of any platform [380] because a lot of the time the simple [381] endpoints that are exposed by make.com [384] or zapier or nan or whatever um you know [386] they're just a lot more parameters there [388] a lot more options uh in the API versus [391] just the the drag and drop. So, what I'm [393] going to do here is I'm actually going [393] to run through how to connect to an API. [395] And I'm going to do it using two tools [396] that are really popular right now, [398] make.com and naden. And hopefully this [400] is just going to give you guys a [400] walkthrough what I look for when I [402] connect to an API. Um, as we see, the [405] number one thing that I always do [406] immediately is I look for O. Then I look [408] for a way to copy and paste a simple [410] example. And then from there, I [411] basically build a minimum viable API [413] call that just works. The second I have [415] something that works, which usually [416] involves some method endpoint and header [418] shenanigans. The second I have something [420] that works, everything else is so much [421] easier. So, um, yeah, let me show you [423] one example in make.com and then I'll [425] show you another example in, uh, n as [427] well. What's the API we're going to be [429] connecting to? It's this really cool one [430] called firewall. I've been using [431] firewall a lot more recently. [432] Essentially, what firecall is, it's just [434] a way to scrape like any website and [436] then return the results in what's called [438] markdown. So, this is my website right [440] over here. Okay, leftclick.ai, growth [442] systems for B2B companies. Got a [444] handsome photo of myself in the top [445] right hand corner. Then a bunch of other [447] BS. I'll save you guys the time. [448] Essentially what we do is um you know [450] they have this little playground here so [451] you guys can visually see what's going [452] on. But let's say I want to run a [456] scraper for a [458] leftclick.ai. Essentially what's [459] happening is on the back end it's [461] spinning up uh its own server and then [463] it's calling my website and then it's [464] extracting all the data for me. And then [466] what I end up getting in return is I end [467] up getting this markdown here. And [469] markdown is just a compressed version of [471] the HTML on the website. So I have like [473] access to formatting with these headers. [475] I have access to the links. I have [477] access to basically everything I'd need. [478] What's the value in scraping websites [480] and stuff like this? Well, I talk about [481] scraping a lot. Most of the examples in [483] this video are going to be all scraping [484] based. Um, just because I think there's [485] like tremendous um kind of strategic [488] sales value. Uh, but you know, the vast [491] majority of the time, anytime you're [492] whipping up an email campaign for [494] somebody or you're sending any sort of [495] outreach or you're doing any sort of [497] marketing that really matters, you're [499] going to be doing some sort of scraping [500] in Aon Automation. So, I just wanted to [501] make sure this is hyper relevant. Okay, [503] cool. So, um, that's more or less the [505] the playground. So, what I want to do [506] now is I want to run this through API. [508] I'm going to open up my make.com [509] scenario over here. I just have it [511] called API call example. The first thing [513] I'm going to do is I'm just going to [514] open up an HTTP request. And then what I [516] always start with is the make a request [518] module right over here. Okay. So, now [520] I'm going to head over to Firecrawl. And [521] what do I want to do? I want to use [522] their API, right? So, I'm going to go [524] firecrawl API. I always just Google the [527] API that I'm looking for. And I see [528] there's an API reference here. Awesome. [530] Looks good. Now, I'm confronted with [532] kind of an intimidating page. I have [534] SDKs, APIs, like what are all these [536] threeletter acronyms? Well, the good [538] news is this specific API is actually [540] pretty up toate and it's pretty clean. [541] Um, not all APIs are like this, but [543] essentially the very first and most [545] important thing that I'm looking for is [546] always the authentication. I think I [548] might have called it authorization back [549] here, but really what I meant was [551] authentication. Okay, so we need to [553] authenticate. Now, the way that [555] authentication typically works is there [556] there are two or three primary methods [558] nowadays. Um, the simplest one is what [560] we see over here, which is why I picked [562] this API, and it's called authorization [564] bearer. Now, authorization bearer is [566] super simple and it's super [567] straightforward. And essentially, all [568] this means is we need to add a header in [570] our HTTP request that includes the term [573] authorization and then the value of that [575] needs to say bearer and then a space and [577] then we need to have our API key. Okay, [579] I think this nuance is lost on a lot of [580] people. At least certainly was for me [582] when I got start started with all this [583] stuff. So, I'm just going to show you [584] guys what this actually looks like step [585] by step with this real API. And then I'm [588] just going to um change my API key [589] afterwards so you guys don't all run up [591] my fire crawl dev. Uh okay, cool. So, [594] let me just see here. Um what endpoint [596] do we really want to call? I guess let's [598] find an endpoint. So, I'm going to find [600] the simplest possible endpoint. I'm just [601] going to try recreating the playground [602] request. So, I think it's a scrape, [604] right? I'm just going to click scrape. [605] And what do we see here? Post scrape. [607] Okay, cool. The very um important thing [609] is on the right hand side. You see how [611] there's this curl request and usually [613] most APIs nowadays will have a big [615] snippet of code. Well, this is where I [617] basically go to copy and paste a a code [620] block with everything I need as quickly [623] as humanly possible. Now, what we see is [625] if I go back to my [627] um Excal here, we start with the [629] authorization and we figured out how to [631] do that. That's fine. Now, we're going [632] to look for a copy pasteed example and [633] then we're going to put together a [634] minimum viable API call. So, we've done [636] this. Okay, we've done this and now we [638] just need to put together this minimum [639] viable API call inside of make. So, I'm [641] just going to drag these docs all the [642] way over to the left side so I could [643] just very quickly and easily access [645] make.com. And then what I'm going to do [646] is I'm just going to copy all the fields [648] that are relevant. Now, the fields that [650] are always relevant are always going to [651] be the URL. So, I just grabbed the URL [653] directly from here. I'm going to copy [654] and I'm going to paste it inside of my [656] URL bar. The method, which if you guys [658] remember said post over here, it's [660] usually going to be get or [662] post. And then the headers, so [665] authorization bearer token. And this is [666] where we put our API key. Okay, so in [668] make I'm going to go down to headers, go [670] authorization, then I need to type [672] bearer. And now I need my API key. So [674] where am I going to get that? Top right [675] hand corner. I'm going to go to my um [676] fire crawl. Then I'm going to go down to [678] API keys. Obviously every platform that [680] you're using is going to have a [681] different UX for API keys and stuff. But [684] this is what fire calls looks like. [685] Okay. And then I'm going to go to API [687] key. And I'm just going to copy this API [688] key. I'll go back to make and I'm just [690] going to paste that in. Okay. So now we [692] have the authorization taken care of [694] which is really cool. The next thing we [696] need is if we go back to this doc, you [698] see how um there's a uh content type [700] application JSON header. Well, in make [702] it's really easy to do. You just go body [704] type and then you go raw and then [706] content type you just set to JSON [708] application/json and then uh under [710] request content. That's where this data [712] flag is going to come in. And it's [713] always a data flag in a post request. [715] So, what I'm going to do is I'm actually [716] just going to copy this entire [718] thing. Okay. I'm going to go back into [721] my make and then I'm going to paste it [722] in. And all I want is I want my URL, [727] which in this case is being covered with [729] a string. So I'm just going to paste in [731] leftclick.ai. Now you see there are a [733] ton of options here. Include tags, [734] exclude tags. Usually in APIs like this, [736] anytime you see these strings with this, [738] it's kind of like this code. This is [739] just like a standin or like a template [741] or like a placeholder. So I'm just going [742] to get rid of all of these. And to be [744] honest, do I do I even need any of [745] these? I don't really think so. It looks [747] like the only thing I actually need is [748] just the body, right? I'm just going to [749] remove all other options but this URL. [751] Maybe I'll leave the markdown, too. [753] Okay, get that out. Going to make sure [754] that everything is still formatted in [755] JavaScript object notation. That's [757] definitely a good skill to learn if you [759] guys are using APIs. And then I'm going [760] to rightclick this and press run this [762] module only. I see it's taken some time. [764] It's a pretty good sign. Usually when [766] things take time and on make.com side, [768] that means you're not getting an instant [769] error. And what do I see if I go down to [771] the bottom of the screen? Metadata [774] markdown. I have all my markdown in this [776] variable over here. If I scroll even [778] further down, I have my entire website. [781] And then I also have a bunch of other [782] fields like source URL, scrape ID, [784] description, title for my meta, all that [786] stuff. So what have I done here, guys? [788] I've successfully built an API request, [791] inmate.com. As you see, it only took [793] maybe 2 or 3 minutes as long as you know [795] where to look and where to start. I'm [797] going to do the exact same thing now in [798] NAND. And you'll see it's actually even [799] simpler because, you know, the solutions [801] usually do a fair job of giving you [803] what's called a curl request. And you [804] can actually just copy and paste a curl [806] request directly into NAD. Does most of [808] the work for you. So now I'm going to [809] open up an NAN um uh workflow over here [812] and then I'm just going to type in HTTP [813] request. Same thing as before. Then you [815] see in the top rightand corner it says [816] import curl. What you can do is you can [818] actually just grab this curl, copy all [820] of it. Okay, curl is just a way that you [822] send a request using your terminal. Then [824] I'm going to click import curl. Paste it [826] all over here. Import. And then now [828] we've actually automatically filled out [830] all of that data. Okay. By just copying [834] and pasting a curl request. This is why [835] a lot of people like NAND. NAN is a [837] little bit more developer friendly and [838] geared towards people doing API [840] integrations and stuff like that. I need [842] an API token. So, I'm just going to copy [844] this over. Go back over here. Paste this [846] in. Super easy. Then, what else did we [848] have? We just had a URL, right? So, I'm [849] just going to go https [851] leftclick.ai. And then I'll leave the [853] formats part and just delete everything [855] else. This to me looks like pretty good [856] JSON. If you're ever unsure whether [859] something's good JSON, just go to [860] jsonformmatterater.com, paste in your [862] JSON, then click format or beautify. If [864] it works, you're going to get something [865] like that. If it doesn't work, let's say [867] we have an extra comma, it's going to [868] tell you where the error is. And [870] usually, you'll be able to look at the [871] fifth line and then be like, "Oh, okay. [873] I have an extra comma there." Anyway, [875] now that we know that that's good, I'm [876] just going to go back over here and I'm [877] going to click test [878] step. Same as before, we do not get an [881] instant error. What we do get is we get [882] the data on the website scraped ready [885] for us basically instantly. Okay, so [888] yeah, API calls are not magic. They're [890] actually pretty easy and pretty simple [891] and pretty straightforward. You just [892] have to be smart about how you use them. [894] So, next up, let's talk a little bit [896] about the other side of the equation. We [898] just talked about sending data. Well, [899] let's now talk about receiving data. And [901] the best way to receive data is using [904] something called a web hook. A web hook, [906] to make a long story short, is just like [908] an API call is a way to connect [910] something that doesn't have a connector [911] built into your note platform. Uh, it's [913] a way to create your own connection um [915] sending data out. A web hook is just a [917] way to do that for sending data in. So [919] web hook is just a custom URL basically [921] that you are creating that enables you [923] to point other services to you and then [926] when you do something like maybe you [927] change a record or you update a status [929] or uh some new email comes in or [931] whatever you can actually trigger a web [934] hook on the make.com or the nadn or [937] whatever your note code tool is end to [939] start some flow. Okay, so highly [941] encourage you guys to figure this out [942] because if you do figure it will make [943] you unstoppable. Learning web hooks and [945] learning APIs are probably like the two [948] I don't know I'd say they're probably [949] like the two highest leverage things to [951] learn in the actual AI automation [952] fulfillment side of things aside from [954] you know this business skills we talked [955] about earlier. So how exactly would you [956] do that? Well in make it's pretty easy. [958] All you do so you just go to this web [960] hook node or module. What you want is [962] custom web hook. Okay. Then you create a [965] custom web hook and I'll just say my [966] example web hook. And now what you have [969] is you have a server essentially that is [971] willing to receive a request. All you [974] need to do is send a request to this [976] server and then you are going to trigger [977] your make.com flow. So if I click run [979] once, you'll see it's waiting. Okay, the [982] simplest request you could send with a [983] web hook is actually just you trying to [985] access a website. So if I just take the [986] URL, which was this one up here, and [988] then I paste it in, what do you think is [990] going to happen if I press enter? Well, [991] my browser is going to send a request [993] over to this web hook URL, which is [995] going to trigger my flow. So I just [996] press the button. As you see, it says [998] accepted. And then if I go back here, [1000] this make.com operation, it actually got [1002] triggered, which is pretty crazy. Now, [1004] there's some built-in logic with web [1005] hooks that they don't really teach you [1006] about, but because web hooks are just a [1008] server request, you can also do things [1009] like past query parameter uh query [1012] parameters over. So, um, if I were to [1014] put a question mark and then say query [1016] parameters equal example, then press [1017] enter, what you see is I now have access [1019] to a variable called [1021] query_parameters. Now, I'm doing this [1022] with a browser, but you can actually do [1024] this with any service you want. And you [1025] can do this with u monday.com. You can [1027] do this with ClickUp. There are a [1028] variety of different ways to do this. If [1030] I go over to app.clickup.com, which is [1032] just a simple project management tool [1034] that I really like, then I click on [1036] their automations uh feature. You'll see [1039] here that if I click manage all [1041] automations, I have the ability to set [1042] up an automation where when I do [1044] something, basically I can fire off a [1047] web hook request. Now, if I fire off a [1050] web hook request, if I paste this URL in [1052] here, then I just say, I don't know, [1054] task created. So, every time I create a [1055] task, I'm going to call a web hook. If I [1057] do this, okay, then I go back to my make [1060] scenario, run this, go back to my [1062] ClickUp, and again, ClickUp can be [1063] whatever the hell you want. It doesn't [1064] have to be ClickUp. It could be [1065] monday.com, it could be pandoc. [1067] Basically, every one of these tools has [1069] a web hook feature. Then, if I say this [1071] is an example record, I press enter. [1074] Then, I go back here. What you'll see is [1076] ClickUp just triggered that web hook and [1078] then sent it over to the address that I [1080] listed which has now enabled me to start [1082] a flow in my no code tool. So it's as [1084] simple as that. Does not have to get [1085] more complicated. So I'm sure you guys [1087] can imagine NAND is basically the exact [1089] same thing. There is a web hook [1091] node. The only difference between um [1094] make.com web hooks and then NAND web [1096] hooks are there's a test URL and [1098] production URL. Um, and generally when [1100] you are testing something, you need to [1101] have this web hook- test in the URL. [1103] When it is live and it's ready for [1105] production and your your workflow is on, [1107] it needs to just say web hook. You also [1109] need to specify the method. It needs to [1110] be either a get or a post, but I'll [1112] leave all that to specific programming [1114] videos. Um, it's more or less the exact [1116] same flow here. So, if you know how web [1119] hooks work, you're already 90% of the [1120] way to being what I would call a good [1122] automator. Um, you know, web hooks, API [1125] requests, these are basically like the [1126] tools of the trade. And to be honest, [1128] anytime you're using a built-in [1129] automation or, you know, a drag and drop [1131] node anyway, all you're doing is you're [1132] you're you're using web hooks, they're [1134] just not telling you that you're using [1135] web hooks or you're using API calls. [1136] They're just not telling you that you're [1137] using API calls. All right. Okay, cool. [1140] Next up, I want to talk how to prompt AI [1142] models effectively. As the AI and AI [1145] automation probably implies, most of our [1146] work involves weaving in artificial [1148] intelligence into some sort of business [1150] process. So, I have the simplest [1152] possible way to think of this, and I'm [1154] going to give it to you right now. There [1155] are basically three types of prompts and [1158] these three types of prompts are present [1159] across more or less all of the current [1161] at large language model tools. There is [1163] a system prompt. Okay, there is a user [1166] prompt and then there is a assistant [1169] prompt. These are the three types. Now, [1171] the way to prompt an AI and to [1173] consistently achieve pretty good [1175] results, you know, you got to go a lot [1176] deeper if you want to get amazing [1177] results, but if you want pretty good [1178] results, results that are enough for you [1180] to whip up a flow in a few seconds and [1182] then impress a business [1183] owner, what you need to know is that the [1186] system prompt is how the model [1189] identifies. So this is where you [1191] say you are a data [1197] entry professional or something or you [1201] say you are a skilled recruiter. You are [1205] the president of the United States. I [1206] don't know whatever the heck you want it [1207] to roleplay as. This is the identity [1209] that you're giving the model. Okay. The [1212] user is where you give it a task where [1216] you say your [1218] task is to do a thing. Then the [1223] assistant prompt, okay, is what the AI [1226] gives you back. And usually the way that [1229] I like to do things is I like to have [1231] the assistant give me back my stuff as a [1236] JavaScript object notation um JSON uh [1240] string. So, it's going to look like this [1241] with curly braces with a key and a [1243] value. The reason why I do that is [1244] because when you get in the habit of [1245] doing this, you can then very easily [1247] integrate this with any tool on planet [1249] Earth. You're using what's called [1251] structured data. And once you have [1252] structure to your data, you can [1253] obviously um you know, forward that over [1255] to some software platform, parse out the [1257] keys, add the values to to other [1259] variables and stuff. It's pretty cool. [1261] Okay, so that's more or less what this [1263] looks like. just to run you guys through [1264] it very quickly with an NAND flow that I [1266] built to personalize um real client or [1269] real lead data. I've since sold this [1272] system many times. I've also put this up [1274] on Maker School and make [1276] moneywithmake.com, my two automation [1277] communities. We've had many, many people [1279] sell this. This is exactly what a real [1281] functional system that you guys can [1283] charge money for looks like. Um the AI [1285] model for this system essentially has a [1288] system prompt where you say you're a [1290] helpful intelligent writing assistant. [1291] That's its identity. And then we have a [1294] user prompt where we give it the task. [1296] Your task is to personalize an email. [1297] You'll do this by taking a prospect [1300] LinkedIn profile and then editing five [1301] templates for different sections of the [1303] email. Subject line, icebreaker, [1304] elevator pitch, call to action, and a PS [1306] field. Your templates are below. Then I [1308] give it some templates. Then I give it [1310] some guidelines. Then finally, to make a [1313] long story short, I say respond in JSON [1315] using this format. Okay. Then what do I [1318] have? Well, this is where things get a [1320] little bit more complicated and where [1321] most people kind of lose me, but [1323] essentially after um the system prompt, [1325] you put a user prompt. After the user [1326] prompt, you put a second user prompt [1328] where you actually give it the data that [1330] you want it to operate off of. And then [1332] finally, when you're done, the AI will [1334] return essentially an an assistant [1336] prompt. So, this is sort of the behind [1337] the scenes sort of, you know, the the [1339] best way to think about using this sort [1341] of stuff um live. And it's what I follow [1343] every single time that I build a system [1345] that prints money. I mean, I I follow [1347] this card blanch. I'm going to have this [1349] Excala draw in the uh description, so [1351] you guys can just click the link, look [1352] at this exact structure, and use it in [1353] your own platform. Um, I'm using uh just [1356] Nad for that example. But keep in mind, [1358] you can do the exact same thing in [1359] Make.com, exact same thing in Zapier. [1361] That's why I drew this out just so you [1362] guys had something that's platform [1364] agnostic. Okay. Number five is to use [1366] what's called testdriven development. [1368] Now, I don't think a lot of people fully [1369] understand what this means, but usually [1371] the way that people will build out [1372] workflows is they will try and in their [1374] head map out what the whole thing looks [1376] like and then they'll drag and drop like [1378] 50 modules together and then click run [1381] or test. Then obviously there'll be an [1383] error at some point during the flow and [1385] then when the error occurs, they're not [1386] entirely sure where they need to go to [1388] fix it or why it happened in the first [1390] place. Don't do that. Instead, do what's [1392] called testdriven development. When you [1394] start building stuff, okay, start by [1396] dropping the first module in. Okay, then [1399] test to make sure the first module [1401] works. Test to make sure that with the [1403] inputs that you provide that module, [1405] everything the outputs are as expected. [1407] Once you're done with that, then and [1408] only then do you drop module 2 down. [1410] Then you test module 2. Then and only [1413] then do you move on to module 3. And so [1415] on and so on and so forth. The reason [1416] why is because if something in your flow [1418] breaks, okay, and you know that [1421] everything up until here was perfect and [1424] then all of a sudden there started being [1426] a break right over here, where do you [1429] think your error is? Obviously, the [1431] error is right over here. So, this is [1433] where you're going to look. The reason [1435] why this is valuable is because when [1436] you're building systems, debugging, the [1438] process of going through and trying to [1440] figure out what the problem is is a [1442] massive time sync. It's like a binary [1444] search tree in technical terms. It's [1446] super freaking expensive time-wise. But [1449] then if you test driven develop like I'm [1451] doing here, every time you test a module [1453] after you put it in, it actually just [1455] it's a fixed time cost. It takes like 30 [1457] seconds every time you do that. Your [1458] flow has 10 modules. What are you doing? [1460] You're testing for 5 minutes total and [1461] you know the whole thing works and you [1463] know exactly where the debug um is, [1465] right? So instead of your uh debugging [1468] kind of looking like this, if this is [1470] time and this is um I don't know let's [1473] say debug time and this is like your [1476] step in [1478] process basically your debug time looks [1481] like this which is a lot more consistent [1484] uh like this a lot more consistent a lot [1486] more measurable and a lot more reliable. [1489] Okay, so just a much simpler and easier [1491] way to think about it. When you guys [1493] create something, okay, just like I [1494] tested the web hook, test the web hook [1496] first before putting down uh the next [1498] module. Okay, when you're done with uh [1501] whatever you're testing, actually test [1503] the whole flow again. Okay, right click [1505] on it, click run this module only and [1507] say, hm, you know, did the uh value y [1510] come out like I expected? Yes, it did. [1511] Okay, great. Now I can move on. The [1513] second you get in the habit of this, [1514] your builds are going to be a lot [1515] faster. [1517] Okay. And then the last thing I wanted [1518] to cover is anytime you're building [1520] something, start at the end. Don't start [1522] at the beginning. So, you know how [1523] earlier I was talking test-driven [1524] development, start with module one, [1525] start with module 2. Well, actually, I [1527] was kind of being tongue and cheek. What [1528] you should really do is, let's say you [1529] have 10 modules in your in your desired [1531] flow. What you want to do is you [1532] actually want to start with module 10. [1533] You want to test to make sure module 10 [1535] works, and then you want to work [1536] backwards to module 9. You want to test [1537] to make sure module 9 works, then you [1539] want to work backwards to module 8. Now, [1541] I know you're probably thinking this is [1542] silly, but let me give you a quick [1543] example flow. Let's say you have a very [1545] simple proposal generator. Okay, this is [1547] a proposal generator flow that I've [1549] built and shown on my channel many [1551] times. The way that this works is [1553] usually you will have some form. You [1555] will have the salesperson full [1557] information about the prospect in this [1558] form during a sales call. You'll then [1560] have AI to generate content whether [1564] that's a copy for a proposal, maybe [1566] you're customizing an email to send out [1567] or something. Then you will customize an [1569] asset, so either a Google Slides or a [1571] Panda doc. Then finally, you'll send an [1573] email with the Google Slides proposal. [1574] How would I actually build this thing? I [1576] actually wouldn't build it left to [1577] right. What I would do is I would start [1579] with the last module. Okay, this is [1581] where I'd start. I'd actually put down a [1583] module that sends the email that I want [1585] that contains a link to the Google [1586] Slides proposal. You know, if my flow [1589] starting left to right is supposed to [1591] start with a type form or something, I [1594] wouldn't actually start with the type [1595] form. What I would do is I'd go all the [1596] way on the right here and I start with [1597] the email. Okay? I would have send an [1600] email all the way on the right. I would [1601] then add an [1603] example of the data that I [1608] want along with the attachment type that [1611] I want. I would do all of this and then [1613] I would test it. I would make sure it [1614] lands. And only when I make sure that it [1616] lands. Only when I make sure that the [1617] end does what I want to do would I then [1619] work backwards, which in this case might [1622] be a Google Slides module or something. [1624] Okay. So maybe now um I would do Google [1627] Slides and then I would go create [1629] presentation from a template. Now this [1632] is a little bit backwards. So I'd stick [1633] it right over here. Then you know after [1635] that what would I do? I would go and I [1637] would add an open AI node. Okay. I would [1639] test to make sure that open AI node [1641] works. And then I would uh we're doing [1643] create a [1644] completion and make sure that's all good [1647] to go. Okay. Then maybe before that I [1648] have some other data processing stuff. [1650] But the point that I'm making is I would [1651] actually this entire time work this way, [1654] not this way. And there are a couple [1656] reasons for this, but to make a long [1658] story short, when you work backwards, [1660] what you're doing is you're eliminating [1662] wasted time on all of those paths that [1664] lead nowhere. So if this is the flow at [1669] the end of it, okay, it's four modules [1672] or nodes. [1674] In order to create it, what you actually [1676] had to do is you had to make this and [1678] then you had to try this and then that [1679] didn't work and then you had to go back [1680] here and you had to try this and maybe [1682] that worked. But then you tried this and [1684] that didn't work. You tried that and [1685] then you got back here. Okay. And then [1688] finally you got over here. So like this [1690] is the the the actual flow. And I think [1692] I drew an extra one here, didn't I? [1693] Yeah, I did. That's all right. But [1695] during the building process, you [1697] experimented with all these weird ass [1698] paths. It didn't actually lead anywhere. [1700] These are all wasted time. Okay. It's [1702] kind of like how you have like a million [1704] in one ways, okay, to make it to X over [1709] here. So, these are all the ways that [1712] you could go. If you just started at X [1714] and then picked one of these, let's say, [1717] let's make this blue. Let's say this one [1718] here, you'd actually only ever spend [1720] that time building it backwards and [1723] traversing that one path. You don't [1725] actually have to try all the all the [1726] candidate paths it's called. So, yeah, [1729] start at the end, not at the beginning. [1731] easily the simplest and most [1732] straightforward way to getting this [1733] done. If your goal is to send an AI [1735] written email, have the AI write the [1737] email first and then send it. Don't [1738] actually like start with the trigger. [1740] Don't start with all the introductory [1741] logic. Don't do any of that. All right. [1743] Hopefully that makes sense. Awesome [1745] guys. Had a blast putting this video [1746] together for you. Hopefully you've [1747] earned the 8020 of the 8020 of the 8020 [1750] at this point. If anybody has any [1751] questions about up and getting up and [1753] running with AI automation as a business [1755] model or web hooks APIs or any of the [1757] more technical things that I talked [1758] about today, just drop a comment down [1759] below and more than happy to help. And [1761] if you guys like this sort of stuff, [1762] definitely check out Maker School. We're [1764] just under 1500 members as of the time [1766] of this recording. Prices are increasing [1768] the second we hit that 1500 member cap. [1769] If you guys wanted to start an [1771] automation business, now is definitely [1773] the time.

Title: Scrape & Auto DM Every Social Media Platform Using AI (2025)
[0] Hey, today I'm going to show you an [1] exhaustive list of ways to scrape every [4] major social media platform currently [6] known to men. That includes Facebook, [8] Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Tik Tok, [12] and we're even going to do YouTube. I'm [14] also going to show you how to automate [15] outreach on those platforms. So, you're [17] not just going to be able to get a list [19] of leads, you're going to be able to put [21] those leads into a sequence and actually [23] sell them stuff, which is what I think [24] most people really care about. I have a [26] giant flowchart here that shows you how [28] to get up and running on every platform. [30] So, if you guys want that, just head [31] over to the uh link in the description [32] to find it. Let us start with the very [34] first, which is going to be uh Twitter. [36] And I'm actually going to go as far as [38] literally signing up to the platforms [40] for you guys. So, I'm going to whip out [41] my my super cool uh AX and we're [44] literally going to be paying uh money [46] and signing up to these platforms. All [48] good in the hood. I want to show you [49] guys how this stuff actually works if [50] you were to go out and do it for a [52] client today. So, starting with the [54] first, which is Twitter, the number one [56] simplest and easiest way to scrape and [59] then do outreach to Twitter profiles [60] right now is the [62] drippy.ai. Uh, I'm not affiliated with [64] Drippy at all. In fact, I'm not [65] affiliated with the vast majority of the [66] platforms I'm going to be talking about [67] today, but it is a very straightforward [69] way of essentially just plugging in a [71] couple of parameters and then getting a [74] list of leads that you automate the [76] outreach to. So, Drippy is right over [79] here. You just type drippy.ai. It's an [81] AI assistant for your Twitter or XDMs. [83] They pitch it this way because this is [84] obviously not cool or funky dory with [87] the Twitter terms of service. So, they [90] have to kind of pitch themselves as an [91] assistant more than anything else. Let [93] me put in my email [95] address. Next up, they're going to send [97] me a verification email. So, I'm just [99] going to open up my email. [101] Cool. Then going to verify. Verification [104] looks good. I should now be able to just [106] refresh this. Okay. Awesome. Now we are [109] in Drippy. So we're going to do some [111] onboarding here. I'm just going to add [112] some basic answers, I should [116] say. I'm now going to add or connect my [119] Twitter account. So in order to do that [122] here, you obviously need to actually [123] manually connect your Twitter. So I'm [125] going to do [128] that. You then have to sign into [133] Twitter. And then I'm just going to save [135] my password. They're going to then email [137] me an additional verification code [139] because obviously they don't want you to [143] um be doing any sort of [146] scamming. Paste that [149] in. Should now be connected. We have an [152] onboarding session that is optional. I'm [154] just going to skip that. And then okay, [156] great. Now they're going to walk you [159] through the process of adding a lead [161] list and so on and so forth. Uh I'm just [163] going to do that myself sort of next. [164] So, it's not very difficult to do. A lot [166] of the stuff is self-explanatory. So, to [168] add a new lead source, I'm just going to [170] click new lead source. And you have a [171] couple of options here. They're going to [172] allow you to scrape leads from a tweet [175] or a Twitter profile. You can also just [176] import leads from a CSV file, which I'll [178] talk about in a second. And then you can [180] do lookalike leads, finding leads [181] similar to your existing customers or [183] ICP. So, in my case, um, yeah, I'm just [185] going to click this to start, but I I'm [186] also going to run through the other [187] options here. Lead scraper basically [189] means when you click this button, little [191] modal is going to pop up that's going to [192] allow us to let's say we want to do uh I [195] don't know an account source. All you do [196] is you literally just put in the account [198] that you want to scrape the followers of [200] essentially. So um I don't know. I mean [202] there's a lot of options I have over [203] here. Uh why don't I just do I don't [205] even know if we could do myself, but I'm [206] just going to try doing myself. That way [208] I don't have to muck around with anybody [209] else's. So I'm just going to add this as [211] my [212] source. Cool. Looks like it pulled my [215] data successfully. And what do I want to [216] do? Do I want to do followers or [217] following? Maybe I just want to, you [218] know, contact the followers of some [220] automation dude. [221] Okay. Now, what's going to happen is [224] it's going to start importing that list [226] of followers. Now, um this is a preview [229] uh of 400. And I believe they do 400 or [231] maybe 10% or something like that. So, [233] we're just going to let that preview [234] run. After that preview is finished, uh [237] we'll click next. And here we have a [238] couple of options. We can um [240] continuously like we can add more. So, [242] we could filter leads by the number of [244] followers that they have. So, we could [246] grab my leads and then we could say, hm, [248] I only want to, you know, reach out to [250] leads if they have more than 100 [252] followers. We could also filter by the [254] number of following. We could exclude [256] leads based off of whether their bio [257] says something or whether their bio um [260] like doesn't have something. We could [262] have a number of tweets filter. And then [264] we could also just reuse other saved [266] ones that we have. So, in my case, I'm [267] just going to filter leads and I just [269] want them to have more than 100 [270] followers because if they have less than [271] 100 followers, I don't know, odds are [273] they're just new profiles or maybe they [275] don't really have any valuable things to [276] say or whatnot. I want people that are a [278] little bit more socially engaged. So, [279] I'm just going to click apply. Okay. [281] Then I'll go down to next. And then um [283] we now are essentially just previewing [285] our changes. So, I have one data source. [287] I have one filter applied. Brought my [289] 4,000 down to 1,400. Then they're also [292] going to give us a lead credits amount. [294] And in this case, I'm just going to say [295] Nick Rives [297] followers greater than 100 [300] followers. Then going to save. And now [303] voila, we have our [304] drippy.ai lead source. Um, it's already [307] done all the lead scraping for us. Uh, [309] now it's currently importing, which is [311] pretty nice. Obviously, if you want to [312] actually do this, you are going to have [314] to, you know, upgrade your account. So [315] then you just head over to their um [318] app.drippy.ai/ settings/plans. And here [320] you'll have access to a bunch of them. [322] There's like a starter plan, an [324] unlimited plan, then custom plans. So, [326] um I'm just going to click start free [328] trial on the starter plan cuz that's [329] just all I need for the purposes of this [330] demo. Nothing super fancy. And then I'm [333] going to go ahead and then start my [335] trial. Okay. So, while all that stuff is [337] importing, I'm going to head over to [338] automations. And then what I want is I [340] want um to set up my cold DM automation [343] essentially. So, what I'm going to do is [344] I'll use cold DM 2.0. This allows us to [346] send outreach messages to users you've [348] imported as a lead source. So, I'm going [349] to click next. Then the source I'm going [352] to use is going to be Nyx followers. [354] Then we have the option here to either [357] layer AI personalizations into an [358] existing script or provide the AI with [360] instructions to write an entirely [361] personalized message. So you kind of [363] have u um you know two options here. In [365] my case, I'll just use script [365] personalizer. And to be clear, I [367] actually recommend you guys just like [368] use a AI to personalize an element of an [372] already pre-existing script because uh [374] somebody that's read, you know, sent [375] several hundreds of thousands of emails [377] at this point, that's typically how you [378] get the highest ROI. You don't have AI [380] take care of everything for you because [381] AI can just kind of be flamboyant and [383] annoying and the tone of voice tends to [385] suck. You actually just like have a a a [387] snippet of text that works and you know [389] it works. You just have AI customize a [391] couple of parts about it. So here is [393] where you have the option of setting [394] this up and then they actually allow you [396] to test it which I think is really cool. [397] So there's standard and then there's [399] advanced. I'm just going to use [400] standard. And essentially um what you do [402] here is you provide a little bit of [403] context. So who are you? Who is your [405] business? Um what's your offer? So, uh, [407] I'm just going to put my my context [409] here. I'm going to say, you know, my [411] name is Nick. I run a YouTube channel [415] with not my anime list.net search with [418] 60,000 [420] subscribers subscribers where I teach AI [425] automation, cold email, [428] um, cold [430] outreach, and growing your online [432] business. [435] I do this by drilling deep into process [442] optimization and doing live builds, [446] showing [447] people how to put complex automations [450] together in a simple fashion. I don't [452] know, just pulling stuff out of my ass [453] here. Hopefully you guys can tell. Uh, [455] then you have your own script. So, here [457] is where you would actually write your [459] script and then you'd put in like your [460] your personalization variables and [462] stuff. So, I would probably go, "Hey, [464] first [466] name [467] love." And then here I'd [471] go some specific aspect about their [476] profile. Refreshing to see some [479] refreshing aspect of their profile [482] that's different from other [485] people's. Thought I'd reach out. For [488] context, I run a YouTube channel at [491] around 60k subs and I'm looking for, I [493] don't know, let's hypothetically say I'm [495] looking for, I don't know, like clippers [496] for my my YouTube content, which is [498] actually something that I am currently [499] doing right now. So, I run a YouTube [500] channel around 60. I'm looking for [502] clippers. Your profile came up as a good [506] fit. short [510] form. Given your experience with short [514] form, would there be any interest in [517] giving this a try? I have a [521] challenge set up here. I'm just going to [524] go to my challenge. Uh, and the way [527] that this works for people that are [528] unfamiliar is basically I just have a [529] bunch of content and I'm offering people [531] the ability to clip and post my content [533] on their own websites for on their own [535] um social media platforms for a dollar [537] per thousand views. So, I'm going to [540] paste this [541] in. Let me know. Thanks, neck. Cool. [546] Check the settings. Creativity. Nope. [548] That's all good. We can include website [549] context, include tweet context, and then [552] uh yeah, we're basically good to go. I'm [553] just going to generate a message to this [555] perpetual comics person here [558] who love the fact you're a comic [560] collector, especially someone with a [561] part-time role at Oracle. Thought I'd [562] reach out for context. I run a YouTube [564] channel at 60k subs. I'm looking for [565] clippers. Your profile came up. So, this [566] is like the the standardized one, right? [568] Let me know. Thanks, Nick. Cool. And I [569] used 002 credits for that. Very nice. [571] Very nice. Here we have the ability to [573] generate some message variants. So, we [575] can actually have AI do it. So, I'm just [577] going to click generate variants. It's [579] now going to generate a couple of [580] different messages. The reason for this, [582] uh, why you might want to do this on [583] Twitter anyway, is just because, um, you [585] don't want to send the exact same [586] message over and over and over again. [588] You want to like vary the messages that [589] are being sent out so that Twitter [591] doesn't think that you're just like [591] spamming a bunch of people via DMs, [593] which, as I mentioned previously, is not [594] exactly part of their terms of [596] service. AI is going through the whole [599] rigomearroll. Maybe while it's doing so, [601] I'll just make a little [604] change. I'm looking for video. Let's [611] do video editors [617] instead. And I'm just realizing like if [619] I'm going to run this, I should probably [620] change the primary audience so that it's [622] video editors and not necessarily people [623] that follow my channel, right? But I'm [625] sure you guys can kind of see how you'd [626] piece stuff like that together. Maybe [627] you follow the followers of some video [629] editing channel that uh teaches people [631] how to edit videos. Well, odds are [632] people that follow that person are going [634] to know how to edit your videos. So you [635] just perform customized DMI reach for [637] them. [641] Cool. Looking for great [645] editors and are a fan of styles like [652] um let's just do [656] screenblade. [660] Cool. Let me know if [663] so. No pressure. Cool. That looks pretty [665] good to me. Then we have some follow-ups [668] that we can add. So, I'm not going to [669] add any follow-ups. Um, well, maybe I [671] will. I'll just say just checking in on [672] this. Let me know. And then after that, [675] we could also schedule how many messages [677] we want to send. So, maybe I want to [678] send 10 messages per hour or something [679] like that. I don't know. Not Not really. [681] Um, you generally want to keep your [682] limits pretty low here. I think on [684] average, you want to send like 50ish DMs [686] a day. So, about 1,500 a month max. You [688] can also set a delivery schedule like, [689] you know, Monday to Friday between 9:00 [691] a.m. and like 6:00 p.m. PT, for [693] instance. I'm just going to leave that [694] delivery schedule off and just send it [695] all the time. And then if I've already [696] previously contacted somebody, I'm just [698] going to leave that off. I can [699] autofollow people if I want to auto like [701] them, auto retweet. Uh, you know, [703] there's there's a lot of options here. [704] Um, but I'm for now I'm just going to [705] leave all of this as next. Finally, then [708] we enter the automation name. So, I'll [710] just say primary DM automation. And then [712] the sending account is going to be [713] Nikki. I'm just going to create. Once [714] I've created this thing, obviously we [716] are good to go. um it is going to pull [718] uh leads directly from my leads section [721] here and then start sending uh outreach [723] to all of the people that I've listed [725] here. Right? Import is now complete. [727] We're basically good to go. Um so that's [729] basically all you need to do. Um once [731] you're done that, it is now live. The [732] automation is sending. You are good to [734] go. Um you can obviously turn off the [736] new cool DMs or follow-ups if you want. [738] You also have the ability to um pause [740] the whole outreach campaign here uh if [742] you so wish. But um yeah, that's [744] literally all you need to do in order to [745] get this up and running. Now, let's [747] cover a couple of those other lead [748] generation methods. So, you see how [750] earlier um when I was creating my little [751] lead source, I could do lead scraper, [753] CSV import, or lookalike leads. Well, [755] CSV import is a pretty cool mechanism [757] that you could use in order to find [758] leads that I don't think a lot of people [760] know how to how to use, but you can [762] actually drill much deeper down than [763] their um their defaults. The way you do [765] so is you do something like Apify, which [767] is a scraper that enables you to scrape [769] large volumes of profiles without [770] necessarily having to use Drippy's [772] interface. I can see this probably being [774] more beneficial from a credit [775] perspective as well, but basically it's [777] a big marketplace where you could scrape [778] any platform, and I'm going to cover how [780] to use it in a few of my future ones. [782] You could do Tik Tok, you can do [783] Instagram. Um, in our case, we're going [784] to do Twitter. And so, what you can do [787] is you theoretically could actually [789] scrape, let's say, based off keywords, [790] based off tweets and stuff. So, you [792] could extract all of the information [795] that you could ever want based off of, I [797] don't know, you could put like Elon [798] Musk's Twitter profile or something, and [800] then you could get a big list of all of [802] the tweets that he's ever made. Then, [803] based off all the tweets that he's ever [804] made, you can get a bunch of people that [806] have commented on his Twitter posts. [808] Then from that, scrape all the people [809] that have commented on his Twitter posts [811] and then use that as your list. Um, [812] which would essentially be a customized [814] one. Um, that Drippy doesn't allow you [815] to do so organ uh organically, right? [818] So, a lot of cool options there. Um, but [819] I think I'm going to leave it at that. [820] There's there's a lot that you can do [821] with this and there's a lot that you [822] could obviously customize. Um the last [825] mechanism is you could also do a [826] lookalike leads. So what you do is you [829] paste a link to the account that you [831] want. So I might do my [834] own. Then it'll actually go and then [836] it'll find lookalike leads based off of [839] people that follow that account. So, [841] it's not going to get the exact people [842] that follow your account, but what it's [844] going to do is it's going to find [845] patterns in their followings, their [847] their followers, the keywords on their [849] profiles and stuff like that. Then, [850] they're going to give you different [851] people. So, this is useful obviously if [853] you're scraping large volumes of people [855] from from one um account and you don't [857] just want to do it from that one account [858] anymore, or you're getting good results [860] from that account, but you want to get [861] people that are similar and and you [862] don't really have any more followers to [863] scrape, you can just create a lookalike [865] lead list um instead of like actually [867] doing that primary lead list. All right, [869] so that's Twitter/X. Let's now get into [872] Instagram. The way that we are going to [874] do Instagram is we sort of have like a [876] truncated fork in the road. We can [877] choose one of two paths and I'm going to [878] show you guys both paths, but you could [880] use Appify and Make.com. Appify is the [882] tool obviously that I showed you a [883] moment ago. And I'll run you through [884] what that looks like. U Make.com is sort [886] of like a visual automation tool that [888] lets you um drag and drop various steps, [890] which is, you know, very powerful tool [893] that you shouldn't just consider in the [896] context of lead scraping. You can do a [897] lot with it. Um, and then auto IGDM is [899] sort of like like an all-in-one package [901] similar to drippy.ai, but I'll show you [903] what both of these look like. Let's [904] start with appy and make.com. Basically, [906] what you can do on Instagram is you can [907] actually like extract email addresses [909] from profiles pretty easily. And, you [911] know, if you feed in a,000 profiles, you [913] realistically be able to get like 200 [914] 300 email addresses from that, which [916] which are pretty good numbers. And then [917] you can actually like reach out to those [918] people directly over email. So, you [920] could, you know, use Instagram as your [921] scraping source and then you could reach [923] out to people over email. Um, or what [925] you could do is you could use Instagram [926] as a scraping source and then reach out [927] to people over Instagram using direct [929] DMs. Now, this is kind of a nuanced [933] point that I don't think a lot of people [934] understand, but you know, social media [936] platforms, they are controlled by a [938] third party entity. And because they're [939] controlled by a third party entity, they [940] obviously have very harsh rate limits in [942] place. These third party entities don't [943] really like when we game the systems [945] like we're doing right now. So, this is [946] kind of like growth hacky, right? The [948] thing is, email is not really like that. [950] With email, for the most part, assuming [952] that you build up um the infrastructure, [954] you can send out as many emails as you [955] want in a day. So, in the case of [957] Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and all [959] the other platforms I'm going to talk [960] about, you know, like with Twitter, [962] maybe you send 50 cold DMs a day or [963] something like that, right? But if you [965] hypothetically spun up an email campaign [967] that sourced emails using Twitter data, [968] you could theoretically send a thousand [969] emails a day. There's really nothing [971] stopping you. Instagram is really [972] similar. So, in our case, I mean, we're [974] going to be able to send realistically [975] maybe 30 to 50 a day using a tool like [977] Auto IGDM. But if you wanted to augment [979] that, um, what you could do is you could [981] just get the emails like I'm about to [982] show you here, then use that to add to a [985] cold email campaign and then kind of [986] like communicate with them off platform, [987] if that makes sense. Okay. So, how [989] exactly do you do this? Well, as you [990] see, I have a million in one tabs open [992] here on Appify. What I did is I just [994] typed on Instagram and I have a variety [995] of scrapers that I could use. Generally [997] speaking, I like um scrapers that are [999] payer result. Those just are a lot [1000] easier for me and they're a little bit [1002] more cost effective. Pay per result just [1003] means if I get a thousand leads, they'll [1004] charge me for a thousand leads. If I get [1006] 10,000 leads, they'll charge you for [1007] 10,000 leads. The alternative on Ampify [1009] is you could like pay per usage or you [1011] could pay pay per server usage or you [1012] could pay per um uh per hour or or [1015] rental or something like that. I find [1017] it's just not really that scalable for [1018] our purposes. So, I always just go pay [1020] per result. So, the one I'm going to be [1021] looking for is Instagram search. We're [1024] going to be using this one right over [1025] here. And this one costs $2.30 per [1027] thousand results. Obviously, pretty [1029] reasonable and reliable. And uh the way [1031] that this works is you basically just [1032] pump in a query and then it returns a [1034] bunch of profiles for you. So users. So [1037] I'm going to go query um AI automation. [1040] And for the purpose of this demo, I'm [1041] just going to do like I don't know 50, [1043] let's say. Let's just make sure this is [1045] 50 users. Then I'm just going to click [1047] save and start um on Appify. And now [1050] what's happening is on the back end, [1051] this is actually spinning up a server on [1053] Ampify's um hardware and then it's using [1056] that server to like run their little [1058] private scraping thing. The cool thing [1060] about Appify is it has a bunch of [1061] built-in proxies. That just means that [1063] has a bunch of like scraping protections [1064] that minimize the probability that um [1068] that maximizes our ability to get these [1070] things and they just take care of all of [1071] it for us. We don't really have to do [1072] any work ourselves. Okay, great. So, as [1075] you can see, I got a ton of profiles and [1078] the really cool thing is on in addition [1080] to those profiles, I also got a bunch of [1081] websites. How cool is that, huh? Pretty [1083] sweet. All right. And it looks like I [1086] don't know, we scraped all 50. So once [1088] you're done with that scraping, you can [1089] just click export results. And what are [1091] you going to get as a result? A CSV [1092] file. CSV stands for commaepparated [1094] value. So this is just a quick and easy [1096] way for us to get a giant list of things [1098] in a format that is our own. We're not [1100] using a third party tool for this [1102] anymore. When we import a oops, sorry, I [1105] downloaded that by instance. Uh what we [1106] want to do is we actually want to import [1108] that CSV that we just exported. Um and [1110] the value here is this is our own tool. [1112] This is ours, right? This is our Google [1114] sheet. It's our data. We can do anything [1116] we want with this stuff. It's just [1117] voila. It's just all here. So, I'm [1120] clicking import. Once the data is [1122] inside, you can see that it's I don't [1124] really like the format. The um the sizes [1126] of these cells are really big. But if I [1127] drag this and make this a little bit [1129] smaller, what we'll see is we actually [1131] have access to the biography, the [1133] business address, the business address, [1136] city name. We have all of these fields [1138] basically with data in them, which is [1139] awesome. And the value in having all [1142] these fields with data is obviously we [1144] can then use this to get um email [1146] addresses from these accounts. Okay. So [1150] we're not going to be able to get all of [1151] the email addresses from these um of the [1153] 50. I don't know. My inclination is [1155] we're probably like 15 or 20 emails. [1157] Usually it's about like a 30% enrichment [1159] rate. But um yeah, we we have now [1160] officially gotten a bunch of uh a bunch [1162] of profile data and we've we've put it [1165] in our own service. So what do we do [1167] from here? Um pretty simple and [1168] straightforward. you need to use what's [1169] called an email uh verific or sorry an [1172] email finding tool. They have a bunch of [1174] email finding tools available to you. Um [1176] I personally really like one called any [1178] mail finder. Now obviously all these [1180] cost money so there are variety of [1181] services out there that you can cross [1183] compare the costs with. I find any [1185] mailinder is a great mix of both cost [1186] and then reliability and I'm usually [1188] able to get like a fair number of the [1189] emails that I I I look for. Um but yeah, [1191] so now that we have all of these um all [1193] I need to do is just head over to my [1195] anymailfinder.com account. I'll go to my [1197] app. And the way that an email finder [1199] works basically is, and I always [1201] recommend using the UI before you try [1202] and like upload a bulk file is you can [1205] search for um a company, you could [1207] search for a person at a company, you [1209] could search for decision makers at a [1210] company, you could also do LinkedIn URL [1212] search. I'm actually just going to do a [1214] company search. The way that it works is [1215] you basically feed in the domain name [1217] that you're looking for, and then it'll [1218] go and it'll see if there are any [1219] accessible email addresses just by doing [1221] a bunch of math on the back end. like [1222] it's basically scraping this website uh [1225] for any email things formatted as an [1226] email. It's scraping all mentions of [1228] this website on the internet. It's doing [1229] a bunch of like what's called nominative [1231] email verification where they combine [1232] your name and stuff like that. And uh [1234] yeah, you know, if I type in my own [1235] website, left click.ai, you can see it [1236] literally found my email address right [1238] there, right? Pretty neat. So, what do [1239] you think is going to happen when we [1240] feed in a bunch of these Instagram [1242] profiles? Well, we're going to be able [1243] to find a bunch of their emails. So, I'm [1245] going to head over to bulk search and [1246] then click new bulk. Then, I'm going to [1248] go to company. And then what I'm going [1250] to do is I'm going to upload the CSV [1252] file that I just downloaded. So data set [1254] Instagram search scraper. That's it [1256] right over here. It's now processing the [1259] file. Um it looks like in our case we [1262] are exceeding the maximum allowed [1263] length. So what we need to do is we just [1265] need to grab some of these and then [1266] shorten the hell out of them. That's uh [1268] fair. We do have some of these that are [1269] just like unnecessarily and unreasonably [1271] long. So really, if I'm honest, the only [1273] column that we actually need here cuz we [1276] have a lot of data here, right? The only [1277] column that we actually need in this [1279] entire thing is just the um domain name [1282] one. So, I'm actually just going to go [1283] in. I'll grab the URL. I'm going to go [1287] all the way back [1289] here. Just click on [1291] this. All the way back [1294] [Music] [1296] here, very beginning where it says [1300] external URL here. I'm just going to [1303] delete literally everything else cuz [1304] yeah, there's like 2,000 columns in [1306] there. That's a pretty big ass file, [1308] right? Then I'm just going to remove a [1310] bunch of the other information that I [1311] personally don't really think is super [1312] relevant. And then voila. Now we have [1314] external URL here. We have URL, we have [1316] the username, and then we have a quick [1318] little biography. Um, I think the [1320] biography might be a little bit long. [1321] I'm just going to remove that, too. [1322] Obviously, play around with this. And [1324] various different types of Appify [1326] scrapers that you guys use are going to [1327] have different uh they're going to have [1329] different means of delivering this data [1332] to you. The one that I used was just [1333] like crazy long. So anyway, um now I'm [1336] just going to export this updated Apify [1339] search. Then I'm going to go back to my [1341] bulk scraper and I'm going to upload it [1347] again. Okay, we are currently doing some [1349] scraping [1351] here. Looks like we found 14 fully [1354] verified emails. Seven of them were [1355] partially verified. So actually that's [1357] like 20. Wow, 27. Not bad. We also have [1360] some that we just didn't find, right? [1361] Which is understandable, but um still [1363] pretty good. Second that it's done, I [1365] can then preview this. If I preview [1366] this, it'll actually show me the email [1367] addresses. Um, keep in mind that some of [1369] these are I'm want fully verified and [1371] partially verified as a CSV. I'm going [1374] to continue this download. That's okay. [1376] Uh, and then I'm just going to go back [1377] here and I'm just going to make a new [1379] Google sheet and then just visualize all [1380] these email addresses. So, I'm going to [1382] go [1382] import. I'll go upload. And we're just [1385] going to paste these puppies [1388] in. Okay. Okay. And now, as we can see, [1391] we actually have a ton of email [1393] addresses. Wow, very nice. Very nice. [1395] Super cool. Now, as you see, some of [1397] these um some of these links aren't [1398] actually links to like the person's own [1400] website, right? Like school.com is not [1402] that person's website. School.com is [1404] like a aggregator that they just happen [1406] to have a thing hosted on. Same thing [1408] with I don't know like Linkree and [1409] Cal.com. So, these these these emails [1411] obviously like they don't really matter [1412] to us, right? But they're still emails, [1414] which is pretty cool. And now all of a [1416] sudden, you have a big list of emails. [1417] You could pump this into some sort of [1418] email campaign, like an instantly [1420] campaign or something, and then get out [1422] there and start sending. But that's only [1424] one half of it. Let's hypothetically say [1427] you actually wanted to send DMs to these [1429] people instead. How would you go about [1430] doing that? Well, there's a dedicated [1432] tool that essentially does a lot of the [1433] heavy lifting for you in the back end. [1435] The only issue is it's, you know, it [1436] costs a little bit more than doing it [1438] peace meal like we did back here. And [1440] then, you know, it actually allows you [1440] to send it via Instagram as well. So, [1442] it's called AutoIGDM. Um, AutoIGDM has [1445] pricing plans that are monthly, [1447] quarterly, and then yearly. So, I'm just [1448] going to sign up to the monthly pricing [1450] plan and then just give this a go. Um, [1451] but let me let me walk you through the [1453] entire process. First thing is click [1454] start now and then enter your email [1456] address and then I'll do nick at [1458] leftclick.ai. Very cool. Create my [1460] account. Then you have to obviously pay [1462] for the service. So, I'm going to go [1463] through and I'm going to pay for my [1464] service. This allows you to send 1500 [1466] DMs a month per account. It's 100% [1468] cloud-based and it's also fully [1469] automated. So, there's no work kind of [1471] that you have to do on the back end. You [1472] just kind of add all the stuff you want [1474] once and then it just does for you. So I [1476] have to verify my email address as per [1478] usual. Let us go back here and then I'm [1480] just going to type [1482] autoigm verify. Create my account. I'm [1485] just going to um copy this link actually [1486] because I don't want to do it in this [1488] browser. Go back here and then paste it [1490] in. And now I go through the signup [1492] process of my account. So I'm just going [1494] to go this and then I don't know. Um [1497] let's not do that. Choose my own please. [1503] Let's do [1504] that. Then going to sign in. Save. Uh, [1508] now I just connect my Instagram account. [1510] So I'm just going to go Nick. Then it'll [1512] go through and attempt to connect to my [1514] Instagram [1516] account. So I need to log back in. And [1519] then I also need to add my own password. [1521] Um, if you add the wrong password, [1523] it'll, you know, kind of screw around. [1524] So just give me a second to go through [1526] and actually add my password to my own [1528] Instagram account. [1533] Okay. And then after that, you need to [1534] do what's called a secret key setup. So, [1537] they actually have a tutorial video that [1538] shows you um all of [1540] this. Basically, you need to go to [1542] account [1543] center.instagram.com. It'll take a list [1545] of all of the profiles that you have [1546] available to you. You go down to [1548] password and security. Then you go [1550] two-factor authentication. You go to the [1553] account of interest. It'll open up this [1555] two-factor authentication screen or [1557] page. When you click on that button, [1559] it'll then generate a key for you. You [1561] copy this key. And then what you do is [1563] you go back to AutoIGDM. Then you paste [1566] the key in here. Okay. Once you're done, [1569] you click add [1571] account. Then you have now connected [1574] your account and everything is perfect. [1576] So the system will eventually log into [1578] your account for you. Um you may get a [1580] notification saying we suspect automated [1582] behavior in your account. That's [1583] completely understandable. And then what [1584] you do now is connect your account to a [1586] campaign. So the way that you do this is [1588] click connect to campaign. Click add new [1590] up here. Now you have your campaign. So [1592] we need to link the account that we just [1594] added. So just click that button. Then [1596] we go in and now we can actually go um [1598] they're going to obviously give you a [1599] bunch of information about this, but [1600] that's okay. Um you then go in and then [1603] you uh reference specific hashtags or [1606] you reference accounts. Okay? So for [1608] instance, you could look for Instagram [1610] accounts that are engaged with a [1611] specific Instagram account. So in my [1612] case, I have another channel called Nick [1614] Sarafh here. I know that that's pretty [1616] good. Then I have Nick.Surf. And then I [1618] don't know. Let's just go Instagram AI [1620] automation. Let's just see what's the [1621] first thing that pops [1623] up. Um, this person's account, new link [1627] app. That looks pretty [1629] cool. Just going to paste that in. And [1632] now I have these three accounts that I [1634] am targeting, which is pretty cool. So [1636] from targeting, you can then go to [1637] filtering. You can add negative keywords [1639] and positive keywords. Now I'm going to [1640] be doing basic filtering. I'll be [1642] looking for people with profile picks, [1643] bios. Um, I don't know if I'm going to [1645] look for website links. I will exclude [1647] sexual content. Do definitely do not [1648] want to be DMing those. I get enough of [1650] those as is. Do not DM the user if you [1652] already had a conversation. I'll do [1653] that, too. Then you can also set a [1655] minimum number of followers. I'm just [1656] going to do 100. Okay. All right. From [1659] there, I then um have a couple of other [1661] options. Obviously, you need to create a [1662] message. So, what I'll say is there. And [1666] then um here is where you would add your [1668] specific message text. So, hey, first [1672] name. just thought I'd reach [1675] out. [1677] Love your posts on AI automation and um [1681] in the same field. So that's obviously a [1684] pretty trash outreach message. Ideally, [1686] you would want some sort of some sort of [1688] reason why um that's a little bit more [1690] justified than, oh, I think you're [1691] really cool, but I just want to make [1692] sure you guys can see how this works [1694] without spending God knows how long [1696] crafting the perfect message. Um I'm [1698] then going to send follow-up after 2 [1699] days. And then I'll just say, "Hey, [1701] first [1701] [Music] [1702] name. Checking in on this. No hard [1705] feelings if you don't want to add me." [1708] And then because I'm cheeky, I'm going [1709] to add a funny little face. Okay, great. [1712] After that, you define the schedule. So [1714] maybe I want 9 until 5 Mountain time. [1716] Okay, pretty nice and simple and easy. [1719] Then I submit my campaign. Once I've [1721] submitted my campaign, it is now um [1723] basically in their system. And once it's [1726] in their system, we are queued up to [1727] start doing our outreach automatically, [1729] which is pretty sweet. Okay, great. And [1730] now it's going to ask us if we want to [1732] submit the campaign. You just click yes. [1733] And then voila, it has now been um [1736] submitted successfully, which is [1737] fantastic. I'm also just going to save a [1739] draft of this campaign just in case. [1742] Yes, I'm going to leave that page. Cool. [1743] So, we have our account connected. We [1745] also have the campaign that is going. [1747] Um, when you submit, it will not begin [1749] immediately. I believe either their team [1751] reviews it or they have some process in [1752] the back end to take care of it for you. [1754] Um, but more importantly, there is a [1755] statistic page where it'll actually show [1757] you all the leads that you've been [1758] messaging. It'll show you results on [1760] those leads. Um, I think you get like a [1762] nice little visualization as well. And [1764] yeah, that's a quick walkthrough of how [1765] to accomplish that second big step, [1767] which is a direct DM path where they [1769] basically take care of all of it for [1770] you. All right, now let's get to the [1772] motherload, which is LinkedIn. Now, [1774] there are variety of different ways that [1775] you could do LinkedIn outreach. I've [1777] talked a lot about them across my [1779] channel. have obviously created LinkedIn [1780] automation systems in NAN and make.com [1782] and stuff like that. I'll have that be [1784] one of the options. Then I'll show you [1785] some other options that you guys could [1787] use as well. So on the far left hand [1788] side here we have LinkedIn automation [1790] using hey reach or expand. So just like [1792] drippy and just like um auto IGDM this [1794] is like a third party tool that you sign [1795] up to. You pay some premium fee then [1797] they basically just deal with it all on [1799] the back end for you. In the middle here [1800] there's this LinkedIn AI outreach system [1802] which I developed um that uses a noode [1803] platform called NAD and then another [1805] platform called Phantom Buster. kind of [1807] just connects the two together like [1808] glue. Um, and then you know the end [1810] result is you could send customized DMs. [1812] And then the last one is just going [1813] directly using sales navigator and [1815] email. Um, I think instead of sales [1817] navigator I'm probably just going to do [1819] h maybe I will do sales navigator. I [1821] don't know. I might just use appy for [1823] that. I'm not entirely sure. We'll kind [1824] of play it by ear. But um, in reality [1825] like you can mix and match a lot of the [1827] tools that we're talking about and it's [1829] really just a matter of finding the the [1830] most cost effective one. Okay. So let's [1832] start with this tool. Hey Reach or [1834] Expandy. You can use either one. I'm [1835] just going to use expand here. Um, and [1837] the reason why I'm going to do it is I [1838] think the pricing is a little bit [1839] cheaper than the alternative. It's like [1840] 99 bucks a month or something. Um, you [1842] end up with uh a lot here. You know, you [1844] could set up templates. You could do [1846] campaign prioritization. Tons of [1848] different campaign types. Um, country [1850] based IP addresses to minimize the [1851] probability of you getting like blocked [1853] and stuff and so on and so forth. So, [1855] what I'm going to do is I'm just going [1855] to click generate leads and then I'm [1858] going to go through their little signup [1859] process and then I'm going to show you [1860] how to do this. [1868] Under account type, I will use Expandi [1870] for my company or personal goals and [1872] click sign up. They're now going to send [1875] me an email which I can obviously then [1876] verify just by checking out the Expandi [1880] verification. I'm going to copy the link [1882] address, just open it in this tab. The [1883] reason why I I always do this is it just [1885] I don't know. I don't want to like be [1886] constantly all tabbing between different [1888] tabs. Just want to have it all here. [1892] After that, it will run me through some [1893] onboarding. So, I'm just doing sales. [1895] I'm heard about Expandy, but I've never [1897] used it. Let's go. This is Nick's [1901] workspace. You can see they're [1903] onboarding the hell out of me. I like [1904] it. Now, I'm going to connect my [1906] LinkedIn account. I'm going to use a [1908] Chrome extension for this. So, I'm going [1909] to click this button. I'm going to [1910] download this Chrome extension. And [1911] basically, instead of you having to [1912] enter your username or password, which [1914] is fine and all, um it it's going to use [1916] a Chrome extension which will [1918] automatically connect to your LinkedIn [1919] for you. So, it'll take you to the [1920] LinkedIn page. You'll then go here, [1922] continue to Expandy. Then, it will [1925] redirect you back to the app um page [1927] that you were on before, except this [1928] time it'll also have your cookies, which [1930] will allow it to access everything that [1931] it needs to access to automate the hell [1933] out of your processes. Cool. Um I'm now [1936] going to choose the country that I want [1938] to run this in. Now, I am Canadian, and [1940] so my usage up until now has been from [1942] Canada. So, I'm going to want to [1943] minimize the discrepancy between the [1944] usage and then obviously where I'm [1946] going. Uh, I'm now going to connect my [1948] card [1950] details. Okay, it's now creating a [1952] workspace subscription for me. After [1954] that, it's going to synchronize my [1956] account. Basically, run through that [1958] Chrome extension again, do some [1960] connecting behind the scenes. Then, it's [1961] going to ask you to invite your [1962] teammates. So, I'm just going to do that [1963] later. And then, voila. You know, we we [1965] have some some goals that we can put in [1967] here. Um, get your your ideal customer [1969] profile. That's what ICP stands for. So [1971] maybe um I don't know I help exa [1974] uh let's say sales chief sales [1978] officers with [1980] driving leads affordably. My goal with [1983] this campaign is to book more sales [1984] meetings. Nice. So I'm going to take [1986] that and then AI use it to like do [1988] something cool. Um and then we can do a [1990] basic search. We can do a sales [1992] navigator search or we can do a [1993] recruiter search. So it recommends that [1994] I do the basic search. So, um, what I [1996] can do is I can find prospects in [1998] LinkedIn, then copy the link, then paste [2001] it directly in here. So, I could just [2003] actually just type this in, and it'll [2004] actually go through and like like it [2006] just used AI to generate the search. Um, [2008] so you can obviously rank this down and [2010] get super super into the nitty-gritty [2012] here. You could add a bunch of filters [2013] based off location and where the person [2014] lives and stuff, but this is the link [2016] that you are going to be providing [2017] expand that it is going to be doing the [2019] scraping from. So, we're searching for [2021] chief sales officers using this link. [2022] Okay. After that, we can just enter the [2025] name. We can also auto reload this. Um, [2028] and it looks like you can't actually [2029] autoreload it right now. You need to do [2031] it the second time for some reason. [2032] Maybe it's just a little bug of the way [2034] that they do things. And then here is [2036] more or less how that works. Um, how the [2038] entire platform works. You reach out to [2040] second and third degree connections with [2042] personalized connection requests and [2043] follow-ups. But you can also select a [2044] variety of other types. You could do [2046] sequence campaigns, groups, event [2047] invites, mobile connectors. You could [2049] actually try and do event participants. [2052] So you could do messengers, company [2053] follow invites. You have a bunch of [2054] options essentially, which is pretty [2055] cool. Um, for now it's just going to use [2058] AI to like, you know, whip up the copy [2059] of your campaign, whip up everything you [2061] need. So this is the quote unquote [2063] personalized message. Do I think these [2064] personalized messages are great? No. If [2066] you guys want more insight on that, just [2067] check out some of my copyrightiting [2068] videos. I think you can realistically do [2070] a lot better than this. Generally, you [2071] just want to make it seem as [2072] personalized as humanly possible. Um, [2075] you can allow it to send with or without [2076] the connector message. Um, I'm just [2079] going to leave it at as this for now. [2081] And I'm going to leave the follow-up [2082] messages as default. Follow-up messages [2084] as default and all the spacing and stuff [2086] like that is default as well. It is nice [2088] to allow you to get um kind of like I [2091] want to say 80% of the 80% of the [2093] results just out of the box with AI. Um [2095] but I do find that that last 20% is [2097] super valuable. So I would highly [2098] recommend if you're going to launch any [2100] sort of campaign here, definitely make [2102] sure to do that yourself. Make sure you [2104] know what the offer is that you're [2105] selling. Make sure you know how to pitch [2107] yourself. Make sure to put yourself in [2109] the prospect's shoes. you know, if [2111] somebody were reach out to me, you know, [2112] how could they make that outreach look [2114] as personalized as possible? Um because, [2116] you know, if it's not, likelihood of [2117] somebody getting back to you um is a lot [2119] lower. Okay. And once that's done, the [2121] leads are now ready for action. You can [2123] let the networking begin, they [2126] say. And then from there, we are good to [2129] go. So, you can create your workspace [2130] based off your activity. You know, add [2132] your working days and so on and so [2133] forth. I'm just going to skip that. And [2135] then you're good to go. This will start [2136] scraping leads on the back end for you. [2138] Once it's ready, all you need to do is [2139] just confirm by giving this a click and [2141] then going to the top right hand corner [2143] and pressing activate. You won't be able [2144] to do that until the leads are done [2146] scraping, but that happens relatively [2147] quickly, I would say. All right. Aside [2149] from that, there are a couple of [2150] additional ways that you could scrape [2151] LinkedIn. I'm going to be covering the [2152] LinkedIn AI outreach system by the yours [2155] truly, Nick Saraf. Um, I use a variety [2158] of tools to that end. The big tool that [2161] I use is called NADN, which is a no code [2165] drag and drop, no or low code drag and [2166] drop builder that allows you to like [2168] automate a lot of processes in the back [2169] end. And so I've actually created a flow [2171] here which you guys can check my video [2173] for. Just check the um the link up here [2175] or just look to I think it was my my [2177] third last video that just says Naden [2179] LinkedIn system or something like that [2180] that covers how to do this. But [2181] essentially what we do is very similar [2182] to what Expand is doing. I'm just going [2184] to go um on form submission. Give this a [2187] quick test. It'll now ask me to describe [2189] my audience. So, I'll just say founders, [2191] partners, or um co-founders at creative [2195] agencies between 1 to 100 people in the [2197] United States. If I submit this, um I [2200] can then just run through this test. The [2202] reason why I'm showing you guys how to [2203] do this in a no code tool is just [2204] because I think it's important that you [2206] guys reduce your reliance on third party [2207] tools cuz these third party tools do [2209] like take a fair cut off the top, right? [2211] Like it costs a fair amount of money to [2212] use them. As you saw, I've already spent [2213] like 300 bucks. We we're barely uh you [2216] know, it's barely noon today. Um, when [2218] you know how to use no code tools like [2219] this, you can usually do a big arbitrage [2221] on the value of these tools and then you [2222] can get up and running for cents on the [2224] dollar really. Anyway, um, I generated a [2226] search URL in Apollo and basically I [2228] just got the same sort of thing that you [2230] would have gotten in LinkedIn. So, a big [2231] list of people. From there, uh, what you [2233] do is you basically run what's called an [2234] appy [2236] actor. So, if you aren't familiar, an [2239] actor is the term for a scraper used in [2244] the tool that I was showing you guys a [2245] moment ago, Apify. And this no code tool [2248] nan actually allows me to spin up and [2250] scrape a list of leads using that [2252] completely automatically. So I don't [2254] actually have to go through and you know [2256] like manually do it or anything. I [2258] actually just do it all automatically. [2259] And what it's doing is it's now scraping [2260] a bunch of leads for me. So it's [2261] actually getting a bunch of email [2262] addresses of these people which I can [2264] use to do any sort of outreach that I [2265] want. Okay. And then once all that's [2266] done the scraper output it's find over [2269] here like we were doing before. Or the [2271] way that this works is we actually have [2272] access to all of that data now just in [2274] NAND which is pretty cool. Um, and then [2276] we can actually go and we can do like [2277] some personalized outreach. So, my [2279] personalized outreach is a little bit [2280] better, I think, than most of the [2281] personalized outreach out there. I [2283] basically take a sentence from their [2286] profile data and then I use it to [2287] customize a little bit of outreach. Um, [2290] so love seeing your creativity, love [2292] seeing your knack for fresh ideas. You [2293] know, I'm looking for X, Y, and Z. Would [2295] love to connect. From there, I add it to [2296] a Google sheet, which is uh not super [2300] complicated. Essentially, I'm just [2301] adding a new row to a sheet, which I [2303] think we've probably all done here. And [2305] then um finally, at the very end, I [2307] trigger what's called a Phantom Buster [2309] agent. And this is the cool part. Um [2311] this is where we use another third party [2312] tool called Phantom Buster. But I find [2314] it's just a little bit um more cost [2315] effective than the other ones. If I go [2317] to the Phantom that is running, [2318] basically what I have is an auto [2320] icebreaker connect. This is one of the [2322] many tools that Phantom Buster allows [2323] you to use, but essentially what this [2325] one does is this one actually just sends [2326] a connection request along with like a [2328] customized message for you. So, I go [2329] down to results. I've actually already [2331] sent a bunch of connection requests to [2333] people and um the messages are like this [2335] one. Hey, Frank, loved seeing your [2336] creative director role. I'm also [2338] crafting stories. Thought I'd connect. [2339] And then, um I actually automatically [2341] send a connection request alongside the [2343] DM. So, if you think about it, under the [2344] hood, exact same thing Expand is doing, [2346] but I can do it all for substantially [2348] less money than that ongoing membership. [2350] Okay. And then the last way to scrape [2352] things from LinkedIn is you scrape the [2354] data from LinkedIn and then you just do [2355] outreach over email instead. And this is [2357] actually the primary way that most um AI [2359] automation agencies, uh recruitment [2361] companies, and other services do things. [2364] So instead of actually going to LinkedIn [2365] directly, what we're doing is we're [2366] using a third party service, Apollo, [2367] which I showed you guys a moment ago. [2369] The thing is Apollo just scrapes other [2370] leads from LinkedIn. Anyway, so we're [2372] scraping a service that scrapes a [2373] service that scrapes a service that [2375] scrapes a service. So the the value [2376] there is um you know, it's just a lot [2378] cheaper than if you were to go to [2380] LinkedIn Sales Navigator directly. And [2381] uh what we do is um we run the exact [2383] same flow that I showed you a moment [2384] ago. So, we export these 500 results. [2387] And now we have a bunch of email [2388] addresses, right? So, with these email [2390] addresses, we then just pump them into a [2392] cold email tool like instantly.ai or uh [2395] maybe Smartle as well. Smartle and [2398] Instantly.ai are probably right now like [2399] the the two big competitors here. Um, [2402] and what you can do is you just you just [2403] paste the email in, then you write your [2405] own sequence just like we did earlier, [2406] and then it automatically sends them out [2408] um based off of some mailbox uh [2411] settings. So, if you guys want a guide [2412] on how to do that, I've I've made many [2414] videos on my channel about how to get up [2416] and running with cold email very [2417] quickly. Um, but this is another way [2419] that we could do a data source. All [2421] right, let's cover the lovely Facebook. [2423] Facebook has a couple of different [2425] routes that you could take. You could do [2428] um Facebook group scraping using a show, [2430] or you could use a third party tool [2432] called Reach Owl to do the connecting [2433] for you. So, just to keep things simple, [2435] I'm just going to start with Reach Owl [2436] and then we'll talk all other stuff [2438] later. Um, in order to do this, just [2440] type in Reach Owl. This is the platform [2443] that we want to use. Go to their pricing [2445] here. You'll see that their basic plan [2446] starts at $29 a month with one social [2448] media account. So, I obviously want to [2450] connect Facebook. Uh, what I'm going to [2452] do is I'm going to click register up [2454] here. Then, I'm just going to go through [2455] their sign up [2463] process. Once that is done, they have a [2465] little onboarding sequence they're going [2467] to take you through. [2469] Then you can continue to [2471] dashboard. And now you just connect your [2473] social media account. As you see, they [2474] also do Instagram, but I think their [2476] main value is Facebook. I think autoigm [2478] does better. And I'm going to log in [2480] with cookies. Now, what you need in [2482] order to make this work is you need a [2483] Chrome extension called Cookie Editor. [2486] Cookie Editor just allows you to extract [2487] cookies on various websites. So, I'm [2489] going to be doing that for my Facebook [2490] account right now. Going to grab cookie [2493] editor, add it to my Chrome menu. I'm [2494] then going to pin it. Then I'm just [2496] going to go like Facebook. Actually, I [2498] think I already have a Facebook tab open [2499] here. Right there I do. And then what I [2501] want to do is um I just want to go into [2503] cookie editor. Um I need to request [2505] permission for all [2507] sites. Then down over here, you see I [2509] have a variety of cookies. I believe [2511] what I need to do is just export this as [2513] JSON. And then I go back to reach and [2516] then I paste my cookies. And let me just [2518] double and quadruple check that that's [2523] good. Okay, looks good. And then what I [2526] do is I just set an account title, Nyx [2528] Facebook. Then click next. Okay. Um, [2531] then you have to find what's called your [2532] proxy [2535] URL. And then after you're done with [2537] that, you just need to connect your [2538] proxy. So I just scrolled down from [2540] select from shared proxies and used [2544] 181214117123. It's much easier way to do [2546] things than actually having to go [2547] through the rigomear roll of like [2548] setting up your own proxy account, but I [2549] want you to know that you can set up [2550] your own proxy account if you want to. [2551] Okay. From there, it'll ask you if you [2552] want to start warming up the account. [2554] So, I say yes. Um, then you can set your [2556] minimum intervals. These are all [2557] recommended intervals. And then you can [2559] also just turn off the campaign if a [2561] bunch of your uh friend requests or [2562] messages fail in a row. So, I I [2564] recommend turning that on as well. This [2566] is these are obviously all just safety [2567] procedures. Once you're done with that, [2569] you can actually set up a campaign. So, [2572] we go over here, create your first [2574] campaign. And here you have a variety of [2576] different things that you could do. [2577] Okay? So, for instance, you could um I [2581] don't know, you you could extract [2582] Facebook profiles from a custom list of [2584] URLs. So, I'll show you guys all about [2585] that later, but then you could find [2586] Facebook friends of somebody that you're [2588] already friends with. You could do [2589] Facebook video comments. So, you could [2591] actually pull a video on Facebook and [2594] then extract all of the people that have [2597] commented on that post. You could also [2599] do ad reactions. So, if somebody has [2601] posted or given a thumbs up to an ad or [2603] something, you can actually have that um [2605] you can actually scrape the list of [2607] people there and then send them a [2608] message or whatever. Then you can do [2609] group members, you can do um Facebook [2611] post ad comments as well. So, I'm just [2613] going to do post ad reactions. I need to [2615] go find basically a Facebook ad URL. So, [2618] I'm just going to go over here and [2619] hopefully nobody that I'm connected with [2620] has done anything super [2622] embarrassing. Okay, so this one from [2624] Grant Cardone looks pretty good. I think [2626] in order to do this, I don't I don't [2627] actually remember exactly how. I think I [2628] click [2631] embed. Okay, now we have access to that [2634] specific ad which if I click on I'll now [2636] go directly to the post and then what I [2639] do is I go back to hey [2641] reach paste it in here. You'll see that [2643] there's a the a bunch of extra fields [2645] here like question mark refbed. Um [2647] that's okay. What you want is you just [2648] want it [2649] facebook.com/post/post ID. Okay. So just [2652] delete this number. Have the post ID [2655] there. Click next. Okay. Okay. And then [2657] from here you can set up a message [2658] sequence. So do you want to set a friend [2660] or a follow request? You could be like [2661] these two lovely gentlemen. Or you could [2663] send a message sequence. I'm just going [2664] to call this [2666] example reach owl campaign. I'll run [2669] this from my Facebook. Um daily limit is [2672] 30. I'll filter by audience or location. [2674] I guess I'll go like [2676] USA. [2677] Um and I'll also do United States. Um [2680] the reason why is cuz I think this is [2681] just like a string. So some people are [2683] going to write USA on their profile, [2684] other people are going to do USA. I'll [2686] do both genders. Send message to new [2689] prospects only. Uh I'll say don't send [2691] messages to people that already have [2692] conversations with me. Then I'll do my [2694] my pitch. I loved this. Hey, I figured [2699] you were interested in um Grant [2702] Cardone given that I saw your like on [2706] one of his ads. I run a YouTube channel [2710] at around 60k subs. I wanted to see if [2714] you might be interested in XYZ. Maybe [2718] I'll delay one minute and click save. [2722] And then I can start my campaign. If if [2724] you just click start your campaign, [2725] it'll start. So voila, done. We are now [2728] um essentially reaching out to people as [2729] we speak. Uh well, first we're we need [2731] to warm up our account and sometimes [2732] that takes a while. Um but I'm just [2734] going to leave it at that. My campaign's [2735] all good to go. Obviously, there are [2736] additional settings that I could screw [2738] around with. Since I don't actually want [2739] to run that or send that exact message, [2741] I'm just going to turn mine off. Okay. [2742] Okay. And then the other way is we're [2743] going to use Appify to scrape a bunch of [2745] Facebook group members. Um, and then [2747] based off of that, what we can do is we [2748] can look through their profiles to see [2749] if they have like a website or something [2751] and then if they do, we can add them to [2752] an email sequence, same as what we've [2754] seen before. So, the way that we do this [2756] is we go back to Appify and I just type [2759] Facebook. Facebook obviously can scrape [2761] posts, comments, groups, pages, ads, ad [2764] library. The one I want is group [2765] scraper. Um, I think this one is $45 a [2768] month for rentals. Let me just see if [2769] there's one that might be paper result [2771] instead. [2772] Not seeing one specifically for groups, [2774] unfortunately. H Yeah, you might just [2777] have to do the $45 rental one if you [2780] wanted to do groups themselves. [2782] Regardless, I think they might offer you [2784] a trial. Yeah, they do offer you a free [2786] 7-day trial. So, I'm just going to sign [2787] up to this and we'll give it a try and [2789] then I'll just make sure to turn it off [2790] after I'm [2792] done. Okay. So, from here, I can [2794] actually enter in my group scraper. Just [2796] going to go to this group URL and see if [2798] um this is a maths formulas one, which [2801] is public. I think it needs to be [2802] public. So, we're just going to paste [2804] that in. Number of posts I want. I don't [2806] know. Let's say 10. Uh 20. Sorting [2808] order. New post. Search by letter. [2809] Search by keyword by year as well. And [2811] then you can do a time frame. I'm just [2813] going to click start. We're going to [2814] rent the actor for the $45 a month. And [2817] then I'll just make sure to turn that [2818] off [2819] after. Okay. So, after this is done, you [2822] can see we got a big list of all the [2823] posts that were made. Now, in this [2825] specific group, which I don't think is a [2826] good example, most of the posts are just [2828] made by the same person. But ideally, [2829] you'd have a group that's active and [2831] dynamic and you have a lot of other [2832] people that are commenting and stuff. [2833] Anyway, um what you'll end up with is [2835] you end up with this column called user [2836] with two fields and in it you'll have an [2838] ID. Okay, so this is actually the ID of [2841] the Facebook profile that left the the [2843] comment. So if I go facebook.com and I [2846] think what I do, just scroll back here. [2850] I think I basically go user and then ID. [2853] So, I'm actually just going to feed in [2854] the ID and then you'll see it'll just go [2856] directly over to the specific person [2858] that left that post. Okay. And this [2859] person, Ellie Surya, that you know, runs [2861] a bunch of profiles and stuff. Um, the [2863] cool thing is when you have these, you [2865] can then go to about and sometimes under [2867] their contact or basic info, they'll [2868] have websites and social links. And the [2871] second you have a website and or social [2872] link, you can just do the same thing [2873] that we did earlier with LinkedIn, [2874] right? That's pretty simple and pretty [2876] easy. Um, in order to get all of that [2878] information, all you need to do is you [2879] need to take this data that you've [2880] gotten. So, we'd export this, okay, as a [2882] CSV, and then feed it into another [2885] scraper on Appify, in this case, called [2887] Facebook profile and page scraper. And [2889] what you do is you just feed in a bunch [2891] of profile URLs. So, it' be um [2895] facebook.com/ whatever that number is. [2898] And then you could actually feed that [2899] in. And then that would go and it would [2900] extract you all of the the website data, [2903] the contact info, everything essentially [2905] that you need. Um, and the benefit there [2906] too is you can actually get very [2908] creative with this. you could scrape a [2909] bunch of their posts after to look for [2910] websites that are mentioned as well. So, [2912] I mean, obviously the rabbit hole here [2915] in scraping is really deep. Uh, my rule [2917] of thumb when I'm doing scraping is the [2919] more work that I have to do to get the [2920] information, usually the better the list [2922] is, but I kind of need to weigh that [2924] against the cost that it takes for me to [2926] do so, right? Like you can get a super [2928] nuanced, extraordinarily deep list that [2930] nobody's ever contacted before, but if [2932] it cost you like $10 a lead to do so, [2934] you need to make sure that the ROI works [2936] in your favor for whatever you're [2937] selling. Okay, let's talk a little bit [2939] about how to scrape YouTube. The [2940] simplest and easiest way is using the [2942] Appify YouTube to email scraper. I do [2944] this all the time myself and it's about [2946] as simple as we just go to back to our [2949] actors, back to our store. Um, just go [2951] YouTube and then type in the word email [2953] and you'll see that there'll be an email [2954] extractor channel email scraper mass [2958] YouTube email scraper. I mean there [2960] there a bunch that people have set up. [2961] Basically, the way that this works is a [2962] lot of the time on people's YouTube [2964] accounts, myself included. You'll [2965] actually find an email address listed [2967] somewhere. I don't know where. I mean, [2968] it depends. Sometimes people put them [2970] directly in the bios. Sometimes people [2971] put them in like a little contact. [2973] Sometimes people say for business um for [2975] business purposes, you know, feel free [2977] to email this if you have an inquiry. [2978] But basically, we'll just scrape all [2980] those automatically using one of these [2981] and then just um add them to a big sheet [2983] for you. So, yeah, I see a bunch here. [2985] Uh let me just see if there's a paper [2987] result one. Um let me see. This one [2990] looks pretty good. advanced and cheap by [2991] Stormcraper. So, I'm just going to give [2992] this a try. And then what you can do is [2994] you can actually add a keyword for the [2997] people that you want. You're not even [2999] adding in a specific um account or [3001] something like that. What you're doing [3002] is you're actually just scraping emails [3003] for marketing. That's probably one of [3004] the easiest ones. So, why don't I type [3005] like AI automation? I'm cool with any of [3008] these email [3010] domains. So, these ones are all fine for [3012] me. Then you click save and start. it'll [3015] actually go and it'll find um email [3017] addresses on YouTube profiles that rank [3020] for the term AI automation. So, that's [3023] pretty cool. Feel free to use that if [3024] you guys want to um experiment with sort [3026] of like an all-in-one solution. There's [3027] also uh if I go back to all actors and [3029] then store over [3032] here. I think if you type channel email, [3036] it'll actually um allow you to put in a [3038] list of URLs. So, um I don't know, maybe [3040] I put in my my my URL [3043] here, Nick Sariah for something. Um and [3046] then it'll go and it'll scrape [3047] specifically emails at that URL. Okay, [3050] so we just pumped in a bunch of AI [3052] automation channels in and you can see [3053] we've actually gone through and we've [3054] extracted emails for them um simply [3057] using the scraper. Um but yeah, aside [3059] from that, there are a couple of other [3061] ways that you can go a little bit more [3062] nuanced, a little bit deeper. um just [3064] type in YouTube channel email and then [3067] from there you'll get like a YouTube [3068] channel bulk email scraper, YouTube [3069] channel email scraper, YouTube email [3071] finder and so on and so forth. So what's [3073] the value here? Well, once you have um [3074] once you have that uh you can just pump [3076] this into an instantly or smart lead [3078] sequence and start sending cold [3079] outreach. Um there's no inherent DM [3082] mechanism on YouTube unfortunately. So [3084] I'll leave it at that. But um yeah, it's [3086] probably one of the simplest and easiest [3087] ways to get up and running sourcing data [3089] off of YouTube, especially with like [3091] more niche keywords and stuff like that. [3092] And then last but not least, here is how [3094] to scrape Tik Tok. Now, variety of [3096] different ways to do so. I'm going to be [3097] using Ampify scrapers. I'm not married [3099] to Ampify here at all. They're a great [3100] platform, but there are variety of other [3102] ways you could do this if you wanted to. [3103] I just continuously rely on this because [3106] they just have a bunch of like out of [3107] the box ones that work. And basically, [3109] you know, you can use Appify and then [3110] you can use a no code tool like make.com [3112] to take that data and then review it and [3114] then I don't know, add it to some email [3116] sequence like I was talking about [3117] earlier before sending them out. So uh [3120] first things first, we choose our [3121] scraping method. As we see there are [3123] variety of different things we could do. [3124] Hashtags, usernames, videos, relevant [3126] keywords, right? Then we just run this [3128] one actor called Tik Tok data extractor. [3130] I don't know where all of these arrows [3131] are coming from, but they are certainly [3134] annoying. So we're going to go back to [3136] our actors list store and I'm just going [3139] to type in Tik Tok. What you want is [3141] this data extractor one over here. This [3143] is by far the best. The value here as [3145] well is it's results base. So $4 per [3147] thousand. pretty easy videos with this [3149] hashtag. Let's type AI automation. What [3151] this is going to do is it's going to go [3152] and extract a bunch of videos for me. [3154] But there are also a bunch of other [3155] options. I could do profiles. Okay, so I [3158] could actually add in a username and [3160] then I could scrape all the videos and [3161] profile data from people that um that [3163] person follows or something like that. I [3166] could do um a direct search. I could [3168] actually enter video URLs. And then I [3169] could also download Tik Tok videos, too. [3171] Pretty crazy, right? Lots lots of [3173] options here. Anyway, I'm just going to [3174] try scraping, let's say, 10 videos per [3177] hashtag AI automation. I'm going click [3179] save and start. Now, what's happening is [3181] this is obviously spinning up that [3182] server like we talked about. But this is [3184] probably one of the best actors on the [3185] Appify platform. So, you get a lot of [3187] data and all of it's really relevant, [3188] which is nice. All right, so what did we [3189] end up doing? We got a big list of data [3192] here. We got the author. We even got the [3194] author's avatar profile pick, right? We [3196] got the text of the post. We got the [3198] digs, the shares, the number of plays, [3200] the number of comments. We got the [3201] duration in seconds. You can see that [3203] being valuable. We even got a bunch of [3205] metadata about music. But that's not [3207] all. If I click all fields, we got even [3209] more data. Okay, so now we have things [3210] like play count. We got metadata related [3213] to the music. So if there's a song, we [3215] actually know the song that was used. [3216] You can use this to like scrape like [3218] really good songs to use in videos, [3220] whether it's pinned, slideshow, the [3222] location, um the ID of the post, uh the [3225] various h the other hashtags that they [3227] use. So maybe you use a automation as [3229] like your primary hashtag, but then you [3230] scrape all the other ones and then [3231] search for those. Again, the rabbit hole [3233] goes pretty deep here. Um, but anyway, [3236] so now basically the the thing that's [3237] important for us is we have the uh we [3239] have the profile URL. We also have the [3240] name here. Uh, and then we also have a [3242] bunch of information about the person. [3244] So, you know, join the AI ranking [3245] community, join this, join that. You [3247] know, we we have a bunch of data that we [3248] could theoretically pass through some [3250] sort of system to generate um an [3252] icebreaker for, right? Which is pretty [3253] cool. Once you have a list of all of [3255] that, you can then search profiles. [3257] Okay. So, I'm just going to go back to [3258] that run and I'm just going to show you [3260] guys an example. If I wanted to run [3262] Nikico AI ranking, then if I wanted to [3267] extract people that rank for hashtags [3270] like a automation and then I wanted to [3272] extract a bunch of detailed profile data [3274] about them. Okay, this is what that [3277] would look like. Let me just delete [3279] this. And now I'm only scraping the [3281] video. Uh I'm only scraping the profile [3283] itself. So now this is going to be [3285] spinning up a server just like it did [3286] before and every other time and it's [3288] going to be getting us a bunch of data. [3290] All right, after you get a big list of [3292] all of the authors, it's kind of a [3293] clever and hacky way of doing things, [3295] but what you have to do is you have to [3297] connect chat GPT to this list. Then what [3301] we're going to do is we're going to feed [3302] in all of this author information into [3306] um chat GBT and see if we can have it [3309] return us a website. Let me show you [3312] guys what that process actually looks [3313] like in [3314] practice. So, first thing I'm going to [3316] do is I'm just going to use the get data [3318] set items. And this isn't a make.com [3320] video, but I just want to show you guys [3321] that it is actually feasible. We're [3322] going to get data set items from this [3325] data uh Tik Tok data extractor. So, I'll [3327] go to storage and this data set ID is [3331] right over here. I'm going to feed this [3332] in. And basically, all this is doing is [3334] this is giving us access to all of that [3337] data that we just had earlier. Okay. Now [3339] the field that we really care about is [3341] under author meta and it's the name and [3343] then maybe the nickname as well. So what [3346] I'm going to do is I'm going to grab all [3347] of that data. I'm going to feed that [3349] through an open AAI API call. So I'm [3352] then going to call OpenAI. The specific [3354] model I'm going to call it's going to be [3356] a search. This search model essentially [3359] allows you to look up results. So what [3361] I'm going to do is I'm going to use a [3364] developer/system. So you are helpful, [3366] intelligent data extraction and search [3370] assistant. Then under message, I'm going [3372] to go roll. Your task is to take as [3375] input a um Tik [3379] Tok Tik Tok profile JSON and look for [3383] and [3384] return a website for that person in [3387] JSON. It should be their either their [3391] company site or their personal site. Use [3393] this format. Then I'm going to say [3396] website. If no website is found, leave [3398] it blank. Only return your results in [3402] JSON. Your first character should be [3405] this. Okay. I'm then going to let's just [3409] go down to show advanced settings and go [3410] JSON object parse JSON response. I'm not [3413] going to do any of these other [3416] settings. What I'm then going to do is [3419] between this I'm just going to go [3420] transform JSON. What this will do is [3423] this will allow me to get this object [3424] which I care about which is author meta [3426] and just turn it into a big JSON [3430] string. The value in there is I'm just [3433] going to be able to get all of the all [3434] the data about that person which should [3436] help my search. So I'm then going to [3438] do text content JSON string. Then we'll [3442] just see if we can get the results. And [3444] I'm only going to return for now top [3447] five results to show you guys what this [3449] looks like. Um, looks like JSON objects [3452] not supported. Oh, my bad. You can't [3453] actually use Yes, that's why I um [3455] hardcoded it. Uh, you can't actually use [3456] this JSON object as a [3460] um, yeah, you actually just need to go [3462] empty there. Okay, now we're going to [3464] run this. It's now going to perform a [3466] bunch of searches for us under behind [3468] the scenes and sort of under the hood. [3469] Okay, so if it can find the website, it [3472] will. Now, in this case, it's finding [3473] school's website because this person had [3475] a specific offer that went back. This [3477] person did not have a website. This [3479] person had a school website because they [3481] had a school community. This person [3482] actually found their website which was [3484] nice. Then this person uh looks [3487] like just actually get the output of [3489] that. This person had their website as [3491] well. It looks like out of I don't know [3493] five profiles we got two. What you do is [3496] you then go to a Google sheet and then [3497] you just add that data. If I go to [3499] sheets.google then go down to Nick I [3502] leftclick and then make a new Google [3503] sheet. I just call this Tik Tok data. [3507] Then here I go website and then I go [3510] profile uh I don't know Tik Tok profile. [3514] Then I go back to my make.com [3516] scenario. If I then choose that Google [3520] sheet, I'll actually show you guys what [3521] it looks like when we fill it in. Just [3523] go sheet one table contains headers and [3525] the website will be the parsed version [3528] of this. So I'm going to parse this [3531] out. Feed in that result. Then from [3535] this, what we want is [3537] five.json. Cool. And then Tik Tok [3539] profile for that specific record would [3541] just be Nico ranking. Let's see what [3543] that looks like. As we parse it out, [3545] it's going to again perform those [3547] searches. And then if I open this up, [3549] you can see is we're now finding the [3551] website for the people that have [3552] websites. So we didn't find one for [3554] Automation Universe. We found one for [3556] Nathan Hodgson. And then we also found [3557] one for Callum Carver. And you know, as [3560] we see, we've gotten two out of the [3561] five. So about a 40% enrichment rate. [3563] You could also obviously improve the [3565] quality of the prompts if you wanted to [3566] do things like, I don't know, tell it [3568] not to put school communities in there [3569] because school's obviously blowing up [3570] right now and that's a a big place that [3572] a lot of creators are monetizing instead [3574] of having their own website. But yeah, [3576] that is uh more or less it on Tik Tok. I [3578] went through all applicable social media [3581] profiles today. A lot of fun putting [3583] this video together. If you guys have [3584] any questions about how to get up and [3586] running and scraping your own social [3587] media platforms on your own, let me [3589] know. For now, I'm going to hastily go [3591] through and uh remove my credit card [3594] from a bunch of trials and then also [3596] cancel a bunch of these because I just [3598] wanted to show you guys what this looks [3599] like and I was happy to pay a little bit [3600] of money to make sure that I could. If [3602] you guys like learning about scraping [3603] and if you guys like the idea of getting [3605] an automation business up and running [3606] that does this sort of thing [3607] professionally for businesses, [3608] definitely check out Maker School. It's [3610] my 0ero to1 road map to show you guys [3611] how to launch and monetize your own AI [3614] automation business. Uh, if you guys [3615] already have an established company and [3617] maybe you want to take it to the next [3618] step, check out my community that shows [3620] you how to take something that's working [3621] and then scale it up even more.

Title: AI Agents vs AI Automations in 2025
[0] AI agents and AI automations are [2] fundamentally different things. They are [3] tools in your kit. And just like with [5] any tool, I see a lot of people using [7] the wrong one for the job. So, in this [8] video, I'm going to run you through the [10] differences between AI agents and AI [12] automation, which different problems [13] these two tools solve, and how to choose [15] the right approach that delivers the [16] best results for your clients or just [18] your specific business needs. This is [20] especially relevant with new [21] technologies like MCP or model context [23] protocol, gaining a really wide market [25] share very quickly. So, if you guys want [27] to stay ahead of the impending AI agent [28] boom, it's important to understand how [29] all this stuff works and how to [30] realistically choose which one to use. [32] By the way, my name is Nick and I've [33] sold several hundred,000 worth of AI and [35] automations and agents over the last few [37] years and I coach over a thousand other [39] people to help them do the same. So, as [40] I mentioned before, the current [41] iteration of AI agents, specifically [44] NADN AI agents, isn't yet at a point [46] where you can realistically and reliably [48] produce an ROI for a business that you [51] couldn't do through easier, better, and [53] more conventional automation means. I'm [55] also not saying this because I hate AI [56] agents or I think AI is bad technology. [59] I run my entire life using artificial [60] intelligence at this point. Makes me all [62] my money. It's all I talk about. Um I've [64] discussed this many times, but basically [66] what I really don't like are hype [67] bubbles and common misconceptions. So I [69] just want to clear up both right now. So [71] why do people get confused? Well, the [72] biggest confusion I see is people not [74] understanding the fundamental [75] differences between three types of [76] systems. We have traditional automation, [79] AI automation, and AI agents. These [82] three categories are a lot simpler than [83] most people make them out to be. So, let [85] me break this down for you. First, let's [87] talk about what traditional automation [88] actually is. Now, traditional automation [90] is your conventional procedural [92] automation. The old left to right flow [94] where you execute some trigger, then a [96] bunch of actions occur immediately [97] after, and none of those actions include [99] AI. We've been able to build these [101] things for decades now. And in terms of [102] no code tools, you can think Zap year, [104] make.com, nonen where essentially you [107] build these linear workflows that [108] connect a bunch of different tools [110] together via API. And they're ultimately [112] reliable, predictable. You know, they've [113] been around for years. We've been using [114] a lot of them. For example, let me show [116] you guys a simple automation that's [117] traditional that I built in make.com for [119] invoice follow-ups. Essentially, what [121] happens is every day, okay, at 7:30 in [124] the morning, we will grab the current [126] date. We will then check a Google sheet, [130] which is this Google sheet right over [131] here. We'll get how long it's been since [133] we've sent an invoice essentially. Then [136] if it's been, I don't know, 7 days since [138] we've sent the invoice, we'll send an [139] email that'll look like this. If it's [142] been 14 days, we'll send another email [145] that might look like this. It's been 21 [148] days, we'll send another email. It'll [150] look like this. And so on and so on and [152] so forth. Okay? Now, we've had the [155] ability to use these sorts of flows. In [157] this case, this isn't actually going to [158] send the email because none of the dates [159] match our time period, but we've had the [161] ability to do this sort of thing for a [163] very long time. There's nothing special [165] here. There's nothing magic. This sort [166] of automation is actually now built into [167] a large number of the the tools online [170] that people uh use, you know, like go [172] high level, various inbound and outbound [174] email tools, various CRM and so on and [176] so forth. And you can think of these [177] sorts of module flows as like a pipe, [179] okay? Where essentially things will [181] start at one end. So you have some sort [183] of input coming in. In this case, it's [185] just the current date. And then data [187] will flow through this pipe left to [189] right before determining which route it [191] wants to go down. So it's not making any [194] complex decisions. Uh it's incredibly [196] reliable. And for most businesses, this [197] type of automation can easily generate [199] an additional 10 or $20,000 a year just [201] by ensuring that invoices don't slip [202] through the cracks. I consider it super [204] simple but super effective, which is [206] ultimately what I'm all about. Next up [207] is AI automation. And this is where we [209] take the same procedural flow, but we [211] add an AI component somewhere in the [213] middle. Maybe instead of just sending an [215] email, we have a large language model [216] that personalizes the content based on [218] something about the client or the [219] prospect. Now, something like this, [221] which I built out an NADN, would be [223] considered an AI automation flow. What [225] we have again is the same left to write [227] sort of system where in our case, we [230] click a test workflow button that's down [232] here. Then we proceed to do a bunch of [234] things. We get some data set items. We [235] have some eliminter. We do some loop [237] logic. we do an if then then finally we [240] hit an API and then here's the important [242] thing we use AI as one of the nodes in [244] our step before finally adding a row and [247] uh sort of working through like that. So [249] this works essentially the exact same as [252] you guys saw previously. We have some [253] sort of left to right flow. Really the [255] only difference is we also have an AI [257] node that does something inside of it. [258] It does some sort of flexible in our [260] case personalization where uh the output [263] is we end up with a bunch of highly [265] customized fields that we can use in an [266] email. Okay. Hey, I mean, I sell [268] automation systems like this from [270] anywhere between $1,500 to $10,000. [272] These are very, very simple to use. As [274] you can see, exact same logic as in [275] traditional automation. We just sprinkle [277] in a little bit of AI magic. Now, we [279] also have a subvariant of that, and [281] that's the dynamic AI automation. [283] Instead of just using AI as a component [284] within a fixed workflow, a dynamic AI [287] automation actually allows the AI to [288] make decisions about which path to take. [291] You can see what makes dynamic AI [292] automation different in this example. [294] What we have here is we have a flow that [296] I put together in NADN which auto labels [298] and drafts incoming emails. Essentially, [300] when a new email comes in, what we do is [301] we pass all of those emails through a [304] text classifier. The text classifier's [306] job is to take an email, then put it [309] into one of these categories. [310] Transactional, invoices and receipts, [312] cold air outreach, sponsorship/ [314] affiliate requests, and QA advice, and [316] community inquiries. Essentially what's [318] happening in this case is AI itself is [320] deciding which route to go down based [323] off of the logic that we put in. It [325] might choose transactional emails [326] depending on whether it thinks that the [328] input to this node is a transactional [330] email. Might choose QA advice. It might [332] choose unknown. Right? And based off of [335] that AI logic we're doing the routing. [337] Essentially what I'm trying to say is AI [339] is making decisions about the flow of [340] data rather than just processing data [342] within a predetermined sequence. And as [344] I'm sure you can imagine, this adds a [345] ton of flexibility in your automations. [347] But I want you guys to focus on this for [349] a second because here's where a lot of [350] people get confused. A lot of people are [353] calling this thing right over here an AI [356] agent. Okay? But it's not an AI agent [359] because at the end of the day, the AI is [361] still operating and constrained within a [363] set of these pathways that we put [365] together. We've basically taken the time [366] to bake in all of this logic. say you [369] can go down this pathway, that pathway, [371] that pathway, and that pathway, and you [372] get to choose which one. Um, AI in this [375] case is really powerful, but it's [377] ultimately just a router. It's a [378] decision-making machine. It doesn't have [380] the freedom to define new paths on its [382] own, and it can only go down the [383] sequence from left to right. Now, that's [386] where AI agents come in. When we talk [388] about AI agents, we're really referring [389] to something fundamentally different. An [391] AI agent is a system that uses a large [393] language model to decide what's called [395] the control flow of an application. In [397] plain English, it just means the AI gets [399] to make decisions about what actions to [402] take and importantly in what order. [404] Okay? With an AI agent, instead of you [406] designing the whole workflow like I [408] showed you guys a moment ago where we [410] have left to right nodes, you're giving [412] the AI access to various tools, then [415] letting it figure out the most efficient [416] way to complete your request using those [418] tools. And really, in a nutshell, if I [420] just strip away all the complexity, all [421] that means is at the end of the day, the [423] AI agent decides what your flow looks [426] like. You just give it the ability to [427] call a tool when it needs to. Let me [429] show you what I mean with a practical [430] example. I recently built a website AI [432] agent NADN that essentially functions as [435] a chat button. Unlike traditional [436] automations, this agent will receive a [439] chat message right over here. When that [441] chat message comes in, as you can see, [443] we have an AI agent node which is right [445] next to it. Okay. But there's no linear [448] flow. I mean, you know, Naden allows you [450] to create a linear flow if you want, but [451] the linear flow isn't really the core [453] part of this, nor is it entirely [454] required. What we have instead is we [456] have a bunch of tools that this a agent [458] knows about and is connected to and can [460] call depending on your query. [463] Essentially, it's deciding the tools to [465] use, the tools to select based off of [467] the logic that the uh large language [470] model has. Not the logic that we've [471] baked into, but the logic that it is [474] deciding for itself. So, for instance, [476] if I were to open this up here and then [477] chat, say something like, "Hey, could [480] you book me a meeting for uh let's check [484] what day it is today?" Let's say I got [486] to make sure that it's a Monday because [487] I'm my calendar blocks out um Sundays. [490] Let's say Monday, March 24th, [493] 2025. Now, when I call this, essentially [496] what's occurring is this model has a [499] choice. And that choice is in our case [502] which tool should I call? And because it [505] has access to these tools, it's asking [508] us to fill in information that that tool [511] needs in order for us to execute it. So [513] now we have a back and forth with this [514] model. What it's asking us to do is [516] could you please provide the start and [518] end time for the meeting as well as the [519] meeting summary or title. If you try and [521] think about how we would have baked that [522] in ourselves using some sort of [523] traditional or AI automation, um [526] essentially we would have had to have [527] you know like a new chat message [529] received then we would have to have some [532] other question where the AI asks another [535] sequence of specific things based off [536] that and then finally you'd be able to [538] proceed. But in our case we were able to [540] do that just with one AI agent node. [542] Okay. So, if I go back here and then I [544] say, "Yeah, sure. I'm I'm happy to. [546] Let's do 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. and call it [550] Nyx N8N agent AI agent [556] seminar." Now, what's happening is it's [559] taking that information and then it's [561] auto autonomously choosing and deciding [563] to call the Google calendar create event [565] node. it goes receives output from the [568] Google calendar event node, processes [571] it, chooses to do something else with [573] it, which in our case is respond to us [574] with that and then you know now we have [577] u I guess a confirmation message [579] essentially where at the end it asks if [581] there's anything else I would like to [582] do. So there in lies the difference. [584] Okay, it's autonomy. Traditional [585] automations and AI automations are [587] always going to follow predefined paths [588] that you build. But AI agents have [590] decision-m capability. That's what [592] ultimately makes them an agent in the [593] first place. And this autonomy is [595] exactly what makes them both very [596] promising for future applications, but [597] also quite problematic right now, which [599] a lot of people don't really seem to [600] understand. So why are traditional and [602] AI automations, in my opinion, better [604] right now than AI agents? Well, now that [606] we understand the key differences, um I [607] want to dig just a little bit deeper [609] into traditional and AI automations. [610] First of all, despite all of the AI [612] agent hype, these traditional and AI [614] automation systems are actually still [615] the backbone of the vast majority of the [617] systems that businesses use. These [619] conventional left to right flows where [620] you choose the way the automation [622] executes. These are basically what I'd [623] consider the old faithful of the [625] automation world. You will trigger an [627] event and then a predictable series of [629] actions will occur in a specific order [630] and that series of actions occurs the [632] exact same every single time. Meaning [634] that you can build these systems and [635] they'll typically run for years without [637] a hitch. What you're doing is you're [638] building a pipeline. What makes [640] traditional and AI automation so [642] valuable? The key thing is reliability. [644] These systems typically have a very low [645] failure rate. They approach zero. It's [647] 0.0001% depending on the uptime of the [649] various services involved. And when you [651] build a flow that checks your CRM for [652] new leads and sends them the same email [654] every time, it's going to do exactly [656] that consistently and reliably without a [658] question. So the only time these sorts [660] of systems are going to break is just [661] when the APIs change or there's some [662] external system modification or [664] whatever. And that does happen in [666] practice, but it is super rare. Beauty [668] of traditional and AI automations is in [670] their simplicity. There is a clarity to [672] the logical flow, right? Like when X [674] happens, I want you to do Y, then I want [676] you to do Z. And that makes these [677] systems incredibly easy to debug when [679] something goes wrong. You can see [680] exactly where in the chain the failure [681] occurred and fix it. I like to think of [683] it as tracing a wire to find out where [685] that wire is broken. Traditional and AI [687] automations are also super easy for [689] developers set up or extend or maintain. [691] It's basically like working with Lego [693] blocks if you use one of our no code [694] tools. Um, each piece just snaps [696] together in a predictable way. That's [697] how APIs work. You can swap with the [699] components whenever they're needed. And [700] this modularity makes these systems [701] super versatile and adaptable over time. [704] Now, here's the problem with traditional [706] AI automations. And here's really the [707] dream of AI agents and where they're [709] supposed to come in, and that's [711] flexibility. Okay, reliability and [713] flexibility are essentially at two odds [715] of a spectrum. If you wanted to handle [717] different scenarios or edge cases or [720] different input schemas like different [722] types of parameters that you feed into [723] an input without necessarily defining [725] all of the logic manually yourself, AI [728] automations and traditional automations [730] are unable to adapt on their own to [732] learn from these situations or apply [734] even very elementary logic to them [736] because you're the one that set the [737] route. You're the one that built the [738] flow. The thing is most people overblow [740] how valuable this is. In reality, [743] usually if you have a business that's [744] making a lot of money, which is [745] ultimately all we really care about, [746] right? We're just we're just here to to [747] build systems that enable businesses to [749] make more money, whether it's somebody [750] else's business or our own business or [751] whatever. If you have like a a system [753] that a business is already using and [755] it's printing money, and even if it's a [756] manual or whatever, and you want to [757] sprinkle some automation in there, if [758] you think about it, that system is a [761] defined series of actions that occur [762] very similarly every time, right? So [765] that system is sort of like a manual [767] automation. All you are doing by [770] automating it and putting it on the [771] cloud is you are building a predictable, [774] reliable, repeatable flow over and over [777] and over and over again. The last thing [779] that a business wants if it has a [781] pipeline that continuously and [782] consistently generates $100,000 a month [784] is something that mostly works or [786] something that, you know, works 95% of [788] the time or something that's super [789] flexible and has all the the capability [791] to do all this cool stuff, but we only [792] want to do that one thing and it just [794] doesn't really do that one thing very [795] well. The way that I see it, and this [797] might date me and make me a little bit [798] older than I actually am, but it's the [800] different it's the difference between [801] like a general purpose CPU and kind of [803] like an application specific integrated [805] circuit. General purpose CPUs can handle [808] any problem that you throw at them, more [809] or less, they're typically just going to [811] be a lot slower at doing that. And you [813] know, because of their uh substantial [815] reduction in speed, very few people use [818] them for these hyperspecific [819] applications. If you consider like an [821] application specific integrated circuit, [822] essentially what that means is we've [824] actually built the architecture of the [825] logic manually. Like we we've hardwired [828] it into a circuit board and it just does [830] that one thing every time. It's just a [832] series of of um electrical impulses [835] essentially that follow from one [836] transistor to the next. Okay. Anyway, [837] nerdy example over. Essentially, what [839] I'm trying to say is traditional and AI [840] automations are the backbone of most [842] successful business operations today. [844] Because if you guys have an established [845] process that makes a company 100,000 [846] bucks a month, 200,000 bucks a month, [849] and then you start introducing even the [850] slightest bit of error like AI agents [852] tend to do, maybe 5%. It's not that [854] you're just losing 5% of your revenue. [856] You're losing uh I mean, honestly, up to [858] like 100% of that revenue, you're [860] potentially costing that company their [861] entire topline if you build a system [864] that undermines their ability to deliver [865] consistent results. Now, I've sold [867] several hundreds of thousands of dollars [868] worth of traditional NA automations over [870] the years because they deliver [871] measurable consistent results without [873] the unpredictability that comes with [875] more flexible systems. And for most [877] business use cases, this predictability [879] is worth its weight and gold. This is [880] what businesses want at the end of the [882] day. So, where exactly do these AI [884] agents come in then? Um, AI agents, you [887] know, everybody says that they're these [889] revolutionary pieces of technology. [891] They're going to change automation [892] forever. I think they will, don't get me [894] wrong. And I don't want to be like that [896] lidite that stands against this torrent [898] of technological progress and tries to [899] stop it, but they're not really at that [901] point right now. And because of that [903] lack of reliability, because of the fact [905] that these agents are essentially just [906] glorified chat bots at this point, [908] they're very unlikely to really be able [910] to be installed in a company and then [911] drive immediately an actionable revenue. [913] They're very unlikely for you to be able [916] to define a process that prints money on [918] a cyclic basis or whatever um and then [920] hand it off to the age and then not be [922] concerned about its ability to do [923] things. [925] Okay, so let's look at this example [926] again. I know I just showed this to you [928] before, but essentially walking you guys [929] through this. What we have is we have a [931] chat interface that I can open by [933] clicking this chat button. We're storing [935] memory, aka we are adding messages to [937] some buffer using this window buffer [939] memory option. We're using OpenAI to be [941] our chat model um in our case GPT4. And [944] then we have a Google calendar tool, a [946] Gmail tool, HTTP request tool, a [948] calculator tool, a Wikipedia tool, then [950] we also have a vector store tool. Okay. [952] Now, when you send a message to this [954] agent, what it is doing is it's deciding [956] which tools to use and also in what [958] order based off what you're asking for. [961] I'm sure we can all agree this stuff [962] looks super cool from a bird's eye [964] perspective. If I ask it to book me a [965] meeting tomorrow at 3 p.m. like it did [966] yesterday, it'll interpret that request. [968] It'll check my calendar availability. [970] It'll create the event. It's a it's a [971] super undeniable highv value wow factor, [974] and it makes for great demos. But the [976] issue is the reliability cost. If I were [978] to run this exact agent just like I did [980] before a 100 times, it would fail [983] somewhere between one to maybe five [985] times. Okay? And that's as of the time [987] of this recording. There's a [988] infrastructure framework that's gaining [989] a lot of popularity recently called MCP. [992] The whole idea is it makes things [993] substantially more reliable. We're not [994] entirely there yet. I'll make some [995] videos on MCP pretty soon. Um, but I [997] just wanted to point that out. Now, one [1000] to five errors out of a hundred requests [1002] might not sound like much, but that is [1004] astronomically higher than a traditional [1005] automation to the tune of several [1007] thousand times. If we go back to [1008] something like this, okay, if I were to [1010] run this 100 times, it would fail zero [1012] times. If I were to run this a thousand [1013] times, it would fail zero times. If I [1014] were to run this 10,000 or 100 thousand [1016] times, might fail once. Okay, this is an [1019] order an order of magnitude better and [1022] more reliable ultimately for businesses [1024] that ultimately care about uptime and [1025] and stuff like that. Um, obviously [1027] businesses are going to they're going to [1028] prefer simple and repeatable systems. [1031] Now, anyway, the point that I'm trying [1032] to make is since you're communicating [1033] with this model, it's not always going [1034] to interpret your request correctly. [1036] Sometimes you're going to say something [1037] like, "Hey, could you book me a calendar [1038] event?" But then instead of booking you [1040] a calendar event, what it's going to do [1041] is it's going to go down this HTTP [1042] request route instead. Now, in our case, [1044] this is actually doing an API call where [1045] it gets the current weather. Okay? But [1047] maybe just because uh you know large [1050] language models are flexible and they [1051] have the opportunity to make a mistake. [1053] What it'll do is it'll make an HTTP [1055] request to that get current weather API [1057] and then it'll add like the city and [1059] make it a calendar instead. It'll [1060] basically hallucinate and invent stuff. [1062] Doesn't happen super often, but it [1064] happens enough that uh a lot of [1065] businesses are I want to say skeptical [1068] of using these sorts of things for [1070] applications that are high cost um and [1072] not necessarily high ROI. Now, I've also [1074] previously touched on a cost that a lot [1076] of people don't care about, and that's [1077] the prompt engineering of these models. [1078] Uh, like if I were to, I don't know, ask [1081] this to send me an email. Hey, can you [1083] send an email to Nicholas [1086] Sarifgmail.com, congratulate him on his [1088] recent career move? He started a new [1091] company called [1093] Leftclick, right? If I tell it to do [1096] this stuff, which is one of the most [1098] common um I want to say examples of AI [1101] agents where you have it send some [1102] update or whatever, you know, it'll do [1105] the thing most of the time. In my case, [1106] it'll send an email to Nick [1108] congratulating him on the recent career [1109] move. But if I actually go back to my [1111] email inbox, I just open this up for you [1113] guys and we actually look at like the [1115] quality. Essentially, what we have is, [1116] "Congratulations on your new venture [1118] with these capitalizations. Dear Nick, I [1120] hope this message finds you well. I [1121] wanted to extend my heartfelt [1122] congratulations on your new career [1123] moving the second launcher company [1124] leftclick was a fantastic achievement I [1125] know you make a significant impact in [1126] your new venture wishing you all the [1127] best as you embark on this new journey [1129] best regards your name so I guess what [1131] I'm trying to say is imagine if you know [1133] you sold this to a business owner or [1135] something and the business owner just [1136] didn't fully understand the capabilities [1138] of a chat model like this because [1139] they're not you know AI automation [1141] specialists they're not developers they [1143] don't really get how all of this stuff [1144] works deep down that's why our value is [1146] our value and imagine if they sent an [1149] email like this to some past client or [1151] something. Okay. How do you think that [1154] client is going to take something like [1156] that? Pretty poorly. I guess I guess the [1158] point that I'm trying to make is if you [1160] try and use NADN AI agents in some sort [1163] of customerf facing [1165] application, there's a high likelihood [1167] that this is going to negatively impact [1169] how you're perceived, which can have [1170] massive downstream effects if you're not [1172] careful. What if instead of all that [1173] fancy overengineered LLM stuff with the [1176] AI agent and the tools, right? I mean, [1178] that's the definition of [1178] overengineering. you are building the [1180] wheel of all wheels and all you need is [1182] like a a little round pebble or [1185] something like that. Um, what if instead [1186] of that we had a simple set multiple [1188] variables node in make.com that just [1190] says call with Nick March 25th, 2025, 3 [1193] p.m. to 3:30 p.m. We had two steps where [1196] the second is we create a calendar event [1198] directly in [1200] Gcal. And what if we just what if we [1202] just simplify it and cut down all of the [1204] complexity. [1206] Okay, this is going to work basically [1208] every time. It's substantially easier to [1210] set up. It's infinitely more scalable [1213] and it's also much more maintainable. [1215] Sure, it doesn't have a cool chat [1216] interface, but what do you think is more [1217] valuable to most businesses at the end [1219] of the day? Is it a nice chat window or [1220] is it actually getting things done [1222] reliably? I mean, how many situations [1224] are there where people want to book a [1226] meeting with you? Don't focus on the [1229] user interface and making the user [1231] interface as complex and cool and sexy [1233] as possible. Well, just make sure the [1234] thing that you want them to be able to [1235] do is doable. So, in our case, instead [1237] of offering them a chat window, just [1239] give them a calendar, right? It does the [1240] exact same thing. And people are much [1242] more used to using calendars than they [1243] are chat windows anyway. So, that's the [1245] fundamental difference. You know, with [1246] AI agents, you're giving up maybe 5% of [1248] your business reliability for what [1250] ultimately amounts to a cool little chat [1251] box. And that 5% might represent $50,000 [1254] or maybe even $500,000 a year. Any [1256] serious business owner is not going to [1257] be making that trade-off. Does that mean [1259] that AI agents are useless? Absolutely [1261] not. They're incredible for personal [1263] assistance, experimentation, [1264] non-critical business processes, and I [1266] also think they have that they have [1267] their place in sales. Um, they're [1269] definitely going to become a lot more [1270] valuable because of stuff like model [1271] context protocol. And I mean, I use AI [1273] constantly in my own work. But for core [1275] business processes and operations where [1277] reliability is very important, [1279] traditional automation and AI automation [1281] is going to reign supreme for quite a [1283] while still. So, now that we understand [1285] the key differences between traditional [1286] automation and AI agents, how do you [1288] actually decide which one is right for [1289] your specific situation? Let me walk you [1291] through my own thought process when I'm [1292] evaluating this sort of thing for [1293] clients. To make a long story short, [1295] given the benefits and the drawbacks of [1297] traditional and AI automations versus AI [1299] agents, here is how I choose. I use [1302] traditional automation when one, the [1304] process is well defined and follows a [1305] predictable pattern. Two, reliability is [1308] non-negotiable like financial [1309] transactions, legal documents, or flows [1311] that are producing a high ROI already. [1313] Or three, the decisions required are [1315] clear-cut. like if it's A then B or C [1318] then D, I'm going to be using [1319] traditional or A automations. Or maybe [1321] four, uh if I need to maintain precise [1323] control over outputs, that might be [1325] particularly important in um I don't [1327] know like uh like enterprise [1328] applications. And also five, if the [1331] process rarely changes. Okay, if all of [1334] those or hell, if a couple of those are [1335] true, I'm going to be using traditional [1337] or AI automations to do that client [1339] request just because it's easier. It's [1341] Lego blocks. there physical little [1343] pieces that you are building that you [1344] can then interchange swap out modules [1346] when necessary and then just like you [1348] know build repeatable templates off of [1350] super easy and super scalable. Now I'm [1352] going to be using AI agents when I'm [1353] building something that's customerf [1355] facing something where the wow factor of [1358] a chat window is very valuable and [1360] important. Uh something where the cost [1362] of an occasional error is minimal aka [1364] it's not something integral to the [1365] lifeblood of your business like a [1367] booking flow like I was showing you guys [1368] earlier. You just use a calendar for [1369] that. Uh, but it's something that's just [1371] low stakes. It's, you know, you trying [1373] to get information, it's you browsing [1374] through a website and using some sort of [1376] chatbot to tell you more about the [1377] company, that sort of stuff. Uh, and [1378] also when the workflow needs to be able [1380] to adapt to a wide variety of [1381] unpredictable inputs. So, like a [1383] chatbot, like a customer booking or [1386] customer support agent, somewhere in [1387] that process, little cracks are going to [1389] start to show up and you're going to [1390] start to see where businesses solve [1391] their problems organically rather than [1392] systematically. You want to focus on [1394] situations where the customer tried [1396] solving their problem organically [1397] because it means that they didn't really [1398] put a lot of thought into it. It's [1400] basically like a fire that they had to [1401] put out immediately in front of them. Um [1402] and you know when it's a fire you're [1404] less likely to think through things like [1406] a systems or a process engineer you're [1407] less likely to think through things in [1409] the sense of huh you know how can I set [1412] up my system in such a way that doesn't [1413] just solve this problem once it actually [1415] solves all iterations and instances of [1416] this problem forever which is more you [1418] know processoriented. So uh yeah, after [1421] that you just go through my my little [1422] checklist essentially and if your [1424] solution is more similar to what a [1426] traditional or AI automation would be [1427] able to do, then great news because you [1429] can build extraordinarily high ROI flows [1431] super quickly. Um whereas if you know [1434] you have multiple uh inputs, if a chat [1436] window is really important and so on and [1437] so forth, then I'd probably build an AI [1439] agent for them. Here's my prediction. [1441] Over the next year or two, we're going [1442] to start seeing AI agents get [1443] significantly more reliable, and they're [1445] eventually going to reach a point where [1446] they become viable for uh more and more [1448] business processes, including those [1450] higher cost, higher ROI ones that I was [1453] mentioning before that I think that [1454] traditional NAI automations are better [1456] for. The way that I see it, okay, is [1459] like it's like a freshly paved road. You [1461] see the the new ash fault glimmering in [1464] the sunlight. How tempting is it to [1466] drive over that thing? Extraordinarily [1469] tempting. But if you're a wise driver, [1470] you're probably going to wait until the [1471] asphalt sets to avoid getting stuck or [1473] avoid screwing up your wheels. Very [1475] similar situation that I see with AI [1477] agents. I think the ashvault is setting. [1479] It's in the process of becoming very [1480] robust. MCP and a bunch of other [1482] protocols are going to help with that. [1484] But as of the time of this recording, [1486] we're not really there yet. So, the [1487] future will likely involve hybrid [1489] systems. Traditional automation handling [1490] the mission critical backbone operations [1492] with AI agents providing some sort of [1494] flexible interface and then handling the [1495] more unpredictable parts of the process. [1498] um MCP um a couple of the other [1500] infrastructural paradigms uh those are [1502] going to help with that but they're only [1504] going to be a part of it not necessarily [1505] the whole thing. Finally, here is the [1508] most important thing that AI agent [1509] promoters won't tell you. You guys can [1511] always just add traditional automations [1514] into a future AI agent once the [1516] technology matures. So you can always [1518] just add a flow, okay? like spend all [1521] that time creating a flow and then when [1523] the AI agent technology is at the point [1524] where it can actually like choose [1526] reliably which tools to use, you could [1528] literally just add that as a tool later [1529] on. So it's not necessarily that like if [1531] you spend your time building solid [1533] reliable automations now, it is a waste [1535] of time. It's precluding you from being [1536] able to incorporate more advanced A [1538] capabilities later. The, you know, [1540] secret sauce really is that it's going [1541] to give you a stronger foundation to [1543] build upon and more cool things that [1544] your Agent can do when they eventually [1546] get to the point where they're reliable [1547] enough that you want to build them for [1548] businesses. Now that you understand the [1550] real differences between a agents and [1551] traditional automation, I like to think [1552] that you guys are equipped to make [1554] better decisions about which one to [1555] implement in different scenarios. Um, [1557] ideally this knowledge is going to help [1558] you build systems that deliver [1559] measurable results for businesses, not [1560] just things that look cool and make for [1562] great YouTube demos. Ultimately, these [1564] successful automation specialists, in my [1566] humble opinion, aren't just technically [1567] skilled. They know how to identify highv [1569] value problems and implement solutions [1570] that deliver a genuine return on [1572] investment. They understand exactly when [1574] to use traditional automation for [1575] reliability, then when to leverage new [1577] and upcoming technologies like AI agents [1579] for flexibility. If you guys like this, [1581] I got over 160 videos on my channel [1582] showing exactly how to build these [1584] automations and use them for business [1585] step by step. Everything from invoice [1587] collection to lead generation to client [1590] onboarding. All of it is there for you. [1592] But if you guys are serious about [1593] turning your automation knowledge into [1594] an actual business, I highly recommend [1596] you consider joining Maker School. It's [1597] where I help AI automation agency owners [1599] land their first client in 90 days, [1601] guaranteed. Maker School gives you guys [1602] everything you need to succeed. Complete [1604] business roadmap with templates, [1606] proposals, and scripts that I use to [1607] scale my agency to 72K a month. You'll [1609] get ready to deploy automation systems [1611] for lead genen sales and client [1612] management. You also get direct coaching [1614] through live calls, hot seats, and daily [1616] personalized Q&A. And ultimately, you're [1618] going to get a focused community of over [1619] a thousand serious AI automation [1621] entrepreneurs committed to growth. [1623] Whether or not you guys join, and I'd [1625] like you to, but you don't have to, my [1627] recommendation is you start applying [1628] these automation principles in your work [1630] today. Don't just watch this video and [1631] let life and this super fast-paced [1634] industry pass you by. Build solutions [1636] that solve real business problems using [1637] the right approach for every specific [1639] challenge today. Take what I've shown [1641] you guys about these linear uh [1643] traditional and AI automations and [1645] actually put a couple of pieces [1646] together. That's how to get somewhere. [1648] You essentially just have to get [1649] started. So, if you've been on the [1650] sidelines up until now, this is me [1652] giving you permission to get going. [1654] Thank you very much for watching. Peace [1655] out.

Title: STOP Selling AI Wrong: What Business Owners ACTUALLY Want
[0] most people are pitching AI Services [2] completely backwards and it's killing [3] their AI business over the last two [5] years I've sold several $100,000 worth [8] of AI automations to companies and I did [10] this through a variety of ways cold [11] email upwork communities and now [13] organically through my own YouTube in [15] this video I'm going to show you the [16] three critical shifts in sales strategy [19] that enabled me to scale my own AI [20] automation agency from zero all the way [22] to 72k per month and what's really [24] interesting is none of them have [26] anything to do with the technology [27] itself let's get into it business owners [29] care about outcomes not technology the [32] biggest mistake I see AI automation [33] agencies make is they obsess over the [35] technology instead of the outcomes that [37] that technology delivers let me be [39] brutally honest most business owners [41] don't actually care whether you're using [42] GPT 40 they don't care if you're using [44] clad they don't care if for using deep [46] seek or any other custom llm that you [48] might or might not have fine-tuned [49] yourself uh what they care about are [51] results when I first started pitching AI [53] Services I would go into excruciating [55] levels of detail about the models and [57] the workflows and basically all the [58] technical aspects I remember back in the [60] day I this one call where I spent like [62] 15 minutes just explaining to the CEO [64] how the automation worked under the hood [66] how the model was trained all the [68] various technical aspects the parameters [69] and stuff like that um they explicitly [71] said to me that's great but how much [73] money is this going to make me here's [75] what business owners actually care about [77] will this make me money will this save [78] me money will this reduce my risk will [81] this give me an edge over my competitors [83] before you mention a single technical [85] detail essentially that's what you need [86] to focus on so uh my recommendation for [89] you is to nail down down these three [90] points focus on Revenue impact exactly [94] how is this system going to drive more [95] revenue is it going to drive more [97] Revenue because of the hyperparameters [99] and how they were tuned no no business [101] owner really cares about that okay what [103] they care about is how that system is [105] going to interplay with the market [107] usually with real customers or real [109] clients in order to convince them to [111] open up their wallets and checkbooks and [113] pay the company more money so that's [114] what you need to focus on the second big [116] thing is cost reduction so how much [118] money is this system going to save [120] and the third is time leverage AKA [122] specifically um whose time is this going [124] to free up and what is that person going [126] to do with that free and available time [129] so when I shifted from saying stuff like [130] I we'll build you a GPT 4 powered lead [133] qualification system to something that's [136] more benefits focused AKA I don't know [138] we'll build you a system that converts [140] 30% more leads without adding headcount [143] uh my close rate went up significantly [144] and yours can too businesses want proven [147] Solutions not cuttingedge experiments [149] the second iCal mistake I see is when [151] people pitch novel and unproven AI [152] Solutions instead of the more battl [154] tested ones that I and many other people [156] have used that have consistently [157] delivered results for many years um I'm [159] talking like NAD and AI agents I'm [162] talking about more flexible Technologies [164] mCP servers and stuff like that things [165] that while really cool and are probably [167] the way that the industry is headed [169] aren't really capable of driving [171] consistent and valuable return on [172] investments today or if they are capable [175] are not capable of delivering more than [177] a Computing available technology like a [179] traditional a automation for instance so [181] when I first started my agency I was [183] always chasing the newest capabilities I [184] would experiment with different models [186] day after day different approaches day [188] after day and I figured that like I was [190] just adding to my Rolodex right the more [191] knowledge that I knew the more clients [193] would be impressed by the technology um [195] that you know I I understood I had to [197] learn a cold hard reality check which is [199] that most businesses with real money to [200] spend don't want to be your guinea pig [203] they're not spending money on R&D or [204] research and development they're [206] spending money on marketing usually to [207] produce some sort of Roi so businesses [209] in General they want solutions that have [211] worked for other businesses with a [212] proven return on investment here's an [214] early picture of mine that failed [215] miserably we can build you an AI system [218] that uses the latest models to [219] automatically write all of your [220] marketing content it's revolutionary [222] cuttingedge technology and nobody else [224] is using it that sounds nice definitely [227] a lot of words but do those words really [229] mean anything to the customer I mean [231] spoiler alert no so here's how to win [233] take that exact pitch and phrase it in [236] ways that the customer understands and [238] in ways that the customer [240] can conceptualize your value what's [242] something that most customers are [244] concerned about they're actually [245] concerned about reliability they're [247] concerned about their reputation they're [249] concerned about the amount of money this [250] is going to take they're concerned that [251] you haven't actually done this before [253] they're concerned that they're going to [254] get scammed okay there's this big list [255] of essentially things that customers [257] worry about at the back of their minds [258] I'm not inventing any of this stuff this [260] stuff is very tried and true it's been [262] written about for much longer than I've [263] been alive if you just take these ideas [266] and you rephrase that previous pitch you [268] might have something like this we've [270] built the same system for three [272] companies in your industry company a saw [275] $420,000 of new Revenue in just 6 months [278] company b reduced all of their costs by [280] 65% and Company C generated 38 more [283] qualified leads a day here's how it [286] works I again had to find this out the [287] hard way when I was building my own AI [289] automation agency I would get on tons of [290] calls and I was super jazzed about the [292] technology obviously who wouldn't be but [294] when clients actually responded to me [296] when they actually you know gave me [297] their business was only when I showed [300] them specific systems i' built before [301] for other clients and results that those [303] systems had produced in other words I [305] front loaded with social proof I showed [307] them that you know I have been [308] pre-selected I've been validated by [310] other customers other people have [311] trusted me enough to pay me their money [313] meaning that the likelihood that I am [314] going to be a total and abject failure [316] for you is lower I wasn't focused on how [318] Grazy and new and amazing the technology [320] was customers actually care less about [323] that than you might think they much [324] prefer like proven repeatable reliable [326] solutions that have worked for years um [328] compared to ones that you know be new [330] and and and hot off the press in my [332] community the members that consistently [334] land clients are almost never the ones [335] with the most technical knowledge and [337] I've seen over, 1500 of them now they're [339] ones that can clearly demonstrate proven [341] results from systems that they've [342] already built or they can imply [344] experience and social proof with systems [346] that other people would built so to [348] recap focus on specific problems that [350] the customer has confirmed that they [351] have show examples of solutions you've [353] actually already built before and then [355] provide concrete results wherever [356] possible at the end of the day [358] Innovation and you know the ability to [360] revolutionize an industry these things [361] get attention but it's proven [363] reliability that ultimately gets the [364] check business owners want Partners not [366] tools the third major mistake I see AI [369] agencies make is they position [370] themselves as basically little tool [372] providers instead of the owners of [374] outcomes instead of the owners or [376] partners of a business in reality [379] businesses already have way too many [380] tools they don't want another one they [382] don't want a fancy chat box that they [384] could send messages to that can add [385] things to their CRM okay what they want [387] is a system that invalidates the need [389] for them to have to worry about putting [390] anything into the CRM to begin with they [392] have software Stacks upon software [395] Stacks they have thousands I mean most [397] businesses that I come into are spending [398] thousands of dollars of extra money that [400] they don't need to on tools that they [401] never use so the last thing they need is [402] another complicated system to figure out [404] or waste their time on right what most [406] businesses are actually looking for is [408] they're looking for somebody to take [409] ownership of delivering an outcome or [411] deliverable I learned this lesson myself [414] probably over a dozen times now it's a [415] very hard lesson to learn but when I [417] shifted from selling one-off automation [418] projects to longer term retainer [420] relationships where I guaranteed [422] specific results my income went through [424] the roof both because of Leverage but [425] also because I stopped being just [427] somebody that you went to to get a [428] specific job done or get a tool built or [430] whatever and I started being a strategic [432] partner that you know the person could [434] rely on not to just build the spec that [436] they were given but to actually come up [437] with a new spec now in my automation [440] agency I noticed something really [441] interesting when I pitch clients on [442] building an AI system the push back was [444] always about price but when I started by [446] pitching I will generate you X qualified [448] leads per month using an AI automation [450] system that I will build manage and take [452] care of completely the conversation [454] would completely change um basically the [456] same concerns that I had before the ones [458] about price disappeared and instead the [461] price seemed reasonable because I was [463] taking complete and utter ownership over [464] the outcome the cost was less important [466] than the deliverable that I was [467] providing now it's not just my [469] experience um in my community the most [471] successful agency owners don't just drop [472] off a tool and say good luck they stick [474] around they ensure that it delivers the [476] promised results they deliver a return [478] on investment and you know when they [480] pitch people they don't pitch people as [481] I will build you a system they pitch [483] people as I will generate you a return [484] on investment I will make you $155,000 [487] in the next 30 days or you don't pay [490] they will conceptualize this as a [492] no-brainer outcome not necessarily A [494] Dream but like a definable goal that you [496] can actually achieve so yeah sell the [498] outcome don't sell the Tool uh take [500] responsibility for delivering results if [502] you are positioning yourself as a [504] partner and equal to them you have to be [505] willing to also accept the [507] responsibility that entails and then [509] ultim structure the pricing around the [510] value of that outcome not how many hours [512] it takes this approach doesn't just [514] close more clients it also creates [515] stickier client relationships and stick [517] your client relationships in Automation [519] and really if I'm honest any sort of [521] agency space is the path to real wealth [523] Mr the businesses that pay the most for [525] AI Services aren't buying access to [527] technology they're buying peace of mind [528] that somebody is competent enough to [530] handle an important business function [531] for them and make a ton of money now [533] that we understand that business owners [534] want return and they want outcomes more [537] than they necessarily want the fancy new [539] deep seek model off the block let's talk [541] about how to position your AI Automation [542] Services to match and ultimately exceed [544] those expectations um I've basically [546] developed this framework that I've been [547] using both in my community and also in [548] my client relationships and I'm going to [550] share with you this framework it's [551] substantially improved my own ability to [554] both close and then retain and it's [555] something that I consider really [556] integral to just my day-to-day work as [558] an a automation agency owner so Step One [561] is start with their specific business [562] problem don't start by talking about AI [564] just focus entirely on the problem that [566] customer is experiencing I might say [568] something like you mentioned you guys [570] are struggling to qualify your leads [571] quickly enough and you think that your [572] sales team is wasting time on poor fit [574] prospects is that right well tell me [576] about that I don't actually bring up AI [579] until I'm very very clear what the [581] problem is and usually to be honest when [583] somebody jumps on a call with me they're [584] expecting me to start talking about AI [586] usually it gets to the point where you [588] know I haven't talked about AI or [589] automation or anything for like 20 or 30 [591] minutes into the call and finally [592] they're at the point where there's like [593] Nick are you gonna talk about Ai and [595] automation when are we gonna do that I'm [596] like well we're gonna do that once I [597] fully understand your business problem [599] when I get to the point where I do and [601] then I drop okay well here's the [602] technology that's going to help it hits [604] that much harder because we basically [605] just spent the last 20 or 30 minutes [606] focusing on their pain points anyway so [609] that's step one step two is to quantify [611] the cost of the problem that you've just [612] spent the last 20 or 30 minutes pressing [614] on this might be something like so how [616] much does a single lead cost you [618] $155,000 okay um if you're losing [620] $115,000 and your current approach loses [623] you two to three customers a month how [625] much is that in total 30 to 45,000 So [627] based on what you've told me this cost [628] you roughly 30k a month and wasted sales [630] time missed opportunities and growth is [632] that a fair conceptualization I will you [634] know I don't just shove the words in [636] their mouth essentially I will uncover [638] exactly how much money the problem is [639] costing them in their own words and then [641] I'll usually have them do some sort of [643] confirmation of it so now you know we've [645] uncovered the problem we're not talking [646] about AI or automation at all we're just [647] uncovering the problem then we're [649] quantifying the problem step three is [651] you present Your solution in terms of [653] its ability to solve those problems not [656] in terms of their technical features so [658] now that I understand the problem I [659] solution is okay great I'll build you a [660] system that pre-qualifies leads [662] automatically it'll ensure your sales [663] team only speaks with really high [664] potential prospects you can keep your [666] closers on the highest Roi deals you can [668] Farm off anything that's not qualified [670] or not high Roi to people that might be [671] a little bit worse this is going to [673] typically increase conversion rates by [675] 10 to 20% we'll trial it out on you for [677] a month don't achieve XYZ outcome you [679] don't pay but I'm extraordinarily [681] confident and will lastly step four is [683] to back it up with proof so you don't [685] just say Your solution you say I've [686] implemented similar systems for clients [688] in the retail vertical and they see an [690] average Roi of 300% within the first 60 [692] days right what you're doing now is [694] you're positioning Your solution as the [695] solution to their problem then you're [697] saying and by the way if you're worried [698] about this I've already done the same [700] thing for all of these other people and [702] last but not least you talk about [703] pricing when you talk about pricing [704] don't worry about it okay don't it's not [707] weird if somebody jumps on a sales call [708] with you they're expecting to chat about [710] pricing the best way to do it is to [712] frame your pricing in terms of Roi not [714] cost so you might say something like the [717] monthly investment is 5,2 $25 which [720] based on the numbers we discussed should [721] deliver a 4 to 6X within your first [723] month I of course guarantee my service [725] and this is very important to me I want [727] to make sure you generate multiples on [728] your investment and so we're going to do [730] everything in our power to make sure [731] that that is so so I do this approach [733] myself I've seen this approach work [734] across dozens of Industries and hundreds [736] of clients the key ultimately is that AI [738] is barely mentioned it is just the means [740] to the end it's not the star of the show [742] okay don't lose the forest for the trees [744] as an agency owner your job is solving [747] business problems it's not building cool [750] fun AI things so while AI is novel and [753] it will give you that attention at least [754] at the first interaction ultimately [756] nobody really cares about it um I've [759] heard it said that nobody cares about [760] the hammer they care about the house [761] that it builds AI is just your Hammer [763] the the business outcome is the house [765] all right so a lot of that's just Theory [766] let's talk about how you can actually [767] implement this approach in your pitches [768] and your marketing immediately uh step [770] one if you are watching this video right [772] now and you think that you suffer from [773] this problem audit your current [775] messaging check out your website then [777] check out your proposals then check out [778] your pitch deck and really just check [780] out anywhere that you're talking about [781] your services count how many times you [783] mention AI okay versus specific business [786] outcomes if you're mentioning the the [788] tech more than the results that's a red [790] flag um you know count up the number of [792] times you're pressing on a paino versus [793] just being like hey we have really cool [794] technology and if you you do the second [797] more than you do the first you got [798] yourself a major problem you need to [800] reduce the number of times that you're [801] talking about AI the second big tip is [803] to restructure your Discovery calls when [805] I work with clients in my community I [806] usually give them a simple Discovery or [808] sales call structure I spend the first [810] 70% of the call asking the customer [812] about their business problems and their [814] goals then I spend around 20% presenting [816] my solution which is always framed in [818] terms of their business outcomes then [819] I'll spend maybe the last 10% doing some [821] sort of objection or concern handling or [824] discussing next steps what a lot of [826] people will do is they'll spend 10% of [827] the time listening to the customer 10% [830] of the time offering the solution then [831] 80% of the time trying to handle [833] objections I don't think you need to [835] handle objections anywhere near as much [837] as most people say if you're very [839] studious with your consultative sales if [840] you're robust and consistent in that [842] approach you know you you've usually [844] handled most of the objections up front [846] by demonstrating what an Roi this would [847] deliver so don't dive into technical [850] explanations until specifically asked [851] and even if somebody does specifically [853] ask you keep it high level just always [854] bring it right back to business impact [856] and don't worry too much about the [857] objections try and handle them all up [858] front the third thing is reframe your [860] case studies okay the simplest and [862] easiest hack to do this if your current [864] case studies are AI powered cold email [867] system instead name that case study how [871] client X generated 35 new meetings in 30 [873] days using our AI system so focus on the [877] result first then only worry about the [880] system or the implementation at the very [881] end if you have a case study your case [884] study isn't I built an AI powered cold [886] Outreach system that generated $100,000 [889] it's I generated $100,000 with an AI [892] powered cold Outreach system now a lot [894] of people resist this approach because [895] they want to show off their technical [896] expertise but the thing is the people [898] that can afford to pay pay you well [899] don't have the technical knowledge to [901] really care or evaluate what any of this [902] stuff means anyway the only thing they [904] actually care about is how confidently [906] you can deliver the outcomes that they [907] want in the business World complexity [909] does not sell it is Clarity that sells [911] so have a lot of people bring up a [913] variety of objections at this point some [914] of them are valid some of them aren't [916] I'm just going to cover like a big list [917] of FAQs essentially then answer those [919] FAQs and the number one objection I get [921] is what if my clients are specifically [923] asking about the AI technology and it's [925] true some clients are going to ask you [926] technical questions especially nowadays [928] when AI is and trendy and these clients [930] want to learn about Ai and they want to [931] feel like they have a part in their [933] Destiny when this happens I will give [934] them a brief simple explanation but [936] almost immediately after pivot back to [938] business outcomes so I'll say something [939] like uh the specific model we use [941] matters far less than the results that [942] that model delivers we're using some [944] variant of GPT 40 and based on our [946] testing this approach will give you XYZ [948] result maybe another objection might be [951] something like well yeah Nick but I [953] don't have a lot of business experience [954] but I do have a lot of AI and Technical [955] experience and I get it you want to show [957] that you know your stuff but expertise [959] is demonstrated through results not [960] really fancy workflows or complicated [962] systems in my experience if you throw on [963] technical terms that actually often [965] backfires on you um sometimes clients [967] will think that you using that [968] complexity to justify your high prices [970] they will think that you are essentially [972] gatekeeping knowledge um and that you're [974] better than them and that you know [976] you're G you're gatekeeping that [978] knowledge you're G gatekeeping that [979] information as a source of value and I [982] don't think that that's true I mean it's [983] like it's almost like a car deal like [986] like a car dealership or something like [987] do you really need a car dealership any [988] anymore just to be real with you I mean [990] in the year 20 well I'm not going to [991] mention the date cuz I was told by a [993] YouTube strategist to never mention a [994] date in a video but in in certain [997] current year do you really need to go to [999] a car dealership and puddle around for [1002] 45 minutes to an hour going back and [1004] forth with uh you know some [1005] representative about something that you [1007] may or may not really need no it's an [1009] extraordinarily inefficient means of [1011] achieving your desired result which is [1013] to buy a freaking car okay uh it's kind [1016] of like that like when you start talking [1018] in Fancy words and big jargon and oh [1020] this puppet can fit 42 horsepower in [1023] there like you you lose a lot of trust [1025] from the customer my goal is to make it [1028] as easy as humanly possible for the [1029] customer to understand what the return [1031] on investment is so that they could just [1032] decide ASAP really quickly so that if [1034] they're not into it I don't waste my [1035] damn time anymore that should be your [1037] goal as well another really common [1039] objection is what if they want to know [1041] how it works and there's a difference [1042] between explaining the implementation [1043] process versus going deep on like AI [1045] architecture instead of saying oh you [1048] know uh that's a great question we [1049] actually trained our model using this [1050] multimodal approach and um I don't know [1053] we we we're working off a fine-tune [1054] branch of you know deep seek R whatever [1057] focus on the workflow you know we'll set [1059] up the system we'll connect it to your [1060] existing tools we'll train it on your [1061] data and we'll have it operational [1062] within 14 days then we'll monitor [1064] performance and optimize based on the [1065] results and if we need to we'll actually [1067] add some more examples to The Prompt [1068] right you can talk about the AI and you [1071] can talk about the specifics so long as [1074] somewhere at the end of that you tie [1076] that back into what the customer [1077] actually cares about which is the return [1078] on investment another common objection [1080] is my prospects don't value what they [1082] don't understand and this is pretty [1083] backwards thinking most business owners [1085] don't understand how their website's [1086] code works or what it was built with but [1088] their website still makes them money [1089] right you don't need to understand every [1091] tiny feature or every tiny component in [1093] order to understand the bigger picture I [1095] mean scientists understand how the brain [1097] creates thought but not necessarily the [1099] underpinnings behind every single like [1101] you know atom in the cell right when I [1104] coach AI automation agency owners in my [1105] own Community I usually find ones that [1107] are struggling to close deals are almost [1109] always the ones that are overe [1110] explaining and over engineering their [1111] Tech the ones that close consistently [1113] are usually relentlessly focused on [1114] business outcomes I think if you make [1116] this shift you guys aren't only going to [1117] close more deals you'll also be able to [1119] charge significantly more for the same [1120] work and you might even be able to get [1122] away with doing it simpler and easier [1123] than you think I used to do freelance [1125] software engineering and I can tell you [1127] 100% that I charge much more money now [1129] dragging and dropping modules across the [1131] screen than I ever did before when I was [1133] building out some complex Black Box [1135] script all right so let me wrap this up [1136] by summarizing the key mindset shifts [1138] and strategies that you guys are going [1139] to need to make in order to sell High [1141] Roi AI Services the first is to focus on [1144] outcomes not AI technology the second is [1146] to emphasize proven Solutions not [1148] cuttingedge experiments the third is to [1150] position yourself as an outcome owner so [1152] somebody that owns results not a [1154] provider of tools not just a little Code [1156] Monkey if you implement these three [1158] strategic shifts in your AI business I [1160] mean it's virtually guaranteed that both [1161] your close rates are going to improve [1163] but so will the quality of your [1164] relationships and the quality of your [1165] general life if you guys have any [1167] questions just drop them in the comments [1168] below and for those of you that are [1169] serious about building a successful AI [1171] business I would highly encourage you to [1173] consider joining my community maker [1174] school we have over 1300 committed AI [1176]

Title: Build This Automated AI LinkedIn DM System in 1 Hour (N8N)
[0] hey everybody today I'm going to show [1] you how to build your very own LinkedIn [2] Outreach system in naden this video is [4] perfect for anybody that wants to [6] automate their LinkedIn Outreach with a [7] system that creates a targeted lead list [9] in Apollo using just natural language [11] enriches those leads with detailed [13] profile data uses AI to generate [15] personalized messages sends connection [17] requests and follow-up safely and tracks [19] the entire campaign within a Google [20] sheet my name is Nick I've made over a [22] million dollars with AI and automation [24] so today I'm going to walk you through [25] building this entire system step by step [27] let's get into it [30] okay so here's a demo of the system from [32] start to finish we start with a form [34] that I fill out which I'll show you in a [35] second that form basically asks for us [38] to define the search parameters in [40] natural language so I am going to get to [41] say I'm looking for Creative agencies [43] between one and a th people that are in [45] the United States and it will actually [46] create an Apollo search URL for me [48] completely autonomously we're then going [50] to generate a search URL here then run [53] an apify actor um I'm setting a limit [55] node here for those of you that don't [57] know limit node is just sort of a [58] testing node allows me to set lower so I [60] don't overwhelm an API we're then doing [62] a personalization step right over here [64] um then I'm adding this to a Google [66] sheet database you can find this Google [67] sheet database um right over here this [71] Google sheet database is very simple [73] we're just logging the ID of the [74] LinkedIn account the first name the last [76] name the full name sometimes I like to [78] have that LinkedIn URL the title the [80] email status the photo URL and then the [82] Icebreaker then finally we are [84] aggregating all of that data so that I [86] could send an API call to a tool called [88] Phantom Buster and I'm going to cover [89] all the stuff in a second but for now [91] let me just show you guys what this [92] looks like in practice and what the end [93] result is I'm going to test workflow [96] it's going to ask me to Define my [97] audience type in plain English so I'm [99] going to say um I'm looking for Creative [103] agencies around one [105] to um let's say [108] 100 people staff across the United [113] States I want the decision makers so [117] come up with a bunch [121] then I'm going to click submit now that [122] I've done this what's happening is it's [124] going through and it's generating a [125] search URL now the r that this works is [128] the service that I'm using basically [130] takes as input a giant search string and [132] so I'm having AI generate the search [134] string the search string is ultimately [136] what is going to allow us to do said [139] search that looks just like this I'm [141] going to copy this over if I paste this [143] in um what this will do is it'll [144] actually go through and then get [146] decision makers that are within my [147] custom audience in my case 996 people [150] across the United States if we proceed [153] with this it will then um run uh what's [156] called an appify actor it's a service [158] that we're going to be using to scrape [159] this group of people that appify actor I [162] can find back over [165] here what this is doing is it's going [167] and it's identifying who these people [169] are it's extracting their email [170] addresses completely autonomously and [172] then it's also getting me a bunch of [174] additional data on [175] them okay after we're done with that we [177] then pass through a limit node we have [179] an A a model here gp4 that actually goes [182] and creates customized ice breakers for [184] the connection requests and then what we [186] do is we'll actually dump that into a [187] Google sheet before aggregating that and [189] then triggering a phantom Buster age and [191] Phantom Buster is the tool that we're [192] going to be using to grab the data from [194] this Google sheet right over here then [196] actually physically produce our LinkedIn [199] connection request over here okay and [202] what that looks like on um their end is [205] we are now running this Phantom Buster [207] Auto Icebreaker connect and it's [209] actually going going through and it's [210] simulating real human activity in order [212] to send the message essentially and the [215] connection request finally as this [217] proceeds down the list we will have the [219] actual data right over here alongside [221] the specific status whether or not this [223] has been sent um and so we have actually [225] gone through and we've sent a bunch of [227] connection requests at various times of [228] the day to these various people using [230] the system and it was all done 100% [235] automatically so I want to make [236] something super clear as of this moment [239] not actually built the system yet I [241] wanted to show you guys what a live real [242] build process looks like from start to [244] finish by somebody that actually does [246] this for uh for for a living on a daily [248] basis I think right now on YouTube it's [250] really fancy and popular to like put a [252] finished product in front of people and [254] be like here's a system here's how to [255] put it together but that people don't [257] actually show what like the live [258] development process looks like in [259] reality the live development process is [261] filled with a lot of detours a lot of [262] ups and downs a lot of um guesses that [265] you know don't actually end up panning [266] out and you know I want to show people [268] how to actually build systems that make [270] people money I don't just want to show [272] people like a finished kind of sanitized [273] version of it um so that's why you guys [275] are going to see me do it all from [276] scratch and that's why you know I'm I'm [278] structuring this video in this way it's [280] very important to me not just to like [281] show somebody a picture of the Eiffel [283] Tower and then be like hey now that [285] you've seen the picture you know how to [286] build it right it's like no I actually [288] want to I want to show people the [289] building process I want to show people [290] the schematics and the diagrams if that [292] makes sense because for the most part [293] that's my audience so yeah uh this is [296] the road map at this point in time [298] basically what I'm thinking I'm going to [299] do is I'm going to start by scraping [300] Apollo leads using appify then I'm going [302] to enrich leads with personalizations [304] and I'm going to send a phantom Buster [305] for a LinkedIn DMS now if you don't know [307] what any of these platforms mean I'll [308] explain them to you right now Apollo is [310] basically a big database that allows us [312] to get a bunch of information based off [314] search filters like dentists in the [317] United States with one to 50 staff [319] members okay the issue with Apollo is [322] it's a very expensive database and so [325] instead of me just getting leads [327] directly from Apollo what I'm going to [328] do is I'm going to use this tool called [330] appify is kind of a scraper which allows [332] us to plug in an Apollo URL and then it [334] goes in it actually like scrapes the [336] HTML the page to find us the leads okay [338] so this kind of a hack but this is [339] basically what everybody's doing right [340] now to scrape um scrape Apollo and the [343] reason why you know everybody's saying [344] that that's okay is because Apollo is [345] just scraping LinkedIn sales Navigator [347] so it's kind of like you know scraping [349] the thing that scrapes the place that [351] scrapes you know um anyway so this is [353] our scraper I'll show I'll show you all [354] these Platforms in a second then open AI [356] is obviously like our AI tool and the [358] reason why we're using an AI tool here [359] is because um we need to personalize the [362] messages that we're going to be sending [363] to people you know after we find the [365] people we're also going to get a bunch [366] of information about them we're going to [368] figure out where they live we're going [369] to figure out their interests we're [370] going to figure out their job titles and [372] stuff well if you actually just feed all [373] that stuff into um AI you can have ai [375] write something that seems pretty [376] customized like it's not like hello dear [379] person I would like to sell you stuff [381] it's like hey Peter you know saw that [382] you went to I don't know like the U OFA [385] um that's super cool I love that you did [387] X Y and Z and this may be totally out of [388] left F but I thought we should connect [390] something like that right it's obviously [391] I'm going to write it way better um but [393] just to give you guys like a give you [394] guys some insight into that process [395] that's basically what everybody is doing [397] right now in any sort of cold Outreach [399] anyway after we have the personalization [401] and all the lead data and the LinkedIn [402] profile URL and basically after we've [404] done these first three steps okay what [406] we need to do is we need to send the [407] Outreach and so I'm going to be using a [409] tool called Phantom Buster to do [411] that and finally we need to do it you [413] know on LinkedIn so I threw in LinkedIn [415] over here um but let me make this clear [417] uh this is a very short moment of time [419] in which you use all of these tools [420] together in the way that I'm about to [421] show you so you know because we have [424] access and availability to these tools [425] we can do the really cool thing that I'm [427] that I'm about to do um if these tools [429] didn't exist you could still do it it' [431] just be like way harder and it' be a lot [432] more difficult so I prefer to use [434] pre-made tools wherever possible just to [435] expedite my workflow that's sort of like [437] my guiding principle here is somebody [438] that does a automation okay all right so [441] Apollo kind of looks like this as you [444] can see it's literally just a database [446] on the left hand side of people okay so [449] hypothetically let's say I want creative [452] agencies I'm just going to type in [453] Creative agency as a keyword this is not [455] the most effective way to do this by the [456] way but I just wanted to show you guys [457] what it looks like and then um under job [459] titles maybe I'll go owner CEO I'll go [463] founder I'll go partner so I'm just [465] typing in like titles of the people that [467] I'm looking for right um okay anyway I'm [470] just going to leave it at that and what [471] do I end up with I end up with 844 [473] creative agencies um in I think I put [476] United States here [478] somewhere maybe I didn't oh yeah [480] location United States cool so that's [482] all Apollo release for I mean I could go [484] into more detail about it I'm not going [485] to just for the purposes of this but [487] essentially we can we can generate a [488] list of people okay and so once I have [491] this list of people the question becomes [492] all right like how do I actually extract [494] something meaningful from this how do I [495] actually like get I don't know an email [496] address how do I get like a LinkedIn [498] profile URL how do I actually you know [499] get their phone number or whatever so [501] normally you know I would export this in [503] Apollo but it costs a ton of money and [505] so instead what we're doing is we're [506] going on a tool called appify which is [507] basically a big library of scrapers that [510] people have put together and we're going [511] to find a tool that allows us to scrape [513] all these so I'm just going to run a [515] proof of concept first before I even [516] build automated systems and I'm just [517] going to run through this whole thing [518] manually um so let's do it let's do [522] Apollo pump that in there and I'm just [525] going to use this one here I think I've [526] used this one many times before so I [529] just want to verify that I have access [530] to it yes I do okay all right so I'm [533] just going to paste this search URL in [534] here this is just how the tool works it [536] costs a120 per a th000 leads so if we [538] want to scrape a th000 leads cost you 20 [540] I should note that you can only do a few [542] um like 100 or 150 LinkedIn connection [545] requests totally cold per week per [546] account so like you can think of this as [548] basically $120 will give you enough [551] money to run this LinkedIn campaign for [553] a whole month um at least in terms of [554] leads you obvious still need to pay for [555] the rest of software platforms but [557] anyway uh here we pump in some search [559] records so 500 search records get work [561] emails get personal emails find whatever [563] I'm going to click save and start and [564] let's just see what happens okay we're [565] running this manually we're not doing [566] any sort of API yet I will I will put [568] the system together in NN after but Okay [572] cool so as we see it's saying it's found [573] 100 results that's [575] cool now it's getting some more if I go [578] to this output tab you can see the [579] actual results pretty neat huh we're [581] getting all these people's data and oh [584] man are there a ton of fields right [586] there are a lot of fields I'm not going [587] to go into detail on all the fields but [589] I'll just show you that you know you can [590] just you can just run these searches um [592] basically free uh which is pretty cool [595] and yeah we just live in a we live in a [597] pretty specific point in time where you [598] can actually do that okay anyway I'm [600] just going to manually export this and [602] I'm going to do it as a CSV why because [604] I just want to visualize this in Google [605] Sheets and now I'm thinking okay like [608] once I visualize it I can actually go [609] through and I can use AI to do some [611] stuff so this is my thought process just [613] trying to narrate it live so we see [615] what's going on I've built out many [616] similar systems like this so obviously [618] because I built similar systems like [619] this I kind of I kind of have a feel for [621] like where things are going but uh I'm [623] just going to import now and then I'm [625] going to go to upload and then drag and [627] drop this file that I just exported and [629] I the reason why is I just want to [630] visualize it and I'm going to go append [631] to current sheet that's just going to [632] allow me to you know I just change the [634] title I don't want to have to redo it [635] all Okay cool so I'm going to hide these [638] so I don't expose every single person's [639] email address but um as we see here we [642] now have a big list with City Country [644] departments Department email domain [646] email status employment um employment [649] you know creative agencies obviously all [651] of these companies have the term [652] creative agency in their title which is [654] great because I'm looking for Creative [655] agencies in this hypothetical um founder [657] and CEO right and we got a ton of other [660] ones too I think um Apollo just exports [662] all of the fields about their job [664] history which is why it's so long so [666] people have had like 10 jobs it'll [667] actually like export all of them good [669] God okay but the one we really the one [671] we really want is we want LinkedIn [674] URL which is this one right here okay [677] and as we see we don't get the LinkedIn [679] URL for everybody but how long is this [683] list um this is is 101 okay it's 101 I'm [689] just going to scroll up and then select [691] all these looks like we got [693] 60 six I guess we're counting that one [696] too so [697] 60 I think it's like 66 out of [700] 100 so we get about 66% of these as [703] LinkedIn profiles which is great um you [705] know if I go down to email I bet you we [707] probably get a ton of emails as well you [709] always got to check the source data [710] which is why I'm doing what I'm [713] doing um we got 77 so we actually got [715] more email addresses than we did [717] LinkedIn profiles that's really [718] interesting but anyway whatever [719] so I'm sure you guys can imagine any [721] sort of Outreach campaign that you guys [722] run you guys could send emails and do [724] LinkedIn DMS right and that's kind of [726] like the golden um the golden egg the [729] Golden Goose that's kind of like the [731] golden goose egg you know if you hit a [733] person on more than one platform then [734] that's obviously ideal um today I'm just [736] going to be building a LinkedIn system [738] that does that Outreach but I want you [739] guys to know that I've built the Omni [741] Channel supposedly that's what they're [743] called Omni Channel scrapers and systems [745] and stuff like that a ton of times um [747] it's it's no major issues at all and um [749] if there's demand for it then I could [750] show you guys how you like kind of [751] combine these two but okay so now we [754] have a lot of stuff right we have [755] profile fields we we we we have [757] everything it's great um so the question [759] is where do we go from here well what I [760] want to do now if we go back to our [761] little road map is now that I've [764] verified we can actually scrape a PO [765] leads using appify manually this little [767] blue check mark is going to mean [768] manually the green one will be after I'm [769] done it Tom automatically we need to [771] enrich the leads with personalization [773] okay what is personalization well we [775] basically need to write like a really [776] small little snippet that we could stick [778] at the very top of our LinkedIn okay so [781] that when somebody gets a connection [783] request you know it's it's just going to [785] be a short little message that says like [786] hey Peter how's it going love your stuff [788] and really want to connect with you okay [790] and that's what we're looking for we're [790] looking for for something over here [792] hello fem Bernard and Anna hopefully you [794] guys appreciate the views um so actually [797] can I just going to show a little bit [799] more here so I could see if I get an [800] example you see this from this lovely [802] dude and now who I think is in my yeah [804] he's in maker school um I think I [805] recognize him he said hey Nick I just [807] join your community of school I'm [807] excited to start this journey okay okay [809] so we we basically want to personalize [811] this just like anel did um although [813] obviously you're not going to be able to [813] say that you joined my community but by [815] doing this there'll be a much higher [816] conversion rate on the back end people [817] are going to be a lot more likely to [818] actually click the accept button if they [820] see a message like you know a lot of [822] these other guys have joined my [822] communities and stuff like that and [824] that's fine um but like you know how [826] much more likely am I to accept a Nels [827] because I see that he's written me that [828] message right a ton that's the same [830] logic we're going to be using all right [832] all right so uh where are we so we just [834] need to determine that we can [835] personalize this but um I know that [837] LinkedIn has specific limits around how [839] long we can do this so LinkedIn [841] connection requests character limit I'm [844] just going to Google this really [846] quickly and it looks like we have a [848] character limit of about 300 characters [849] that's actually pretty that's pretty [850] small eh so okay so 300 characters to [856] words let's see how long that is in [858] words it's between 42 and 75 so it's [861] probably about 50 words or so so we [862] actually got to make sure that our [863] personalization snippet is super super [865] short okay um anyway let me go to GPT [868] for here and let me just Define a little [870] prompt um you are a helpful intelligent [873] writing assistant I'll say your task is [876] to take as input you guys might not be [878] able to see all of this here just [880] because I have my my face sort of [882] covering it I wonder if I can make this [884] smaller no I [886] can't anyway trust me when I say this is [888] going to be the most Banger prompt of [890] all time your task is to take is input a [893] um bunch of LinkedIn profile [898] information of a [900] user and then generate a very short very [905] Punchy ice breaker that I can use as a [909] variable in the introduction in my [912] connection [913] request so I'm just asking it to do [915] stuff like I'd ask a staff member to be [918] honest AI is at that point now where [919] it's intelligent enough to basically [921] fully understand the context uh if you [923] go back to my previous videos from like [924] a year ago things have changed a lot but [926] now you can just ask like you would ask [928] for any from [930] anybody so um return results in this [934] format I'm going to have it return it in [935] Json JavaScript object notation I know [937] this may seem complicated to some people [939] but um this just uh allows me to [941] automate it later and I just want to [942] verify I can do this so return um your [945] results in this format let's say [948] Icebreaker Icebreaker goes [951] here um in order to ensure ice breakers [955] are Punchy and high quality make them [959] follow this [963] template hey X hey [968] name L seeing thing about [976] them I'm also into [979] other [982] thing plausible tie [987] in thought [989] I connect okay so now I'm just going to [993] see the length of this I'm going to go [994] to a website called word counter so this [996] one's 12 words right that's easy and I [998] think it's actually going to be even [1000] better because if I just scroll down [1001] here you see how um yeah you see how [1004] this message is like basically also [1005] about 12 words or so so this is going to [1007] appear right before the C more badge I [1009] think it's going to be great this is [1010] going to be super super valuable so um [1013] yeah that's what I'm going to do um so [1015] I'm going to I'm going to add this [1017] in and then I'm going to say linked [1021] in fields and I'm actually going to give [1024] it like an example of the data that I [1025] wanted to personalize based off of and [1027] then I'm going to see how it performs [1029] and then assuming all the stuff is good [1030] then I'm just going to pump it into n8n [1032] like one shot and it's going to be [1033] perfect and by the way um this kind of [1035] this is a good opportunity for me to [1036] talk a little bit about why I'm doing [1037] all this stuff like manually is supposed [1039] to going Inn and the reason why is [1041] because um I'm sure I could make it look [1042] really sexy and clean if I just did it [1044] all on end and end but I don't normally [1046] actually build systems like this I will [1047] start by just doing it manually at least [1048] once and just verifying that kind of [1050] looks the way that I think it's going to [1051] look and works the way that I want it to [1053] look works the way I want it to work and [1054] then assuming that it does then I pump [1056] it into n8n and then you know actually [1058] work through the the automation bits [1060] because the way I see it there's the use [1061] case and then there's the automation of [1063] the use case Okay so that might provide [1066] a little bit more context and hopefully [1067] that uh makes things clear but okay so [1069] we just need to feed in a bunch of [1070] fields here that' be relevant so what [1073] are we going to do obviously we're going [1075] to need the name right so I'm just going [1076] to grab [1077] Danielle um who is row number [1082] four [1084] um just go Morgan [1087] here then I'm just going to dump it all [1089] in in plain text [1092] okay let's just [1094] go Fort [1098] Lauderdale [1100] okay like this um that's probably pretty [1104] relevant DM creative agency it's [1107] probably pretty relevant founder and CEO [1110] so maybe I'll go founder and CEO at DM [1112] creative agency [1114] cool what else is like interesting and [1116] unique about [1118] her employment [1121] history um I guess I could include it [1123] but let me just see if there's anything [1124] else that might be a little bit better [1125] than employment history I'm just going [1126] to drag this all the way to the [1129] right Florida H okay so I mean really I [1133] don't have too much information here I [1135] really only have like the company name [1137] um [1139] though it looks like a bunch of [1140] interests about the or sorry keywords [1142] about the organization I might be able [1143] to feed that in [1146] there [1149] um okay well I think in that case like [1151] I'm going to have to feed in some of the [1152] past employment history right that makes [1154] sense um and that way my um you know my [1159] Outreach can talk about like you know [1162] it's I like that you went from doing [1165] like sales at whatever to being a a [1168] founder of your own company that must be [1170] interesting or or I did something [1171] similar or whatever right like that's [1173] basically the vibe I want to go [1175] for previous [1179] experience um and then I'm just going to [1181] say Outlast [1183] eyewear and then sorry I I'm jumping [1186] around a lot here but then I will say [1187] account [1189] director [1191] at man I cannot get these all tabs right [1194] at Red NY okay and then I'm going to [1197] have it generate me the breaker now hey [1200] Danielle love seeing your journey from [1201] Regional sales director to founder I'm [1202] also in a creative leadership thought I [1203] connect that's that's okay that's okay I [1206] don't really like the usage of the [1207] keywords here Regional sales director I [1209] want um I don't want to use the [1211] variables exactly because I want to [1213] imply that I've actually like read [1214] through it so either I will lowercase [1216] them or I'm going to paraphrase [1220] them [1222] okay make sure to follow this template [1224] so what I'm going to do here is I'm just [1225] going to zoom out a bit I'm going to go [1227] over here and edit the [1231] prompt for thing about [1234] them and [1236] plausible plausible tie in never use the [1240] exact [1243] variable um never use the exact [1246] information provided in a LinkedIn field [1249] instead always [1251] paraphrase this makes it seem human [1253] written instead of just an AI or an [1257] automated message let's do that okay I'm [1259] going to delete this and we'll just run [1260] it one more [1263] time okay and I'm also going to provide [1265] a little bit more context now CU I don't [1266] like the [1267] result what we had is hey Daniel I love [1269] seeing your entrepreneurial Journey with [1270] DM creative agency I'm also passionate [1272] about turning Vision it's funny DM [1273] creative agency I guess it's your name [1275] but like I'm I'm about to DM the hell [1278] out of this person I'm also passionate [1279] about turning Vision into reality [1281] thought I connect that seems kind of [1282] weird I don't like that so what I'm [1284] going to do is I'm just going to like [1285] make it super incredibly punchy [1290] also make it super short don't say stuff [1298] like or anything like that be extremely [1301] laconic laconic and Spartan okay let's [1306] try that one more time well let's try [1308] that a couple more times so we figure it [1311] out cool yeah this this looks pretty [1313] good right spotting your creative agency [1315] Journey I'm also into entrepreneurial [1316] Ventures thought I connect I mean you [1318] know it's not like the best in the whole [1319] wide world but that's much better than [1320] before diving into brand Innovation [1322] thought I'd connect cool that's pretty [1324] good let's run this [1326] again startup life that's great see [1328] that's a pretty good Icebreaker building [1331] Brands thought I'd connect cool that [1332] seems pretty reasonable all right cool [1335] so I think like four out of the five so [1336] far have been all right fascinated by [1337] startups all right I think like four out [1339] of the five are pretty good so I'm just [1340] going to leave it at that that seems to [1341] me like a pretty good prompt which means [1343] like my next kind of major task in this [1345] system is done right um the last thing [1348] I'm going to do is I'm going to send [1349] this to Phantom Buster for LinkedIn DMS [1350] now this is this is kind of interesting [1352] a little bit more Nuance but basically [1354] what we have to do now is we have to [1355] take all of this data and we have to [1356] like send it to the platform that we're [1357] going to be using to actually like [1358] trigger the Outreach now that platform [1360] is called Phantom Buster the way the [1362] Phantom Buster works is you basically [1363] pay for um some execution time just a [1366] fancy way of saying that you're paying [1367] for like the amount of time it takes for [1369] the servers to run I'm going to go over [1372] here to this um specific one that I've [1374] put together called LinkedIn autoconnect [1376] and when I build out the whole NN system [1377] in a second I'll um you know I'll rename [1379] it and I'll make it nice and sexy but [1381] basically way that it works is I go to [1382] setup and then what I have to do is I [1384] have to define a a Google sheet and I'll [1386] actually have it go down my Google sheet [1388] okay so I'm going to do that and then [1390] I'm just going to add a column here [1392] called ice breaker okay then I'm just [1395] going to make this like one one person [1397] it's just going to be this person that I [1398] was just doing the testing on which I [1400] think was here right so I'm going to [1402] delete these two and I'm actually just [1404] going to delete all the rest of these as [1407] well because I just wanted to pull [1409] literally one record okay so that's cool [1412] I know I have a ton of redundant fields [1414] and whatever but that's fine um and then [1416] under Icebreaker what I'm going to do is [1417] I'm just going to feed in this um the [1420] data that it just generated for [1422] me I'm going to paste that in here and [1426] then voila okay great so now we have an [1427] icebreaker now the reason why I'm doing [1429] this is because I can now grab this [1430] Google [1431] sheet and I can feed it in here [1435] okay and now I can actually run this [1440] using just feed that in I can actually [1442] run like I can actually go and I can do [1444] um some LinkedIn Outreach basically the [1446] way that Phantom Buster works is you [1448] will connect your LinkedIn account using [1450] a um little Phantom Buster Chrome [1452] extension which they will ask you to [1453] download when you actually get up and [1454] running with the service um and then [1456] from there you know I'll just click save [1459] and then here is the message that I will [1460] write now I'm just going to write um [1462] they allow you to write a bunch of [1464] things I mean you could say hey first [1466] name right then it'll pull the first [1467] name variable but you know I've actually [1469] just had AI write me a whole thing right [1471] so I'm just going to use that whole [1472] thing which is called Icebreaker okay [1475] all right so now I'm going to click save [1477] uh I'm not going to do anything for [1478] email Discovery I don't care about that [1479] they just try and upsell you on stuff [1481] invitations to send per launch maximum [1483] 10 per launch then save then launch [1486] manually whenever I click on it and now [1488] I'm I you know again I'm starting at the [1490] end just want to make sure I can [1491] actually do the thing that I'm asking [1492] for so I'm going to click the start [1493] button and once we verified that we can [1496] worry about um you know running it [1499] completely automatically so what are we [1501] seeing we're seeing that I am indeed [1503] connecting to the LinkedIn I'm connected [1506] as [1507] Nick I'm going through the whole rigma [1509] rooll [1510] here signing up opening sending the DM [1514] and stuff like [1515] that it's going to take a while because [1517] it wants to um basically like simulate [1521] real profile activity doesn't want to [1523] think doesn't want to make LinkedIn [1525] think that I'm like a like a bot or [1526] whatever so it's going to take I think [1528] like a minute or two per profile okay [1530] and as we can see it just updated to one [1532] invitation already stent still pending [1534] that means that the invitation is [1535] actually gone out um so we are now 100% [1537] good to go we verified that all of this [1539] system or all of what I wanted to do [1541] with this system works now I'm actually [1543] going to go through and I'm going to [1544] build it live in nadn how fun and [1546] exciting is that never forget this step [1548] when you're actually building out [1549] systems make sure you can do the thing [1551] manually before you do it automatically [1553] otherwise you're putting the car before [1554] the horse I've seen a ton of people do [1556] this and just really waste all their [1558] time with it so I have an end canvas [1560] here called LinkedIn connection request [1561] system if you think about it what do we [1563] have to do okay we have to start this [1566] system by scraping Apollo leads using [1569] appify Okay um one thing that I think is [1572] really fun that I think I'm going to do [1573] today just forits and Googles is um this [1577] URL here this actually includes all the [1580] information of the of the search right [1583] so what I think I'm going to do is I'm [1584] actually just going to AI generate this [1586] URL for me like that' be pretty sweet [1588] right I'm seeing owner person titles [1590] equals CEO person titles equal founder [1592] I'm just going to go um what can you [1594] tell me about this URL feed this whole [1597] thing in here and let's see if we can [1598] just extract all the [1601] data yeah so our located in the US owner [1603] CEO founder partner creative [1606] agency cool cool so I mean like I'm just [1608] going to have ai do this I mean how cool [1609] would it be if you could just say hey I [1610] want you to find me a list of all the [1611] creative agency owners in Texas and [1613] California or something that'd be sweet [1615] right and then we just like have it done [1616] for us hell yeah so I'm going to go over [1618] here and I'm actually going to start it [1621] with an nadn form input okay and that's [1623] how this is going to work when a new [1624] nadn form input is done let's call this [1627] lead finder uh LinkedIn lead Outreach [1633] trigger insert a an audience for your [1638] LinkedIn lead Outreach let's say [1641] LinkedIn Outreach campaign here then [1644] here I'm just going to do like text area [1645] and I'm going to say [1648] describe your audience in plain [1653] English I'll make it required and then [1655] what I want is a [1657] placeholder audience typ uh I don't [1662] know [1666] company let's do [1669] like company type location [1673] Etc that should be good okay let's test [1676] this step now and I'll say I want all [1680] creative agencies in the United [1683] States with company sizes between 1 to [1686] 1,000 that's what I want okay I'll click [1690] submit and now that I have this I'm [1692] actually going to feed this into AI just [1694] right off the bat so go open AI we'll go [1696] message an assistant credential Li us is [1699] February 4th YouTube from the list uh I [1702] think I'll just use oh sorry I think I'm [1703] messaging an assistant I don't actually [1705] want to do that I just want to do text [1706] my bad so message a model I think what [1708] I'm going to do here is I'll just do GPT [1710] 4.5 I just want to see how like smart it [1712] is um you're a helpful intelligent sales [1717] assistant so I'm defining a system [1719] prompt start that's where I tell the [1720] model what I think it is identifying as [1722] what I like it to identify as then [1724] underneath I'm going to say your task is [1726] to take as input [1729] a a natural language description of [1735] um of a prospect audience [1738] turn that into an [1740] Apollo search URL here's an example of [1744] an Apollo search [1746] URL okay and then I'm going to go back [1749] to [1752] this and I'll say this URL oh geez I [1757] don't like [1759] that this URL describes a search for [1764] people that [1765] are let's do located so I'm just telling [1767] it now that um this is an example of [1771] formatting [1777] basically you can [1780] change those fields and only those [1784] fields return your response in Json [1788] using this format let's do Apollo let's [1791] just call it search URL then I'll go [1794] search URL goes here nice then down at [1797] the very bottom this output content is [1799] Jason I'm not going to add another [1800] message [1802] and let's just pin this now and add end [1805] so we can do some testing with [1809] it go right over [1812] here and let's see what it pops up when [1814] I when I paste this in and let's see if [1815] this is a valid Apollo search URL I mean [1817] you know it's kind of like the first [1818] thing that you got to figure out right [1828] I paste this into [1831] Apollo yeah this has wow oh this even [1834] broke down like the search size that's [1835] very cool um United States uh I'm not [1838] seeing any keywords though that's an [1840] issue so I think like the way that I I [1843] always do these searches with a keyword [1844] like creative agency [1847] um I think there's something broken [1851] here just want to make sure if I delete [1853] all these yeah we're still not getting [1855] hide filters show filters okay so [1857] there's some some broken about the way [1858] that I did this list a moment ago [1861] so let me just do this one more time [1868] um let's do [1872] this let's just Define my search a [1874] little bit more over here because I want [1875] to give it more [1878] examples we'll go one to [1882] 200 and then we're going to go creative [1885] agency and I'm going to tell it it can [1887] only [1894] these are the fields you can [1896] change um and I'm going to say [1899] organization [1903] locations um [1906] keywords Associated keywords sorry one [1908] sec [1911] keywords and person titles [1921] cool do not add or change any other [1924] fields return your okay let's test this [1926] now and let's see if that maybe is a [1927] valid [1931] search uh no no no do I not add or [1933] change any other fields use the above [1935] template well actually maybe this is [1937] good let me [1940] try all right yeah that did work [1944] location number of employees seem a [1945] little bit off though [1948] oh yeah sorry I think I need to add [1949] number of employees here um one [1953] more let's go back to where it says [1955] number of employees up at the top so [1958] organization numb employees ranges there [1960] we go that was the secret [1963] sauce person titles and organization [1966] numb employees [1969] ranges let's just go back to my [1973] search just copy this in [1976] here I'll paste that in too okay now I'm [1979] going to run a test and I think I should [1980] be able to get most of what the [1982] information is that I [1984] want um if I just copy this now and [1987] paste this [1988] in okay this search correctly had the 1 [1990] to 1000 correctly had the United States [1992] correctly had the term creative agency [1993] looks good to me man cool so we now have [1995] a system that can basically you just put [1996] in a search term for what you want it'll [1998] come out with an Apollo search URL [2000] that's sick okay so now what do we have [2002] to do um we have to scrape the leads [2005] using appify so two components to this [2007] right the first is we need [2009] to well we need to call an appify actor [2013] so we basically need to replicate what I [2014] just did over here with an appify but we [2016] need to do it in naad so how are we [2018] going to do that well apify has an API [2022] so I should be able to run this using an [2025] API so if I want to trigger a [2029] run [2031] um I'm going to have [2034] to view the API reference first [2038] so how do we get a run run actor run [2040] actor synchronously with input and [2043] return output okay so this looks to me [2044] like basically what I want cool thing [2046] about n8n is it allows me to just create [2048] a uh a request using an HTTP call so [2052] sorry a curl call so that's what I'm [2054] going to do is see it says curl over [2055] here I'm just going to copy this whole [2056] thing but actually before I do that I'm [2057] actually going to put in the the data so [2059] I need an HTT um I need a key it looks [2062] like like an API key so I'm need to put [2063] that in there then I'm going to need an [2065] actor okay so see this is is where I'm [2067] going to put an actor in so I'm going to [2070] go back here and you see where it says [2072] actors and then JJ whatever this is the [2075] actor ID um you'll always find the actor [2078] ID up at the top [2080] um between the term actors and then [2083] input on [2084] appify uh there's probably another way [2086] that I could get this as well but that's [2087] just kind of the hack that I use so I'm [2089] going to go sorry I'm going to go back [2091] over here and now what I'm going to do [2093] is under parameters I'm going to feed in [2094] the actor ID okay and the barer token i [2097] b Bally need an API key so I don't know [2099] where I get my API key on up if I've [2101] already forgotten I'll probably get it [2102] in settings API and Integrations yeah [2104] okay so I'm going to create a new token [2105] I'll call this YouTube and create I now [2108] have a new token so I'm going to copy [2110] this and I'm going to go back to the API [2112] specification which was just docs ii.com [2115] then I'm going to paste in the beer [2118] token okay that looks pretty good it [2121] looks like I need a body okay it's this [2123] example from schema or example so I [2125] don't really know what that means um [2129] just body required as an object so what [2131] is what is this supposed to mean just [2133] looking for the term body here [2136] now well it's telling me that it's [2144] required [2148] so I'm just going to give this a try and [2150] see what happens I [2152] guess let me just yeah let me just copy [2154] over all the [2155] curl go back here and Go to http request [2160] import curl paste this [2163] in it should Now map this so Maps it to [2165] the specific actor that's [2167] cool um I don't actually have my token [2170] in here so apologies I kind of wasted [2172] our time I'm just going to copy this now [2175] and feed it directly in so this is where [2177] the API key token would go go [2178] authorization and then there's this [2179] format like Bearer token format which is [2182] what most um services use so just make [2184] sure the bearer starts with a B capital [2186] and then there's a space in there's your [2187] actual [2189] token okay so we need to do a post [2191] request good uh Jason body parameters [2195] are Foo and bar I don't really know [2196] we're going to feed in the body to be [2198] honest I don't really know about this [2199] follow redirect thing either so I'm just [2201] going to take that out I think what we [2203] need to we need some query parameters [2206] right I [2208] think maybe we don't I don't know anyway [2212] in situations like this where I don't [2213] know what I do is I just run it and I [2214] see what happens and then sometimes [2216] it'll tell me what the issue is [2218] so input. URL is required okay so we [2220] need in the body probably we need [2225] input [2228] um I'm just going to do this in [2231] Json I'm going to go [2233] input and then I'm going to go [2237] URL [2239] okay so then I'm going to go over to my [2241] sales Navigator search [2243] URL which is right over here [2248] uh nope that kind of stuck at the very [2250] bottom just take that back in paste this [2252] in here okay so that should now [2254] have the URL uh field input. now it's [2258] still saying that it's required so [2259] there's probably something that I'm um [2260] persistently messing up here with the [2262] format so let me go back to my actor run [2264] okay go back here and then sorry where [2267] it says Jason let me just get all this [2269] okay this this might be all I need I [2271] don't know for sure we're going to give [2272] it a try [2274] though we're going to test this [2278] yeah so that is so the Json here is just [2279] the input because you know it's [2281] executing it's taking time now so now I [2284] don't actually know if it's running [2285] right so I'm just exit out of this stuff [2287] I'm GNA go to runs Okay cool so it is [2289] running so now verify that I've I've [2290] just triggered it inside of app uh [2292] inside of nadn and now it's running in [2294] appify fantastic so basically what I [2296] need to do is you see this big URL here [2299] well we don't need that what we need is [2300] we need this right I'm going to feed [2301] this in and total records uh I mean you [2304] know you can put however many you want [2305] I'm just going to do a thousand if you [2307] leave that blank I think you get all of [2308] them personal emails work emails I think [2310] this just means it takes a little bit [2312] longer then while this is working let me [2314] just do some renaming so I'll say run [2317] appify actor and get results a little [2320] bit longer than usual uh [ __ ] I think I [2323] might have just broken [2324] this yeah I think I just broke this by [2327] renaming it okay maybe you don't rename [2329] this live that might be bad anyway um [2333] I'm then going to call this p uh not [2335] personalize I'm gener search [2339] URL okay I'm going to save this whole [2342] thing I'm obviously going to have to [2343] rerun this now because I've just broken [2345] my whole thing kind of [2348] unfortunate but it is what it is [2353] um let's just test the step again and [2355] I'm just going to pin the output next [2358] time so let's just make sure this [2361] works feed that in again yeah [2363] persistently working which is nice can [2366] pin this now let's feed that in right [2369] over here test this again so my memory [2372] limit may be an issue we'll see it's [2375] executing so yeah we're running a [2376] separate we're running a separate query [2377] I'm going to abort the first one I'm not [2379] going to give it 30 seconds I don't care [2381] I'm aborting [2382] you um cool and now we just have to wait [2386] until this finishes basically until we [2387] get all the results and then when we get [2389] the results it should populate on the [2390] right hand side of this okay looks like [2392] this did output but it returned [2394] something empty looks like the reason [2396] why is I probably used the wrong um [2398] actor I used run actor synchronously and [2401] return output I didn't do run actor [2403] synchronously with input and get data [2405] set items that's the one that you want [2406] so wo is me um but I'll basically have [2410] to rerun that puppy is what it is um I [2413] have the actor ID hardcoded here so I'm [2415] just going to paste this in my URL bar [2417] copy this over here paste this in here [2421] and go back that way and then just for [2423] records I got to do 500 cuz I just [2425] waited like 5 minutes to do 1,000 [2428] and I don't really want to wait that [2429] long so let's test this [2432] again I'm seeing that it is indeed [2434] executing going back over here to [2437] runs and you know we are we are now [2439] doing a run which is nice um yeah looks [2443] like the run is running okay great and [2446] that looks like it just wrapped up we [2448] got 500 items because I went back and I [2451] Chang the number of total items to 500 [2454] um and now we basically have everything [2456] that we need in order to proceed with [2457] and then complete this whole flow and as [2460] you can see not super complicated we had [2463] one form submission one module or node [2466] to generate a search URL and one module [2468] or node to run an app IFI actor and then [2469] get the results and because I never ever [2471] want to have to do that I again I'm just [2472] going to pin this and what I'm thinking [2473] is by me pinning this I'm just not going [2476] to have to run that same actor over and [2478] over and over again I'm not going to [2479] have to like have those crazy weight [2480] times that's an important point for me [2482] to make more generally like um I find a [2484] lot of people they will um test stuff [2487] using like repeat manual inputs over and [2490] over and over again so if they're [2491] testing a form or something they'll [2492] actually fill out the form every time [2494] and it doesn't seem like that adds a lot [2495] to the process but consider I might test [2497] a flow 20 times over the course of my [2499] development if I test 20 times and every [2500] time takes me additional minute to fill [2502] out the form I basically like added 20 [2504] minutes to my whole workflow right and [2506] as you see I build these pretty simple [2508] but very high Roi systems like over the [2509] course of an hour or so in a video um if [2511] I were do that I would materially [2513] improve increase my production times um [2515] impacting them like 20 30 Maybe 40% so I [2518] just like to pin data wherever possible [2520] helps avoid like a lot of the BS okay [2523] now that I have this appify actor um [2525] output we we've got a bunch of items [2527] here I'm going to go back to my road map [2529] what do you really need to do well next [2532] up is we need to enrich these leads with [2533] personalization so that's going to be [2535] pretty easy you know why because we've [2536] already done most of the [2538] work I'm going to go to open Ai and then [2540] I'll go message a model okay and then if [2543] you guys remember I already I already [2544] wrote most of this prompt so I'm just [2545] going to copy and paste this prompt [2547] right over here so I'm going to select [2550] my own credential if you don't have a [2551] credential make sure to set it up you [2553] need to just copy over your um opena API [2556] key I'll select GPT [2559] 4.5 I'll paste this in as my system [2562] prompt and then I'll just move [2564] down and copy all of this as my user [2567] prompt okay I'll make a couple of [2571] changes why because I don't actually [2573] need these lines and [2576] stuff what I can do is I can actually [2577] just take this and feed this in as an [2579] additional user prompt [2581] instead and here I can feed in an [2583] assistant prompt have it give me an [2586] example right because I want it [2589] to then I can go back here feed in [2591] another user prompt and then this is [2593] going to be my actual live data right so [2596] what information did I put in I put [2597] first [2599] name so I will do first name here oh [2603] that's ugly one sec I'm going to go to [2606] expression paste this in and I'm going [2608] to call this linked in fields you can [2611] you know actually add all of the [2613] information [2615] and [2616] um like in Jason if you want but it it [2619] doesn't really make any difference right [2620] and doing this I get to save a couple of [2622] uh tokens which may not make that big of [2625] a difference in isolation but it does [2628] definitely make a big difference um if [2630] you zoom out a little bit and like look [2631] at it over the course of I don't know a [2634] month of running this a year of running [2635] this system so I need to find the city [2638] is it City I think it's City okay so [2639] City's Grand Rapid so I'm just going to [2642] grab this [2643] here paste this in right there then what [2647] I need next I need job [2650] title go title creative director that's [2654] cool at and then the company [2658] name what is the current company name [2661] headwind agency it looks like the um [2664] employer employment history zero is [2665] always that then previous [2668] experience and then I'm going to go [2672] co-founder [2673] coo at Mission 3 media that's [2679] cool um let's do one [2682] more we'll [2684] say producer at self-employed at least [2688] for this [2689] guy um feed that in okay great so what [2692] does this look like now LinkedIn Fields [2694] Grand whatever Grand Rapids okay very [2697] nice selfemployed beautiful beautiful [2699] I'm then going to Output my content as [2701] Json go test step and from here our [2704] output should generate some cool [2707] personalization that we can then also [2709] map directly because it'll be on Jason [2711] variable should note that I'm using 4.5 [2713] preview for this you don't need to be [2714] using 4.5 preview I just like to use the [2716] best models for stuff why I don't know [2719] it's a flex I like flexing see these [2722] muscles just screwing around this one's [2724] taking a little bit longer than usual uh [2726] might be because of token [2727] usage or something on my account I'm not [2729] entirely sure so when I run into issues [2731] like [2733] this just going to see if I could stop [2735] this doesn't look like I [2737] can okay cool I did end up stopping this [2740] maybe I'm just going to use okay let me [2742] just try rerunning this now with that [2745] test [2747] data okay once that's done we've enich [2749] lead personalizations then we just have [2750] to send a phantom Buster and the way [2752] that we're going to do the the sending [2753] to Phantom Buster is I'm going to um [2756] just connect to their API and I'll send [2757] like an API request trigger with the uh [2760] with the Google sheet that I'm dumping [2761] to so actually there's an intermediary [2763] step here where I need to dump stuff to [2764] a Google sheet which I haven't really [2765] put together um but we'll we'll talk [2767] about that maybe actually I guess what I [2769] should do then I should probably dump [2772] leads to Google sheet right then four [2775] should be sent to Phantom Buster send [2777] sheet to Phantom Buster for LinkedIn DMS [2780] right trigger Phantom Buster for [2782] LinkedIn DMS that's probably what I'm [2784] going to do and I mean this now looks [2786] kind of weird weird but copy and paste [2788] that everywhere yeah this is taken its [2790] sweet ass time so I'm not really sure [2792] what's going on with that but as I'm [2794] sure you guys know um a lot of the time [2797] when you make an automation there will [2799] be platform bugs or some minor issue [2801] with the nodes or the modules I'm going [2803] to just change this model and see if [2805] that makes it snap out of it so we're [2808] just going to go GPT [2810] 40 and then I'm going to test [2813] this uh actually looks like I have a [2814] bunch of additional new lines here I [2817] don't know why should probably remove [2820] that check this out here as well no [2823] that's fine how about this one this one [2825] have any additional new [2826] LS can't really drag it open which is [2829] unfortunate I gu have to give it a [2831] click well looks pretty good yeah no [2834] problems [2836] there oh [ __ ] man I'm so stupid it's [2839] because I'm doing 500 items duh oh my [2842] God I'm probably racking up my man [2844] that's crazy okay so what I need to do [2846] is I put up put Max items here just set [2848] max items to one that way it's only [2850] going to generate one ice breaker I was [2852] trying to erroneously generate 500 ice [2854] breakers don't be silly or stupid like [2857] me anyway now that that's [2859] done uh we verify that this does in fact [2862] work I can go back over here now and I [2864] could go and I could check enrich leads [2866] with personalizations duh okay next up [2869] we need to dump this to a Google sheet [2871] so what am I going to do I'm going to go [2872] to Sheets right over here going to [2877] um append row and Sheet I'm going to [2880] select my credential I already have one [2882] called YouTube but in your case you [2883] might have to like connect it and do [2884] your ooth and stuff then the operation [2886] is just going to be aend row I'm just [2887] going to be adding these to a new sheet [2889] right append or update a row sorry I'm [2892] going to make a new sheet so we'll go [2894] sheets. goole.com and then what I'm [2896] going to do is I'm just going to go to [2898] my account which I know has a connection [2899] which is this one [2900] here I'm going to create a new one this [2903] is just going to be called leads um I'm [2906] going to go to docum [2908] look up leads see if we can find [2910] something I can the sheet I'm going to [2913] choose from is just going to be sheet [2914] one we're going to map each column [2916] manually no can we just map [2917] automatically that'd be great just dump [2920] literally oh no we can't because we're [2923] only going to dump in this stuff then [2926] [Music] [2928] right I wonder can I just grab [2936] I would like to have all of this [2938] information automatically in the Google [2940] sheet without me having to manually add [2944] every um manually add everything [2948] otherwise I'm going to have to manually [2949] add everything that'd be [2952] brutal yeah that'd be kind of kind of [2958] crazy The Columns in Google Sheets oh I [2960] get it I get I need to set column names [2964] here okay so what I'm going to do is I'm [2966] just going to set these column [2970] names create a [2973] CSV of these header [2976] names see string of these header names [2979] that I can paste into Google Sheets just [2981] going to paste this in and then what I [2983] want is I want LinkedIn [2985] URL and then I also want [2988] Icebreaker and I mean you can put in as [2990] much of this information as you want all [2991] of this additional information I don't [2993] really want to I just want to just you [2994] know get this up and running so that's [2996] what I'm going to be using as an [2999] example so this now has all of the [3002] sheets it's telling me that one of the [3003] headers is twice so I'm just going to go [3005] to data and then I'll go split text to [3006] columns so I have two yeah I do have two [3009] instances of LinkedIn URL that's okay [3011] I'm going to go over here and now I have [3013] my leads sheet which is nice I'm going [3014] to go back and now I'm going to go map [3016] each column [3019] manually and then it's going to match on [3023] ID what I want to do is can I just [3025] actually maybe I can going map each [3027] automatically I don't [3030] know I don't know if this is right so [3032] let's just give this a test see what [3036] happens just supposed to be adding a [3038] single Row in [3041] here and it's not um and the reason why [3046] is because it's grabbing data from the [3049] open AI node instead of the previous uh [3051] limit node which is what I want so I'm [3053] actually going to map each column [3054] manually it's going to find all the ones [3056] for for me then what I want is um under [3059] this I'm going to use ID for ID first [3062] name's obviously going to be frank last [3063] name is going to be whatever um name is [3066] going to be full name I guess let me [3068] see first name then LinkedIn URL so I [3071] need to find the LinkedIn URL [3076] somewhere should be right over here then [3078] what else did we have [3080] title let's go [3084] title email _ step I don't really know [3087] why I put that in there but [3089] whatever basically just mapping a bunch [3091] of irrelevant Fields right now just to [3093] show you guys what the process would [3094] look like then finally Icebreaker the [3096] Icebreaker would be the um message from [3098] the open AI node right okay so now we're [3099] going to test [3102] this giving it a go see the icons [3104] changed here and voila right we've now [3106] dumped in the records that's nice so now [3108] that we have this Google sheet what does [3109] this mean for us well we can actually [3110] just take this Google [3111] sheet I'm going to go editor maybe I'll [3114] change it to viewer actually I don't [3116] really want you to uh somebody always on [3119] from my YouTube somebody will always [3121] find some of my sheets and then like [3123] come in and then just like draw dicks on [3124] them or something it's it's hilarious [3126] whoever you are or whatever group of [3128] people you are keep fighting the good [3129] fight I'm just going to uh I'm gonna [3131] start locking these down a little bit [3133] more okay so that's that now that I have [3135] this Google sheet what I do is I just go [3136] into Phantom Buster okay right over here [3140] I'm going to you know I go to LinkedIn [3143] Solutions LinkedIn and then down here I [3145] go connection request or [3150] Auto and it'll be an autoc connection [3152] sender [3154] essentially so I don't know where this [3157] is somewhere [3161] here might be connect request Auto [3165] invitation [3169] maybe autoconnect there we go this one [3172] here so I'm going to use [3174] this what I'm going to do is I'll change [3176] the input into a spreadsheet URL so now [3178] I'm going to paste the spreadsheet URL [3180] in okay the value of this is It's [3182] publicly accessible then from here the [3184] name of the column containing profile [3186] URL is going to be this LinkedIn URL one [3188] I'm going to keep all of these [3190] columns in my output file because I'm [3192] I'm going to want [3194] them now I then select my LinkedIn [3196] account so in my case I'm going to [3197] select this one here and I should note [3199] that if you want to send the LinkedIn um [3201] messages with like the um customized [3204] connection requests uh I think to any [3206] that's not like a a second connection or [3208] something you need a you need a LinkedIn [3210] sales Navigator [3211] subscription now I have everything that [3213] I need I can just go ice breaker right [3215] so that's what I'm going to be sending [3216] people I go back to [3220] save going to click none for this [3223] behavior I'm going to do 10 per [3226] launch then I'll just leave this at [3229] manual and I'm going to rename this [3232] now Auto Icebreaker connect and voila [3238] now what I'm going to do is I'm going to [3238] grab the ID of the Phantom which is [3240] going to be up here okay and now I have [3242] to do an API call basically to trigger [3243] this so we need to go to Phantom Buster [3246] and check their [3247] API how do we do [3250] this uh we go up here sorry up here [3253] there we go and I think the I don't I [3256] don't know for sure I'm thinking it's [3258] probably agent and it looks like they [3261] have a V2 APS that's what I'm going to [3262] use I'll go to [3264] agent agent launch probably yeah yeah [3268] this is the [3269] one then I'm going to grab a curl is [3272] there a curl yeah there's a curl right [3273] over here so I'm going to copy this [3276] over if I just try this am I going to [3278] run canot validate data should have [3281] required property ID oh yeah ID of the [3282] agent to launch there we go if I feed [3284] this oh yeah okay so what I'm going to [3286] do is I'm going to go to my LinkedIn [3288] agent and then I'm going to grab the um [3290] the phantom ID which is up here I'm [3292] going to paste it in and that's going to [3293] now include that data if I click try now [3296] should 200 and then if I go back here [3297] it's probably running now right yeah [3299] it's running sick cool so we just verify [3301] that we can actually now run [3303] this now is it possible to abort this [3305] mid-run because I don't actually want to [3308] connect to LinkedIn and do all that fun [3309] stuff uh it is cool so what I'm going to [3312] do now is I'm going [3313] to just recreate my HTTP CW request I'm [3318] going to go back to the API copy this [3321] curl request go back to nadn import curl [3324] paste this in it's now going to [3326] automatically map all of these [3329] fields then if I scroll down I have my [3331] Phantom Buster key on Phantom Buster you [3333] need to create an API key so you just go [3335] over here to API Keys you click create [3337] API key and then voila you have another [3339] one and then I'm just going to delete [3340] the one afterwards but you can only copy [3341] it once um basically so make sure to [3343] copy it when you can then feed it in as [3346] an x- phantombuster dkey API key up here [3350] the ID of the specific agent is right [3352] over here I mean it's just mapped all [3353] correctly and now I'm just going to [3354] click test step [3357] and it's executing now Phantom Buster [3359] won't return um a note saying that like [3361] you're good to go it's just going to [3362] return a 200 and say container ID the [3365] reason why is because they allow you to [3366] check on your container ID later so what [3368] you realistically could do okay is you [3371] could have a container [3374] ID you could have a web hook sent to [3377] another scenario or another node another [3380] workflow you can check that you could [3382] use that to update this record saying [3384] sent question mark and then we can go [3386] down one by one so that's what I'm going [3388] to do so I'm just going to rename this [3390] now to trigger Phantom [3393] Buster agent just so I have this and [3396] then over here it's going to be add to [3399] Google sheet wonderful this here was um [3403] personalize [3404] Outreach and now that we have everything [3407] all we need now is we need a web hook [3408] trigger that basically triggers another [3410] portion of this flow so a variety of [3412] different things we could do [3415] um what I'm going to do is I'm just [3416] going to add a separate node or a [3418] separate workflow I'll say trigger [3421] Phantom Buster [3425] agent so I'm going to go number one then [3429] I'm going to have another number two and [3431] that number two is going to basically [3432] watch for the completed [3434] run I'm start with a web hook I'm going [3438] to paste the title in I'll call this two [3441] and then instead of trigger Phantom [3442] Buster agent it's going to be update [3444] Google sheet with Phantom Buster connect [3448] requests these are getting pretty long [3450] so you can call the stuff whatever the [3452] hell you want but now what I have to do [3454] is I have to figure out how to send a [3455] web hook I know that you could send a [3456] web hook somehow so I'm going to go back [3458] to [3459] dashboard go back here and there's got [3461] to be a way to send a web hook [3464] right advanced settings probably yes [3466] there it is web hook cool custom web [3468] hook URL so now I'm going to go into [3470] naad I have a little web hook set up and [3474] what I'm going to do is um [3476] [Music] [3477] looks like web hooks will post a payload [3479] when they post a payload that just means [3481] that in order for you to receive it in N [3483] end you need to change the HTTP method [3484] to post okay if it's get you're not [3487] going to get anything it's just going to [3488] hang forever so we're posting the [3490] payload it's going to have everything [3492] here with a container ID this is [3494] probably what we're going to use to um [3497] to get the data now that I'm thinking [3498] about [3500] it that's what it's going to look like [3502] so we have the container ID we're going [3503] to have to do something else all right [3504] that's fine so um um let's listen for a [3507] test [3508] event and let's [3511] just [3513] uh well is this done yet I think I bored [3517] this [3518] right okay well let's just let's just [3520] trigger this then one more [3522] time trigger me baby one more time [3525] should get a container ID [3527] cool and now just while while we're [3530] listening for this because this is [3531] listening right now um I believe I can [3534] just continue building this and if you [3535] think about it like I need to do is once [3536] I have the web hook I need to get the [3539] data from the container ID right so I'm [3541] go back to my API reference and then [3544] containers let's just [3547] fetch output fetch the output of a [3550] container right so that's what I want so [3553] now I'm just going to copy over [3556] this um go back here do an HTTP request [3561] import this [3562] Curl we're going to map it all including [3565] the ID and everything that I need and [3568] we're hardcoding the container ID right [3570] I think let me just go back to wherever [3572] that container ID was yeah I think we're [3574] I think we're hardcoding the container [3575] right I'm pretty sure and that's going [3577] to include the output now the output is [3578] going to include a list of all of the [3580] records that we've actually sent the [3581] request to which is nice so from there I [3583] should essentially be able to do [3585] everything I need to do okay so I mean [3588] the trigger events taken forever and let [3590] me just see if I could run this as [3592] is oh sorry it's going to be executing [3594] the web hook node so let me just add a [3596] manual trigger first and then let's [3599] connect this [3601] now let's exit out of this now click [3603] test workflow nope just this thank [3607] you it's saying the resource I'm [3609] requesting could not be found so why is [3611] that um there must not be any [3615] data there's probably no [3619] data so I'm just going to see if we can [3621] get the container ID is there a [3623] container ID I'm not seeing any [3624] container ID identity maybe identity ID [3627] might be container idid not really sure [3629] I don't know if that's what that [3632] means um well it did work it actually [3635] went and it sent the request that's [3637] pretty [3638] badass so what are we going to call I [3641] think it might be this identity [3642] ID unfortunately doesn't look like I can [3644] copy it doesn't let [3647] me so that sucks um H how am I going to [3651] get the container ID of the thing [3661] um I guess I [3664] could [3666] just [3668] uh grab a different [3674] container this this one [3677] maybe just let's try this okay oh what [3681] the heck's this I don't know what this [3683] means [3686] this looks like a [3689] test H that's the that's the output [3694] huh [3697] weird so I don't actually know if that's [3699] what we want do we want the container ID [3702] then no we want [3705] um agents fetch output get the output of [3708] the most recent container of an agent [3710] maybe we just need this okay it's [3712] designed so it's easy to get incremental [3713] data from an agent output of the most [3715] recent container okay well I'm just [3717] going to I'm just going to call this [3718] then like right yeah let's just do that [3722] um let's not even worry about all this [3723] stuff let's just [3725] get the ID of the [3728] agent okay should be right over here now [3731] let's do an HTTP request but this time [3734] we'll do it to fetch output okay so I'm [3737] going to copy this over paste this in [3739] the test [3740] field try it and no we did get a weird [3744] we did get a really weird output not [3746] really sure what that [3751] means process finished spreadsheet is [3753] empty or everyone has already been added [3755] okay okay yeah no we did we did actually [3756] get [3757] the we did actually get the output [3762] um maybe there's something that I'm [3764] missing here because it looks like I'm [3767] fetching I'm not fetching what I want um [3771] I'm fetching something different okay [3777] so let me see if I could feed [3780] in the right [3790] container basically what we want is we [3792] just want the big list right so how am I [3794] going to do [3798] that if omitted or set to okay you know [3800] what maybe maybe it's actually this [3803] maybe we go to agents um fetch output [3810] then we feed this in let me try [3812] it oh sorry I'm feeding in a container [3814] ID to something that wants something [3816] called an Asian [3818] ID that's kind of killing me a little [3821] bit uh all right that's fine let's just [3824] kind of circle back um I was using a [3829] post request or a get [3831] request I don't remember let me paste [3835] this in now [3837] now let me test this says it's a bad [3840] request I need to check my parameters so [3841] why is [3843] that could be that the um ID is not the [3848] ID of an agent so I'm going to go back [3850] here to where I Define the ID of my [3851] agent and I'll go back here and I'll [3853] paste the ID of my agent [3855] in and no we do get just this weird [3859] output file which doesn't actually have [3861] anything so that makes me think that in [3863] order for me to do this I should [3864] probably test with a another lead so not [3866] just one lead but two leads so why don't [3869] we just test with with another lead now [3871] I'll go over here we just delete [3874] Frank and [3875] [Music] [3877] then actually why don't I just test this [3879] on my on my real data that' be [3882] interesting let's go back here and then [3884] instead of a limit of [3886] one I I just do a limit of [3891] three that'll allow three things to move [3893] which will allow [3895] us to generate two more rows [3900] basically those two rows should dump [3903] here so just I'm testing all this [3906] iteratively right [3908] now so we should have two more okay now [3911] we do with the ice breakers right so the [3913] rest of the system works fine and now we [3915] just need to send it to this Phantom [3916] Buster agent okay so um let's do it I'm [3920] going to send to okay actually this is a [3922] good opportunity for me to test my um [3925] uh my web hook right so why don't [3929] I grab this listen for this test [3933] event then over here I'm going to test [3935] sending all of these results to my web [3938] hook looks like it's already running [3941] which is a problem H it is [3945] running [3947] interesting I get it I know why it's [3949] running it's running because we're just [3951] doing we're we just sent three results [3953] over we need to aggregate the results in [3956] between these two so I'm going to use [3958] aggregate [3960] okay I don't think I need any field name [3962] at all I think I can just aggregate [3964] these so that these three items become [3965] one item let's see no I guess we do need [3968] a field to aggregate we'll aggregate [3970] them based off of [3972] ID no I just want to aggregate all of [3974] them really um let me just see if maybe [3977] there's another field that I need to use [3979] that's not [3981] aggregate can I just combine these all [3983] into one item no I think I do need to [3985] use aggregate [3986] just going to aggregate all item data [3987] into a single list put it inside of this [3989] object called [3990] data and then from here I'm now going to [3992] have one item and then I can just [3994] trigger this once instead of you know [3995] however many times I've done so all [3997] right well I'm glad that I spotted that [3999] that otherwise would have been a [3999] catastrophic [4001] error um let's see how our agents [4004] doing looks like we're processing two [4007] new records which is nice so this [4009] obviously understands and is capable of [4011] like kind of mediating modulating [4014] whatever the hell you want to call it um [4015] the [4016] output just make sure this web Hook is [4018] set oh [ __ ] the web hook URL is not set [4021] oops save save save save and close yeah [4025] this probably ran without that web hook [4027] URL so that that that makes sense I'm [4029] kind of silly okay looks like we did [4032] indeed finish that run two invitations [4034] were sent I'm not getting a web hook [4036] here unfortunately which is kind of [4037] annoying so I'm just going to um leave [4041] that for at the end of the video when I [4042] do a demo for now I'm just going to [4044] pretend like I did get the the web hook [4045] and then I'll just continue manually [4047] triggering the rest of this flow so um [4050] yeah because we triggered that flow [4051] right at the very end there and then if [4053] I go to my execution history I should [4055] see a record [4057] of the flow at the very end where the [4061] error [4062] was uh I don't know what oh that looks [4065] kind okay that looks kind of weird I [4067] don't remember doing that it's probably [4068] this one [4072] here something is weird happen Happ here [4076] this is like McKing around with the okay [4079] that might be a bug of some kind um [4081] anyway I should be able to grab the ID [4083] of the agent [4085] right so I should then just be able to [4087] feed this directly in which is the same [4089] as before we should be able to test it [4092] should be able to get the the [4093] data but no I'm not really getting the [4096] data not really wondering I'm really [4097] wondering why I'm not getting the data [4098] here looks like this is [4103] good I mean I sent it up but why we [4105] sending it in this format I don't want [4106] it in whatever the hell this is I want [4108] in Jason right I'm just getting this all [4111] is one big text string [4115] so could I get [4119] this agents fetch [4124] output [4128] H yeah that's kind of annoying you know [4130] what we might not actually be able to do [4132] it kind of sucks I think instead we're [4135] going to have to to do so we're just [4137] going to have to go like when it is sent [4140] we're going to have to mark this as XXX [4142] basically [4144] um yeah I mean there's no other way of [4147] doing so I mean it's not ideal and it's [4148] not technically one to one but looks [4150] like the only alternative to that would [4152] be Madness we'd have to parse out all of [4154] those people using Ai and this would not [4156] be [4157] reliable and then um it also cost way [4161] too much in order to do it so I guess [4164] we're going to scrap that we're going to [4165] do is we're just going to keep with keep [4166] on with this one scenario that triggers [4168] the Phantom Buster agent and then after [4170] the Phantom Buster [4172] agent uh well we're not even going to [4174] have a scent column really it's just [4175] anybody that's here will obviously have [4177] just made it through the Phantom Buster [4178] agent so that's what we're gonna that's [4180] what we're going to [4181] say and [4184] then yeah the Phantom muster agent [4186] will'll just run it um every time we add [4189] new people to this [4191] list and then I think we could also [4193] probably just run it once a day or [4194] something once every couple of days [4197] because it actually automatically has [4198] the D duplication functionality inside [4199] of it right so yeah I guess there's no [4201] real reason to have like a like a done [4202] column [4203] anyway it's not that that was a silly [4206] thought ideally you should track this [4208] but there is there is really no need to [4210] split it into I suppose because if it is [4214] on the sheet Phantom Buster will [4216] automatically dup it and so we just [4218] basically anything that goes in the [4219] sheet will eventually be taken care of I [4221] suppose um and if you want to see how [4225] far down you are you just go to results [4228] and you basically just have a list of [4229] everybody that you sent to so yeah we do [4232] have that taken care of automatically [4234] and as we can see you've already sent [4235] some of these [4236] DMS um so I'm probably going to get like [4238] some actual connection requests from [4239] these people which is nice looking [4241] forward to meeting you Frank Greg and [4244] atina uh so let me just think is there [4246] anything else that we need to do in [4247] order to make this [4249] work I don't really think so I think [4252] that's about it just did it with [4253] creative agencies so now we just going [4255] to trigger the Phantom Buster age and [4256] have that go yeah looks pretty good and [4259] there you have it it is a complete AI [4261] powered LinkedIn Outreach system built [4263] entirely in naden the system will save [4265] you hours of manual work every week [4268] while actually improving your response [4269] rates and the personalization that we [4271] built in goes far beyond what most other [4273] automated tools offer as of right now [4275] and then finally the benefit is you own [4276] the entire workflow a few important [4278] things that I'd recommend you keep in [4279] mind I think you should start with small [4281] batches maybe 5 to 10 requests per day [4283] as opposed to large ones link imposes a [4286] message limit of about 100 outbound DMS [4289] of this form AK connection requests per [4291] week so start with 5 to 10 gradually [4293] increases you get more comfortable you [4295] should also regularly check your [4296] LinkedIn account to quickly respond to [4298] any replies I mean if you can respond to [4300] people on average within a minute your [4302] conversion rate um jumps up by something [4304] like 400% I'd also recommend you update [4306] your message templates just every couple [4308] of weeks to keep them fresh then finally [4309] monitor your metrics closely to see [4311] what's working and what isn't you know [4312] cold Outreach is basically all about [4314] iteration um the very first campaign [4317] that you guys send out it's probably [4318] going to be the worst campaign you'll [4319] ever do if you guys run into any issues [4321] or you want to share your results just [4322] drop drop a comment down below I'd love [4324] to obviously hear how the system works [4325] for you and then if anybody has any [4327] questions or something that I might be [4328] able to help with you know I'm much more [4329] likely to respond to comments than the [4331] average YouTuber and for those of you [4332] who are serious about building AI [4333] automation systems just like this one i' [4335] highly encourage you to check out maker [4337] school it's my own Community where over [4338] 1,400 entrepreneurs are building and [4341] scaling their AI automation agencies [4343] thanks for watching and peace out

Title: $100K/M AI Experts Discuss Job Loss
[0] way back in the day everybody would [1] always be like hey don't go broad go [3] deep right cuz depth is what's going to [5] secure you I think interestingly enough [6] it's actually the exact opposite I even [8] knew the guy who changed his complete [10] career over decoding because he thought [12] this is going to be safe and pure and I [16] think Safety and Security attached to [18] skill sets is going away there are [21] certain things that don't need to be [22] scalable and those are hard honest [24] conversations with people in our groups [27] and people on YouTube I think basically [29] we're going to have like pre AI creators [30] and post AI creators that's that AI [32] model that has a crush on me with [34] Technologies like this coming through [36] the four if you just do one thing like [37] if you're just a designer you know and [40] this model comes out that's like domain [42] specific and train specifically for [43] design and it can do the text placement [46] and the lighting of any um actor or [48] whatever automatically like I was [49] showing you guys a moment ago like how [51] much longevity do you actually have in [52] that role this new b m looks awesome [55] thank you very much um what do you think [56] about my lightsaber Jack [60] actually jealous yeah are you on the [64] light side of the force as I am um dude [66] I think I might go sth Lord I [69] think I like the purple the purple's [71] quite unique you got some Sith Lord [73] energy um but here's the problem I don't [75] know how to I don't know how to turn [77] this [79] back any have this changing colors in [82] your videos at the back no no the idea [84] behind this thing is um somebody told me [86] that everybody's using light poles now [88] and I just had to change Apartments like [90] I'm in a different setup as you could [91] see and uh apparently this is just like [93] one of the quickest and easiest ways to [95] like get any lighting setup good to go [97] cuz you know like the way that it is [98] shaped I mean I know it's screwing up [99] the camera in the recording right now it [101] essentially like diffuses the light [103] outwards so you don't actually need a [104] bunch of fancy stuff you can just put a [106] light pole in front of you and get 90% [107] of the way there I'm heading out to [109] Dubai for couple weeks so I've got to do [111] a like a move my setup over on a budget [114] so like I'm I'm just debating what to [115] take and I think a light a light source [117] like that will be cool so [120] the Dubai apartment's going to be like [121] bro but we'll we'll figure it out it's [123] going to be pretty rough man not going [125] to lie like I've heard that like in the [126] summer bro pretty hot yeah well it's [129] like I think everyone leaves for three [131] or four months [132] so um yeah it's gonna be hot be hot I'm [135] come back like the Black Panther man [137] this [138] trip okay you know I I be very T by the [141] time I get back yeah yeah yeah can't [143] wait to hear more about it man it's [144] going to be awesome I'm just going to [145] put that over there and hopefully people [147] can at least see my face we're doing a [148] little lowbudget thing today [150] um cool we got a lot to talk about Jack [152] listen first of all it's great having [153] you here man and um you know I [155] appreciate that you have been [156] consistently posting this podcast on [158] your channel over the course of the last [159] two or three weeks or however long it's [160] been for those of you guys that don't [162] know who Jack Roberts is does he even [164] need an introduction I mean he runs the [166] largest school community on AI [168] automation on planet Earth he comes from [170] an extraordinar entrepreneurial [171] background he wears cool shirts and [173] funky hats I mean is there am I missing [176] anything here or have I just summed up [177] your whole personality the shirt did it [179] yeah jump to did it man what a what a [181] beautiful inroduction man it's very kind [182] of thank you [184] yeah we got uh we got a lot to talk [186] about um some notes that I sent over to [189] Jack right before this chat I want to [192] chat about a new image model that just [193] came out it's called rev image you have [195] a chance to to take a look at that check [197] dude I haven't had a full detail mod so [199] tell me what's your what's your take on [200] this one now um dude it's it's a crazy [203] crazy image model bro like I know we [205] were just talking about how awesome it [206] would be if we had like a jam like [208] figure um to jump on but but actually [210] just before I get into that I want to [211] chat like AI news I want to chat a [213] little bit about um you know this model [215] rev image a little bit about another [216] model called character 3 how it's going [218] to change the game and maybe some [219] entrepreneurial opportunities that are [220] going to result alongside that I want to [222] chat about nadn um specifically the fact [224] that they're raising 60 million freaking [226] dollars to boost their presence and grow [228] in the Bay Area that's huge uh and I [231] also want to chat a little bit about [232] Vibe coding because I saw you made a [233] Vibe coding video where Jack literally [236] constructed a sass app in like an hour [238] it was nuts so yeah have a lot to think [241] about Vibe coded yeah but that's [242] exciting I love the agenda bro that's [244] perfect yeah yeah so it's going to be [245] really fun dude absolutely insane image [248] quality coming out in this new model [249] this was basically like Moonlighting is [251] this one called half moon for quite a [253] while where people like they they didn't [255] um this company rev image sort of just [257] like came out of nowhere but essentially [259] this thing is capable of producing any [261] arbitrarily complex image not just uh [266] like pictures of people or animations or [268] whatever but if if you go a little bit [270] further check this out are you seeing [274] this right now this is this is chis [276] these are like text based like like look [278] at that man look at that um look at the [280] the coherence and the congruence on the [282] text look at these ads that these things [284] are making it's the font it's a [286] typography it's like it the one they [287] always strugle to get text in but it's [289] like how good is the text this is [292] typography this is ex exactly this has [294] solved that and so anyway I guess to [296] make a long story short um the reason [297] why this is so exciting to me in part I [300] is because I think that these AI models [301] have been at the point where like you [302] could make cool pictures and stuff uh [305] for a while you know you could do like [306] cartoon anim like I actually got my [308] start in AI funly enough check with um [310] with an anime image generator where I [312] just wanted to like generate a bunch of [313] images of like anime characters and I [316] found that it was pretty good at that [317] but you know anytime you tried to get [319] more complex anytime you tried to like [320] move away from art and more into design [323] which I think is obviously where all the [324] money is um Quality tanked because it [327] was unable to understand how to put a [329] word together understand letter [330] placement stuff but this model is [332] finally at the point where you can and [333] it's not just that it can do so it can [335] do so extraordinarily well so my [337] thoughts are this is going to massively [339] disrupt like the design industry which [341] up until now has been using AI uh image [343] generators as a tool to like create [346] backdrops or color gradients or whatever [348] um but I think this is like literally [349] the point where it's going to be putting [350] designers out of jobs like tomorrow the [352] second that this model drops yeah and [355] we've come out of what I would describe [356] as the alarm Bell part of the curve [358] which is this is getting kind of close [360] you know the the the tides are getting [361] kind of high like we're up to our waist [363] but we're not drowning yet and then it [365] just takes that slight step change where [366] it goes from you can see the potential [368] to actually physically working I've [370] always had that same observation bro [372] that image gen's really cool getting [373] text on it is really cool but you often [375] find yourself doing 16 to 20 different [377] variations to try and get the text [379] slight to the slight to the right to [381] actually have a model that does that and [383] a really congruent when it's excellent [385] and crucially has a typography now n i I [387] knew you're stick for typography man I [389] myself included so for me I think that's [391] sex delicious dud that's good it's kind [392] of given your general standard Creator [395] or business like the opportunity to make [397] production designer grade level [399] materials and actually if it can do the [402] hard thinking so one of the things that [403] we find it come to Vibe coding later but [405] they D like you say hey design me a sexy [408] app right what how have you defined that [410] AI doesn't always know what great design [412] looks like so that's kind of that like [414] additional value layer that these [416] businesses add like they say hey we will [418] pre-code and pre-built in [420] understandings of what good typography [422] and good text and good design is so the [424] image G models could be this I mean I [426] guess that's I'm assuming that's what [427] this company's done is add that [428] additional um translation layer from [431] user input to the generation models [433] which I think is really sick D and I i' [435] I'd see myself using that quite a lot [437] Agreed 100% I think that when I see [441] changes like this [443] happen I wonder as to how quickly we're [446] going to see the major economic impacts [448] that you know you and I have been [449] talking about right one thing I always [452] get in my community and I'm sure you get [454] as well is like Nick Manis just came out [457] and uh you know it can now sign up to [460] websites and I don't know fill out forms [463] and do all this fun stuff is my work as [465] an AI automation agency like screwed am [468] I just like totally destroyed is there [469] no hope or no future for me I think that [472] people like us actually have the most [475] job security by far out of anything with [478] Technologies this coming through the [480] four if you just do one thing like if [482] you're just a designer you know and this [485] model comes out that's like domain [487] specific can train specifically for [488] design and it can do the text placement [491] and I don't know like the the lighting [492] of any um actor or whatever [494] automatically like I was showing you [496] guys a moment ago like like how much [499] longevity do you actually have in that [500] role and like that domain specific role [502] I think interestingly enough way back in [504] the day everybody would always be like [505] hey don't go broad go deep right because [507] depth is what's going to secure you I [509] think interestingly enough it's actually [511] the exact opposite it's people that you [513] know like entrepreneurs for instance or [514] people that are in roles that require [515] you to integrate a bunch of desparate [516] information into one thing High agency [519] sort of roles that require you make [520] decisions that are realistically the [521] most insulated from this sort of like [523] major disruption to um you know like [526] like the workforce and I think that [528] those are those are the ones that are [529] going to last the longest so I know that [530] this not 100% to do with rev but I was [532] just curious to hear your thoughts on [533] that dud I think that's really well said [535] it's it's emblematic of what's happening [538] at every Arab and I think just to like [540] zoom out a little bit for AI automates [542] it's like you have these different [544] streams of technologies that are [545] developing at a very rapid pace and many [548] of them are on Crash courses to collide [550] into one another like we spoke about [552] didn't we bro in my last podcast about [554] um Sesame which is this aite Tech that [557] is on a direct Collision Course with [559] game development game design so you have [561] all these separate Technologies and once [562] they combined the technology feels like [564] it takes a whole jump Le forward so [566] that's why I I always say you need that [568] breadth General awareness of what is [570] even if you don't want to be an image [571] specialist it's good just to be aware of [573] it because you will find different ways [574] to ingrate it and bake it into your park [576] somewhere Sesame um you mean Maya right [579] that's that a model that has a crush on [581] me yeah dude she she's inous G I [583] actually spoke to Miles dude he um [586] actually funny I I I was chatting my [588] girlfriend had me laughing dude I was [589] like this is really funny dude he's a [590] funny guy that I [592] say right miles the first thing he says [594] get the hell away from Maya what are [597] you yeah dude he's not quite as [599] flotation he's a little bit more [600] aggressive actually mat so can I say [602] dude they um you know they launched the [604] API for that right I saw that man yeah [606] oh sorry it's not an API my my bad my [608] bad I think it's the SDK or whatever [609] like it's on GitHub you can access it [611] and you can like use it for your own [612] stuff you just need to whip up a server [614] and have it running you got Local Host [616] it yeah you can't do it for like I'm [619] really I'm wondering about that like I [620] should play around with that that'd be [621] so cool it'd be really cool yeah yeah I [624] mean like the it's better than the open [626] AI one I think yeah for sure like then [628] um um real time assistants realtime [630] voice assistants yeah I was thinking [632] about uh just the swarm of AI girlfriend [635] apps that are just going to like be [636] created sometime the next few years and [637] it's just gonna be freaking it's GNA be [639] nutty I know we chatted on that last [640] week so I'm not going to cover it but [642] yeah they're definitely going to be [643] popular well it already exists right [645] like you've seen those influences that [646] kind of fractalize their personality um [649] with images and stuff like and people [650] already paying that I think one one guy [652] was doing multiple six figures with his [654] girlfriend you serious already happening [656] yeah already already holy crap dude [659] should be pimping out AI models now you [661] know like that's H you've heard of the [664] whole like only fans agency business [665] model my friend was really interested in [666] this a while ago and you know putting [668] aside like moral and ethical whatever [669] the hell you want to call it um I know I [672] know a few people that were printing [673] money with this stuff were essentially [674] you know like you help a model run their [676] brand and then you I don't know you use [678] AI to assist in like the responding to [680] hundreds of thousands of messages a day [683] um I wonder what sort of opportunities [684] this is going to open you know like if [685] there's a if there's a will there's a [687] way I guess but hey this is great job in [690] the world isn't it so [693] yeah I mean you just have to look at [695] like candidly like what are the most [697] popular websites are on the planet and [699] people are using it like it's a fight [702] you know what I mean so like if you can [704] I mean like it was funny there was a guy [706] I met once and he was always introduced [708] as a guy that bought firewalls for prawn [710] websites and I was like that was just [712] like do like this guy went to MIT this [714] guy went to 7 so that was like his [715] calling card and stuff and oh oh God [717] that's a bit like everyone was like [718] whispering that a little bit but like [721] you kind of like someone's got to do [723] that right so like yeah dude all about [724] to say it's it's definitely a boning [727] industry and like did nothing to say [728] from AI every every industry is getting [730] it like left 100% 100% man I have so [733] much more that I could talk about like [735] porn and its impacts on technology more [737] generally but just for pure distribution [740] of this podcast I will stop here we'll [741] do that we'll do that another after [743] hours po after when the the coffee turns [745] out for some old yeah um it's great that [748] we were chatting about this because I [749] think this leads really naturally into [750] our next topic so um essentially just [753] like we were talking about a moment ago [754] you know you can generate these [755] beautiful designs and stuff like that a [756] new model came out just in the last week [758] and a half or so called characters 3 I [760] chatted about it on my Instagram this [761] actually ended up being one of my U most [762] viral videos but this is an AI generated [764] image of a girl podcaster okay and [768] essentially what you do is you feed this [770] into hedra's character 3 which is the [772] the um company in the name of the model [774] and then it allows you to take a text uh [777] a text thing and then like it basically [780] so check this [782] out so there are some obviously issues [785] on that side there that we saw with like [786] an additional hand and that's just [788] because the images um I don't know I [790] think like The Wider frame images had [791] more issues but imagine if you just [793] cropped this okay yeah imagine you just [795] crop this right in the middle this dude [797] here as he's talking I mean these are [799] like Pretty Natural and organic looking [801] that really impressive yeah right there [803] were a couple other ones check out [806] this I mean Jack [809] I would have told that I wouldn't spot [811] that was AI immed yeah me neither bro me [813] neither like I mean you know obviously [814] there's still a couple of like image [816] problems and stuff like that and I'm not [818] going to dwell on those those minor ones [819] because I think it's just abundantly [821] clear at this point like if you look at [822] the tech that did that like a year ago [824] it was like stick figures going like [825] beep boop right like the ha Jun stuff [827] you know as cool as it was yeah yeah [830] well it's it's your defect we're now at [832] that like we've hit the 95% Mark it's [834] now those like marginal improvements to [837] get those so the little like the finger [839] that appear and stuff those are getting [840] less and less bro I think have you've [843] seen you may have seen content on [844] YouTube about this proliferation of AI [846] generated media um it's especially [849] becoming prevalent on Google I I always [851] thought Google was getting like I don't [852] even use Google anymore personally yeah [854] like it's just I just chat gbt it right [857] it's also like as these things get [859] better if I like if we were thinking [860] about what's the opportunity for [862] businesses my my kind of lens on it is [865] that you are going to reach a point soon [867] enough we don't know what date specific [869] speically but this generated content [871] will become a commodity you know the guy [873] who's 17 in his basement in Arkansas can [876] use it just the same guy as the meteor [878] expert who's 45 and freaking Birmingham [880] what whatever it is why why why Arkansas [883] there something to say about the [884] arkansans or what watching this [888] let that was for you [890] Legend um the point is like um it [893] becomes commoditized so I actually think [895] and I get a lot of questions I don't if [896] you get to SP about how you scale and [899] create faceless video content and stuff [902] yes and you can make money from that [904] 100% I fact you know I've expect people [905] to do multiple you know 10 you know 10K [908] 20K a month with that but I I'm of the [911] view that it is a one of the lowest [913] leverage applications of your beautiful [915] knowledge that you can have and I think [916] the more that this becomes a commodity [918] there's always these fractions of [920] opportunities that appear and emerge [922] until someone else jumps on it so I saw [924] this to say that the big opportunity I [926] believe is in your personal brand anding [928] a uni identity online and using your own [931] unique voice that will become the prized [934] asset it will be made by humans as [937] opposed to made in the UK or made in [939] calg or whatever um so I think that's [942] Direction I'm going to so if you're a [944] bit of a hacker a kind of trend Hunter I [947] weaponizes to generate income in the [948] short term if you want to optimize for [949] generating income long term I would lean [951] into authentic natural organic personal [954] content yeah I've heard it said that we [956] really only have like a couple of years [957] left to make a personal brand from [960] scratch because the next couple of years [963] is going to feature like a a a veritable [966] torrent of content just like this and [968] like let's be real you know you and I we [970] can only make like a few videos per day [972] we only have so many new insights and [974] and cool pieces of knowledge we could [975] share and and ways to motivate our our [977] audience to actually get out there and [979] do the work right I mean how much how [981] much more content could you generate [982] with some model trained on my face that [985] like looks just like me I mean supply [988] and demand right like if there are [989] 100,000 videos s such similar videos [992] that are posted on a daily basis right [993] now then in a few years there's going to [995] be like 100 million um so I mean like I [998] think the bar for for content is going [999] to go up but that that's one really [1001] interesting that's one really [1002] interesting concept I guess that I've [1003] heard about and that's one of the [1005] reasons why just to be transparent about [1007] my own brand strategy I focus so much [1008] more on authenticity than I think a lot [1010] of other people do and I focused more on [1012] just like crazy long form content where [1014] you just hear me breathe and like go [1017] down some shitty detour that doesn't [1018] amount to anything cuz I actually think [1020] that that is going to gain a massive [1022] premium when there's so much of this [1024] perfect amazing AI influencer content [1027] stuff out there like this this this [1029] Trove that I built and also like this [1031] authenticity and and like reputation for [1032] being positive like I think all of that [1034] it's it's almost like it compounds you [1035] know what I mean just like compound [1036] interest it's just I think it's going to [1037] compound way faster than like actual [1039] interest I think um I think basically [1042] we're going to have like pre-ai creators [1044] and post AI creators and then I think [1046] like you know we should be doing you and [1048] I and other people that are watching [1049] this that are maybe starting we should [1050] do literally everything in our power to [1052] like become the pre aai Creator um to be [1054] known for producing content in the pre [1056] AI world do do you think that's because [1059] when AI reaches a level where it becomes [1062] somewhere indistinguishable the volume [1065] of comparable content will just be so [1067] high people won't be clicking on new [1069] brands yeah I mean like there's only so [1071] much like search search engine space [1073] right like I think that Discovery [1074] algorithms will get better at showing [1076] specific types of content to the [1077] specific types of people that want to [1078] watch watch it but like I mean how [1080] quickly is how quickly is Humanity [1083] growing you know what I mean like 8 [1084] billion people today um how long is it [1087] going to take for us to get to 9 billion [1088] which is like a 12.5% increase in total [1090] population comparatively how much longer [1092] is it going to take for us just to get [1093] to a 12.5 increase in the amount of [1095] content on the internet well that's [1096] probably going to happen in like a week [1097] you know what I mean like like the the [1099] amount of content out there is vastly [1101] outpacing the number of people out there [1103] and the number of user seconds available [1104] to watch specific people so that's a [1107] good point if you look at the supply and [1108] demand there is a finite number of [1110] attention points and minutes available [1112] per person to invest in platform the [1114] question is why invest it with you [1117] versus any else but but on Instagram I [1119] came across an account called AI Surfer [1121] and you may have seen this guy yeah I've [1123] heard of this guy yeah yeah yeah this [1124] guy um it's all AI generated it's kind [1127] of haen his head doesn't move very much [1130] so you can tell he's kind of an AI but [1132] but Bros got over 400,000 followers I [1134] think last time I checked so it [1136] obviously there is a [1139] strategy that works like you can do it [1141] for sure if you want to on Instagram um [1145] I think I saw this guy yeah it's like [1149] the key thing is like and it's so cool I [1150] always bring back to YouTube because I [1151] freaking love YouTube but um it's also [1153] like your brand is something that is an [1156] asset that follows you definitely like [1158] it's like if you don't want to talk [1159] about AI image gen in the future it's [1161] great to have an audience that have [1163] trust in what you do what you cover and [1165] I think it's worth doing that like the [1167] cost of doing that only in increases of [1169] time and it's it's a beautiful [1171] opportunity to do that I think and you [1172] can still leverages Tech and stuff it's [1174] just like I I always say to people [1176] you're you know let if if you're going [1178] to spend your beautiful brain investment [1180] points on something let's solve bigger [1182] problems let's do something huge but [1184] it's very popular people really love [1186] doing that stuff it's massive yeah for [1188] sure for sure I was watching a couple of [1190] other guys on Instagram and I was like [1192] some some seems a little bit weird about [1193] this content there's like you know these [1195] fast-paced reals that are similar to [1196] what I'm doing which is mostly [1197] news-based content and like first second [1199] and a half it's like hey in this video [1201] we're going to talk about and then it [1202] immediately Cuts right but then I kind [1204] of like I zoomed way in and then I [1206] realized like the hand placement was the [1208] exact same in every video every single [1211] one was like Hey in this video we're [1212] gonna hey in this video we're gonna hey [1214] in today's video we're gonna and I was [1215] like holy [ __ ] is this all Ai and dude [1219] like hit me like a ton of bricks bro [1221] this guy had I think over 50,000 [1223] followers on Instagram which is about my [1224] size now and I was like could I have [1228] just not recorded anything like I just [1230] done all this [ __ ] in my boxers like [1232] what the hell it's crazy that's why [1235] you're W that that's why you're W that [1236] and you you I've seen a few lazy ones I [1238] saw one uh what was it now Grant Cardone [1240] did one where like was like hey this is [1242] gr Cardone and it was like really badly [1244] generated voice Ai and like the com like [1247] it's like if you do it like incorrectly [1250] you flame you have to get that like [1252] beautiful like sweet spot if you're [1254] going to crush it that's a really [1255] interesting point the the social cost of [1258] being an authentic Creator who is caught [1262] using AI that's really interesting so [1265] one thing that I was championing um over [1268] the course of the last year was [1269] responding to every single one of my [1270] comments on my own and I spent a few [1273] days dude going through YouTube and I [1275] responded to like every single comment I [1277] had gotten up until I was like 20,000 [1278] followers so some something around that [1280] point and I had you know I started [1282] talking about I was telling people about [1283] this like dude you're responding to [1284] every comment what are you freaking [1285] crazy what are you nuts like dude like [1288] that there's no leverage in that where [1289] yeah I thought you were the automation [1290] guy dude automated it and I was like [1292] well actually like I feel like that's [1294] like a completely underutilized resource [1296] I feel like every com comment that I [1297] leave is a statue that I am building a [1300] testament to myself as like a human [1303] being that spent the time to resp like I [1305] feel like that adds so much more [1306] authenticity and then I had somebody uh [1309] bring it up to me and it was like dude [1311] you know like I trained a model on all [1313] of the text you know all the stuff [1314] you've ever written and then I actually [1316] went and I responded to a bunch of [1317] YouTube comments like you know thinking [1319] pretending that I was you like I didn't [1321] post them I just drafted them and then [1322] he sent over a bunch to me and I was [1323] looking at him like holy [ __ ] that's [1324] basically exactly what I what I wrot my [1327] God but then but but then I was just [1329] like man like what would the social cost [1331] be what would the social cost be of this [1333] if somebody like kind of like found out [1335] that I was using AI to respond on them [1336] and it wasn't actually me do you know [1337] what I mean I actually think that would [1338] be huge dude especially for Brands like [1340] ours where it's like okay people like us [1342] they like our personalities they like [1343] what we do and I was like I I can't so I [1345] decided a long time ago I'm not going to [1347] touch that [ __ ] with a 10- foot pole [1348] like if you're if I'm responding to one [1350] one of the comments it's me responding [1352] to the comment you know what I mean it's [1353] not going to be a model it's not going [1353] to be a robot you could chat with a Nick [1355] chatbot if you want but like you're [1357] going to do that I'm not going to like [1359] pretend or or whatever you transparent [1361] about that saying D it was like I'm [1362] actually for saying like every post I do [1364] in my community it's written by Jack [1366] 100% yeah you're right it's like well [1369] okay it may be right but my gosh to [1371] people it just on it destroys everything [1373] it's like oh my gosh it's all AI [1375] generated and is it there's a kind of [1377] plasticky [1379] um I guess it says hey I don't value [1383] your time enough to spend my precious [1385] time quoting this content so I've just [1387] it so it's like you need to be [1389] indistinguishable if you're going to do [1390] that but I I think that's good I think [1392] you can never be too close to your [1393] customers you can never spend enough [1395] time speaking to people and having [1396] conversations like that's the boring [1398] dirty, thousand actions that get the [1400] results um that people just don't want [1402] to do and like I don't think you because [1404] you know you and I bro you know we're [1406] scale Centric and we that stuff it's [1409] also like there are certain things that [1412] don't need to be scalable and those are [1414] hard honest conversations with people in [1416] our groups and people on YouTube I think [1418] that's like I think that's really well [1419] said man agree 100% also if you think [1422] about it statistically speaking like if [1424] your average post or your average [1425] comment gets I don't know a thousand or [1427] 10,000 views or something like that and [1430] if you just leave like 20 every day for [1432] the next 10 years like you will actually [1434] reach the vast majority of human beings [1436] that are out there that could be [1437] interested in your content like like I [1438] was I was thinking about that as well I [1439] was like do I really need AI to do this [1441] stuff no I don't like if I just continue [1443] talking there is already inherent scale [1445] built into media as a as as a as a tool [1448] of Leverage that like you know I'm just [1450] going to keep being myself for as long [1451] as seemingly possible and who knows man [1453] if a big AI Overlord comes and turns us [1455] on a paperclip so at least have tried [1457] it's also it's also your 20 coms are [1460] seen by other people so it's like get [1463] like visibility in every one of those [1464] comments as well so yeah d i I think [1466] that's really well said it's like we [1467] always talk about where AI but there's [1468] also times when not to use AI right [1471] exactly this point I think it's yeah [1472] really good point though damn right [1474] speaking about AI um nad's raising $60 [1476] million Eh this is interesting to me [1479] yeah so what's the digging into what [1480] they've done I don't if there's an [1481] article L but like have they said why [1483] they're raising 60 mils let me pull it [1487] up alongside you um I mean you know like [1490] there's like there's stated reasons [1492] right and then there's like actual [1493] reason yeah anytime anytime a company [1495] makes a PR statement it's like we're [1496] raising it to help divver [1498] and help increase access to AI models [1501] you know what I mean it's like all right [1502] sure [1503] bro I'm okay okay I'm looking at it [1506] right now Berlin Bay Ann said and now [1508] has over 3,000 Enterprise customers [1509] around 2,000 active users on its books [1511] they're going to use the series B to [1512] continue investing in Tech and expanding [1514] your markets like the us home to more [1516] than half of nen's user base so it seems [1517] to be that a big chunk of it is this is [1520] like a like an EU based company right [1522] Berlin headquartered they're raising [1523] this money to penetrate the American [1525] Market um they're raising this money [1527] essentially to like uh one one of my [1529] friends and and one of the people in my [1531] community they're actually interviewing [1532] for around as like a community manager [1534] I'm for Iden right now and the whole [1535] stated purpose of this is to uh I think [1538] it's to like improve visibility in like [1540] the San Francisco area so so I think [1542] like I think they're actually trying to [1543] like migrate into the center of tech [1546] worldwide with this money yeah because [1549] they did a according to a series a for [1551] 13.5 mil four years ago yeah now they're [1554] on that series B for 60 million yeah [1559] interesting um well dude they've really [1561] blown up recently I mean like the [1564] prevalence of AI these NOCO platforms I [1566] mean they're only going to increase time [1567] and it's just interesting to me that [1568] they're really building down I'd love to [1570] know what their their price per their [1571] sort of like profit per customer is I'd [1574] be very to know what that number is [1575] because lots of people are self housed [1577] to it and I'd love to know what the [1579] percentage of people who doing that are [1580] so I'd love to business give Steelman [1583] the na10 business model bro where do you [1584] think like most of [1586] the control I mean if I were to steal [1588] man it obviously they're getting [1590] tremendous amount of market share just [1592] in terms of like sheer percentage of [1594] people using their tools versus other no [1595] code tools by offering the self-hosted [1597] open source version okay so tremendous [1599] amount of market share um but they don't [1601] they don't turn they're not making money [1603] out of it right now right yeah so that [1606] said I mean like imagine a future where [1608] everybody uses naden like every like 80% [1610] of people or whatever and then imagine [1612] naen produces some extraordinarily [1614] simple and cost- effective and very low [1617] lowcost things that's just a no-brainer [1619] for most people to like I don't know add [1620] on some Plugin or some extension or [1622] whatever imagine that like it's just a [1625] few bucks a month I mean like they would [1626] instantly I don't know I don't know what [1628] the user base is right now how many [1629] millions of people are using this thing [1630] that's a good question that's I think [1632] that'd be a really good to figure out [1633] yeah yeah check let's check it out Jamie [1635] pull it up oh right we don't have a [1636] Jamie do we need a Jamie we need a we [1638] need a Jamie we're hiring for a Jamie [1641] roll if you're AI Jam down Bel the [1646] comment Okay so allegedly 230,000 active [1650] users so okay and I wonder to be I [1653] reckon that surged up to be fair quite [1655] recently I wonder be priz 3 that so they [1658] have the Enterprise customers like what [1659] that offer is for the Enterprise [1662] customers because make is a good example [1665] they are double Downing massively in [1668] their Enterprise clients because they're [1670] just worth way more right if you're look [1671] if you make for instance right you get [1674] paid more uh based on operations there [1676] basically usage and frequency and [1678] embedding the operations and then [1679] there's the friction of a leading [1681] platform like uh like I I had even [1683] someone reach out to me on school saying [1684] hey we're whoop come and join us is like [1687] no like obviously not because you're not [1689] just going to like upro your platform [1691] right and school's awesome I love school [1692] yeah so it's like when you get these [1694] NOCO platforms that really integrate [1697] with the business like the the [1698] transition costs get so high that you [1700] kind of have like inbuilt sticky this [1702] with that corporate client which is why [1704] if you're selling a business like that [1705] like that is a good kind of like nice X [1708] plus Factor so from n's perspective I I [1710] wonder if they're similar in a sense [1711] that they say hey we want to Broad [1714] Market penetration we recognize there a [1716] people that will self host because N1 10 [1718] appeals primarily to I'd say more [1720] developer Le individual it's not you [1723] know I I I wonder where their cor [1725] Revenue comes from I wouldn't be [1726] surprised with Enterprise but I don't [1727] their offer is for Enterprise [1729] so very interesting I I think I could [1731] see that as being their strategy yeah [1734] they just frontload the self-hosted [1735] thing popularize the hell out of it um [1738] you know get behind large AI based [1741] initiatives like model context protocol [1742] mCP like their you know the community [1745] node is out and uh they're they're [1746] they're now bundling uh you know I saw a [1749] developer the other day on NN saying [1750] that like they're bundling in um mCP or [1753] something of that nature um to make it [1755] like a core part of their platform so [1756] maybe maybe the reason why they're doing [1758] all this and pushing it is just because [1759] there is such an entrenched no code [1761] Market with Enterprise clients like make [1762] to come they just have to make this [1763] thing like a total no-brainer like you [1765] know an Enterprise client might be [1766] paying I don't know $10,000 a month or [1768] something like $155,000 a month for the [1769] operations usage of something like [1771] make.com thing where you can self host [1773] it for free unless you're they have some [1776] kind of Revenue cap on it I think yeah I [1779] mean like yeah but how are they going to [1780] enforce it in practice you know what I [1781] mean like dude like there's there's [1782] going to be hundreds of thousands of [1784] people that are going to be using this [1785] thing and they're going to be using it [1785] commercially and they're not going to be [1787] but like what's you know how's NN going [1788] to going to know like unless there's [1790] some sort of like baked in Telemetry [1791] inside of it and it's open source right [1793] so if that were to happen couldn't you [1794] just like swap that little function out [1797] I uh I don't know it seems to me like [1799] they're basically trying to be more like [1800] infrastructure than ass sass you know [1801] it's almost like infrastructure is a [1802] service it is yeah Le yeah I I think [1805] that's should play I mean like the big [1806] money seems to be an Enterprise um even [1809] with like your general Joe blogs [1811] individual solar preneur yeah for [1813] example he's using make he's not [1815] spending that [1816] much realistically person on the [1818] platform like all of your big Roi comes [1820] to Enterprise clients I I think what it [1822] says to me the fact they're doing such a [1824] significant raise is a really big growth [1825] signal for the group and as you as you [1828] expect the proliferation of AI and the [1829] use of automation to grow n10 would be a [1831] platform that you'd expect to smash it I [1833] mean bro you and I have spoken to lots [1834] of people who are creating their own n8n [1837] not n8n but their own platform like [1839] Lindy AI is a good example of one make's [1841] one zapier's one there's also some other [1843] smaller ones that are coming up and it's [1845] a it's a growing Market it really is and [1847] I know several people that use multiple [1848] of them so it's not even a zeros some [1850] game with these platforms that's a good [1851] point I didn't really think about that [1853] um it really isn't a zero sum game I [1855] mean the reality is that you know like [1857] all of these tools can basically do all [1858] the same things they're all like Turing [1859] complete from a computer um science [1861] perspective right like you can do what [1863] you can do and make in naden it's just [1865] like slightly different in order to do [1866] so in the same vein you could do what [1867] you could do in Java in Python do you [1870] know what I mean like it's like a [1871] different programming language a [1872] different tool to get the job done so [1875] yeah um I'm I'm pretty jazzed about this [1878] I think that naden you know like we one [1880] major issue that we talked about before [1882] that I see a lot of naden guys and girls [1884] that like you know know the platform and [1885] want to make money with it do is like [1888] it's just so much more Technical and [1889] there's usually just some of these more [1890] soft barriers to like actually going and [1892] deploying something like with [1893] self-hosting it's little things like oo [1895] and whatnot that the the the the the [1898] base tends to be more developer friendly [1900] and developer oriented and because it's [1901] more developer friendly and developer [1902] oriented they tend to get caught up in [1904] the weed they don't actually know how to [1904] use it to make money but but I do think [1906] that like you know with this much with [1909] this much uh funding behind it and then [1911] with this growth this massive growth and [1913] dissemination I think it's just a matter [1915] of time before naden gets a lot more [1916] userfriendly as well and they solve [1918] things like the ooth BS or you having to [1920] set up like a Google Cloud console [1922] account for every integration you know [1924] like I think it's just a matter of time [1925] and and when that happens yeah well it's [1928] it's also like I mean my last my first [1930] tech startup actually we would Creed [1932] loads of different businesses in the UK [1934] and every single one of them had a [1935] completely different process and we [1937] wanted to standardize that we were like [1938] Hey we're going to take the bullets for [1940] you br Nick we're gonna like we're going [1941] to deal with all these companies for you [1943] but then every single business needed a [1946] really specific different thing and that [1948] is how you begin to create I I wouldn't [1951] say emotes but it's it's it's good like [1953] if you can integrate and MTP is a good [1955] example with different softwares and [1956] stuff but you the more you can [1957] standardize and simplify what those [1959] processes look like the better more [1961] advantageous that is and they just have [1962] to keep on adding 5% 5% 5% every single [1965] year or every single month or whatever [1966] to make that whole process super simple [1969] make is you know if you're a business [1971] owner it just wants a quick Automation [1973] and you're going to say look na10 may [1975] have X it's just going to be quicker to [1977] do it to make pick up and learn it so [1978] for sure I think that's solvable by n [1981] make doesn't have a you know a patent of [1985] making things simple like anything but [1987] there's like nice little you like it's [1990] actually it comes back to design right [1991] it's how they don't make me think like I [1993] think in this 60 million what I would [1995] like in end is you to hire a freaking be [1999] beef out your UI team beef out like our [2002] sole job is to make this look freaking [2004] sexy and just like that's what I I think [2006] like I genuinely think that you'd be [2008] getting such a good r with that [2009] investment dude same same or like some [2011] simpler hotkeys or or some like [2013] extraordinarily simple onboarding [2015] process that just shows the average [2017] person how to save 30% building or I [2019] don't know it's like it's like little [2020] things when like you add a node like why [2022] do I have to click on that little plus [2023] freaking that little plus button which [2024] is a tiny little thing in order to add [2026] the node you know what I mean like have [2027] some sort of Auto magnet thing on your [2029] cursor like like there are so many these [2030] tiny little ux changes that just like [2032] make it so much easier for and so much [2034] less clunky for newbies that um I think [2037] when they get a yeah when they get [2038] somebody competent on board I'm sure [2040] they'll figure it out well well dude let [2041] me let me ask the next questions either [2043] man so let's say and make okay they're [2045] all converging around okay you know you [2047] seen the PS the controllers right like [2049] you PS5 Xbox they're all the same right [2052] yeah it's and same with cars like give [2054] or take stuff and this idea that like [2056] over time once an industry becomes [2057] mature like there is a a defined like [2060] thing that works we are not there yet [2063] with these no code and AI like platforms [2066] right my question be once you get to [2068] that certain point [2069] like because where we're sort of heading [2071] with this icy is text to automation [2074] that's kind of like the Holy Grail I [2077] mean Zach started with that like I want [2079] an automation connect to my Gmail and [2080] blah blah blah XYZ and the automation [2082] develops where do you see that like [2085] affecting the automation space man like [2087] especially from an agency point of view [2089] I've got some some racy takes on this [2090] but I've interested like looking down [2092] the barrel a couple of years what what [2094] you think is happening with that yeah [2096] man it's it's really cool that you're [2098] you're you're mentioning this because [2100] the way that I've always envisioned this [2102] and I clearly clicked the wrong button [2104] on my lightsaber since it's changing [2105] colors the way that I've always [2106] envisioned this uh working is just like [2109] all cars get more and more aerodynamic [2112] because it's just more like you know [2114] technically efficient um I think all of [2117] our user interfaces will just get closer [2119] and closer and closer to what I'm [2121] calling a uni box okay kind of like [2123] instantly is uni box you you screw [2125] around instantly right instantly yeah [2128] the cold email tool whatever they this [2129] thing called a unibox it's like some big [2131] email thing anyway it's not actually [2133] like that what I guess I mean is um you [2135] know if you have a Mac or whatever and [2136] you press command in space there's this [2137] little Spotlight search thing that pops [2139] up okay imagine that but for just [2141] anything you could ever possibly want to [2143] do so imagine yeah I mean like chat gbt [2146] is already doing this lovable is already [2148] doing this bolts already doing this like [2149] all of these like you know Vibe coding [2151] Builders and even even no code tools [2153] with like the make.com AI assistant you [2155] put in what you want and then it [2157] interprets it in natural language and [2158] it'll actually spin up an interface for [2160] you on the Fly using Code so that you [2164] could do whatever whatever the hell you [2165] want and the more sophisticated this [2167] Market gets alongside the more capable [2169] these tools get I think just the more [2171] that all of them are going to Verge on [2172] this unibox sort of idea just one little [2175] chat box where it's like you know what [2177] do you want to do today I want to do X Y [2179] and Z it goes in on its back end it [2181] spins up like a user interface that's [2183] like specific and relevant and it's good [2185] for you it knows your history it knows [2187] what sorts of user interfaces you like [2189] it knows what sorts of user interfaces [2190] you're good at dealing with and capable [2192] of and then you know like it like whips [2194] it up so I actually think that the moat [2196] of like the vast majority of these SAS [2198] companies is is like you know there [2200] there's a very short amount of time that [2202] we can like actually make a valuable SAS [2205] company or something because in a few [2206] years you'll literally just be able to [2208] type the SAS that you want in the uni [2209] box it'll whip it up for you um [2211] ephemerally for like you know I don't [2212] know like an hour or whatever and then [2214] you'll do the thing that you want you [2215] want to enrich some leads it's like I [2216] want to enrich some leads it'll like [2218] create a little dashboard for you and [2220] then you just like Okay click here to [2221] upload your leads for instance um that's [2223] fascinating yeah I think that's the way [2225] that things are tending I may be wrong [2227] actually yeah that's a really good point [2230] the okay I I would I would like [2232] differentiate that between user and and [2234] business okay yeah good point [2236] differentiation with business is like [2238] which I think you're you're thinking [2239] about as well is it's it's integrating [2243] with their systems because like they [2244] have so many different Legacy systems so [2245] the question is like how do you weave [2247] the things weave these things in for you [2250] and I who were like how do I do with X Y [2253] and Z we'll just be up I actually think [2255] that's a really that's an really [2257] interesting perspective like I thinking [2259] about that actually that like actually [2261] these apps I mean imagine Li b as a one [2263] out of 10 or B not new right what does [2266] five out of 10 look like what does the [2268] 10 out of 10 look like like you are [2269] literally talking genuinely [2271] transformational things like Vibe coding [2272] is so freaking cool I guys like personal [2275] story on this like my last tech startup [2277] I bought on [2277] ctm P him Sweat Equity we so he made [2280] some some cool money if I were [2282] rebuilding that today I wouldn't need to [2284] do [2285] that I wouldn't like genuinely speaking [2287] you could and he's awesome he's very [2289] talented but it wouldn't be necessary [2291] now that's how far the technology is [2293] coming on so this period of sass we've [2296] got this really unique window bro I [2298] think you're right with that where um [2300] basically we've not seen all the sasses [2302] that are being made or being made in [2304] this last year actually come to fruition [2306] yet because what we've done as aable [2307] creatives or business people with tools [2310] to create and effectuate the technology [2312] it used to be the case like when I was [2313] doing like fundraising and I was like [2315] having conversations and [2316] stuff they would say who's the technical [2319] co-founder they almost wanted a [2322] technical co-founder on the team one of [2324] you need to be I said well that is not [2325] me I am not the technical right I can [2329] spell the word technical but I can't Cod [2331] really I can't it's like yeah it was [2333] like it was it was almost like don't [2335] bother unless one of use a Cod like [2338] that's completely like I I don't think [2340] bro like if you said five years ago [2342] they'd say that's never changing and now [2343] it's completely [2344] changed yeah I would I would 100% agree [2346] dude I 100% agree when I saw um if you [2349] guys haven't checked out Jack's video on [2350] how to build like a I think it's called [2352] how to build a 1 million doll sasap with [2354] lovable and stripe or something of that [2356] nature start for bushing but um I like I [2359] just watched it earlier today and I was [2360] like I was blown away I mean I'd play [2361] around a little bit with the stuff but [2363] you know just I could tell you like youd [2365] build a couple of these and you sort of [2366] knew how to like prompt it and you kind [2367] of you know you you you you understood [2369] it uh to a deeper degree than I did but [2371] I just I couldn't believe that there was [2374] this moment where you like you were [2378] trying to hook up the payment feature or [2380] something and then you were like I want [2383] to hook up this payment feature and then [2384] I think it said okay great just Supply [2386] me your private key and this and then [2388] you were like you copied and pasted the [2390] private key and this and it's like all [2391] right cool I'm setting it up right now I [2393] couldn't believe that because when I set [2395] up my my SAS app um for one second copy [2399] which is my my old content writing [2400] company which we skilled a 92k a month [2403] we we spent probably like like a week [2406] dude just trying to hook up stripe to [2409] the back end to be able to process [2411] credit you did it in like five minutes [2413] max it was insane to me like my job was [2416] I was like you can do that [ __ ] [2419] sometimes it feels like if I'm not [2420] constantly scrolling through thousands [2423] of lines of new AI news and using every [2426] tool that I'll miss out but I understand [2428] that that's the exact trap that I try [2429] and get people in my community to avoid [2431] which is the shiny object syndrome still [2433] though I think Vibe coding more [2434] generally is just a movement is dope as [2436] hell man and I think that um I was [2438] thinking about like you know you know [2440] how you and I were talking about [2441] potentially creating a sass of some kind [2442] and how our SAS we would want it to be [2444] something simple something [2446] extraordinarily straightforward and [2447] something that just adds a tiny bit of [2448] value to a process that people in our [2450] Niche are doing on a daily basis anyway [2452] some sort of lead enrichment or some [2454] sort of qualification or scoring or some [2455] sort of autores I don't know like [2457] there's a million of things that we [2458] could do obviously and I was thinking [2460] about it and you know we were chatting [2461] we're like hm should we hire you know [2462] should we hire somebody if so how are we [2463] going to hire somebody what sort of like [2464] responsibility should we give them to [2465] help us with this stuff like dude when I [2468] see that I'm like do we even need to [2470] hire somebody bro like are you just [2473] going to be the dev you know what I mean [2475] just G sprinkle on some lovable magic or [2476] some bolt. Dev magic or whatever and [2478] we'll just like make the app in like [2480] three hours and and start selling it it [2482] dude it is genuinely phenomenal and like [2485] this Vibe cating and Sass that like that [2487] the brother and sister in the way it's [2489] like the thing I would say bro and like [2491] it's interesting to talk about that [2492] video particular because like if you [2494] want to spin up a minimal viable product [2496] right so in other words hey we've got [2498] this cool idea we think people are going [2499] to dig it uh the idea right is short as [2501] path towards how do I validate that hey [2503] someone thinks this is cool and they [2505] want to buy it this is amazing for that [2507] I mean it's amazing for for you can [2509] build for applications of course [2510] actually though you can spin this up in [2512] an hour like we did in the video and you [2514] can put it in front of a customer who [2516] can put their credit card details in and [2518] buy it it was like you know and actually [2520] guys you could have that fully and maybe [2523] you don't even have cryp attack I mean [2524] we used to say like um the classic MVP [2526] you you'll probably laugh at this make [2527] you remember this was website image buy [2530] now and you just track the number of [2532] clicks on [2533] it like now you can actually deliver the [2535] product as well right deliver the [2538] product at the same time if you can [2540] think it and you're willing to sit in [2541] front of a computer with a coffee and [2542] enough time you can make it happen and [2544] that's what's really flipping cool [2546] essentially it's this theory of [2547] constraints like there's a constraining [2549] factor and I I've had to T Dar this from [2551] my point of view it's like we've now [2553] removed the constraining factor from [2555] technology to somewhere else that's [2557] that's kind of what's Happening here and [2558] it doesn't there's no value in having a [2561] super duper Cod I mean like what we need [2562] to look at is like what are the big guys [2564] doing Mata for example um you look at [2566] what they're doing with their devs and [2567] what are the devs doing now like the [2569] number of jobs available for developers [2571] like realistically when I was when I was [2573] at school um they were saying you need [2575] to learn coding if you want to live in [2577] the in the in the future right which is [2579] so I don't know if you heard that bro [2581] but they yeah totally B said to like you [2582] got to L code you got to L code you have [2584] to L code I even knew of a guy who [2586] changed his complete career over to Cody [2589] because he thought this is going to be [2591] safe [2593] and and I think Safety and Security [2596] attached to skill sets is going away [2598] like there is no jum anymore there is [2601] know if I just can do this you need to [2603] play Infinite games you need to attach [2605] yourself to different things and with [2607] the S that Nick and I were talking about [2609] we were thinking well weren't we bro in [2611] terms of what are the most common [2613] problems that you and I see that we [2615] think we could solve in a really crisp [2617] beautiful beautifully designed place [2619] that delivers it really quickly and [2621] whatever the thing is it does that if we [2623] stick to doing that we wouldn't get [2625] married with technology we would say hey [2626] we'll just figure out what works what [2627] needs to be done and then deliver [2629] it yeah we'll figure works now and that [2632] is probably not what going to be what is [2633] working in a year from now but that's a [2635] cool thing I love your point around [2637] there is no skill-based job security [2640] anymore I think there's a meta skill [2642] which is learning skills and I think [2643] that that's really the thing basically [2645] being high agency is the skill you know [2647] if you're a high agency person and if [2648] you can like if that's the skill that [2650] you improve your entire life then it [2652] doesn't matter what skill is in or out [2654] of fashion at that moment in time like [2656] you'll you'll figure it out and I mean [2658] yeah you know I I'm I'm really grateful [2660] to entrepreneurship for letting me [2661] cultivate that high agency skill I don't [2662] think you need to be an entrepreneur I [2664] don't think you need to start a business [2665] in order to do that but a lot of the [2666] time in order to succeed in business you [2668] do need to be high agency so it filters [2669] people out right as well bro that like [2672] it's actually baffling to me and I we're [2676] probably in a like a I'm say we not not [2680] I wouldn't say an echo chamber but we [2681] are in everyone that you and I see and [2683] think about on a daily basis you know [2685] wakes up saying the word AI but like you [2688] know my sister for example she's a HR [2690] professional you know she does she does [2692] well what she does she doesn't even use [2693] chat GPT I went to a dentist Nick and [2696] the guy was like hey Jack have you ever [2697] heard of trat GPT I was like [2700] never you're like nope tell me yeah [2703] what's it doing these days and you he [2705] was a degree educated early 30s like [2709] even this other gu SP how what do you [2710] use AI for and I I I constantly find [2713] myself having these questions like I [2715] don't know this is probably more people [2717] than not actually who are not even at [2719] the chat GPT level yet we we are so far [2722] at the edge of the stuff that's [2724] happening it's easy to forget actually [2726] the the demand V is this a [2728] plot absolutely and also I think now [2731] that you're putting it that way the The [2734] Leverage that people like us have [2736] because we're so early is massive if you [2738] think about it you were talking about [2739] your dentist earlier in chat GPT right [2741] like if that dentist used flexible AI [2744] processes in their firm or you know in [2747] their clinic or whatever how much more [2748] efficient or effective would that [2750] business be I think it boils down to you [2752] and I and other creators in the space [2754] essentially having a responsibility [2757] almost like a duty to literally make the [2760] economy more efficient because if 99.9% [2763] of people don't even know how to drag [2765] and drop a module across the screen and [2767] we are of the gifted minority of people [2769] that do and if we help a business drag [2770] and drop a module across the screen we [2772] can impact the lives of you know [2773] hundreds or thousands of people at that [2774] dental clinic over the course of the [2776] next years like doesn't that isn't that [2778] just such a beautiful isn't that just [2780] such a beautiful thing Jack to like be [2781] able to help people do so at like one of [2783] the highest points of Leverage this [2784] early on in all of this massive [2786] explosion of Technology [2787] I I agree bro and if you think about [2789] like how much wealth generation is [2792] happening at at the moment people it's [2795] like there's created value and captured [2797] value and that's the captured value but [2798] the actual trickle down created value of [2801] that like the jobs that exist that never [2803] existed before the people that are now [2805] able to quit and do different things [2806] like the economical impacts of what we [2809] do in in AI automation is insane [2813] actually like if you really think about [2814] it like in for example if you would just [2816] to break down step by step right you [2819] create content on a automation awesome [2821] then a client sees that says Hey I want [2823] to work with Nick I'd like to work with [2824] Jack or whatever and then they go and [2826] they do this they implement the [2827] processes they have like a core marginal [2829] effect on their business they can then [2831] hire new people so now you know Steve [2834] McQueen that lives at 72 bendo Avenue [2836] has now got a job because the dentist [2838] has my money inable Capital to hire one [2840] to do V and it's like it's like the [2841] trickle down economics of it are [2843] freaking unbelievable which is why I'm [2845] I'm kind of like I'm optimistic about um [2848] markets in general at the moment because [2849] we've not seen the full effect of AI [2852] really across his businesses so I I [2855] think that's something that you know I'm [2856] thinking about little bit at the moment [2857] it's like okay knowing what I know about [2859] the fact that the actual technology [2862] because like some people compare it to [2864] like cryptocurrency in a sense which I [2866] think it's very different than that but [2868] they they say one comparable Factor [2870] could be the Hy but the key difference [2872] is this is actually changing like I I [2874] can point to a billion examples of how [2876] this is actually in the real world [2878] change the way people do things you [2880] couldn't really say that for some of the [2881] Technologies necessarily so dude that [2884] blows my mind and I think like the [2885] economic impacts absolutely huge all [2887] that to say now is the best time ever to [2890] get involved and learn this skill set uh [2892] and it's I don't know if you think of [2894] this but it's you will never complete it [2896] you are you are essentially becoming a [2898] lifelong learner of this [2899] technology you are essentially [2901] committing yourself to indentured [2902] servitude of shiny objects engine just [2905] like a hell of your own making exactly [2907] yeah 100% bro I [2909] could hell yeah Jack listen man anything [2911] else you wanted to cover dude I think [2913] that's beautiful I think we covered some [2915] fresh stuff um dude I think that was [2917] beautifully said man me too man I'm [2918] really stoked to get this podcast out if [2920] you guys don't already know Jack please [2922] make sure to check out that lovely [2924] YouTube channel of his I'm also seeing [2926] you pop up all over Instagram and [2928] Linkedin um really appreciate your time [2930] my man looking forward to the next one [2932] good to see you cheers

Title: I Studied 200 Automation Agencies: Here's What Works In 2025
[0] hey so I just finished breaking down 200 [2] AI automation agencies for my community [4] of 1400 maker school to figure out [6] exactly what is working today in the AI [9] automation agency space exactly how [11] people are hitting $10,000 a month and [13] Beyond with this business model and what [15] I'm basically doing in this video it's [17] just breaking it all down for you and [18] giving you guys a bunch of strategies [20] okay so I don't know what this dude's [22] name is it's handsome fow I see him all [24] the time but hopefully this is going to [25] be you at the end of this video printing [26] money not for the US government this [28] time the disclaimer here is uh this is [32] what works in 2025 so if you're watching [34] this video in 2027 or 2029 who knows um [37] you know the internet May last until the [39] end of time just know that you know uh [42] approaches in any Market tend to work [44] really well initially and then they just [46] tend to reduce Effectiveness over time [47] so just my due diligence here you if [50] you're watching this really far in the [51] future I'm not saying that this approach [52] is still going to work what I'm saying [53] is that they're working right now and I [55] want you to focus Less on the [56] particulars of the approach that I'm [57] showing you and then more on just the [59] deeper [60] underlying uh I guess the the the the [62] underlying theme or the underlying [64] strategy as opposed to the the tactics [66] because you know tactics change strategy [68] Remains the Same speaking of strategy [70] the very first thing I'm going to touch [71] on is what I'm calling asset-based cold [74] Outreach so basically uh probably a [77] third of the people that are printing [78] money right now in a automation agency [80] are doing some sort of asset based cold [81] Outreach and what this means just in [83] layman's terms this is you [85] right and you are sad and this is your [88] prospect and the prospect ECT is really [90] busy and who knows maybe they're a [92] little bit [92] angry and uh anyway uh in order to get [96] their attention what you need to do is [97] you need to give them something right in [98] order for you know for them to want to [100] actually spend a second in chat with you [101] you need to give them something so what [102] asset based cold Outreach is you [104] basically go and you create an asset and [106] you actually just give it to them and in [108] exchange for that okay what they do is [110] they just give you um it's supposed to [113] be my rendition of a clock a few moments [115] of their time where you can essentially [116] make your pitch okay then after that [118] happens you are happy and then their [120] weird face is also happy that's what a [123] happy person looks like so there are a [125] couple of different ways to do this um [127] but I want you to know that this is this [128] is working really well right now and the [129] reason why is because the bar for Value [131] just continues to go up in cold Outreach [133] uh what people were doing before is what [135] I like to call personalized but boring [137] what we would do is we would take data [139] using some lead aggregator the simplest [141] and easiest one was Apollo okay and for [143] those of you guys that don't know Apollo [145] it's just like this big lead database [147] that allows you to list a bunch of [148] people first name last name Title [150] Company LinkedIn profile email address [152] and stuff and then you know for a fee [155] you could essentially extract that and [156] then get that in a big CSV file or [158] something and then you know add that to [159] your cold email campaign the thing about [161] Apollo is it was really expensive right [163] so um because it was really expensive [165] people basically found a bunch of [166] third-party workarounds and one of the [167] ways that people um got Apollo data [169] without actually paying for it all was [171] this platform called appify now appify [173] is just a big scraping Marketplace [175] allows you to scrape whatever the hell [176] you want including Twitter posts [178] Facebook posts Instagram posts whatnot [181] and essentially what people did is they [182] took appify then use that to scrape a [184] bunch of Apollo leads and then just get [186] that CSV that I was telling you about [187] except instead of a ton of money just be [189] a little bit of money okay and what do [191] you get at the end of the step you [192] basically just get a spreadsheet and you [195] know in the spreadsheet you have like [196] the name you have like the URL of their [198] LinkedIn profile you have you know [200] hopefully their email and a bunch of [202] stuff okay the thing is this approach [204] did not yield enough data to really do [206] meaningful um personalized Outreach with [208] so what people would do after that is [210] they would pass it through some sort of [211] thirdparty API okay like lead magic or I [215] don't know derek. apppp or or Derek Dash [218] app or something and basically these are [220] just like approaches where if you feed [222] in a LinkedIn profile this URL that I [224] was telling you about to this service [225] lead magic or um Derek Dasa you could [229] basically turn that you know big CSV [233] into an even more detailed file that [235] also included a bunch of additional [236] information like what the person wrote [238] in their LinkedIn summary what the [239] person wrote their bio uh maybe you [241] could scrape posts and stuff like that [242] and you know once you have all this data [245] finally you would take all of this stuff [247] here okay all of this then you would [250] feed it into a cold email platform and [253] there are a variety of cold email [253] platform big one is instantly right now [256] there's another one called smart lead [257] which I'll jump to and basically these [259] cold email platforms I appear to have [261] jumped on the pricing page these cold [263] email platforms um just take all of that [265] uh data and then allow you to like send [267] emails unmas to these people okay so [269] look at that happy camper over here he's [271] happy because he got a personalized [273] email um same thing with you know smart [276] lead and a bunch of these other cold [277] email platforms all right so that was [279] the previous approach and I'm just I'm [281] just telling you guys all this because I [282] want everybody to be on the same page in [283] terms of context that was the exact [285] thing that people were doing under the [286] hood right this is like the secret [288] strategy um and and you know you can [290] still produce results with this you can [291] still make money with this but um you [293] can't make as much money is if you use [294] this approach here which new which a lot [296] more people are doing now and that [298] approach is basically where instead of [301] you just personalizing a piece of [303] Outreach and you know sending out an [305] email saying like hey Peter I saw that [307] you're running uh this company and I I [310] love that it's like a I don't know like [311] a B2B manufacturing business and I only [313] work with B2B manufacturing businesses [315] instead of just telling people that oh [317] my God this emails are customized what [318] you do is you actually show them by [320] giving them something that solves a [322] problem now normally this would take a [325] ton of time effort and work but now in [327] the age of AI and abundance you can [330] stuff that's valuable in half a second [332] assuming you have access to the right [333] data so let me just break this down for [336] just like we had before we have this [337] Apollo okay so we have the lead source [341] and then we usually have some way to [342] scrape that so appify in this case so [344] instead of it costing a $3 signs it only [347] cost $1 sign but now we have a bunch of [349] additional steps in between and what I [350] like to do with these steps I like to [352] call them my enrichment steps so we'll [355] get all of the data from apify which [357] includes a CSV with like the the website [360] of the person and the LinkedIn profile [361] whatever and then what we do is we [363] actually send that through like a flow [364] using a no code tool something like [366] make.com for instance or something like [370] nadn okay and these tools essentially [372] allow you to just drag and drop and do [374] do some do some automation for those of [375] you guys that are you know just entering [377] the industry and holy crap did naden [378] just changed their website yes they did [380] that's the sexiest thing I've ever seen [382] and then uh what you do with this is you [385] basically create flows that scrape the [386] person's website and give you a ton of [388] information about you know their website [390] and their offerings and stuff so you go [391] on every page of their website and [392] scrape them scrape their social media so [394] you check out their Instagram their [395] Twitter their LinkedIn everything and [397] then scrape I don't know maybe they have [399] a podcast you scrape their podcast you [400] scrape all the content that's basically [402] about them on the Internet you can do [403] this with a perplexity search or there a [404] variety of different ways but basically [406] what you do as a result of this is now [407] you know in that spreadsheet that I [408] showed you guys earlier well now you [410] have a ton more data you have name you [413] have I don't know like um like last post [416] post one post two post three and so on [421] and so on and so on and so forth you [422] have all the podcasts you have [424] everything that you could possibly need [425] so now once once you have all this data [426] in a spreadsheet somewhere what do you [427] do well now you just feed it into [430] Ai and you ask AI hey uh and this really [433] depends on your pitch and depends on [434] your Market depend what you're going [436] after but you could do something like [437] hey you know I want you to create 22 [440] titles for YouTube videos for this [443] person based off of all of the [445] information on their website and based [446] off of what is currently working right [448] now and AI [450] can then add that to something like a [451] Google Document or maybe some sort of [453] text file or maybe upload it to a a a [456] you know notion page or something and [459] then when you do the Outreach you do the [460] same customized Outreach you did before [462] but now you also do it with that gift [464] that I was telling you guys about [465] earlier okay and um that is definitely [468] not how you draw a present but that's [470] just we're going to use our imagination [471] here folks so now what you do is you [473] hand it to them on a silver platter and [474] you say hey here's a bunch of free stuff [478] you like this free stuff you want more [480] well reply and then I'll figure it all [482] out for you and that's how you get [483] somebody interested in your offer okay [485] so this isn't hypothetical like I've [487] gotten a ton of the stuff um a lot of [489] other people you know probably a bunch [490] of people that are watching this video [491] gotten a ton of stuff here's a quick [492] example of one of these things from a [494] guy that actually ended up working with [495] just because I was so blown away by it [497] he sent me an email and he basically [498] said hey Nick I've written 22 titles for [500] you that you can use right now to [501] improve your CTR let me know what you [504] think Rock PS I've got a full YouTube [505] script ready for you Nick it's [507] complimentary to number one rule for a [508] automations reply to my email and I'll [510] send it to you then what did he do he [511] literally you know I don't know if he [513] used AI automation for this or he wrote [514] it in S I have no idea but then he [516] basically just spammed me with 20 [518] whatever titles 22 it looks like um and [522] think about it from my perspective as a [523] YouTube Creator like this stuff's [524] actually pretty valuable to me you know [526] one of the main bottlenecks in my [527] business is the creation of titles he [528] just he literally just whether he did it [530] himself or he had a do it he just solved [532] a problem for me and he solved the [534] problem for me before he even asked me [535] for anything and then the email he [537] basically just said hey Nick here is 22 [539] titles for you I'm not asking for [540] anything but if you like them let me [541] know and maybe I'll make you some more [543] okay and you know what was my impression [545] my impression was damn this guy knows [546] how to freaking do business okay [547] absolutely I responded to them and and [548] we did you know we did a pretty quick [550] deal um so there you know there are a [553] few dozen people in my community right [554] now that are doing this exact approach [556] they're not doing YouTube titles because [557] obviously they're AI automation agencies [559] that are specializing in slightly [560] different things but they might do like [562] a one-click CRM build they might do some [564] sort of cold email template series or [566] sequence that's customized they might do [568] a whole newsletter for a business that [570] they generate in one second the point [572] isn't necessarily that that asset needs [574] to be incredible okay the point is that [576] it needs to be so hyper customized that [579] the person on the other end of the line [580] gets the impression that you sat down [582] literally physically sat down for 2 [584] hours research everything about them [586] then created it and handed it to them [588] before you even asked for a second of [589] their time because that is just the best [591] impression that you can give in cold [592] Outreach um you know like we're we're as [596] technology and as this industry gets [598] more mature and more sophisticated [599] basically the bar for what is considered [601] good quality Outreach is going to [602] continue to go up and that is so far [604] ahead of what everybody else is doing [605] that it's virtually like an an an [607] instant win I would say so that's a [610] strategy that's working right now I have [611] systems all over my YouTube that show [614] how to build stuff just like this I have [616] systems that show you guys how to [616] generate assets PDFs using um Ai and [619] some sort of data source I have tons of [621] videos on how to use Apollo and appify [623] to scrape data get stuff from social [625] media scrape people's websites and so on [627] and so forth um I'm just going to leave [628] a little link up ahead if you guys want [630] to watch the first one in my big series [632] and yeah you know take it from there do [634] whatever you have to do make it [635] work okay the second really big strategy [638] that's working right now and this has [640] been working for a couple of years but [641] I'm seeing this applied to a automation [644] um specifically because you know we're a [645] very technical audience and people tend [647] to get lost in the product but basically [649] it's sales before product okay little [653] Amazon Smiley um before you build an [657] automation or a system or template or [660] your product try selling it and then [663] only when somebody responds positively [665] to you only when somebody's actually [668] down to maybe buy the thing or maybe not [670] buy the thing but like explore a little [672] bit more about the thing only then do [674] you actually sit down and build it now I [676] know this Probably sounds crazy and a [677] lot of people are like Nick that's just [679] Bonkers why would you sell something [680] that you don't even have how can you be [682] sure that that quality product is good [684] and the reality is right now okay as of [686] the time of this video that doesn't [687] matter and if you try and do everything [690] right and 100% by the book you're just [691] not going to make it the industry is [692] moving too quickly so this is what a lot [694] of people a lot of AI automation people [696] being you know technical um and you know [698] like more from like a programming or [700] developer background this is more or [701] less what everybody's doing so they'll [703] do some market research I see this all [704] the time in my community um they'll [706] spend like you know two or three days [708] compiling a bunch of stuff they'll like [709] read through communities of like a [710] particular Niche videography is is my [712] go-to so they'll like they'll go [714] videography [715] communities then they'll like look for a [717] bunch of communities here and then [718] they'll scroll top to bottom and they'll [719] look for pain points and then they'll do [721] a bunch of you know total addressable [722] Market whatever they have some little [723] report at the end of and they're like [724] okay this is a good idea I should [725] probably do this and then what they'll [727] do is they'll be like okay so what are [728] problems that they're facing okay it's [730] this problem so I don't know their video [732] production pipelines suck I'm going to [733] develop a [735] product and so you know after that what [738] do they do then they spend you know a [740] week or two building this thing then [742] only after they're done building this [743] thing doing like backbreaking labor and [745] spending I don't know like I've seen [747] people spend like 3 four weeks building [748] like a simple set of make.com templates [750] or something it's pretty crazy then [751] they'll try and sell it and then this [753] try and sell it period this might take [755] another three or four weeks and then [756] they realize that it fails okay and then [758] it takes them like another week to just [760] muster up the courage to try again and [762] then they freaking go back so this whole [764] cycle is like six or seven weeks man if [766] you go through two of these Cycles you [768] could have built a whole lifestyle [769] business in in the meantime you just [771] wasted an entire like business cycle a [773] zero to 10 or or 20K you know Journey [776] it's crazy and so don't do this I don't [780] really know how else to instill upon [782] this point but but the age of Costco you [785] know uh is it with a c a t I think it's [788] with a t Costco's whole like build it [790] and they will come methodology where [792] they put a bunch of warehouses in the [793] middle of nowhere and their products are [794] just so damn good that everybody comes [796] that doesn't work for this industry that [797] doesn't work for um our current ERA of [800] technology that doesn't really work for [801] startups okay what we need to do is we [803] need to validate our product as quickly [804] as humanly possible so instead of build [806] it we you know build it and then they [807] will come I say sell [810] it and once they're [813] here then build [818] it now it doesn't sound as nice it [820] doesn't roll off the tongue but um we'll [823] just say Nick surve 2025 just FY I want [826] just quote me on this one doesn't sound [828] as nice but trust me when I say this is [830] this is what everybody that wins does [831] okay what does that actually look like [833] in um you know like if we just like [835] examine a little flowchart here you sell [837] first okay you validate fast and then [840] finally you build after so that six to [842] 7even we pipeline before well you're [843] still going to do your market research [844] for maybe a couple days then you're [846] going to come up with an idea which [847] might take you a couple days then you're [849] going to try and sell it maybe you'll [850] give yourself like a week to sell it and [852] then guess what if it fails how long is [853] this Loop now this Loop is now maybe [855] like 9 to 10 [857] days instead of six to seven weeks so [860] you are six to seven times [862] faster and concommittant you know if I [865] could just um show you guys kind of what [868] what the growth rate of a company that [870] does this versus that other company [871] looks like I'd say it's about six to [873] seven times faster if that green one is [875] somebody that's doing this approach this [877] orange one is somebody that's doing like [878] the traditional build and they will come [879] approach okay and I mean like what you [881] know if you're at like 13 or 14 weeks [884] and you're staring down the barrel of a [885] freaking bottle or gun or bottle or [887] whatever the hell you want to you want [888] to stare down the barrel of um you know [891] and you have very little Runway left you [892] have no money I mean like that that [894] that's a big gap that might be like [895] $100,000 right that's a lot don't don't [898] let yourself be that orange line I [900] guess and then the benefit is you know [902] after you've succeeded then you spend [903] the hours building so you're basically [905] only spending time and energy on things [906] that you have verified people actually [908] want and the second that you like do [910] this two or three times Well you [911] basically have like a a list of [913] templates or a list of products that you [915] can legitimately sell usually for months [917] on end I mean you know these systems [918] tend to solve core problems and it's not [920] that they're so like these these are [922] these are core long-lasting problems [924] these aren't like automation problems [925] you know what I mean it's like lead [926] generation that's a core problem you [928] figure out that like a specific spe type [929] of company wants a specific type of lead [930] generation and they're willing to pay a [932] lot of money for it you could sell that [933] thing for for months or years you could [935] make a ton of money off of it you could [936] build your whole life around it you know [938] that's kind of how I feel with my [939] initial cold email I reach system [940] proposal generator system and then some [942] of the crms that I was selling I mean [943] you know I essentially built my business [944] around these [945] things okay big thing number three that [948] I see winners do that I typically see [950] losers kind of screw up and I say losers [953] here in a relative term but you know at [954] the end of the day business is a game [956] you know when you get into the AI and [957] automation industry you you can kind of [959] pretend you're playing a game of a game [960] of chess or something right the people [962] that tend to fail at that game of chess [963] just tend to get a little bit bogged [964] down in the complexity of things like [966] self hosting so what is the number one [970] Contender for you know worst contributor [973] to this problem right now um naden okay [975] naden as we all know is blown the hell [978] up right now I mean they just had [979] changed their beautiful website look [980] super sexy probably pay a designer off a [983] whole mansion in order to make it happen [985] naden is awesome and it's gaining a ton [987] of market share really quickly but what [989] I find is somebody that has been in the [990] space for the better part of the last [992] couple years and that you know who [993] focuses primarily not on um you know how [996] cool the systems that I can build look [997] and all amazing AI agents with the [999] quadrillion tools that look like a piece [1000] of spaghetti you know I focus on the [1002] amount of money that you can drive from [1003] this stuff people that start with nadn [1006] they tend to be a little bit more [1007] technically oriented and then they just [1008] tend to get bogged down like the the the [1009] technicalities of self-hosting and stuff [1011] and the issue with self-hosting is not [1013] that self-hosting itself sucks it's just [1015] that it requires a fair amount of [1016] expertise to figure out and then it adds [1019] like a ton of additional complexity to [1020] the process of actually building [1021] something for a client so what [1023] self-hosting does I find is it gives you [1025] the illusion that you're making all this [1026] progress and that you're moving forward [1028] and you figured out how to do your [1029] environment variables or whatever but [1031] you don't actually make money with it [1032] because you're not actually driving [1033] actionable business outcomes so naden is [1035] actually a really poor Contender for [1036] this I find and you know I'm just [1038] telling you guys what I see in my [1040] community I'm not trying to knock a [1041] platform here I love naden I use it all [1042] the time but uh you know if if if I [1044] could create a ratio between like the [1046] the people that start with make.com [1048] versus the people that start with nadn [1049] and then how much money they make within [1050] maybe a month or two and the people that [1052] start with [1053] make.com i I got to take a survey but my [1056] gut feeling is it's at least two to 3x [1058] than the people that serve with niden [1059] just because the people serve with n [1061] just get bogged down the technicalities [1062] okay so um yeah I just picked a couple [1065] of platforms here to show you guys like [1066] obviously you know I've been a big [1067] make.com fan for quite a while I built [1069] my whole you know um um AI automation [1071] coaching business starting with make.com [1073] so I can't recommend make.com enough it [1076] costs a little bit more on the front end [1077] but because it's totally self uh a cloud [1079] hosted you know you don't have to deal [1080] with any of the implementation you don't [1081] have to deal with any like the actual [1083] setting up or renting a server you do [1085] pay substantially more in the front end [1086] than something like a self-hosted NN [1087] setup but typically what you're doing is [1089] you're paying and then what you receive [1091] in return is a ton of your time and [1092] energy back and the ability to like very [1094] quickly gets things like ooth up and [1096] running so I'm a big fan of that um I [1098] don't really know why I threw the vapy [1099] logo in here I guess I just like vapy [1101] hello vapy how you doing anyway focus on [1103] cloud Solutions wherever possible you [1106] know uh if if there's uh two options [1108] that you have okay the first is go [1110] through some lengthy thing to set up a [1112] server and uh you know like put all this [1115] time and energy into making sure the [1116] server works right and get all the bells [1119] and whistles to make sure that like your [1121] process time costs as few operations as [1123] possible if if you're putting all that [1125] time and effort in what you're basically [1126] doing is you're doing another version of [1128] building the product before you start [1130] selling I would say if these products [1132] come out of the box and they work [1134] perfectly and all you have to do is pay [1135] like 30 or 40 or 50 bucks a month extra [1137] in order to have that product um well [1139] take that product sell it first and then [1141] worry about all that hosting and all [1142] that super high efficiency stuff later [1144] on down the [1145] line okay the last thing I'm going to [1148] talk about is what I'm calling Omni [1149] Channel lead generation um I see a lot [1151] of people doing this and I think the [1152] reason why this works is if we just zoom [1154] out a bit if you use Omni Channel Legion [1156] in concert with asset based cold [1158] Outreach you're basically maximizing the [1160] probability that somebody actually sees [1161] the asset that you spent a little bit [1163] more time and energy making like if you [1165] think about it this flow right over here [1166] this might actually cost you something [1168] every time that you run this thing you [1169] know you're going to have to spend a few [1170] cents scraping via appify then you're [1172] going to have to spend a few cents on [1174] maybe the operations in your no code [1175] tool or the large language model tokens [1177] to process all this stuff then you're [1179] going to have to spend some money for [1179] the cold email platform right so if you [1181] think about it you know if if we've just [1183] dumped all this money in then logically [1185] speaking and and we made this amazing [1187] asset and the probability of the person [1188] responding to us if they see the assets [1190] really high what's the bottleneck in our [1192] process the Bott is them seeing the [1193] asset so that's where Omni Channel Leen [1195] comes in and basically um you know the [1197] whole purpose of this [1199] is it maximizes the [1202] probability of people [1206] seeing our super high quality [1210] asset let me give you guys some context [1213] um before what a lot of people were [1215] doing is they were like just sending an [1216] email okay and in reality emails or I [1220] don't know upwork [1223] apps or I don't know posts on social [1225] media or whatever these have a low [1229] probability of being seen if you send [1231] somebody a cold email and you even have [1234] like some minor issue with maybe your [1235] deliverability or something nowadays [1238] people get so many of these things and [1240] so many people Mark things to spam and [1242] and you know these email pixel things [1246] automatically open the contents of the [1247] email and they use it to like AI [1248] summarize like Google and Outlook does [1251] they have such a low likelihood of [1252] actually seeing your asset that it's [1254] almost like why the hell did you even [1255] make it to begin with like if you're [1256] spending I don't know even like 10 10 [1258] cents okay which is actually quite a bit [1260] of money if you think about it per [1263] lead then basically what you're doing is [1266] before the person has even seen it you [1267] spend 10 cents okay in order for one [1270] person to see your Outreach you spent 50 [1272] cents and then what's the probability [1274] that they're actually going to get back [1275] to you or something I mean man that [1276] might be like $5 so what are you doing [1278] now you're just spending $5 for somebody [1280] to say no to you more or less and how [1282] many people how many NOS does it take to [1283] get a yes I don't know maybe 40 well [1286] maybe uh I don't know eight and then how [1288] many yeses does it take to actually like [1290] sign a deal and like get on a you know [1292] get on a get on some sort of uh offer [1295] with you I don't know it could be like [1296] 10 so maybe you're spending $400 to [1298] acquire like a a $1,000 CLI well now you [1301] just spent you know 40% of your margin [1303] anyway I I do this to show you guys my [1305] thoughts on how I think about acquiring [1306] business and um cost per acquisition [1309] which is extraordinarily important and [1310] also to show you guys where that [1311] bottleneck is okay if you send a super [1314] customized piece of Outreach to somebody [1316] and there's only a 20% chance that they [1317] see it that means 80% of the time you're [1319] just throwing money away what people are [1321] doing now is they're doing multiple [1323] channels now if we were to say send an [1326] email that contains our asset send an [1328] igdm that contains our asset saying send [1330] a LinkedIn request that contains our [1332] asset and then also send an X message [1333] that contains our asset mathematically [1336] speaking the way that this works and [1338] this is some statistical thing that I [1339] just had to ask chat gbt about there's a [1341] term and one of you guys can tell me [1342] what it is um there's a 59% chance that [1344] they'll see it okay these aren't [1346] additive um but if you have a 20% chance [1348] sending of getting an email scene 20% [1350] chance of getting an Instagram DM scene [1351] 20% chance of getting a LinkedIn request [1353] scene and then a 20% chance of getting [1354] an X message scene well now you've [1356] basically tripled your [1358] odds and so right off the front end [1361] because you have this super valuable [1362] thing that'll basically guarantee you a [1364] conversation if it just gets in front of [1366] them you've tripled your odds of that [1368] happening and you basically this this [1369] one strategy here will like 3x um what [1373] is called your throughput which are the [1374] number of leads that you you can push [1376] through your pipeline so you know this [1378] is something that you can't do in [1379] isolation this is sort of like a a [1381] strategy or a hack to use in concert [1383] with some sort of approach like um as I [1386] was mentioning up you're an asset based [1387] cold Outreach but it's something that's [1388] working really really well right now and [1390] a couple of other ways that you can [1391] apply this and that I've seen people [1392] apply this are like uper caps um people [1394] will make a custom asset for the upwork [1397] job post that they are applying to like [1399] they will take the job description [1400] they'll feed it through Ai and then now [1402] that it's fed through AI um they'll go [1405] and make a Google doc with it then [1406] they'll go and they'll make like an [1407] actual system to make.com blueprint with [1409] it using AI you can do that by the way [1411] then they'll attach all the stuff inside [1412] of the Google Doc send it alongside [1414] their upwork application along with the [1415] loom video right but it's like okay we [1417] just spent like 50 cents doing that plus [1418] a few minutes of my time making that [1420] video so how do I maximize the [1421] probability of that being seen well you [1423] take all the client account information [1425] and then you find the person and then [1426] you know you apply um not only on upwork [1429] but you send them an email you hit them [1430] up on social media do all that stuff I [1432] should not that that is not allowed by [1433] the upwork terms of service I've just [1435] seen some AI automation agencies do it [1437] alongside other people so you'd have to [1438] do that at your own risk um but yeah [1440] that's a big strategy that I've seen [1441] working super well and you know as I [1443] mentioned at the beginning of this video [1445] These are strategies at the end of the [1447] day I don't want you to F to pay [1448] attention to the very particulars of the [1450] tactics that I'm talking about because [1452] these tactics are going to work [1453] realistically for a couple of months and [1455] then they're not going to work as well [1456] if you spend a dollar and then right now [1458] you're making $10 on one of these you [1460] know in six months you'll spend a dollar [1462] and you'll make $5 right these things [1463] will just grow less effective as time uh [1465] with time as more people use them but if [1468] if you pay attention to the core [1469] fundamentals here the things that drive [1471] all of these strategies they tend to be [1473] things like personalization giving [1476] people a ton of value upfront before you [1478] make any sort of ask um getting up and [1480] running not waiting for perfect [1482] conditions before you start um operating [1485] with lower levels of certainty even if [1486] you don't know what you're selling or [1488] whether you can build a product you go [1489] out there and sell it anyway and these [1491] are more like core foundational themes [1493] that any positive um any fast growing [1496] business owner usually has in their back [1498] pocket that have resulted in these [1499] tactics so if you understand the the [1501] deeper themes you'll be able to recreate [1502] these tactics when the time comes and [1504] when you inevitably need new ones all [1506] right I think I'm done you yapping for [1507] the day good to be back if anybody has [1509] any questions about this stuff just drop [1510] me down a comment below more than happy [1512] to help out or answer if you guys are [1514] into building your own Ai and automation [1516] agencies from scratch definitely check [1518] out maker school we got over 1,400 [1520] members in there right now really [1521] appreciate the time have a lovely rest [1523] of the day I'll catch you on the next [1524] video cheers

Title: MCP Explained in 31 Minutes (Without The Hype)
[0] now that open aai has officially offered [1] their support for mCP it is basically [4] confirmed model context protocol is [6] going to be the aient framework today [8] I'm going to explain what mCP is without [10] the hype and without the fluff this [12] video is suitable for complete beginners [13] so even if you guys have never typed a [14] line of code in your life today you're [16] going to learn exactly what mCP is how [19] it fits into your AI or automation stack [21] how to use it in practice and I'm going [23] to include a real example inside of [24] naden my name is Nick I build systems [26] for a living I actually scaled my own AI [28] an automation company to 7 a month so [30] this is literally all I do let's get [32] into it so what is model context [35] protocol I should note that it is in [37] every Creator's interest to make stuff [39] like this whether it's a protocol or a [41] framework or a software drop or whatever [43] seem like it is bigger than it actually [45] is okay so mCP model context protocol is [49] just that it is a protocol and just like [51] most protocols we can deconstruct it we [53] can break it down we can learn it step [55] by step that's what I'm going to be [56] doing with you guys today the thing [57] about mCP is that it's not actually a [60] lot of people think it is cuz they're [61] seeing it blow up all over the internet [62] right now but mCP or model context [64] protocol was actually launched by [66] anthropic way back in November 25th of [69] 2024 so it's not exactly new it's also [72] not exactly old but essentially the [74] reason why you've been seeing it all [75] over your YouTube right now is because [77] it's finally gaining a critical mass of [79] adoption where it's gotten to the point [81] that it actually does provide a ton of [83] value right like a protocol is only as [85] valuable as the number of people that [86] use it when it has wide Market [87] penetration that's when you start to [89] really see the benefits and because of a [91] few creators or maybe anthropic Zone [92] marketing efforts or whatever we're [94] finally getting that point now so just [95] to give you guys a little bit of context [97] mCP itself is not new it's relying on [99] technology that was created a year or so [101] ago depending on when you're watching [102] this video so to understand how mCP or [104] model context protocol really works the [106] best way is to just Dive Right In and [109] build in my case I'm going to be using a [110] lower no code tool called n8n just so we [113] can see how the concepts play out in [114] like a live practical scenario we're [116] going to do all the Whiteboard or [117] Blackboard stuff later so this is an [119] example of an NA an AI agent that is non [121] mCP there is no model context protocol [123] in here for all intents and purposes you [125] guys can think of this as like the [126] current way of building AI agents now [128] I'm using NAD which is a low and no code [129] platform if you guys don't have [130] experience with this that's okay I'll [131] walk you through it really briefly um [133] essentially when we receive a new chat [135] message in this window what happens is [138] it calls our AI agent which is basically [140] just a giant categorization machine it [143] chooses which tool to call based on [145] whether or not we ask for a tool and [147] then if we don't then it just calls the [148] open a chat model and returns answer and [150] we also have a window buffer memory not [152] super important to know the thing that [154] is important to know is if we look over [155] here we have all these tools right what [156] I've done in this case I've added uh [158] five I've added a tool for creating a [160] calendar event one for deleting another [162] for getting another for updating another [163] for getting many and the key here and [167] essentially the thing that mCP solves is [169] mCP means that we will never have to go [172] through and create all of these nodes [174] and all their specifications ever again [175] I'm never going to have to actually go [176] into this n8na agent set the credential [179] well I will we'll have to set a [180] credential but set the tool description [181] set a resource set an operation set a [183] calendar set a start time set an end [184] time and then set some additional fields [186] in the summary I'm never going to have [188] to manually configure each of these [189] again okay and this may not seem like [191] much but imagine you got like 10 or 15 [192] different options for your a agent to [194] categorize in orall um and you know if [196] everyone takes 10 minutes that could be [197] an extra couple of hours before you set [199] up your AI agent flow right what mCP [201] does is it eliminates this completely [203] okay so this is like our pre-flow sort [205] of like our current non mCP flow this is [207] an example of an mCP flow okay and there [209] are a couple things that look a little [211] bit different here so um previously we [213] had what like five different tools that [215] were all Google Calendar tools right [217] well now instead what we have is we have [219] an mCP node one that's called execute [222] tool another that's called list tool I [223] imagine this is going to be deprecated [224] soon we're just going to have one so [226] I'll just keep it from a bird's eye [227] perspective essentially we have um an [230] appify mCP appify being a scraping [232] platform and then we have an Airbnb mCP [234] so notice how over here okay what we did [236] is we had five nodes on one software [239] platform well over here what we're doing [241] is basically inside of apify is a giant [244] list of nodes okay but we're only [246] calling this one node and then it calls [248] the specific node for us so this is sort [250] of you kind of almost think of it like [252] an a agent calling a bunch of other a [253] agents which is a solution that people [254] used to use in order to try and solve [256] this problem but it's a lot more [257] sophisticated than that and it just [259] eliminates a large chunk of the issue um [261] so basically what happens is like I'm [263] going to open this chat okay and then [265] now this this is going to look a little [266] bit different just cuz I'm on a [267] different version and I got the um mCP [269] community no installed and all that [270] stuff so what I'm going to do is I'm [272] going to ask it to tell me hey what [276] tools can I use with [279] Airbnb and what it'll do is it'll call [281] this list tools node which I set up in [283] like 0.5 seconds and then it's going to [286] return me a list of all of the various [288] tools that I can call okay so [291] specifically Airbnb because this is a [293] new mCP server only has two sub tools [294] but I can do an Airbnb search then I [297] have a list of all the parameters that I [298] could feed in which which will [299] automatically be filled and then I have [301] Airbnb listing details which are where [303] you know I can get a specific piece of [305] information for specific listing detail [307] or something okay um how about the [310] appify okay tell me about appify tools [314] what it's going to do now is it's going [315] to call the appify mCP server that [318] appify mCP server is going to get a list [320] of all of the various endpoints that it [322] has access to and then it's going to [324] return them and so you know just because [325] again this is really new and early days [327] stuff we only have one um specific tool [329] that we can call called search but [330] interestingly notice how before you know [332] I would had to set up all this stuff um [334] manually well this is now going to [335] automatically input the query the Max [337] results the scraping tool we're going to [338] be using the output formats the request [340] timeout and so on and so on and so forth [342] so basically I guess what I'm trying to [343] say is in a [345] nutshell instead of you having to [347] connect to one tool like a create [349] calendar event what you're going to [351] basically get to do is you're going to [353] get to combine all of these into a [355] family of [357] tools and then you're only going to have [359] to connect that one one family you're [360] only going to have to do that one [361] authorization and then that's it you're [363] good to go and as I've mentioned before [365] there's an execute and a list here um I [367] imagine that's just going to be combined [369] into one in the future essentially what [371] this is going to mean is you will pretty [373] soon have an AI agent that is capable of [374] calling a million things okay and more [377] importantly if I go over [380] to the giant list of mCP servers which [384] is provided by anthropic and has a bunch [386] of community servers so this is where [388] you actually get all servers from what's [390] more important is there's actually a [393] service and they're developing these [395] right now called mCP Compass mCP create [397] whatever where you will pretty soon be [399] able to instead of connect a specific [401] node that connects to a family of tools [404] and then calls the specific tool [405] properly you're actually going to be [406] able to connect to a node called like [408] mCP Compass or something some sort of [410] high level node which will actually [411] select the family of nodes that you need [413] and then select the specific sub node of [415] that family of nodes so we're basically [418] just increasing levels of abstraction C [419] here and if you think about it logically [422] that's all programming and no code and [424] AI have ever really done so to make a [427] long story short right now if you guys [429] want to build an AI agent in naden or I [431] don't know zapier or one of these other [433] lower no code platforms and you want to [434] do something useful like grab data from [436] a database or maybe send an email [439] through Gmail or create a task and [441] clickup whatever the hell your use case [443] is you kind of have a problem every one [445] of the connections that you create will [447] require a separate node or a module now [449] every time you create a separate node or [450] a module you are obviously going to have [452] to configure it right in NN that means [454] that you guys are going to need to do [455] like a poster SQL node you'll need to do [457] a Gmail node you'll need to do a clickup [459] node and basically all of these things [460] are going to have their own unique [461] parameters they're going to have their [462] own unique authentication methods and [464] they're also going to have their own [465] unique data mapping requirements the [467] point I'm making is it's a ton of manual [468] configuration um just to make sure that [470] your workflow flows and if any Services [472] were to ever update their apis the [474] entire workflow would basically break [476] until you go in and fix that [477] configuration right I'm sure we've all [479] been in that situation before is people [480] that work with AI Automation and code [483] and that's really the value prop of mCP [485] it's basically a standardized way for AI [486] agents to connect to external services [489] without you having to manually configure [491] every single connection instead of you [493] having to set up a specific node for [494] every integration what you do is you [496] just give your AI agent the entire [498] family of nodes the mCP server and it [500] will just automatically at runtime [501] initialize and have access to all of [503] them so that's the bird's eye view let's [505] now dig a little bit deeper into the [507] weeds and cover some of the more [508] technical stuff that he might have been [509] confused watching other videos at okay [512] so here's more or less how AI agents [513] work right now okay as you saw with the [515] NN example we start with some sort of [518] chat message and that goes to our AI [520] agent right over here that is a really [523] crappy line let me just rearrange this a [524] bit after it's made it to our AI agent [527] um the AI agent sort of does some [529] thinking okay this is just like its own [532] reasoning process with our wonderful [534] little robot and then you know It [538] ultimately chooses um essentially which [540] tool to use based on that so I don't [543] know let's say my new message is hey can [546] you add XYZ to the database right pretty [551] simple message what is this a agent [552] going to do it's going to see the word [554] database it's going to look at the tool [555] that has access to which is database and [556] it's probably going to go this way I say [559] probably because as I've mentioned a [560] couple times before these agents you [562] know while they're smart and they're [563] intelligent and they're great um they're [564] not that smart and that intelligent and [566] that great right now like on average uh [568] you have an error rting anywhere between [569] maybe 1 to 5% per request so kind of [571] makes kind of makes for like a rough go [573] if you're a business owner and you know [575] you just want a chat bot that you could [577] just message and say add XYZ to database [579] well I mean if it just doesn't do it 5% [580] of the time you're losing more than 5% [582] of money on it which is an interesting [583] point somebody in my channel made a [584] while ago anyway I guess the point that [586] I'm making is you have access to all of [588] these independent tools right so we need [590] to set up the call database tool on its [592] own postgressql or whatever we need to [594] set up like the server spec we need to [595] like set up all the the the the inputs [597] we need to like drag and drop and map [598] the variable whatever we saw that same [600] thing with the send an email right same [602] thing with the create a clickup task [603] right and same thing with the create a [604] Google Calendar appointment these are [606] all different tools and so the AI can [608] can call them and it can do like a [609] pretty good job but you as an AI [611] automator and AI integrator um you have [614] to like go through all the rigma r of [615] dragging and dropping and setting them [617] up okay how [620] mCP AI agents work is a little bit [623] different notice how we've now added a [625] couple of additional layers to this so [627] we still have a new message that comes [628] in okay [630] so I don't know you know [632] add [633] XYZ to DB okay but what we'll do is [639] essentially when at at initialization at [641] runtime what'll happen is you see how [643] this mCP client is connected to a bunch [645] of these servers well basically what [646] happens is and I can't really show this [648] without just screwing up the graph so [649] bear with me but at initialization these [652] uh Services okay will feed [656] back all of the functions that they have [659] access ACC to which you'll see in a [660] second to the mCP client the mCP client [664] will [666] inject into the prompt of the AI agent a [669] giant list so it'll be like hello you [671] have access to post gresql you'll have [675] access to email you'll also have access [678] to CRM for postr you'll have access to [680] function one function two function three [683] for email have access to function one [685] function two function three right and [686] it'll do so in this super compressed and [688] pretty efficient format and now this a [690] agent will see Okay add XYZ to database [692] it'll be like okay well it's probably [693] postgres because postgres is a database [695] then it'll be like hm okay how do you [696] know what's the add function it'll find [698] that one and then it'll tell the mCP [701] client hey I want [705] post cres ql and I want like the add [709] function okay and here is my input [713] parameters MCB client will take that [715] information and now because this is a [717] level of abstraction it's like a a level [719] of distance basically between the llm [720] and then the tool that it's calling this [722] mCP client can format it in like a safe [724] and secure way that is free of I don't [726] know like prompt injection issues or or [729] like direct server access issues or or [731] or you know safety issues with the tools [733] okay and now this mCP client which is [735] you know it's not like an AI it's just a [737] procedural logic takes this this might [739] be like the NAD chat boox window and [741] then it'll actually go and it'll call [742] the specific thing it wants so you know [744] it sees post SQL okay great goes to the [745] post SQL server and then what does it [747] see if I scroll down a little bit more [749] notice how this postgressql server mCP [751] server now has access to and can call [754] all of these endpoints and these are [756] basically like kind of think of them as [758] like API calls right so what's it going [760] to do it's going to add a record so um I [764] just realized that I don't think I [765] included an add a record example that's [767] really [768] funny so we are just going to go down [770] here and go add a record which was [773] totally there before and then um it's [776] going to you know it's going to choose [777] the add a record then from this we're [778] going to get the data right the server [781] will will get it it's going to go back [782] to the server from this it'll go back to [784] our mCP client then our mCP client will [786] basically be able to again you know [788] inject it um and kind of append it to [791] the end of the agent thinking chain [793] which will then send it back over to us [795] and it'll say you know congrats our our [796] thing was successfully done okay great [798] so now that we've seen this from a [799] bird's eye view why is this you know why [801] is this actually cool like why is this [802] actually important well notice how up up [805] here we had to do the input spec of [806] every tool call DB send email crate [808] click up task create Cal Point whatever [809] like all of these were fundamentally [810] different things that we were asking for [812] and so we had to go and we had to drag [814] and drop the variables and map them all [815] independently and stuff what happens [817] over here is that's handled by a level [819] of abstraction you no longer need to do [820] that all you need to do is you just need [822] to authorize you need to connect to the [823] poster SQL Server okay you just need to [825] do your API key or or or or whatever the [828] specific connection mechanism is [829] depending on the software the second [830] that you're done with that now you're [832] good you don't need to do any additional [835] input schema you don't need to do any [837] mapping of variables you just said [839] whatever you want to the AI agent okay [842] this AI agent will call everything else [844] and it'll do all of the work for you and [846] AI agent is probably not the right term [848] that I'm thinking about because a agent [850] is really this entire thing what I mean [851] to say really is your large language [852] model okay so your llm just does it all [855] it it it has all of the access to all of [857] the input specs it just does it all [859] automatically it's able to choose [860] intelligently and here's the really cool [862] thing it's more accurate it's [864] substantially more accurate it's more [866] accurate because all of the stuff is now [868] standardized all of this stuff has been [870] being worked on by people all over the [871] world the prompts that we're using [873] aren't just like a prompt that one [875] engineer at NN or one engineer at some [877] other company whipped up kind of you [878] know in between their smoke break and [880] just think like it works kind of well no [882] these are actually like constantly being [884] tested constantly being iterated and [885] constantly being improved and then this [887] sort of approach even though you know [889] they're more steps and it's more refined [890] and stuff like that takes that accuracy [892] metric that I keep on bitching about [894] from you know something like that maybe [897] maybe it's like 95% or so to much much [899] much higher it does so while um ensuring [901] some level of security then ultimately [903] speaking this is just like kind of the [905] way that all things go right things as [906] they improve the new products they tend [908] to get a little bit more complicated a [910] little bit more sophisticated but at the [911] end of the day a little bit more [912] accurate and reliable for users so model [915] context protocol is composed of three [917] main components we have the mCP client [919] which sits with your AI agent in NN or [921] whatever platform you're using and you [923] can think of this as like the software [924] that wraps around the chatbot when you [926] make a request via your large language [927] model what happens is is actually not [929] sent to the service directly it's sent [932] to the mCP Client First which will [933] process it and then sanitize it before [935] sending it to the next step which is the [937] mCP server now the mCP server is what [940] extracts or receives the request from [942] the mCP client and these requests are [944] formatted as a specific tool call with [946] parameters like number of rows or search [949] URL or whatever basically it takes this [952] tool call and then it turns it into an [954] actual API request that it then sends to [956] your external service finally you have [958] the actual external service itself this [960] is the database or the Emil or the CRM [961] or whatever and so what happens at [963] runtime is the mCP server which has a [966] big list of all of the available tools [967] to call will actually compress and and [970] extract that down into a very tight [973] efficient list that it'll then send to [975] the mCP client then the mCP client at [978] runtime will inject this big list into [981] the prompt of the large language model [982] itself when you tell your AI agent to [985] update that customer record and clickup [987] for example you now have your request [988] but but then on top of that request [990] you'll also have that giant list of all [991] the tools that the AI can call and [992] that'll be written in a very [993] standardized and a very efficient format [995] your AI will then read the list of tools [997] then read your request and then if it [998] needs a tool to fulfill a request it'll [1000] make that decision extract what you want [1002] package that tool call into the format [1004] that the tool wants then it'll send a [1006] little snippet of text to the mCP client [1008] the mCP client will take that request [1009] and send it to the mCP server then [1011] ultimately the mCP server will call your [1013] thing uh I know that that is a lot of [1014] steps but there are a couple of upsides [1016] to this the main upside is by insulating [1018] an abstracting everything out like we're [1020] doing if somebody were to hypothetically [1022] build an mCP server for a service like [1024] clickup or air table or whatever what [1026] that would mean is anybody could use [1029] that with any AI agent that supports mCP [1032] which means mCP in that way will grow [1035] like a weed if you wanted to build a [1037] solution and you wanted to open source [1039] it or whatever you wouldn't just build [1040] it for yourself you would literally [1042] build it for every other human being and [1043] AI agent on Earth you building this mCP [1046] server or this solution or whatever [1048] would literally be adding to the [1049] collective knowledge of humanity and I [1051] think that's dope as hell another point [1052] I think a lot of people Miss is that mCP [1054] standardizes the language it [1056] standardizes the input schema it [1058] improves security because you're [1059] abstracting away the large language [1061] model and then the tool call right we [1062] have the mCP client in between right now [1065] basically every service has their own [1066] unique prompt system their own unique [1068] approach to security and their own [1069] unique you know format for input schemas [1071] and whatnot and a lot of these suck like [1074] if you've watched my channel before I [1075] constantly dunk on NN I rag on andn [1079] which is funny um I think that their [1081] prompt engineering for tools sucks so [1082] the whole idea is screw that we as the [1085] entire internet will move towards a [1087] unified standard and then as a result [1089] everything will just get way better it [1091] means that you won't need to manually [1092] configure all those connections you [1093] won't need to manually maintain them [1094] when apis change um mCP basically [1097] virtually guarantees that everything [1098] will just be plug andplay instead of the [1100] node configuration hell that I think [1101] we've all experienced ourselves so now [1104] that you understand what mCP is let's [1106] talk about why that might actually [1107] matter for people that build aom people [1109] that make money because at the end of [1110] the day this is anational Channel and I [1112] want you guys to know everything that [1114] you need to know in order to do work but [1116] I don't just want to focus on the [1117] knowledge if we just get down a brass [1118] taxer the whole point is money right so [1120] how is this going to help you make more [1121] money well think about the current [1123] situation if you guys are using naden or [1124] make.com right now or whatever other AI [1126] agent tool you're basically having to [1128] build out every single node as well as [1129] the input specifications of that node [1131] you'll have to drag and drop various [1133] things into various fields and have to [1135] go dollar sign from Ai and that works [1137] fine for simple agents but it gets [1138] complic as hell when you try to build [1139] anything bigger CU you're basically [1141] going to have to recreate the wheel [1142] every time and when you do that you'll [1144] have to recreate the wheel for like a [1145] massive agent with a million tools the [1148] ones that look like spaghetti diagrams [1149] which I think we've all seen the [1150] thumbnails for mCP solves this instead [1153] of having to hardcode every possible [1154] tool basically what happens is your AI [1156] agent will just connect to the entire [1158] Suite where the entire family is upet [1160] which is just the mCP server and then [1161] it'll get a bunch of context about which [1163] tool it needs to use so this is [1165] something that people uh do in the space [1166] pretty often right I always talk about [1168] League process in lead enrichment lead [1170] extraction that sort of stuff so [1172] hypothetically as an example if a new [1174] lead were to come into your system right [1175] now you might have to build dedicated [1177] steps to first check it against your [1179] database after you check it against your [1180] database you might do a little bit of [1181] research on the company scrape the [1183] website find the email address you know [1186] enr a field or whatever right that's [1188] what you have to do right now you have [1189] to build out this logical left to right [1190] flow and make.com and it's mess pain in [1192] the ass with mCP what you could do is [1194] you could just add an AI agent node you [1197] could connect it to an mCP server called [1199] like your lead enrichment server or [1201] something and basically what'll happen [1203] is when a new lead comes in you just say [1204] hey could you research them add context [1206] around who they are and what they're [1207] doing to the CRM and then assign them to [1208] the appropriate rep you as an AI [1210] automator that's all you have to do you [1213] no longer need to go through this whole [1214] rig Ro of like putting together this [1215] procedural logic it'll just do it right [1217] and you don't even really need to go [1218] through the whole riger roll of like [1219] connecting any of this stuff because you [1221] just connect to one server which maybe [1222] it's connected to a bunch of other [1223] servers or something I don't know but [1225] it'll just do it all for you so you know [1227] you connect it to that one tool like [1229] maybe a search engine or some lead [1231] instantly thing you know that does it [1232] all for you then it'll go through the [1234] whole thing for you it'll it'll scrape [1235] the lead it'll enrich it for you it'll [1237] it'll do everything you need and because [1239] mCP is standardized as hell it'll do so [1241] with substantially higher accuracy and [1242] reliability which means it'll actually [1244] start being able to use it for business [1245] applications so yeah you know here's the [1248] key thing that people are missing it's [1249] not magic it's just a protocol it's a [1251] slightly better alternative to what most [1252] people are doing right now it's a way [1254] for different systems to talk to each [1255] other if you guys use nadn for instance [1257] all of what I have just Des described is [1259] more or less what n agents are doing [1261] right now it's just they're it's kind of [1263] harder and more annoying mCP is just [1265] like one level of abstraction up it's [1266] just a more efficient and global [1268] standard for how to lay things out when [1270] you ask your a agent something it's not [1271] like it magically knows what's going on [1273] at the other side of the flow um as I [1274] mentioned at runtime the mCP server [1276] model context protocol this protocol is [1279] just hey list all the endpoints that you [1281] have access to inject that into the [1284] large language model via the mCP client [1286] and then voila right it just does it a [1288] little bit better than most approaches [1289] and that's really the cool part about [1290] protocols when enough people get on them [1292] and we get to the point where we can [1293] improve them a little bit by little bit [1294] by little bit everybody's experience [1296] improves at approximately the same rate [1297] which is sweet so what I mean by this is [1300] we're not fully there yet not [1301] everybody's using this not all the tools [1303] are there so you know the implementation [1304] matters the quality of your llm still [1306] matters the specifics of how each mCP [1308] server still matters a lot um but you [1311] know I want you to know that like the [1312] goal is to ultimately move forward to [1313] this um a standardized way for systems [1315] to communicate and uh you know one where [1318] we don't necessarily need developers to [1320] do every single tiny little connection [1321] we just need like hyper effective [1323] developers to set up these MCB servers [1324] and then everybody else around the world [1326] gets to benefit so let's look at where [1327] mCP is at right now I spent some time [1330] testing various mCP servers with [1331] different AI agents and just to be [1333] brutally honest with you we are still [1334] very early right now there are basically [1336] three main ways to use mCP and these mCP [1338] servers are kind of Hit or Miss um but I [1340] will explain them all to you regardless [1342] first you could use mCP with a claw [1343] desktop app anthropic is the company [1345] that created the mCP standard so [1347] naturally their implementation is the [1348] most secure you can connect local mCP [1350] servers to CLA and have it interact with [1351] your file system or your database or [1353] some basic web services or whatever uh [1355] the second way is with development [1356] environments like cursor AI I personally [1358] think this is where they have a lot of [1360] value right now um I've seen a lot of [1361] practical use cases just on Twitter and [1363] stuff like that cursor can currently use [1365] mCP to understand your codebase search [1367] documentation and even generate code [1369] that works with your specific project [1370] structure as well as like call some [1371] tools that you know you might want and [1372] you might have previously had to add [1374] some some hardcoded Logic for um and [1376] then third you can actually build your [1377] own implementation using the open source [1379] mCP standard in library now I I wouldn't [1381] personally do this as an AI automation [1382] person because I think that if you go [1384] through the whole rigoll of like [1385] building out all that stuff it kind of [1387] defeats the whole purpose of using these [1388] no code and and automation tools right [1390] which to me is to avoid heavy [1391] development work but then drive [1392] disproportionate outcomes in terms of [1394] Revenue um so like the reality is a lot [1397] of people that do this mCP server stuff [1399] on their own time maybe they're not [1401] actually that good right right now [1402] they're still pretty experimental pretty [1404] buggy or pretty Limited in what they can [1405] do um but you know eventually we get to [1407] the point where these are like [1408] production ready and you can use them in [1409] your day-to-day um but yeah you know [1412] that's kind of like the current state [1413] there's no robust Salesforce mCP server [1415] yet there's no Google workspace mCP [1417] server yet uh there is no real [1419] integration for most popular marketing [1421] tools right now uh but there probably [1423] will be right for mCP to realize this [1425] potential and I think now with open a [1426] behind it it will we do need those high [1428] quality server implementations for every [1429] service we want to connect to and that's [1431] just going to take time just think about [1432] how long it took for every SAS product [1434] to have a decent freaking API and like [1435] so many of them still don't right now [1437] Imagine The Complex creating mCP servers [1439] for all of those apis plus all the ones [1441] that don't have apis and it's not just [1443] about setting up like an endpoint now [1445] it's setting them up in a way that an a [1447] agent can connect to an a agents are [1449] smart but obviously there are certain [1450] limitations surrounding them so I guess [1452] the point I'm making is tldr there's a [1454] lot of work so where does all that leave [1456] us as automation Builders and agency [1457] owners are there actual opportunities [1459] here is this just another AI hype cycle [1461] Nick what should I do I see two [1463] realistic scenarios for how you might [1464] want to approach mCP right now the first [1467] option is just wait and see if you guys [1468] are focused on delivering Client [1469] Solutions that work reliably today [1471] that's probably the most sensible [1473] approach mCP is not not the shiny object [1478] okay it's not the shiniest object or [1479] whatever and it will be valuable but [1481] right now it's kind of a little shiny [1483] it's still maturing and betting a real [1485] client project on mCP is probably not [1487] the best for the client interest the [1489] businesses that you're working with [1490] generally more proven technology um I [1492] don't think we should be you know [1494] helping them install buggy experiments [1496] into their flow you know I think it be [1498] great eventually it's just going to take [1499] some time and yeah that's kind of like [1501] your first option that's you know I'm [1502] doing a little bit of that most people [1503] in my community are doing a little bit [1504] of that and so on the second option is [1506] for you to start experimenting [1507] internally um I'm also doing a little [1508] bit of this you know I'm testing [1509] different mCP servers inside of nadn [1511] specifically I'm seeing what works well [1513] and what doesn't and I'm thinking about [1514] how these could eventually fit into [1515] workflows that I build um and basically [1518] I'm not like implementing these in [1519] client projects I'm just building [1520] expertise that might be valuable later [1522] so you know the real business [1523] opportunity I think that we can get out [1525] of this as Ai and automation people is [1527] not necessary to try and tie an mCP [1529] directly into all our client projects [1530] right now it's just to position [1532] ourselves as people that understand the [1533] direction the technology is headed um we [1535] can use this as Authority we could use [1537] this as like a sales tool uh you know we [1539] could use this as like future potential [1541] also speaking of potential I think [1543] there's like a big opportunity right now [1544] to build highquality mCP servers for [1546] popular business tools probably over the [1548] course of the next month so if you guys [1550] got some development skills or maybe [1551] you're a company that has access to [1553] developers like you know I was just in [1554] the shower thinking about this so screw [1557] me if it's not exactly the most forward [1558] or well thought out business plan but [1560] you could probably create mCP servers [1562] for tools that don't have them you could [1563] probably approach these businesses and [1564] offer to do that um so that you know [1567] these these businesses get to take [1568] advantage of all that AI agent traffic I [1569] think there's going to be a ton of [1570] demand for it um and as I mentioned with [1572] open AI now behind it the two biggest AI [1574] companies in the World Behind mCP is [1577] virtually guaranteed that this is going [1578] to turn into something much bigger than [1579] it is right now all right so let's get [1581] practical for second how does mCP [1583] actually fit in with the tools you're [1584] already using like naden if you guys are [1585] using naden you might have notice that [1587] they recently added mCP capability [1589] through what's called a community node [1591] this is interesting because it starts to [1592] bridge the gap between these structured [1593] workflows I was talking about and these [1594] more flexible a agents that we were just [1596] discussing um it's still pretty early [1598] days to use the mCP node in nadn you do [1601] need to be running a self-hosted version [1602] not a cloud version you also need to go [1604] through some rig roll like you have to [1605] enable Community nodes you have to set [1607] up your environment variables correctly [1608] and then you have to install the mCP [1611] node manually which means it's not [1612] plug-and-play um the reality today is if [1614] you try to implement this for a client [1616] or for yourself you probably spend more [1617] time wrestling with technical issues and [1618] actually delivering value like it took [1620] me a good couple of hours to actually [1621] figure out what was going on with this [1623] but you know that's the vision and I do [1624] see the market and N end moving towards [1626] that for sure I was just browsing a [1628] forum thread like on the in and [1630] Community forum and I saw that the [1631] developer said like oh hey you know [1633] we're removing the requirement for you [1634] to have like our community underscore [1636] nodecore tool underscore usage [1638] environment variables because we think [1639] people are going to be using mCP like [1641] crazy so I mean really it's just a [1642] matter of weeks and or months before [1643] naden has access to this sort of stuff [1646] and who knows by the time you're [1647] watching this maybe anden has like mCP [1650] as part of their core functionality I [1651] don't know so yeah for most of you guys [1653] running client Focus automation business [1655] definitely follow this as interesting [1657] just don't build it for a client yet [1659] it's worth understanding conceptually [1660] maybe even experimenting with a little [1661] bit internally but probably not [1662] something I would use for a client [1663] project just yet an interesting side [1666] note I'm going to make is that mCP is [1668] basically just an AI wrapper around apis [1670] you take this API specification and that [1673] API spec was always built for humans [1674] initially right API end points and docs [1676] and all that stuff these are these are [1677] human things [1678] but then what AI allows us to do is we [1681] basically aify the whole ecosystem of [1683] apis and turn it into mCP servers so if [1686] and when mCP continues to grow in the [1688] future what I think is going to happen [1690] is like every API will be developed [1691] alongside an mCP server because that's [1693] actually going to be much more important [1694] to the internet than just us lowly [1696] little humans like you know if there are [1698] eight billion humans n billion humans [1700] however many billion humans there are [1701] right now that we know about um you know [1705] I think there'll be like 90 billion AI [1707] agents and and so obviously like the [1710] internet will have to be made for these [1711] AI agents right more so than than the [1713] human beings and our py little uh API [1716] end points where do I see all this stuff [1717] going over the course of the next 6 to [1718] 12 months first I think we're going to [1720] see a flood of mCP servers being built [1722] for the most major past providers to [1724] start and then that'll just trickle down [1726] to all of the um you know analoges and [1728] stuff like that so think of all the [1730] platforms I use on my channel click up [1731] Panda do big crms like Salesforce or [1733] HubSpot or QuickBooks Google workspace [1736] the dreaded Microsoft 360 Suite I think [1739] all of these will eventually have [1739] dedicated mCP servers that let AI agents [1741] interact with them naturally I don't [1743] think they're all going to be good I [1744] think a lot of them are going to be [1745] buggy and kind of crappy and I think [1746] we're going to have the same problem [1747] we've always had with new tech [1748] implementation I think the quality will [1750] vary widely but it will get better with [1752] time I think that'll be in like the next [1754] three to six months and then I think you [1755] know as time goes on we'll see mCP [1757] become a standard feature in these AI [1759] development platforms so curser um you [1762] know Claude Devon whatever you know I [1764] think all of these AI development [1765] platforms are going to support mCP as [1767] basically foundational and then um you [1770] know since open AI has now expressed [1771] support behind it I think this is now [1773] going to trickle down from [1774] infrastructure to actual tools so what [1775] do I mean by tools I mean naden make.com [1778] zapier all these other no Code and low [1780] code Builders so um we're already seeing [1782] this with naden with their experimental [1784] support that is slowly transitioning [1785] into core features but um yeah you know [1788] I think that it's just a matter of time [1789] before make.com picks it up just a [1791] matter of time before lovable um Lindy [1794] basically any one of these platforms um [1796] just starts using that as like a a core [1797] feature [1799] so does this mean anything for your [1800] business really probably not for the [1801] next few months still too immature to [1803] build production systems on but I do [1804] think in the medium term uh we'll [1806] probably start seeing some opportunities [1807] to use mCP how fun is that um really [1809] excited so to wrap it all up I do think [1812] mCP is a great step towards making AI [1813] agents genuinely useful for AI [1815] automation I think it addresses a real [1817] problem which is the difficulty of [1818] connecting AI systems where our actual [1820] data business lives to you know real [1822] applications I think that another big [1824] issue is accuracy and I think mcps are [1826] going quite away to improve the accuracy [1829] and reduce like some of the weird [1831] one-off errors that we see with [1832] particular implementations like n but to [1835] hedge at all we are still in the early [1837] days there's a pretty big gap between [1838] the hype and the current reality I think [1841] most mCP services today are kind of [1842] unstable they're kind of limited in [1843] functionality and you know I don't think [1846] this is going to be a hype bubble that [1847] just disappears I don't think this is [1848] just like a short-term thing I do think [1850] it's worth paying attention to but I [1852] think it's going to take a little bit [1853] more time and I think that uh you know [1856] this critical threshold of of interest [1857] in MC and stuff like that you know it's [1859] probably a little bit still too early [1861] kind of the same way that N na agents [1862] were just a little bit too early and [1863] they didn't really like actually in [1865] actionably help uh business outcomes I [1867] think that's kind of like where we're at [1868] with that and that's fine just wait a [1870] couple months jump in a hyperbaric Time [1871] Chamber get in a time machine or [1873] something when you come out mcps will be [1875] everywhere and that's that if you guys [1876] want to stay updated on a automation [1878] including future developments with mCP [1879] and maybe some other tools just [1881] subscribe turn on notifications I'm [1882] constantly testing these Technologies [1884] and separating the hype from what I [1885] think actually works for those of you [1887] guys that are serious about about making [1888] money with AI I would encourage you to [1889] join my community maker school we have [1891] over 1300 committed AI entrepreneurs [1893] that are growing their AI agencies you [1895] can get

Title: Automate Your Content with THIS New OpenAI Agent (n8n)
[0] hey everyone today we're doing a live [1] build of an nadn content generator using [3] the new web search API that openai just [6] dropped it's going to look online for [8] examples of content that we want to [10] create it's going to improve the quality [12] of that content then find information [14] from a bunch of relevant resources [16] around the internet create its own [18] outline generate a bunch of high quality [20] content based off that outline call [22] various apis in order to generate [23] imagery that corresponds to the article [26] and then finally combine all that stuff [27] together into a fantastic highquality [29] piece of content if you guys want to see [30] what an actual development process looks [32] like then this is the video for you stay [33] tuned and let's get into it so I'm going [34] to jump onto the nadn canvas in a second [37] but before I do what you're looking at [38] right now is my game plan before I build [40] any system I typically spend a few [42] moments and I think about what an [44] appropriate sequence of triggers and [46] actions might look like so to make it [47] clear I haven't actually built this [48] system yet if you guys are going to [50] watch this video you're going to be [51] along for the ride I'm actually going to [53] show you the various dead ends that I go [55] down I'm going to run you through some [57] bug fixes as I am probably going to [59] encounter some [60] and really you guys are just going to [61] get a firsthand look at what a real [62] development process looks like and [64] despite the fact that you know this may [65] be a roundabout way to get to the end [67] result which I'm sure you guys are [68] looking for which is the content [69] generator system in front of you working [71] in beautiful I prefer to do it this way [73] because I think it's a little bit more [74] authentic you guys get a feel for what [75] it actually involves to put a system [78] like this together and then I also think [80] it's a lot more educational because if [83] you guys just take a look at like the [84] Eiffel Tower or something and then [86] somebody tells you okay good so you've [88] looked at it now go build it you know [90] where do you even know where to start [91] right so anyway I can wax poetic about [94] this all day I'm not going to let's look [95] at the game plan we're going to start [97] with some sort of trigger now what I'm [99] thinking we're going to do is we're [101] going to start with a keyword so I'm [103] going to need to find some way to feed [104] in a keyword into the system maybe I'll [106] use a form input it's probably what I'll [107] do I'll probably use a form input I [109] could use a chat input I could use a web [111] hook I mean maybe I'll maybe I'll have [112] two or three just to show you guys how [113] you can add multiple triggers and an it [115] down actually so we're going to start [116] with some sort of trigger um what I'm [118] going to do is just I'll I'll send it a [119] a keyword okay once I have a keyword the [123] model is then going to research other [124] posts using this new web search API [127] which is pretty new from open AI they [129] published it just a couple days ago I [130] know that sort of dates the video but uh [132] yeah it's currently in preview and it's [134] a great model it's going to replace a [135] lot of my perplexity usage then we're [137] going to generate some outlines using [139] the data that we found from the web [140] search API basically we're going to take [142] a bunch of other posts that other people [144] have made and I'm thinking we're going [147] to feed these into Ai and then have ai [149] come up with new and improved ways to [151] write those posts maybe a new angle and [153] maybe like a new outline structure so [155] that it doesn't copy any pre-existing [156] information but so that we can make it [158] better which is ultimately what we'll be [159] rewarded for SEO wise and then after [162] we've generated these candidate outlines [164] what I want to do is I want to feed [165] these into an llm stands for large [168] language model just like open a GPT 4.5 [170] whatever then we're going to write a [171] bunch of content with that okay we're [174] going to write the content after we [176] generate the outline and this is really [177] important because we want the outline to [179] give our content something some sort of [180] structure I find if you don't have some [182] sort of guiding overarching structure to [184] your content the quality tends to be [186] pretty poor and that's how we're going [187] to avoid this after that we're going to [189] create stylized images using AI I say [191] stylized here because if you if you just [194] have it generate you an image and if [195] you're just like hey make me an image of [196] a building or something your article [198] talks about buildings the quality is [199] usually pretty crappy if I'm honest and [201] it's very evident to people that are [203] looking that it's like AI content but if [204] you have some sort of theme for your [206] blog maybe some sort of handdrawn theme [208] or or retro theme or something um you [211] know if you make it stylized then the [213] people that are looking at the images [215] will attribute any issues in quality to [218] just your style as opposed to [220] necessarily you know the model itself um [222] being an AI right then finally um I'm [225] not really sure if we'll fully do this [226] but I'm probably going to queue up some [228] post in some way shape or form maybe a [229] Google doc or a WordPress install or [231] something okay this is my game plan I'm [234] going to be referring to it over the [235] course of the next uh hopefully hour and [237] a half or so but we'll see how long this [238] video ends up being as I put together [240] this build uh and then yeah we're going [242] to see where we land this is a system [244] that I've very similar to a system that [245] I've sold for uh many thousands of [247] dollar I probably made over like 80k off [249] of the system directly and then if we're [251] talking indirectly through me publishing [253] on YouTube similar variations of it um [255] several hundreds of thousands of dollars [257] so the very first thing we're going to [258] need to do just looking at this ENT [259] canvas is obviously we're going to need [260] some sort of trigger right so I'm going [262] to go to add first step and I have a [264] variety of trigger options here [266] obviously since I'm testing I'm gonna [267] add this this is trigger manually the [269] value in this is you could set some mock [271] data okay so why don't we just go back [274] here why don't I just call it keyword [276] there'll be some variable here called [278] keyword and I don't know we have a bunch [281] of cool keywords here um why don't we [284] just type in agency sales process now if [287] uh I have some some grammar Pros in the [289] chat uh in the video not in the chat [291] rather keep on forgetting this isn't a [292] live video that I'm I'm doing not a live [294] Workshop because I've been doing a lot [295] of those um for anybody that's watching [298] this you might be looking at and then [299] who's familiar with SEO you might be [300] looking at keyword and you're like [301] that's not a keyword those are three [302] words well keyword is just a I don't [305] know uh convention disambiguation for uh [309] multiple words but basically it's what [310] you type into Google to get some sort of [312] result okay so you see where it says [313] agency sales process in Google this is [315] the keyword this is what we're looking [317] for and ultimately what we want is holy [319] crap that's funny I rank oh my goodness [322] no way I'm on the freaking first page of [326] Google for agency sales process okay no [329] I'm not no I'm not thank goodness that [330] would have freaked me out I'm just here [331] because it's probably my [333] account okay anyway so um yeah we're [336] going to we're going to pin this output [338] right so let me just zoom out a bit save [340] this and now what we've done is we [342] pinned um you know this agency sales [345] process [347] keyword I don't like the way that looks [350] so I'm just going to say test flow after [352] that I'm probably going to do some sort [354] of nadn form just to show you guys what [356] this looks like right on a new nadn form [358] event we'll also feed in to here and [361] we'll have a question I don't know it'll [363] just be example form there'll be one [365] here called keyword field type will be [367] keyword it'll be [371] required okay that's going to open this [374] up and I'll say agency sales process [376] click [378] submit okay so now we basically have if [380] you think about it the same duplicate [382] data here right um we have a value [385] called keyword which is ultimately what [386] we're going to want and I'm going to pin [387] it so now we have a manual way do this [389] we also sort of have like um this would [391] be the end product if I were to show it [392] off or or um Pitch it to a client or [395] something but I'm going to just use the [396] manual test flow and I'll jump in with [398] the form test flow um just at the very [400] end after I'm done with all this stuff [402] so that's the first step um we need some [403] sort of keyword trigger cool so that's [405] actually done it's probably the easiest [407] step that you could possibly have just [409] going to check that actually let's let's [411] check it from the left that way it'll be [412] standardized and easy to see for [414] everybody okay the next step is we need [416] to research posts using the web search [417] API based off this keyword so uh anytime [421] that I'm um looking at a an API that I [424] haven't worked with and I haven't worked [425] with this API because it's new um I'm [427] going to run through a very simple [428] step-by-step process and I do it every [430] single time and if I don't know what the [432] API is this process allows me to sort of [434] get the 8020 I can get up and running [435] with the API as quickly as possible [437] dealing with authorization dealing with [439] the specific endpoints I want yada yada [441] now I know for a fact in this specific [443] case um since I'm going to be using an [445] open AI [447] API um I already know what the link is [449] for one because I just posted this in my [451] community and then number two um I know [453] that they're probably going to have [454] really good documentation it's not going [455] to be that difficult okay but uh let me [458] run you through what it looks like [459] regardless so basically what I want is I [463] want some sort of thing that looks like [466] this if you think about it so this is my [469] tools web search this is where I'm going [472] uh basically what I want is I want a way [474] to do an HTTP request to this endpoint [476] with some sort of authorization bear [478] this is my token [480] then I need the content type to be [481] application Json then I need to feed in [483] the model GPT 40 search preview with [485] some web search options I guess these [487] are some additional options which I'll [488] have to look into and then um under [490] messages I guess this is the input that [492] I actually feed in I have one called Ro [494] user and then what was a positive news [495] story from today this looks really [497] really interesting realistically we're [498] probably going to have to formulate our [499] own prompt because I can't just type in [501] I mean I guess I could just type in the [502] keyword agency sales process but I'm [505] probably going to want to ask it a [506] question okay so the very first thing I [508] always do is I always just look at an [510] example of the input if there isn't an [512] example of the input apis are made a lot [514] more difficult but nowadays basically [515] any API worth their salt is going to [517] have an example of the input now um curl [520] just means like an HTTP request that I'm [522] going to be sending from a no code tool [523] like naden um the cool thing about is [525] you can actually just copy an a curl [527] request paste it into the HTTP node and [529] it'll actually go and generate the whole [530] thing for you which is sweet that's what [531] we're going to be using um but uh yeah [534] you basically just always want to be [535] finding some sort of example of a curl [537] request [538] okay so after that output and citations [540] the API response item in the choices [542] array will include okay so it's giving [544] me a bunch of options I suppose that's [546] nice do I care about this I guess so so [548] this is an example of the output so it [550] looks like the output that I will be [551] going for the explanation will be here [555] so I'm going to go for uh it'll be [557] message content so this section right [559] over here and I'm just thinking in my [561] head okay when I call this when I [563] reference this variable in the HTTP [565] request it's going to be message. [566] content then annotations these are going [568] to be Cit with links to various Pages [571] they're going to be buried over here and [573] it's actually going to include the [574] characters as well end index start index [576] that probably just means like it's like [577] a link you know like if the link is the [580] New York Times created a survey on X Y [582] and Z like the start index would be the [585] character in that sentence so the New [588] York Times like the start of the nend [590] which would be the fifth character that [591] would probably be where the link would [592] start then it would go all the way to [593] the end of the thing about the study um [595] which would be over here so that's kind [596] of neat we have a bunch of [598] data looks like those web search options [600] were just a bunch of different location [602] things so I don't really know if that's [603] super necessary and there's some other [605] ones like search context size and all [607] that crap all right so is that super [608] important for us um yeah not really I [611] guess all I really need to do is I need [612] to get this authorization up and running [613] so my very first goal is I just want to [616] have an HTTP request inside of NAD that [619] works I'm not actually going to do it [620] based off my data but I'm just going to [622] go create a new HTTP node back there [624] then I'm going to click import curl here [625] and I'm just going to paste all of this [626] in okay when I import it what it's going [629] to do is it's going to parse that [631] because n has their own little parsing [632] Library it's going to put the URL in the [634] URL field authentication in this case [636] will have none because we're going to [637] manually insert it this is typically how [638] I do so I don't really like using the [640] built-in authentication you certainly [641] can if you want um body content type [644] Json specify body using Json so all this [646] looks really good um all I really need [648] to do if you think about is I just need [649] to get my bare open AI key so the way [651] that you do that in open AI let's just [653] go to in my case the top right hand [655] corner then there'll be API keys for the [658] organization then I'm actually I don't [661] think I can copy this anymore so I have [662] to create a new one and I'm going to [663] call the specifically deep content [665] generator API key the reason why is [668] because I'm going to delete it right [669] after this so that nobody can just use [670] my API key so I'm going to copy this go [673] back here then you see where the dollar [675] sign open AP open API key I'm just going [677] to paste that's my API key okay cool [681] just looking through the rest of this [682] all of this looks pretty [684] solid maybe we'll [687] do um [690] what are some articles high ranking [693] articles about the agency sales process [696] maybe let me do a test [698] step so looks like it's taking some time [701] that's great that means that it's [702] probably working normally when it [704] doesn't take time it returns instantly [706] it's not and great it looks like it did [707] so I'm just going to move over to the [708] schema view over here and I'm going to [710] give myself a little bit more space [711] because odds are the outputs are always [712] going to be a little bigger and more [714] lengthy than my inputs that looks nice [717] as you can see I have some content here [719] developing an effective sales process is [720] crucial for agencies aiming to scale and [723] blah blah blah here are some high [724] ranking articles with insights on [726] it okay so I have the content um it [728] looks like the content gets truncated or [730] cut off very early so I can't actually [732] see the output very nicely that part [734] kind of sucks but I do have a bunch of [736] high ranking articles supposedly uh so [737] that's pretty cool [740] um could I do I don't actually know how [744] this works to be honest first time I'm [745] I'm using it via API so why don't I type [747] something in like [750] um find me three high ranking articles [753] about the agency sales [756] process and then extract their outlines [761] in markdown [764] format [767] output um as a [771] numbered list i e the first article's [776] outline should be one [781] the second article's outline should be [784] two and so on let me see if I can just [786] grab that directly because that would [788] save me a step I don't know for sure but [790] I'm just testing the capabilities of [791] these models um obviously we're going to [794] have to verify that this is [796] consistent it doesn't look like it's [798] doing that I think the reason why oh you [801] know what you know what actually looks [802] like it is doing that [804] fantastic okay great so I'm actually [806] getting outlines here that's really cool [809] here's the issue with this um I'm not [811] getting a format can I can I get this in [813] some sort of Json or JavaScript object [815] notation format if I could get the [817] output as just [820] like H it doesn't look like I can [822] actually output [824] it as a like like I want like an array [827] containing three items the first is [829] outlined for one second is outlined for [830] two third is outlined for three so what [832] I'm going to do just for Simplicity so [835] I'm going to do another I'm going to do [836] an open AI message and assistant [839] or message a model [841] request then going to feed in my own [843] credentials and now I'm just going to [844] see if I could reformat this content [846] using AI so I'm going to go GPT [851] 40 I'm then going to say you are a [857] helpful intelligent content assistant [860] going to use that as the system prompt [862] for user I'm going to say let's [865] think your task is to take the out of a [869] search [871] module and reformat that into [876] Json your Json should follow this [881] format we'll say um article [885] outlines it'll be an [887] array it'll be [890] title then it'll be mark down [897] outline cool now looks pretty good to me [900] me just open this up a little bit [903] more so uh let me pump this in adjacent [906] form matter just because I want to have [907] some of that formatting format beautify [910] there you go it just makes it a lot [912] easier for me to see and I think that's [913] really important in long-term [915] maintainability so article outlines um [918] objects which is an array that contains [921] a bunch of article outlines containing [922] titles markdown [926] outlines rules I'll say there will be [929] three [934] outlines insert all of them [938] into the appropriate object using the [942] markdown [945] outline [946] parameter [948] um in addition make sure you [952] format the [955] outlines make sure you replace any new [958] lines [960] with back [962] sln since I'm sending this via Json uh [965] via HTTP [967] request cool um if any information is [972] missing only use the supplied parameters [976] I.E [978] um title and markdown outline if any [983] information that information is missing [986] leave the value as this [989] cool that looks good to me I'm going to [991] click output content is Json and then [993] I'm going to add a message and I'm just [994] going to feed in this content [997] okay it looks like we have access to all [1001] of these outlines which is [1003] nice um I'm then going to test the step [1007] now and see if we can grab some [1010] Json I'm loathed to introduce AI into [1013] more steps in this process than I have [1015] to like I can technically have ai the [1018] reformatter but ideally I wouldn't [1019] actually have to do this twice I'm [1021] thinking I'm going to have to do this [1022] twice just given what I'm seeing [1025] here okay this looks pretty good to me [1028] so all of them follow this introduction [1030] format I don't like how there are three [1034] um you see how there are sort of [1036] three heading Parts [1039] here that doesn't seem like it's going [1041] to be the most consistent so I'm [1042] probably going to run into some issues [1043] there looks like it's using markdown and [1045] it's determining what the heading is so [1048] I can actually tell [1053] it to [1054] structure the [1056] outlines make [1060] sure insert the title as an [1067] H1 then insert the next headings as [1071] H2S if there are [1074] any nested [1076] subheadings use h3s [1081] Etc Let's test this step and let's just [1084] see if there's a better output [1086] now something that maybe is a little bit [1088] more consistent I think that there [1089] probably will [1091] be this is taken a fair amount of time [1093] why um I don't know maybe the server is [1096] underload or [1097] something maybe my prompt is really long [1101] but it's really not that long and if [1102] we're being pragmatic here I mean this [1104] is like this is nothing in terms of [1106] usage I should probably reduce the [1108] output Randomness or the temperature [1110] down to something a little more [1111] manageable okay while that's [1114] running let's just format this a little [1116] better give myself some room let's go [1119] back to oh okay we did get the [1122] output all right so this looks much [1123] better this is a very standardized [1125] format right we have the title but then [1126] we also have the whole article or the [1128] whole um thing in markdown which is very [1130] very valuable okay and this is what it [1133] looks [1134] like if I go markdown live preview I [1137] just paste this in [1139] h no it doesn't really work that well [1140] does it okay anyway um see what says the [1144] secret for success to agencies then it [1148] says the sales Playbook this is [1151] basically what the article is going to [1153] look [1155] like or what the outline is going to [1157] look [1162] like right that's good that's what we [1165] want [1169] we have one bullet point here another [1171] bullet point here another bullet point [1174] here then we have this here right so [1178] this is basically what the L's going to [1179] look like so that's cool [1184] um let me just [1187] finalize I don't like other two bullets [1190] here let me just finalize this just for [1192] my own [1194] Clarity looks like for whatever reason [1196] this tool automatically inserts another [1198] thing oh about the author Dave Fischer [1200] background and expertise contact [1201] information interesting that's really [1203] interesting no I don't don't know if we [1206] wanted to write anything about Dave [1207] Fisher in here but um cool so uh just [1209] ignore all of the backs slash ends um as [1211] we see here what we're going to get as [1213] our end result is we're going to get a [1215] couple of outlines the secret to success [1216] for agencies is the sales Playbook [1218] introduction delegating sales [1219] responsibilities and agencies importance [1220] of a sales Playbook why agencies [1222] struggle to develop Sales Systems why [1223] create a sales Playbook how to succeed [1225] just get started about the author Dave [1226] Fischer this is pretty good um [1229] okay so now I just want you to think [1230] about you know my goal here my goal is [1233] I'm going to grab three outlines like [1235] this really now what I want to do is I [1237] want to have ai combine the best parts [1238] of all of them basically to turn this [1240] into like a mega article or a mega mega [1242] um mega outline and then I also wanted [1245] to come up with like a couple of new [1246] headings basically that'll improve the [1248] probability of this just being [1250] considered new and exciting and and and [1252] interesting content maybe a slight [1254] different angle on something that these [1255] guys didn't talk about so from here on [1258] out my thoughts are I'm probably going [1259] to have to have another AI [1261] node the only purpose of this AI node [1265] excuse [1266] me um the only purpose of this aode is [1268] going to be to get these [1270] outlines stick them all in the input and [1273] then just generate a better outline [1275] afterwards and the outline should be [1276] formatted in a very specific and [1278] standardized way if I want to make use [1280] of that outline later to write content [1282] and if I want to be able to make use of [1283] it to do anything like if I if I [1284] standardize it now I'll be able to use [1286] this for anything like like this doesn't [1287] have to be a cont generate doesn't have [1289] to be an article gener I could generate [1290] outlines but I could use those outlines [1291] to generate YouTube scripts I could use [1293] those outlines to generate posts of any [1295] kind I could use them to generate and [1297] basically an infinite number of posts [1300] that have the same IDE and the same [1302] structure and the same high level topic [1303] but might actually be a little bit [1304] different um which you know uh I I could [1307] I could publish 50 articles on the same [1309] topic or something like that and then I [1310] could have all of them rank at the top [1312] right like if you think about it that [1314] would allow me to maximize the [1316] opportunity of a system like this and [1317] then if I'm building template I'd be [1319] able to sell it in a much wider array of [1321] purposes than just like an article [1323] generator which is my first thought so [1325] that's kind of cool um I think I'm going [1326] to do that so I'm going to head back [1328] over here to deep content generator and [1330] I have you know I have my my outputs [1332] right over [1333] here just because this looks basically [1335] exactly like what I want I'm just going [1337] to pin this make this really easy for me [1339] so from here on out and you know what I [1341] might as well just pin all these outputs [1342] to be [1343] honest um so from here on out um I now [1346] have my three outlines why don't I just [1348] rename this a bit oops um I think I [1352] might be using my voice or something [1353] like that [1354] sorry I need to rename this um why don't [1358] I just call this um [1361] call open AI web search API by the way [1365] is there is this like available in the [1367] open AI node [1369] now if it is and I'm just being silly [1371] I'm just going to do [1374] that custom API I could use a custom API [1377] call no I couldn't [1379] got to add my credential first sorry now [1381] that I'm thinking about it [1382] like they probably updated something no [1385] they didn't this is the assistant let's [1387] just do [1390] text no I'm not seeing anything here [1392] maybe there's a [1397] preview um we have an audio preview do [1399] you have a web preview oh yeah you know [1401] what sorry we actually have a search [1402] preview directly embedded so you don't [1403] actually even need to do the API call [1405] that's really funny oh well uh you know [1407] you tend to learn these things as they [1408] go regardless um I like the fact that [1410] I've done this API call that's cool I [1412] don't really mind it sure you have to [1413] put your own um token in plain text and [1414] whatnot but if you guys want to [1416] replicate the same functionalities that [1417] open AI um node uh it's much easier to [1421] do so with the actual open AI node [1423] itself as opposed to the HTTP request so [1425] you know the harder thing you'll be able [1426] to do the easier thing okay [1429] so uh right so then what what does this [1432] do this right over here is going to [1435] extract and format outlines that's all [1438] that this does doesn't do anything else [1440] this model here is going to generate [1444] better [1446] outline that's what this is going to do [1449] so for this I'm going to use GPT 4.5 [1453] which as of the time of this recording [1454] is the best free model that I could use [1458] sorry not free uh best freely available [1460] model that I could use on the API you're [1463] a helpful intelligent writing [1466] assistant the system prompt will be your [1469] helpful intelligent writing assistant [1470] the text will be your task is to [1473] generate a [1475] highquality comprehensive outline for an [1478] article on a given [1481] topic okay the topic will be provided to [1486] you along with three outlines that we've [1490] outlines of other articles that we've [1493] scraped from the web [1498] you [1501] must digest the three other [1508] outlines [1510] combine [1515] them and understand what they [1519] are I'm not going to win any awards for [1521] this prompt but I just want to get [1522] something on paper um as a rough draft [1524] and I can always edit it and iterate it [1525] later so I'm just giving it my thoughts [1527] as if I were talking to a staff member [1529] or something you must digest the three [1531] other [1533] outlines digest these three [1539] outlines fully and [1542] completely combine [1545] them generate a new [1548] outline using content from the previous [1552] three outlines as [1555] inspiration make sure your outline is [1557] significant L better more [1562] comprehensive discusses more [1564] topics if you believe that the provided [1570] outlines ensure that you are not [1573] repeating verbatim What the outlines [1579] are but effectively incapsulate the [1583] concepts and ideas they're talking about [1586] in in your new [1589] Mega [1592] outline [1594] okay output in Json using this format [1598] we'll just say mega [1601] outline and then what I also wanted to [1603] do is output your mega outline in [1606] markdown ATX format for those of you [1610] guys that don't know markdown ATX format [1612] it's just where you place hash signs [1614] followed by space before the heading [1615] text so just like this that's a heading [1620] one um okay next [1622] up where the hell was I um I I'll put [1626] your mega outline in markdown ATX format [1629] next up [1631] um [1633] ensure let's [1637] say [1640] h very formatting use H1s H2S h3s h4s [1649] bullet [1653] points Etc in your big [1660] outline okay [1664] um do not include any personal [1667] information say of the writer in your [1671] finished these outlines in your finished [1673] product sometimes they add or append [1677] their names to things leave that out [1681] cool that looks pretty good to me I'm [1683] now just going to feed in these three [1685] outlines so if you think about it I I [1687] mean I'm always going to have marked [1688] down outline markdown outline markdown [1690] down outline this very very quick and [1691] easy way to do this I mean like we could [1693] we could map um we could grab article [1697] outlines [1699] here okay and then we could just like [1702] map the markdown outline together and [1706] stick it all but I mean I'm I'm I'm not [1707] going to do that I want to just get this [1708] up and running as quickly as possible so [1710] I'm just going to write [1712] keyword um what I'm going to do for [1714] keyword is I'll just go test flow then [1718] I'm just going to grab [1720] item uh and then oh I think that's just [1722] it [1725] right um oh jeez I guess we have [1730] multiple items here [1736] right should should just be agency sales [1739] process then down over here going to say [1745] outlines why don't I just [1749] do [1752] one um we'll go markdown outline number [1759] one then [1761] two then [1763] three is this the most scalable way to [1765] do it not really like if I wanted to [1768] have this generate 4 I'd have to go in [1769] here and then hardcode it but to be [1770] honest I think three is probably [1772] sufficient uh but yeah you you'd be able [1774] to do something like like you can map a [1775] new array that just contains these and [1777] then just join them all together if you [1778] wanted to a variety of different ways to [1779] do so okay then I'm going to click [1780] output content is Json for temperature [1783] it's go 0.7 I'm also going to do the [1785] same thing back here just because I umum [1788] I personally find that the and this [1789] might just be my bias I find that the [1792] usual model outputs are a little too [1794] creative for me say creative I mean that [1798] a very loose sense uh I think that these [1800] models can be like super annoyingly [1802] flamboyant and just use like words that [1803] nobody ever would I have a a 4 ler giant [1806] bottle of water my girlfriend's been [1808] telling me I need to drink a little bit [1809] more water so I'm going to be doing so [1811] through an aluminum [1815] straw oh my god that's way too [1820] cold good [1822] God my initial goal with this was to [1824] drink all four liters every day and I [1827] was like well I'm just going to get one [1828] bottle and that way I'll know when I'm [1830] done the four liters right you know how [1832] much four lers of water weighs to carry [1834] around [1836] ridiculous okay got the mega outline [1838] over here let's take a peek at [1843] this so uh I'm going to say I'm just [1848] going to feed this into my own model [1849] let's just do GPT [1851] 40 um render this and mark down just [1854] going to paste this [1856] in no no no you okay whatever that's [1859] actually fine so it's actually going to [1861] create me this and just format it for me [1863] I didn't want it to render it for me [1865] like this AKA just add the new Lin I [1867] wanted it to actually show me what this [1870] thing look like but that's okay I guess [1873] we could just do that so this is the [1875] more comprehensive one now start off [1877] with an introduction that defines the [1878] agency sales process talks about the [1880] importance and benefits of a structured [1881] sales system then discusses common [1883] misconceptions about sales processes and [1885] agencies we understand the challenges [1887] okay cool internal barriers external [1888] barrier factors creating a robust sales [1890] Playbook purpose and value key [1891] components of an effective sales [1893] Playbook Central [1897] stages this looks pretty good yeah this [1900] looks pretty good um all right so now [1902] that I'm thinking about it this would be [1903] a good opportunity for us to add links [1905] right now right be a really good [1907] opportunity for us to add links um so I [1910] might actually do that um okay so just [1911] just to keep track of what we've done we [1912] we now researched other posts using the [1914] web search API right so now it's time to [1915] generate candid outline select we've [1917] actually done that and I'm just going to [1918] have this do the selecting it's not [1920] going to select a Canada on it's [1921] actually just going to combine them all [1922] so now we just have to write the content [1923] using the LMS and then we create the [1924] stylized images using a an the post I [1926] think there's an opportunity for us to [1927] add links [1928] though um not of furniture why why is [1932] this oh right Jason formatter it's just [1934] some free service you don't have to use [1935] it if you don't want to um it was make [1938] ads pop up after a while this this is [1940] really long this is super long so [1942] there's obviously not going to be any [1944] meaningful way that we'll be able to [1945] generate all of this in one shot right [1947] like I hope we're all clear here we're [1948] not just going to pump all this into Ai [1949] and be like hey write me an article it's [1950] going to do a really job so what we [1952] need to do is we need to iteratively [1953] prompt AI um we need to feed in sections [1956] probably like I don't know a few [1959] sections at a time and then depending on [1961] the length of the final [1963] article we might feed this into [1966] um 01 Pro or something like that 03 or [1969] something just have it like um iron out [1971] any like a lot of the time when you [1972] generate stuff section at a time like if [1974] I generate like this introduction [1975] separately and then I intro this section [1977] this section [1978] like a lot of the time the model is [1979] going to like restate the same things [1981] kind of like here at the margins know [1983] that is not a dick growing out of this [1985] wall but it's going to restate the same [1987] things kind of here and so what an you [1989] know [1990] 01 Pro would do or 03 or what whatever [1994] these like reasoning models are they [1996] have really long contact window so [1997] they'd actually go through and they'd [1998] unify them they would they would remove [2000] um I can't really deleting this [2002] unfortunately but they would remove all [2003] this stuff and make it all good so that [2005] like the paragraphs flow seamlessly into [2007] each other [2008] and in this way we'd eliminate the the [2009] length problem uh it cost us a little [2012] bit more because we're producing higher [2013] quality content we're re we're repr [2014] prompting it a bunch but we'd have a lot [2016] more control over the end process I [2018] would say and then um yeah we we'd [2020] basically split it into a few flows [2022] there'd be like a like a top level [2023] writer flow which would do the iterative [2025] thing and then there'd be an editor flow [2026] like the o1 which would actually like [2028] you know do the editing and stuff but [2030] yeah I'm starting to think like there's [2032] probably an opportunity to put links in [2034] here so what do I mean I mean like [2037] imagine if we just this it said agency [2038] leaders AV verion to sales and then [2040] there was in Brackets little [2042] bracket and then it said you know [2045] forbes.com article that talks about X Y [2047] and Z and then there was a link right so [2050] I don't know like like what if uh [2052] how do you do markdown [2054] again is that [2057] this hold on one sec I need to figure [2060] out how to do markdown [2062] links okay link text here okay so [2064] basically it' be this right then you see [2070] see [2071] here we could just embed [2073] this then we could say [2077] brackets another bracket here and then [2079] we could [2081] say 2015 fors article showing X Y and Z [2087] right that way when we feed this outline [2089] into the writer it' actually be able to [2091] create us hyperlinks as well which would [2093] solve our our internal and external link [2096] problem um that would solve [2098] completely so how are we going to do [2100] that well let me think back to this so [2102] we're extracting formatting the outlines [2104] we're not generating a better [2107] outline I guess I just need to do a [2109] little bit of research now honestly [2113] um I guess I just need to do research [2116] and [2118] then so what am I going to call this [2121] again [2124] H maybe I should call this twice [2128] okay I think I'll do that the first time [2129] I'm going to call it I'm going to call [2132] this to generate me these [2135] outlines but I'm also going to call it [2138] to generate me articles like empirical [2141] articles on this [2143] stuff okay so actually have two this [2147] first open AI web search API going to be [2149] find [2150] articles sorry find [2153] outlines and this second one here is [2156] going to be um find citations okay and [2160] then we're going to stick the [2162] citations not here but over here [2165] alongside the generate a better outline [2167] thing then it'll stick the citations in [2169] there so what do we need [2172] um find [2175] me [2178] statistical stat okay find me let's [2181] do five [2185] statistics citations or [2189] educational resources [2193] on then I'll insert the topic [2198] here so we'll put [2203] keyword un let's just say the following [2205] keyword to make it really clear that [2207] that is what we're supposed to do just [2208] in case this is some grammatical issues [2210] right agency sales [2212] process um for [2216] each for each link provide a [2220] on line summary of the key [2225] findings okay let's let's give this a [2227] try now uh this is going to overwrite [2229] pin data yeah that's fine I don't [2231] mind let's see if it can do this if it [2234] can we'll just combine that directly in [2235] the output and use it to generate a mega [2237] outline that contains positive citations [2239] here are five statistics and educational [2241] resources related to the agency sales [2243] process okay so now I'm going to go here [2248] this is perfect this contains everything [2251] wonderful yeah wonderful wonderful [2253] wonderful oh man I'm so stoked on this o [2255] that's going to be [2256] juicy okay so we have the citations now [2258] so when we generate this better outline [2260] you know what we're going to [2262] do in [2267] addition as well as a bunch of citations [2272] with on [2274] line conclusions you must digest these [2277] three outlines fly and [2280] completely [2281] understand the citations and one [2285] conclusions generate a new outline using [2287] content from the previous the Lin's [2290] inspiration and then weave in the [2293] citations and one line can we the [2298] citations [2302] okay um make sure to include all [2305] citations [2307] all of these citations you're given use [2310] markdown ATX format when linking them in [2313] the [2315] outline okay so down here I'll say [2319] keyword outlines and then I'll [2322] say [2325] resources so now I'm going to go find [2327] citations right [2329] here scroll all the way down to the [2331] bottom because I uh I'd still consider [2334] myself a novice at NN [2338] formatting and [2340] so um sometimes I will be referencing an [2344] individual uh where I need to unpin this [2346] node and execute it sometimes I'll be [2348] referencing an individual item as [2350] opposed to uh you [2353] know something else so I am going to [2355] unpin [2357] this and now in order to test all this [2359] I'm going to have to run it [2364] all yeah I think I'm going to have to [2366] test this all which kind of sucks I hate [2368] doing that but it's what it [2371] is uh this is a function I no I think [2374] I'd go [2376] all then I [2378] go [2380] last then I go [2385] Jason then I [2389] go content is there content [2394] message [2396] uh let me think for a second choices [2399] it's [2400] choices [2407] choices [2410] um I should just have one [2412] choice I do just have one choice choices [2416] zero [2418] Dot [2420] message I mean I could just drag this in [2422] here but I don't want to I'm better than [2424] that um dot content [2430] okay hopefully hopefully that's good [2433] enough we'll [2434] see cross your fingers for [2437] me I think that this is going to be a [2440] banger I think this going to be even [2441] better than I thought the system would [2443] be it's always fun to be able to put [2446] together these sorts of things in just a [2447] little [2449] while friend just sent me a very funny [2452] text okay [2454] so uh yeah assuming that this works then [2456] we're just going to go ahead have it [2457] right and the way that we're going to [2458] have it right is if we look back at this [2460] markdown preview thing do you notice how [2462] on every line we have um uh we have [2465] these headings so it's like you know [2468] two number signs basically we could [2470] theoretically do is we could split [2472] everything by the two number lines so [2475] this would be one [2476] section this would be another [2478] section this would [2480] be a third section this would be a [2483] fourth [2485] section see here this would be section [2489] okay just like that and then this would [2491] be a sixth and then finally that'd be a [2492] seventh okay so we could actually go [2494] ahead and we could we could we could [2496] generate the whole article like that [2497] then we're just going to have a massive [2498] hodg podge of stuff and then once we [2500] have that massive hodg podge of [2505] stuff rewrite this but not in markdown [2513] format I I want to I want to find a link [2515] where the hell are the links I don't see [2517] see any links link [2520] please not seeing any links [2526] uh yeah so it doesn't look like it's [2528] actually doing the rewriting I want [2529] that's fine you can shut up now thank [2531] you where are the links oh okay okay [2535] example sales people who follow def find [2536] sales PR 33% more likely to be high [2537] performers right over here okay cool Co [2539] cool so we actually have the links [2540] inside fantastic I'm not going to go [2541] through the whole ring roll doing what I [2542] was doing back there um but anyway [2544] obviously we now have the better outline [2546] so now we just have to let me use an [2548] edit Fields node because what I want to [2551] do now is I want to I want to map this [2556] stuff what I'm probably going to have to [2559] do is go to the expression [2562] editor and [2566] then here I'm going to [2569] say [2570] um [2572] sections then over here what I'm going [2574] to want is I'm going to go Json do [2578] message. content. Mega outline okay then [2582] I'm going to split it I'm going to split [2584] it on the basis of these if I do that [2589] what am I going to [2590] have this doesn't look to me to be an [2595] array but I may be mistaken I don't know [2597] if it's an array to be [2600] honest I can't actually see where is it [2604] I mean it you know looks kind of like an [2606] array but but isn't an array I don't [2608] know I'm not seeing any array like thing [2611] here if I test this let's see what [2612] happens it's broken oh no okay it is an [2613] array nice okay [2617] so so sections awesome and then I don't [2622] like how it splits it and then it takes [2623] the thing out is there [2626] some can I do the nadn split function [2629] without actually removing [2640] H uh hold on a sec actually wait wait [2642] one [2647] moment I've used the like value of [2649] splicing a dot in you can use whatever [2651] you prefer blow the two nodes all right [2652] that's fine no that doesn't really help [2655] me it'd be really nice if I could have [2657] the title of the header no I mean I mean [2659] I do have the okay I do have the title [2661] but not everywhere like look key uh [2664] introduction understanding the agency [2666] sales landscape [2667] important oh you know what you know hold [2669] on what if I put a space there then I [2671] test [2675] it no that isn't working why well if we [2680] think about [2681] it [2683] um mastering the agency sales process a [2685] comprehensive gut all right I'm I'm [2686] going to need [2687] to I'm going to need to have this whole [2689] thing [2692] here then I wanted to remove the new [2694] lines in my prompt immediately faster [2702] go let me ask it again assist [2707] me uh no no no no no sorry sorry sorry [2710] replace all new [2715] lines there you go please do not turn me [2717] into a [2719] paperclip oh no it's up putting it not [2721] as marked [2723] down what the hell am I going to do man [2726] all right let me see do do we still have [2727] that markdown answer that we had [2729] before no we don't that's really [2733] annoying if we go back [2738] here for whatever reason it's not [2740] splitting this right so that's a bug [2742] right that is most definitely a bug we [2745] found our first bug ladies and [2747] gentlemen so we [2751] need is we need it to [2755] say this [2759] basically overview of this episode [2761] that's not what I wanted [2766] okay I'm just going to do this a little [2768] bit until I get to the next heading here [2770] just so that I could see what this [2771] actually looks [2773] like that's fine okay all [2778] right so what's happening here I'm [2781] splitting based off of the presence of [2782] these three characters so realistically [2785] the beginning is is going to look like [2788] this the next one is going to look like [2793] this next one is going to look like this [2798] no that seems fine I don't see any [2799] issues with that so it was right about [2801] the beginning beginning is just going to [2803] look like the title so I can just get [2805] rid of like you know I could just slice [2807] that out I don't need to use that one [2809] the next one's going to say [2811] introduction and then it's going to be [2813] all the way down [2815] to the last line [2819] but the next is saying key challenges [2821] and agency sales [2823] processes why is this just a [2827] title [2830] H seems [2834] weird I don't like that I'm splitting [2837] the beginning and the end so what what's [2840] going on here with this mastering the [2841] agency sales [2844] process let's do this with the actual [2846] data [2851] do that's fine it's also fine it's also [2858] fine we have two new lines we have key [2861] processes that's fine okay then we have [2865] this so what's going on we [2869] are splitting based off of the presence [2872] of this I understand now we're getting [2876] all of this this then what are we doing [2879] after that we're [2880] getting this [2884] H how are we going [2888] to make it not split it based off of [2893] that like what I what I want is I [2897] basically [2899] want I guess I could just ask AI for [2901] this but still that seems like a cop out [2903] here basically what I want is I I want [2906] split all the sections that only contain [2910] H2S so that it's like this is a section [2913] right here you know what I mean then [2919] afterwards maybe new [2922] line okay maybe there's a simple [2924] solution to [2928] this uh cap lock is on [2938] yeah okay that was a simple that was a [2940] simple solution just add a new line cool [2943] uh awesome so then I have all of my [2945] sections here with the text and stuff I [2946] got so now what I have to do is I have [2947] to generate articles for every section [2948] so this is where the prompt engineering [2950] is going to come in I'm just going to [2950] pin [2951] this then I'm going to rename this and [2955] I'll just call it um uh separate into [2959] sections very cool now I should note [2962] that because I have you know in this [2964] case six sections basically what I'm [2966] going to to be doing is uh can I just [2969] remove H how do I pop no I need some way [2973] to to remove pluck no um reduce no slice [2979] can I slice [2981] this from the start that would just be [2984] one to the end just get rid of that yeah [2988] okay cool sorry so now I have the right [2990] now put that's fine you can unpin it [2992] there you go so I'm going to take this [2994] and I'm going to feed into AI so it's [2995] going to be some prompt engineering and [2997] then um I'm just going to have it [2998] iteratively do it so if if in my head [3001] like I always think about things in [3003] terms of make.com which is sort of you [3005] know the no code platform that I figured [3006] things out in [3009] first the way that you do this in [3010] make.com is you iterate and then you [3013] basically do one at a time section by [3015] section um in nadn though it's just [3017] going to Output this item or this [3019] variable called sections uh there'll be [3022] like six of them simultaneously [3023] basically so what I could do is I could [3024] just uh oh actually no this is still [3026] technically one [3028] item so I could I could do this in a [3030] variety of ways I could split [3033] out so I could basically [3037] um drag these [3041] fields called sections I believe let me [3045] just test this really [3047] quickly there are now six items called [3052] sections one 2 3 4 five six then now [3057] that I have these six sections split out [3059] six items I could then pass this into AI [3061] the only issue with this potentially is [3063] that um you may run into rate limits [3065] when you're doing a ton of copyrighting [3066] so if you don't like that then what you [3067] can do is you could use the um split in [3069] batches Loop over items or split in [3071] batches known and then that'll just [3073] allow you to take this thing that we [3074] just split out and then just run it one [3076] at a time so I'm just going to try for [3077] now to run it all six at a time because [3079] that sounds way easier to me then [3081] assuming that that doesn't work I can [3082] worry about um you know generating it [3085] one at a time okay so now instead of [3087] generate better outline what is this is [3088] going to be right section [3091] okay so we have we have everything we [3093] need if you think about it we can um [3095] unpin this we have everything we need we [3098] have very high quality um working [3100] materials it's just a matter of sitting [3101] down at our little Minecraft Workshop [3103] whatever the hell it's called putting [3105] them together and having some cool sword [3106] at the end of it or whatever so your [3108] helpful intelligent writing [3112] assistant just going to say [3114] writer your task is to generate a [3117] highquality comprehensive section of an [3121] article [3123] using a piece of an [3126] outline this piece is not the whole [3129] outline it is but a [3133] part knowing this confine what you write [3137] to the contents [3142] of but a part knowing this [3145] canine exactly [3148] what you write to the contents of the [3151] provided section do not write additional [3154] or accessory content that doesn't belong [3158] in this [3159] section let me do some rules [3164] too do not write calls to action [3171] ctas or introductions unless it unless [3175] you are explicit [3177] instructed to do [3179] so say with an introduction tag with an [3183] introduction tag with an introduction [3186] header okay looks pretty [3190] good section in Json using this format I [3193] will now give it the format that I want [3196] again so to be clear the format that I [3199] want is I want it to be [3203] um article section [3208] okay content goes here let's say [3212] markdown content goes here let me just [3215] see if there's anything I can [3221] copy weave in the [3224] provided I'm now using an old prompt to [3226] help me generate a new prompt weave in [3228] the provided citations [3230] um in a markdown ATX [3235] format we just continuously say write in [3238] markdown [3239] ATX [3243] format make sure the heading is in [3251] H2 make sure you weave in any provided [3254] citations and marked on ATX format as [3256] well okay this looks pretty good to [3261] me um I'm not going oh maybe I'll use a [3264] Spartan tone of voice [3267] use a simple straightforward tone of [3270] voice no fluff [3274] cool that looks pretty reasonable to me [3276] we'll see how this goes [3280] um okay so I have the keyword [3283] right so now I just want my section so [3285] I'm just going to feed in section [3286] keyword is this agency sales [3289] process your section keyword of The [3295] Wider article [3297] wider article I don't know your [3300] section [3302] okay so um let's test this and let's see [3305] what happens might as well rubber's got [3307] to meet the road eventually right I [3309] think we're already coming up on one [3310] hour but that's actually pretty good [3311] we're getting close then I'll be able to [3313] check that little box off which is [3315] pretty [3320] cool fingers crossed I should note that [3323] I'm using GPT 4.5 preview here um [3327] if you check the tokens this is very [3330] expensive relative to the majority of [3332] the other models so if you want to do 1 [3334] million uh like let's actually like [3336] check out the usage on this I mean like [3337] how long is this really well I don't [3338] know I guess we're going to find out [3339] soon enough but uh you see how it's 75 [3343] and 150 per million output so I mean a [3346] million's a lot right I usually like [3348] things in terms of a thousand but that's [3349] still like 15 cents per thousand output [3351] tokens basically so I mean realistically [3353] this is probably going to generate me [3354] like a few hundred output tokens from do [3356] it between 6 to 10 times per article [3359] that's going to be a lot right it's [3360] going to be 30 30 to 50 cents per piece [3364] now why am I using this really good [3365] article uh really good uh uh model [3368] because I think that the the value here [3372] is worth at least 15 times more than the [3375] price that I'd be paying for it so the [3377] price differential may be 15x you know [3380] between this and [3384] this but I think that the value [3388] differential between this and [3391] this is much more than 15x I think [3394] writing is one of those things where if [3396] you are off even a percent or if you can [3399] make an article better by even a [3401] percent um as an input like if the the [3404] input's one percentage Point better then [3406] the output can be many many many orders [3407] of magnitude better so um that's what I [3410] think I may be mistaken there and maybe [3412] you don't want to do this maybe you want [3413] to say 50% on inputs and outputs with a [3415] bat AP and run task asynchronously over [3417] the next 24 hours whatever floats your [3419] boat this is taking me a lot of time [3422] though because it's writing all six [3423] right uh realistically I probably should [3424] have limited this to one and then just [3426] wrote one at a time instead of all six [3428] simultaneously but uh yeah if anybody [3430] has any Jeopardy music now would be the [3431] time okay um oh nice that actually did [3434] finish right on Q much [3438] appreciated looks pretty good uh I'm [3440] just going to check this now [3447] I mean it's pretty chunky don't get me [3451] wrong let me save [3453] this and pin this just so that I I have [3456] all of it in article [3460] section and now oh just deactivated it [3462] by pressing D and now I'm going to use [3465] another edit fields or set node and I'm [3467] going to just say you know like [3469] concatenate basically so I'm going to oh [3472] hold on a second I think I need to [3473] aggregate this because I have six items [3474] let me just combine a field for many [3477] items and all list to a single item [3478] right so I'm going to combine article [3480] section [3481] here I believe that's that let's test [3484] this right so now I have it in a list [3486] the second that I have in a list now [3487] it's pretty easy for me to join this all [3490] I do is say [3493] um draft and I go over [3496] here and then I'll go to expression and [3499] all I'm doing now is I'm basically just [3501] going to be joining this [3507] um and then if I test this now my final [3509] string contains invalid Jason why [3515] again [3517] H I might have too many of these one [3522] more [3523] time also contains invalid [3529] Jason this is really really long a [3532] little too long honestly [3536] well let me double check the key draft [3539] is followed [3540] by this which is nonv valid Jason syntax [3544] right so oh right if I do this and [3549] this should look like that but there's [3552] probably an [3553] issue [3556] because I'm [3564] probably probably using the wrong quote [3566] signs or [3569] something let me just double check this [3571] one more [3578] time I'm unfortunately going to have to [3580] go through this whole thing in the [3581] expression editor here just see [3585] so understanding the agent oh you know [3587] what do I even need to do [3590] this man that's long as hell [3593] Jesus looks pretty good to me [3600] where is [3602] this go back one two three where's the [3607] fourth I don't see the fourth [3609] here yeah I think that this is actually [3612] okay I'm not really sure what the [3613] problem is maybe somebody here sees it [3615] and I don't um I'm going to spend a [3617] moment fixing this though maybe instead [3620] of Jason let me just try manually [3621] mapping [3624] this what I want is just want to call [3626] this draft then the value is going to be [3629] an [3631] expression cool cool so that looks like [3634] it worked I should also probably have [3637] the title somewhere here [3639] right um what was the title of the piece [3643] again I guess the title was separating a [3647] section zero [3649] right so I'm going to go back [3653] here then I'm going to have [3656] um separate in [3659] sections all maybe can I just go [3663] first I think I need to go off and then [3665] I go [3668] first json. [3674] sections um h [3686] I don't actually remember what this [3689] was dot [3691] sections then can I go [3695] zero think I gotta go zero [3698] right oh you know what it's because I [3701] actually removed this um I sliced it [3705] right yeah I did so I can't actually use [3706] that what I need to [3707] do so I think I actually have to use [3710] this better outline thing H that kind of [3713] sucks I don't like that I do not like [3716] having to do that is the title anywhere [3718] else here that I could just reference [3720] really [3724] quickly I guess I could just have it [3726] generate me the title [3728] here title and then Mega [3733] outline one of those really tiny [3735] annoying things you know um and if I was [3739] a little smarter but how I put this [3740] together I would not be suffering this [3742] right [3743] now but I think I basically have to do [3746] like I basically for the purposes of [3749] Simplicity I have to go through this rig [3751] roll again so you see here where it says [3755] Jason um like this I I can't actually [3758] just use dollar sign Json message [3759] content what I have to do is I dollar [3761] sign generate better outlines do [3768] item um all I meant to [3773] sayir do Json Dot [3777] message. [3778] content. Mega [3781] outline dot split so now I should have a [3785] title [3788] here splitting them oh and then I have [3791] to grab the first one right okay great I [3794] finally have it right then I can [3797] actually just remove this and this is [3798] going to be my final [3801] output this is now my whole article okay [3805] looks pretty good to me let's test this [3809] well got the whole article here and keep [3811] in mind this is pretty fragile we [3812] haven't actually done testing but when I [3813] do the testing you're going to see this [3814] isn't going to work all the time so [3816] we're going to have to put some [3816] safeguards in later [3818] probably um let's call this now uh what [3822] am I going to call [3825] us set draft [3828] article let us also take this whole [3831] draft article um not [3834] here let's go here open this up let's [3838] take this whole draft article [3840] now copy and paste this in a markdown [3843] live [3843] preview and we have everything the same [3846] except we have the whole piece now [3848] understanding the agency sales landscape [3849] sales are critical to assess and growth [3850] of any agency they often present [3851] distinct challenges unique to agency [3853] environments agencies typically offer [3855] specialized Services making their sales [3856] processes more complex and Nuance [3857] compared to traditional product-driven [3858] businesses additionally sales and [3860] agencies often involve selling [3861] intangible outcomes and value [3863] propositions which requires robust [3864] communication strategies and Trust [3866] building efforts how would I rate that [3867] first paragraph great many agency [3870] leaders H misconceptions about the sales [3871] function frequently viewing it as [3872] informal out Pursuit rather than stry [3874] for [3876] process okay look [3881] good okay there's a problem here see [3884] this that's a [3886] problem voila we found problem number [3888] one why is that there why is key [3891] challenges in agency sales processes [3893] here and not lower there should be a new [3896] line there that makes me think there are [3898] more issues like this yes there are okay [3901] you know what I think I know what the [3902] issue is when you split [3907] things [3912] um and then when you join them back [3917] together if you want to join them back [3919] together [3922] nicely what you have to do is you have [3924] to add a separator [3929] in my case I'm G to add two no I'm not [3932] going to add [3935] two maybe I will add [3938] two now if I test [3942] this and I grab this output paste this [3945] back in here you'll see we have the [3946] headers [3950] awesome okay that looks [3954] fine that's true say that again [3961] Jesus okay very nice very [3970] nice now um are we going to be winning [3973] any Nobel prizes for how engaging this [3974] content is no but the purpose of this [3976] content is not necessarily for it to be [3977] engaging how many times do we say the [3982] keyword we say it six times it looks [3985] like in this article and how long is [3986] this [3988] article just going to jump on [3990] wordcounter.net paste this [3995] in um 1500 words in total so six times [3999] 1500 words I mean it's not the highest [4000] density keyword but it's pretty good [4002] yeah it's pretty good and the reading [4003] level is college graduate which I like I [4005] don't like um overly simplified super [4007] annoying ass content so that's cool [4009] that's an article on the agency sales [4010] process we also have links right we have [4012] five links um some of them look like [4014] they're varied some of them say Source [4016] other ones actually have the source like [4018] embedded that's cool real human beings [4020] do [4021] this so really what's left I mean like [4024] we just need to add some images to this [4025] thing [4026] honestly yeah we need to add some images [4028] so why don't I go markdown image [4033] format [4035] um okay I should not have Okay so this [4038] is do we have an image [4040] here right right we do um imager I don't [4045] know AG [4050] geny I'm doing this because I know that [4052] I can get an imager link really [4055] easily I'm just going to take this here [4057] and paste this in see if we could see it [4059] okay so we can so what if I just [4062] littered a bunch of these around right [4064] mastering the agency sales process [4066] comprehensive guide then basically if I [4068] just [4070] found space to do that I mean I know [4073] this isn't like the sexiest because I'm [4076] just pasting the same photo in there [4078] again and again and again but I just [4079] wanted to double check you know I can [4082] render this right so I think if I'm [4084] going to do something like this [4085] realistically um I should just have a [4087] convention where I do an image at the [4088] end of every section like I did this on [4089] my blog quite a while ago and um you [4092] know it's one of the ways that I did [4094] this I did SEO [4099] content now in this case um I was [4101] writing about how to use AI in say [4105] actually funnily enough so as you see I [4107] have like a picture of the ad20 some guy [4110] holding a mug that says the ad20 I had [4112] some rich text sections here that depend [4115] I had some [4117] screenshots some more screenshots this [4119] is of the old prompt I was actually [4120] doing make.com s back then very [4122] interesting and exciting right another [4124] post [4126] here very very interesting these are um [4129] old articles that I've written on [4131] artificial intelligence before anybody [4132] knew who the hell I was check those out [4135] if you want they're pretty cool um or [4137] not so I need now to generate images and [4139] then I need to uh host the images [4141] somewhere and I need to have a link to [4142] the images that I can insert okay that's [4144] the that's the whole goal that's what I [4145] need to do now so the question is how [4147] I'm going to do that well the simple way [4151] so I could just ask AI to do it like [4153] open AI get the [4155] images got to host it somewhere right so [4158] I guess I could just can I upload it to [4159] Google Drive could I download this [4162] image upload it to a Google Drive and [4165] then get the direct download link is [4167] that going to [4169] work that's fine take me to the folder [4172] take me to the folder come in the folder [4176] now direct download link Google Drive [4179] Google Drive has a way where you can [4181] feed in the link to an [4184] item [4187] okay share link and then you can [4189] generate a direct download link which I [4191] believe can be visualized I'm just going [4193] to do editor just in case [4195] it just remaps the um the link a little [4198] bit so if you type this in you'll now go [4199] to a direct link that immediately [4201] downloads the file so what if I go back [4204] here and I paste this link in sorry that [4207] doesn't actually do because [4211] there's that's [4213] annoying obviously it doesn't [4216] um web view link Google Drive markdown [4219] maybe I just type that in [4226] okay I'm not really sure how I'm going [4228] to do that but let's let's just deal [4229] with that later why don't we start by [4230] actually generating the image and seeing [4231] what sort of quality images we can get I [4233] think what I'm going to do is I'm going [4234] to do some stylized stuff right so I'm [4236] just going to open up my little open AI [4237] prompt and I'm going to say something [4238] along the lines of generate me a [4240] stylized [4243] image [4245] of something that represents [4249] um handrawn [4253] simple handrawn on [4258] charcoal simple stylized handdrawn on [4261] charcoal [4272] uh of [4274] this [4277] piece of [4278] [Music] [4280] a something that corresponds to this [4285] article section and I'm just going to [4288] see if I can just stick it in there [4290] could I could I stick it in there what [4294] do you guys [4295] think is that going to [4298] work is that all I need to do just say [4301] this exact sentence and then say make [4304] sure it's stylized like a [4306] pen I don't know we're about to find [4310] out no that's way too crazy man no no [4315] writing no [4318] writing [4320] okay [4322] um yes you're going to write this [4324] again for sure was the problem [4329] here simple stylized handrawn pen [4331] squiggly [4332] lines this session [4339] Rules to [4341] This section of an article below [4347] rules no [4349] text [4351] extraordinarily [4353] simple [4356] minimalistic [4359] one three I don't know three pen Strokes [4364] Max I don't know these are very specific [4366] instructions that the image model isn't [4367] going to [4369] get [4373] minimalistic cute [4380] of a subject that corresponds to the [4381] section of an article below rules no [4383] texts extraordinarily simple [4385] minimalistic as few pen Strokes as [4389] possible [4391] um I don't know man I might just want to [4393] use something else for this like mid [4394] Journey or something Dally's just always [4398] sucked to me [4401] anyway also I should note that when I [4403] feed this into chaty BT it's not [4405] actually just taking my word [4408] verbatim that's perfect that's exactly [4410] what I wanted you see this exactly what [4412] I wanted holy perfect oh man that's [4415] perfect I wanted something cute I wanted [4417] like stick characters I wanted it I mean [4420] it's say sales pipeline there H it's [4422] little writing assumably possible this [4424] this is this is exactly what I want okay [4426] this makes me feel confident that we can [4428] actually get this [4431] done okay is it going to be perfect [4433] probably not no but this makes me feel [4435] confident we can actually get this done [4437] if we do it [4438] Tastefully we do it in a few places so [4441] we got my six items [4443] right uh I'm just going to add a limit [4446] so that I don't have to do this again [4447] I'm going to set the limit to one by [4449] doing this only the first item is going [4451] to make it through here now we can go [4453] back to open [4454] Ai and we can generate an image I'm [4457] going to select my credential the [4459] resource I'm going to generat an image [4461] generate model is going to be Dolly 3 [4462] and I will paste this in [4465] generate me a simple stylized image [4467] handdrawn pen squiggly lines cute of a [4469] subject that [4471] corresponds of a [4476] subject subject should correspond to the [4478] section of an [4480] article should relate to to and [4483] correspond to the [4485] section article [4487] blow section let's feed this in [4492] now make sure it's cute [4496] and [4498] simple respond with an image URL hell [4501] yeah test the step should now just be [4504] doing it on one because we're feeding at [4505] one this is an introduction about the [4507] agency sales landscape might draw me [4510] something about a landscape who knows [4512] let me check if these image URLs are [4514] directly linkable if they are boom we [4516] got our article that's going to be [4520] perfect revised prompt [4525] Helm or a beacon perfect so if I paste [4527] this in now oh no [4530] text no text how do we stop this [4537] text no text please please no text style [4542] maybe there's a [4544] style hyper real and dramatic okay uh [4548] natural looking or hyper let's try [4549] hyperreal and dramatic maybe [4551] that'll sorry hyper real oh I don't [4554] want oh man I don't want actual hyper [4556] real my bad I clicked the wrong button [4562] there we are certainly coming up on some [4568] lengthy maybe I should say the word [4571] blob that actually looks pretty cool [4574] it's not that that's not bad at [4580] all all right honestly not terrible um [4584] okay well with this URL paste the sun [4587] can I can I just link it directly back [4589] to markdown live preview paste the sun [4591] oh I can that's dangerous look at that [4594] ain't that cool beautiful beautiful man [4596] so stoked about this awesome it'd be [4599] nice if we had some unified style for [4601] all of this and I think that that would [4602] actually be pretty straightforward to do [4604] um presumably you would have to use the [4606] same batch of [4608] keywords um like minimalistic UniFi like [4611] like there's there's doll E3 [4615] prompt [4621] Styles hand [4623] drawn I do something like [4629] this yeah yeah that's fine no no no no [4632] no no no all this is [4638] trash no most of these are this one's [4642] okay oh that's a drawing on like a piece [4644] of paper [4646] H we could do something like that [4647] watercolor pixel [4648] art watercolor pixel art you know [4651] imagine you make your style like [4653] watercolor [4654] pixel or like anime or something on your [4658] blog well then you just generate these [4659] and like sure it's not going to be [4660] perfect right there's some minor issues [4662] here shoes or whatever but like people [4663] aren't going to care they're going to [4664] say oh that's just a consequence of the [4666] fact that you're generating an image [4668] sorry um that's Consequence the fact of [4670] uh part of your [4671] style more than anything else [4675] I'm I'm not looking for this though I'm [4677] looking for okay I'm not seeing anything [4680] here unfortunately this is cool I like [4682] this I like the watercolor I could try [4685] that um watercolored pixel art anyway [4689] maybe I'll just stick with what I have [4690] right now and then we'll just finish it [4691] and then I can give uh yall a primer on [4694] like different styles and stuff like [4695] that after so okay so so what do we have [4699] here we have um all six items we're [4701] going to do the limit then another six [4703] items are going to pass we're going to [4704] generate an image for all six items then [4705] we're just going to aggregate all these [4707] okay so we need to do two input field [4709] names the first is going to be message. [4711] content. article [4713] section [4716] uh if you think about [4719] it do we need to even do this in like [4722] this linear flow like do I need to limit [4724] it and then produce this image are you [4726] using anything here that is super [4729] valuable or important for me yeah we are [4731] actually we're we're feeding in the [4733] content of the thing right [4735] that makes [4737] sense so we actually can't [4740] um oh sorry I need to turn this into [4742] expression if I am to drag and drop a [4745] variable in here there we [4748] go right so yeah we are going to have to [4751] do it that way um but basically what I [4753] want to do after that is I just want to [4754] combine these two [4755] so I want have like [4759] a I don't know um aggregated message. [4765] article [4766] section was going to be a little bit [4767] further back [4769] right I guess I could just feed all item [4771] data into a single list I wonder what [4773] happens when I do that I don't think [4774] I've ever done this [4776] before no that just grabs it immediately [4778] from the preceding [4780] um immediately from the preceding [4785] node [4787] H uh what would this mean for me then [4790] well I basically need to grab the link [4793] from here I need to format it as [4796] markdown then I need to stick it or [4799] prepend it to all the or append it to [4801] all the sections here [4804] right so how am I going to do [4808] that when I aggregate [4815] them oh boy we got our we got ourselves [4818] a real problem here problem is uh I'm [4822] unclear on the data [4827] format that I should be [4829] using could I just feed this output [4832] directly in [4833] too will that [4835] work this might work what if now we just [4839] add all Fields into this [4843] thing [4846] okay [4848] so all item data is now going into a [4850] single [4851] list we are receiving this but where is [4854] is the image data [4860] now maybe what we do is we do individual [4863] fields we do content article [4865] section we also do one here called [4871] URL [4873] no we just have an empty URL block [4877] what's [4880] annoying oh uh sorry I probably just use [4882] a merge now don't I might be in [4887] silly once data from both is available [4889] so I have to wait but then after I [4891] should be able to stream the sentence [4892] input one stream the sentence input two [4896] right and from [4899] here I [4900] will output items of each input one [4904] after the can I just combine [4907] by [4908] position number of inputs two if I test [4911] this now what's going to happen revised [4913] prompt URL oh okay cool cool cool cool [4917] it should just only be feeding in one [4918] right oh well it's six in one H [4923] um I should uh do I need [4928] a there you go that's probably [4934] better this is starting to look a little [4936] janky but bear with me here so we're [4938] then going to combine these two and I [4940] just want to make sure it's the same [4942] one so we have both the mess message [4945] article section accessible to us and [4947] then the [4948] URL so that's good and I think I'm going [4951] have to do one more edit Fields node [4957] unfortunately to now do the formatting [4959] that I'm looking for which is section [4963] and image then the value of this is [4966] going to be what are we going to do here [4969] uh we'll feed this in [4972] first then down at the [4975] bottom I'll go URL in [4982] here [4984] and I don't think I need anything else [4986] just to be clear how do I do this drag [4989] racing this is where the caption goes if [4990] I just remove the caption does this [4991] break anything no it doesn't cool so I [4995] should be able to test this now the [4996] output should be [4999] this alongside two new lines one two and [5004] then the [5005] image I don't think we actually need two [5008] new lines there but that's okay all [5011] right now that I have all this I'm going [5012] to be outputting six items right I can [5015] delete this feed this into the aggregate [5017] node right du then I can just aggregate [5021] all item data into a single list now [5023] we're going to have one item but it's [5024] going to be section an image here under [5025] data and then we could set the draft [5029] article as the [5031] title and then [5036] json. dat is probably what I need [5042] right it'll be [5045] data do [5053] jooin uh why is why am I not seeing this [5055] Jason [5057] data [5060] right [5061] dot BL really [5066] h [5068] no no we we'd go jason. data. [5071] all do [5074] join I'm not seeing this probably [5078] because sorry Jason do [5084] um I'm oh I'm not really sure why I'm [5086] not seeing this to be honest okay let me [5088] just let me just run all this [5092] once so now I have the title that's fine [5095] oh you know what let me just run all [5096] this actually two times so let's change [5098] the limit to [5100] two yeah let's just change the limit to [5103] two let's test [5106] this fed six in here we're going to be [5109] taking out two so I going to regenerate [5111] this too it's going to generate me a [5114] couple [5114] images then we can run the merge node [5116] after the two image Generations is done [5119] that should help then from there uh I [5122] believe I should be good to continue on [5125] and then wrap this up with the images [5127] and then um yeah yeah then after that we [5131] should be good to go so just keeping [5133] track of time here we wrote the content [5134] using the LM we've now created stylized [5136] images using AI we just need to queue up [5137] the post to figure out that formatting [5139] and I'm just running through the testing [5141] flow and I I know I don't need to do [5142] this but um I just wanted to so that I [5145] could see things one by one I like going [5146] node by node by node wherever [5148] possible so we're just going to unpin [5150] this uh I'm now going to edit the fields [5153] so that we have two items with section [5155] and image wonderful we're now going to [5156] aggregate these two items into a uh list [5160] containing two items data zero data one [5162] we're not going to set this draft [5163] article [5165] okay what we want to do well what we [5168] need to do is we need to join them so [5170] I'm going to go Json that'll be the last [5173] data now it's data is already uh an [5176] array so we can actually just join this [5181] immediately h [5186] um no we need to flatten this [5191] actually okay well we could we could map [5194] this I guess that's [5197] fine why don't I just get [5200] item we'll just go item do section and [5204] image okay so now we have an array which [5207] is just like a list [5209] of all of this right which I've now [5212] mapped [5217] then I think we can just join this [5222] now maybe with an an extra new [5227] line and I do think I actually need an [5229] additional new line when I split this or [5232] or add this I should [5234] say that'll be easier it'll look better [5238] we'll then aggregate this I'm going to [5240] set the draft article with the two [5241] pieces [5244] sorry we don't want that we want this [5248] cool yeah yeah now we have the image [5249] here image here awesome so yeah that [5253] looks pretty good uh oh uh and then you [5255] know I don't think I need that that's [5257] what I didn't need I didn't need that [5258] space between that and the title nice [5261] very cool very cool very clean I should [5263] say starting to really come [5265] together cool so that's the draft [5267] article um H what I think we should [5270] realistically do now [5274] is just going to save this uh we have [5278] basically everything we need it's just a [5279] matter of how do we get this on a page [5281] somewhere right I think there are a [5283] variety of ways uh let me just check if [5285] there's like a WordPress [5287] thing I already create a post in [5292] WordPress and then if I were to let's [5294] say update that post in [5296] WordPress or add text to a post or [5300] something [5302] content the content for the oh you know [5305] I'm going to have to do a connection if [5306] I want to do [5307] that guess we could go Google Docs as [5310] well uh but then I have to update the [5312] document with text insert can I do [5317] HTML can I just insert the entire [5319] article into a Google doc I actually [5321] don't know how to do this so we're going [5322] to find out together we'll go Google [5324] Docs we'll go create a doc now I'm going [5326] to create a document um just right over [5328] here in my [5329] normal slash and then the title will [5332] just be whatever the I don't know I'm [5334] just going to say example title okay [5336] test [5338] this from here we're going to have an ID [5340] and a bunch of stuff that's fine now [5342] what I'm going to do is I'm going to [5343] feed this into this Google doc doc ID is [5345] just going to be this which is going to [5346] be hardcoded basically simplify what's [5349] this oh yes then if I just take the the [5352] whole draft article and just feed this [5353] in now okay what exactly would [5357] happen what the hell would happen here [5366] just going to go and navigate to the [5367] specific ID of the specific [5369] piece we have the whole thing so that [5372] makes me think we'd probably feed in [5373] HTML too right so why don't I now take [5376] my mark [5378] down convert [5380] it to [5383] HTML feed in my draft destination key [5386] data [5387] fine add blanks to Links no automatic [5390] linking to URLs um no backs slash no [5394] okay there's a lot of options here I [5396] don't know which one is which so I'm [5398] just going to try without any of [5400] this this is my data it outputs the [5403] draft and it outputs the data that's [5405] nice so now we're going to create the [5407] doc what I'm going to do just going to [5409] feed in this [5413] data [5417] okay unpin node Google Docs one and [5419] execute oh yeah yeah my bad um I need to [5422] unpin this and then I need to create a [5424] new one that's fine um this is my [5426] example title here so I'm going to [5427] delete this now go back here okay we're [5430] going to create a new Google [5433] doc over here we're going to update that [5436] Google [5438] doc and then I'm just going [5444] to no that's not right we need this to [5447] have HTML in [5449] it we need to create a document using [5452] HTML basically [5454] and then it needs to be formatted so why [5456] is this not formatted [5460] H text insert footer header named range [5464] page break paragraph bullets table okay [5466] that's not [5474] right update Fields I'm not really sure [5477] what that means looks like I have [5482] several hm [5485] okay well I might be a little limited [5487] here um Google Docs naden [5497] HTML H nobody replied to that [5508] guy okay uploading an HTML document in [5511] order to create a new Google doc is not [5512] supported that's fine [5516] could I maybe use the Google Drive nodes [5519] for [5520] this create a fall from text [5523] maybe you try that create a fall from [5526] text [5530] here well let's give it a try why don't [5533] I just paste in a bunch of HTML let's [5535] just go direct to the markdown node and [5537] we'll just test this just grab all of [5539] the HTML [5541] here from the beginning to the end [5546] go over here paste it [5548] in maybe I need like the the actual full [5551] thing now that I'm thinking about it I [5553] don't know we're going to test this [5556] anyway it's probably just going to be a [5557] text file realistically [5562] right let's go [5565] here what was this called we need to get [5568] the name the name is just [5571] x x.com um this is a Google [5576] doc open with Google Docs this looks [5579] this looks nice right that's that looks [5581] pretty good ah oh the hell that that [5585] actually looks good why does it look [5587] good from the outside in that's [5589] perfect [5591] H not really sure what's going on there [5594] but it does look pretty damn good but [5596] then when we click on it it doesn't look [5598] good H well we need some sort of [5600] deliverable folks I don't know how we're [5602] going to do this deliverable if I'm [5603] being honest [5605] I need something that this thing dumps [5606] to generates to I need some I do [5609] markdown for Simplicity but I need [5614] something could it be that um this needs [5618] to add complete HTML [5621] document that'll generate me the dock [5624] type HTML then when I update [5629] this it'll be bigger [5639] that definitely didn't do anything what [5641] if I grab all this and then pump this [5643] into this Google doc [5647] now just see if there are any examples [5650] convert to Google doc oh maybe this is [5651] it maybe this is it convert to Google [5652] Document test step okay so I I've made a [5654] couple changes here I've added like a [5655] full HTML document with a bunch of stuff [5658] so they may not actually be call this [5662] html text HTML example no maybe if I [5666] remove this now if I go back to markdown [5669] and then I do not do complete HTML [5672] document then where it says Google drive [5674] what I do is I actually just yeah sure [5675] I'm going to execute all them again I [5677] don't care then I'm going to feed in [5679] this [5680] markdown full HTML supposedly not full [5683] HTML document then convert it how about [5688] that [5689] maybe maybe no [5693] things ain't looking super good for us [5695] what's ap properties I don't know what [5697] the hell that means okay so it looks [5698] like the way that you actually do this [5700] is you will convert the markdown to HTML [5702] which is hypertext markup language it's [5704] a lot more understood by um Google and a [5706] bunch of other platforms then you need [5710] to create the Google drive file [5715] from um the text that you provided in in [5719] in HTML here so we stick that right over [5721] here then after that we download that [5724] file for whatever reason with an HTML [5727] file extension then after that we upload [5730] that same file which is kind of annoying [5733] uh but that's what you have to do and [5734] then you know you can also do at the end [5736] here so you can delete that first file [5739] right this Google Drive create from text [5741] file so I'm just going to go back here [5743] and then I'm going to go by ID and then [5745] I'm going to delete the file [5748] from this Google [5750] Drive the reason why I'm doing this [5752] obviously uh it's just because this is [5754] kind of a hacky thing that I need to do [5757] in order to make it work kind of blows [5759] but yeah create the file download it re [5762] you know upload it again then delete it [5764] afterwards Lord Almighty um but yeah the [5767] end result is you you end up with the [5768] file right over here which if you um [5772] sorry that's not the file you end up [5773] with a file that if you top right hand [5775] corner go open with Google Docs it'll [5778] open it in Google DOC format which will [5779] look something like this we can see we [5781] have our images in there as well now our [5782] images are pretty big not going to lie [5785] don't know if there's a way to set um [5787] custom image sizes if there is I will [5789] figure it out but uh you know you [5791] basically now have everything that you [5793] need in order to write the whole blog [5795] post essentially and it looks pretty [5796] good right aren too many issues you see [5798] there are links in here they're nicely [5800] done they go directly to the resource [5803] you have um images of the specifical uh [5806] the specifical the specific uh little [5809] things that we we generated earlier [5810] which are usually just blobs and kind of [5812] cute shapes and stuff the headings [5814] there's a good spacing here between [5817] elements maybe we go add space after [5820] paragraph before and then after as [5823] well um you know there there's there's a [5825] lot going on looks pretty so that's cool [5828] uh a couple things we need to fix we [5829] need fix the titles still says title [5831] example so when I was bugging around I [5833] obviously did a lot of BS here what I'm [5835] going to [5837] do is I kind of got to grab the title [5845] right so I'm GNA go over here where it [5847] says mastering the agency sales [5851] process [5852] okay then I will go back to where I do [5856] my [5859] title my title will be [5866] this [5870] um do I need this [5874] just separate it by based off new lines [5876] and then I can grab the first one that's [5877] probably the easiest way to do it then I [5880] could just replace all instances of um [5884] dollar signs or Hashtags with uh [5888] nothing still have a space there though [5890] I don't like that I don't know [5892] why okay anyway um that solves this [5895] particular case but as I've mentioned [5896] before you know there probably going to [5897] be some issues uh with other ones but [5900] Okay cool so we have the title now which [5902] is nice that's done when we download the [5906] file we're doing so with these options [5908] I'm just going to get rid of [5910] that then when we upload the file we [5912] obviously [5914] need we need the same thing so just [5916] going to copy all of this come back here [5919] I'll upload it all again get the same [5923] title oh you know what we probably need [5925] an HTML here don't [5928] we if we don't have the HTML it'll [5931] probably hate us there you go [5934] same thing when we do the [5937] upload then we go back here to delete [5940] file we want to do is just want to use a [5942] schema view so we go back to here where [5944] we generated the item in the first place [5946] and we can delete it um it's telling me [5947] that we can't find the specific item so [5950] let me go here I'll go all so now we [5954] have all of these items now I should be [5956] able to do first I should also then be [5958] able to do json. ID [5961] cool and we should delete that previous [5963] item because it's ugly and we hate it [5966] then finally we need some way to notify [5968] us right so maybe what I'll do is I will [5972] email it why don't we do [5975] that I send a message I'm going to send [5978] that message over to myself nickit left [5982] click. a and then I'm going to um simply [5986] ask [5987] here your [5992] content is [5994] ready your content then in Brackets I'll [5997] include the [5999] name maybe we will [6002] do oh I wish we returned the title oh [6005] yeah we do return the title that's cool [6008] yeah so your content which will in this [6010] case not be title example but um it says [6012] so now but when we actually generate the [6014] content it won't be so your content is [6019] ready hello you [6025] you'll find find your content at the [6028] following [6029] link uh one more thing we actually have [6031] to do unfortunately is we have to get a [6033] share link from Google Drive so I know [6035] it's a lot of Google Drive nodes here [6037] but we have to it's called share [6041] file basically we have to do is we have [6043] to feed in the ID of the file we we just [6045] um not the one we just download sorry [6047] not the one that we just um deleted what [6050] we want is this one here Google Drive to [6053] the one that we created so voila the [6057] permissions are going to [6058] be reader to [6062] everybody okay and then once we have [6064] that link which we need to test in order [6066] to get the data I should now be able to [6069] grab the [6070] link from this um where the hell is the [6077] the ID is not anyone with link come on [6081] really that's obviously not the actual [6083] ID of the [6085] file oh email [6089] message oh that's really cool you know [6091] what we could probably just sort all the [6093] stuff out send notification [6096] email and just say hi your file is [6099] ready then what we could do is we could [6101] actually just email it directly to the [6104] user and where we'll get that email so [6108] we'll get that email from our form input [6111] which we will feed into guess we got a [6113] feed it into both [6116] here [6118] so have a variety of different ways we [6120] can trigger this flow this is my testing [6122] one this is sort of my real one with the [6123] form input going to be feeding in the [6126] keyword from on form [6128] submission let me just make sure that [6130] all of this is [6138] correct keyword I'm just going to feed [6141] that form submission in there then ract [6143] their outlines markdown format cool cool [6145] cool that looks fine just make sure that [6146] the citation flow also works with the [6150] following keyword it's grabbing Jason [6152] keyword [6155] from I'm just going to feed this in as [6158] well I guess that's also Jason keyword [6160] so it'll oh okay I got it it should [6162] perform the same regardless of whichever [6163] one we use to [6164] trigger very nice um and then I want to [6168] add one more thing here which is [6169] obviously the email address so we go [6171] email [6175] let's go lowercase here also make that [6178] required now I'm going to test this [6180] unpin it and test it's going to open up [6182] this I'm going to say agency sales [6183] process email is going to be Nick left [6185] click. uh I'll use my other email here [6188] that way it emails me from nickol left [6190] click. now we have an email node or an [6193] email variable this technically won't be [6195] accessible at the end but I'm just going [6196] to stick it at the end [6200] regardless um okay let's just just let's [6203] think really deeply about this how the [6204] hell are we going to reference that file [6206] all the way over [6208] there [6210] so one [6212] sec this should still have access to the [6214] few nodes before right so let me just [6216] see how this is [6219] formatted me just stick this here for [6221] testing purposes email was on form [6224] submission Okay cool so on form [6226] submission item. json. Emil I think this [6228] is probably going to work if not it's [6230] not the end of the world I can always [6232] just update it afterwards [6233] but on form submission item Jason email [6237] hi your file is ready find it at this [6241] link [6243] cool all right we got some renaming to [6245] do here so this is going to [6248] be [6250] create [6260] um create HTML file this one here will [6263] be download to nadn this one here will [6268] be re-upload to drive this one here will [6272] be [6274] delete HTML file this one here will be [6280] share [6282] link let's do share link and [6285] email okay for limit I have the set at [6288] two so I'm actually just going to if I [6291] can leave this blank do I get all of [6292] them let's just do [6294] 100 all any other limits I need to be [6296] aware of doesn't look like it cool I [6298] should now be able to test this so if I [6300] just delete this if I just like select [6303] all of these nodes and then press uh U [6306] for unpin it doesn't look like I can do [6307] that that'd be sweet if I could have but [6309] I [6311] can't G to unpin unpin unpin [6315] unpin unpin and we are now that we've [6318] done uh testing kind of one by one by [6320] one we're actually going to do an end to [6321] end test using the form submission [6323] um I guarantee there going to be some [6325] sort of issue here um I always do this [6327] anytime I want to make a flow live I [6329] have to end end test it if it doesn't [6330] make it all the way through uh variety [6332] of of reasons why that might be like if [6334] you think about it I'm generating a lot [6335] of content with gbt 4.5 here and I'm [6337] going to be doing a lot of it in quick [6338] succession so rate limits could be an [6340] issue the way that I'm calling variables [6342] could be an issue I haven't verified [6343] that I have these four Google doc five [6345] Google doc calls in a row which um you [6347] know the Google Docs sorry Google Drive [6348] API is very notorious for being slow and [6351] crappy yeah iety of uh variety of [6354] potential problems [6356] here let's just make it abundantly clear [6358] what's first this is first okay so now [6361] I'm going to test this [6362] workflow keywords agency sales process [6365] emails Nicholas gmail.com I'm submitting [6369] okay we're now finding [6374] outlines just going to run that one [6377] first extracting and formatting the [6381] oines we should be feeding from this [6383] though I'm not sure why that's not [6387] feeded did you find [6391] citations why is this not finding the [6392] citations should find the citations [6395] immediately are you having a problem [6397] little [6398] one okay well anyway so uh what where [6401] did we get to here so we un form [6403] submission [6404] here [6405] um just in case this might be causing a [6408] problem of some kind let me just unlink [6409] this for [6410] now we found outlines [6413] we also sent data to find citations we [6417] have yet to start this for whatever [6418] reason not sure [6420] why anyway after that it looks like we [6423] extracted and formatted the outlines [6424] what did we feed in as an input we have [6427] find outlines over here it says items [6430] exist but they're empty so very first [6433] thing I want to do during this debugging [6434] is I just want to figure out why this [6436] didn't run so I'm going to pin this [6438] which should have all of the data that I [6440] need [6444] respond when the form is submitted sure [6446] that's [6448] fine oh I guess I could actually have [6450] just like inserted um responded with the [6453] form that's funny anyway whatever I'm G [6455] to pin this I don't know why this isn't [6457] working right I want it I want it to [6459] grab both so I'm just going to test this [6465] now okay so in order to run this I need [6468] to have both pieces of data that seems [6469] fine I'm not sure why I couldn't do that [6472] uh why I didn't do do that initially I'm [6474] just going to disconnect and reconnect [6476] them cuz sometimes I find that in [6478] platforms like this this happens I don't [6480] know if that's the reason why this [6482] didn't work but we'll find out okay so [6485] there was some issue here with the [6487] generat batter outline looks like an [6489] expression references the node test flow [6491] but it hasn't been executed yet so where [6493] are we getting that from ah I see we are [6494] getting this from test flow okay we are [6497] getting this from the test flow Noe so [6499] odds are there's probably some other [6501] issues with this that rely on the the [6503] test word [6505] um the test flow node so minor minor [6509] issue but that's okay that was the whole [6511] purpose of this right we're now going to [6513] generate a better outline and while I'm [6514] at it I'm just very quickly going to [6515] verify that there is no test ah there is [6518] see you could see it right here so I'm [6520] actually going to go back [6521] here get that test flow variable and [6524] just replace [6529] it any more [6533] test flow no don't see anything here [6536] test flow no I don't see anything [6539] here set draft article test flow no I [6542] don't see anything here test flow okay [6544] no I don't see anything else anywhere [6546] here so I think I'm okay on the test [6548] Flow side of things I am of course [6550] generating quite uh a chunky outline [6554] here looks pretty solid um but that's [6556] not enough you know I I don't want to [6558] just generate this piece by piece again [6559] I actually want to run through the whole [6560] thing so what am I gon to do I'm [6561] actually going to delete all of these [6563] then I'm just going to unpin this and [6565] then I'm actually going to test this [6567] workflow again we're going to do the [6568] exact same thing I just did agency sales [6570] process GL gmail.com [6574] cool now kicking [6578] back the response has been Rec oh why [6580] the hell does this keep on happening I [6581] don't I don't like [6583] that I thought I could do this [6585] simultaneously doesn't look like I can [6586] it looks like this is going to run [6587] without this so this data isn't going to [6589] be [6590] accessible that kind of blows [6594] I've totally done this multiple times [6595] before so it's odd that I'm not doing [6598] both yeah so this is not going to be [6599] able to reference the find citations now [6601] okay well whatever I'm not going to [6602] think too much about it I'm just going [6603] to remove [6605] this and then place this in between [6608] these two now this is probably going to [6611] be referencing json. [6614] keyword which means I'm going to have to [6616] actually go and hardcode the keyword [6619] in using this [6623] there you go okay so we should find the [6625] citation [6629] afterwards instead of json. choices. [6632] message. content what we're actually G [6634] to have to do think about it so we're [6637] gonna have to ex so I got to execute all [6638] the previous nodes again which kind of [6640] sucks but is what it [6642] is um let's go here execute the fine [6646] citations [6651] note okay we got it now so we can now go [6656] here this is now the last node which is [6663] good oh sorry this actually is not this [6666] is not [6669] correct so what we need to do is we [6671] actually need to replace this with the [6672] outlines right so I'm actually going to [6674] replace this with the outlines we'll go [6675] choices zero content there we go nice [6680] okay let me see if we need to remap [6681] anything here do we have to remap [6685] anything um no that looks fine Jason key [6689] word no that looks fine citations [6691] citations [6692] citations nope that looks fine okay I I [6695] think we're actually okay now let's do [6697] this one more [6699] time agency sales process Nick [6703] nickis I left yeah [6706] gmail.com I like how you can move stuff [6708] around in nadn while you're um while [6710] you're playing with it it's [6713] cool can't do that in [6718] make we are finding the hell out of [6720] these citations we are fining these [6721] citations so well ladies and gentlemen [6723] that we didn't even get an error in the [6725] extract and format outlines [6727] node that is some [6729] energy wonderful [6734] wonderful that will generate us lay out [6738] lines now we're just doing in one item [6741] here but when we generate a better Lin [6743] still going to be one when we gener when [6744] we separate into sections though it's [6745] going to be a lot right and we're going [6747] to have to write six sections [6748] simultaneously so if there is going to [6750] be an issue I anticipate the issue is [6752] going to be [6754] here this is just one call with gbd 4.5 [6757] right not that big of a [6764] deal I would love to get myself a [6768] button that I can click anytime I want [6772] uh that plays Jeopardy [6775] music and then every time I have a [6777] weight like this I can just click a [6779] button and it [6782] goes or maybe I need like a hat or [6784] something you know like a funny hat [6787] funny waiting hat I put on like the [6788] waiting hat maybe on top there's like a [6790] clock or something on set hat that'd be [6792] a really funny mini game anytime you [6793] watch my content would keep you engaged [6796] as opposed to just looking at a little [6798] wheel should be [6800] fun uh but yeah [6804] we must wait for the outline to be [6806] generated and I am a very lazy editor so [6810] I prefer not to have to edit stuff like [6813] this wherever possible so if I could [6815] find a way to make it super engaging [6817] that would solve my whole problem okay [6819] generated the better [6821] outline outline looks pretty good here [6823] I'm not seeing any [6825] problems I'm seeing links that's good [6829] we're separating them into [6831] sections introduction this looks good [6833] basically the exact same thing that we [6835] were doing before very different article [6837] to last time we split them [6841] out these are some very in-depth outline [6843] sections very very nice so now we're [6845] writing section by section we're doing [6847] all nine simultaneously if I open this [6848] up um one unfortunate thing is you can't [6851] see the nodes as they are being [6852] generated but they certainly [6855] are no limiter here so this open node is [6858] going to generate some images we're then [6860] going to merge them [6862] anything that I can just get ahead of [6864] while I'm [6866] waiting looks pretty good I mean like [6868] you know ideally we would add um [6869] metadata so [6871] the image URL would not just be a lone [6875] image URL we'd have the image URL plus [6877] we'd have uh some caption but it is what [6881] it [6882] is and I am very curious to see what [6884] sharing that image would look uh sharing [6886] the the final product would look like uh [6889] it'll be kind of a waiting game because [6890] I'm sure we're going to run into some [6891] issues during the generation of this [6893] puppy okay we've written the sections [6895] looks like we had nine items come in [6897] very cool if I now look at the [6900] output first section looks formatted [6903] well can't really say much more than [6905] that but yeah it does look formatted [6909] well second third and fourth sections [6911] look formatted well what we're doing now [6913] is we're generating the images via open [6915] AI um and you know what maybe the reason [6917] why I thought that these would both run [6919] simultaneously is because I'm used to [6920] doing two inputs to emerge no like this [6923] so now that I think about it I probably [6926] could have had a merge node where I [6927] merge these two together and then feed [6928] it into Ai and I probably would have run [6931] but to be honest just a I'm just saving [6933] a little bit of real estate there no no [6934] major problems or [6936] issues I'm surprised that we haven't ah [6938] okay there we go we have now run into [6940] yes we have now run into an issue [6941] maximum length is 4,000 characters cool [6943] so that's very good to know maximum [6946] length of the section is 4,000 [6948] characters what was the issue that led [6950] me to [6952] being over 4,000 [6958] characters [6961] H what we should probably do is we [6963] should probably just summarize this feed [6965] the summaries into open AI instead of [6968] this should I do another model call if I [6970] do another model call we are really [6971] getting in the thick of it here but I [6973] could what that would look like is I [6975] would simp I have a simple prompt that [6976] just say hey summarize the section [6978] summarize key findings in this section [6979] basically then I would feed that in here [6982] and then instead of it being 4,000 [6983] characters like it is now by the way [6985] 4,000 [6986] characters is about uh 700 words or so [6989] really 7 words I fed in 700 words in [6992] this thing which one man I see nine [6994] items here but which [6996] one let's check the output of [6999] this 700 words I don't that doesn't look [7003] like 700 words to me that doesn't look [7005] like 700 4,000 cares two words yeah man [7009] wild what the hell is 700 words [7013] okay might be this one this it's pretty [7015] long no still not that [7018] long you know what it might be maybe [7020] it's a word limit a rate limit thing H [7022] yeah I should probably do that I haven't [7024] really touched on debugging at all not [7027] even a tiny bit bunch of different ways [7029] we could solve this problem I could [7030] generate [7031] fewer no I think I'm going to have to I [7034] think I'm going to have to just generate [7035] very short summaries I do want an image [7037] at the end of [7040] everyone okay well what I do this [7044] then why don't I add another module [7047] here just call it open [7051] AI going to say message model it's going [7054] to be a very dumb [7055] model to minimize character [7058] limits gbd4 a mini minimize cost as [7062] well you a helpful intelligent writing [7066] assistant then I will say summarize [7070] this into five bullet [7073] points then I'll will feed this in I [7076] will simply [7081] take summarize the below section article [7086] section into five bullet [7089] points return output in [7094] Json I'm going to say [7098] summary uh let's not do bullet points [7113] okay I'm then going to go user going to [7115] feed it [7117] in article [7120] section [7122] um [7125] here then I'm going to close that outp [7128] put the content as Json in [7130] summary I will then test this once oh [7134]  oh crap it's going to test nine [7137] times uh [7140] yeah yeah it's going to test nine times [7143] that sucks man can we just stop this [7146] stop for the love of God man stop all [7151] right I have confidence that that's [7152] going to work so what do we do inside of [7155] generate we open this up and then we [7158] want Jason [7163] oh uh actually it's kind of annoying I [7166] kind of do want to test [7172] this can I grab a piece from one of [7174] these [7185] articles let's go back here now [7197] Let's test this just so I can get a feel [7198] for what the output looks like content [7201] summary [7203] right go back here paste that [7206] in now because I have this I'll have [7208] access to the content summary down there [7211] which means I'll be able to just drag [7212] this in [7214] Easy uh easy pey lemon squeezy [7222] now going to test this with my very [7225] short [7227] summary oh right it's probably 4,000 [7229] characters with all of the prompt there [7232] test this with my very very short [7239] summary is this running more than once [7241] no it's just running once [7243] cool we got the cute little thing with [7247] the Sals perfect nice so now we can just [7250] feed this limit in [7253] we're going to take as input the article [7255] section that we've generated from here [7258] okay cool all right uh awesome awesome [7262] so let me just do this again yeah I'm [7264] just going to Contin continuously do [7266] this till I get further and further [7267] along um do I [7269] recommend sorry do I like testing and [7272] spending God knows how long doing this [7273] no I don't but um is there any other way [7276] to be sure that the system does what you [7277] want it to do first you do node by node [7280] testing just like we've done but next [7282] you have to test the entire performance [7283] of the unit as a whole like I'm doing [7285] now so no there is no other way to do it [7287] I'm just going to keep on doing it until [7288] I uh brute force my way through this and [7290] then eventually finish it okay and it [7293] looks like we are now good to go with [7295] that um flow started and finished in [7299] think it's like two and a half minutes [7300] or so so it does take a fair amount of [7302] time to generate one of these puppies [7304] the end result is over here you'll get a [7305] little um Google doc thing that looks [7307] like this with the hdmo once you click [7309] open with Google Docs it'll be here I'm [7312] just going to add a little bit of [7312] formatting to this because I like the [7314] way that it looks technically you can do [7315] this through API as well you could get [7317] the ID of it and then like add a bunch [7319] of your pre formatting rules if you want [7321] and I'm just going to look at this right [7322] now and kind of verify that this isn't [7325] um this is what I [7328] wanted so it does look pretty good aside [7331] from the images I will say images are [7332] certainly the weakest part of this [7334] because let's be real none of those [7337] words make sense why do real words when [7340] fake words do gter [7342] repeatable scalability training SC [7345] scannon I mean these are cute as hell [7347] they really are I just wish there was [7349] some way to like turn the text mode off [7350] or something man be so much easier if it [7353] was just all stuff like this this is [7354] perfect this is all you want right like [7357] imagine if you had a Blog with just a [7358] bunch of this stuff oh [7361] fantastic but we [7363] don't uh it looks like we also have one [7366] generator at the end I could get that [7367] get rid of that I don't think I will [7369] that's fine look how happy he looks oh [7371] he's like holding a little happy [7373] guy all right so a clearly defined sales [7377] process plays a critical role in the [7378] success of any agency we're I'm just [7379] going to proof fre it myself um because [7381] I want to make sure that the content is [7383] actually okay if not I can pass this [7384] whole thing all 2450 words through [7387] another prompt clearly defined sales [7388] process Place critical and agency [7390] structure [7391] framework [7393] okay [7394] right right structured sales [7396] methodologies very cool yeah yeah sweet [7398] I'd give this like um 90th percentile [7400] content better than a lot of people that [7403] I've worked with you know I run a [7404] Content writing [7406] company of course you know to be frank [7409] the value of content is going down um [7411] just because the supply the demand for [7413] Content goes down concommittant with the [7414] supply going up so uh you know I'd keep [7417] that in mind right like you used to have [7419] to pay several hundred to get an article [7421] of about this length with you know [7422] reasonable quality copy like this that [7425] was not copy and pasted now you have ai [7427] do the quote unquote copy and pasting [7428] some people would disagree on whether or [7430] not it's plagiarism or not but yeah so [7432] listen I've read most of this this looks [7433] really really really good um actually [7435] better than I was expecting I didn't [7437] think the quality would be this good so [7438] that's that's really positive super [7440] positive actually um I want you guys to [7442] know that I've I've generated this as a [7443] Google doc but you can generate this in [7445] whatever means you want you don't have [7447] to do it as as a Google doc like I'm [7448] doing here um you could theoretically [7451] hook this up to Wordpress okay in [7454] WordPress you upload HTML and it is [7456] formatted just like this just without [7458] all the that I had to deal with [7459] um from you know this section over over [7461] here onwards so you could actually just [7464] get rid of all that and just feed the [7465] mark down directly into the WordPress [7466] module you'd be good um you know if you [7469] wanted to instead feed in what do we got [7472] we got a web flow site here right You' [7474] create an item inside of web flow now I [7476] don't know if the formatting is exactly [7478] the same but you would probably have to [7480] make some formatting adjustments [7482] markdown itself probably wouldn't work [7484] um art HTML may I don't know what let's [7487] just double check this really quickly [7488] before somebody gets me in trouble [7496] use the API [7498] to create a [7504] post yeah I'm not really sure about that [7506] but um you know I guess what I'm trying [7508] to say is there are a variety of cms's [7510] that do this sort of thing for you [7511] content Management Systems you could use [7513] one called like content full that's what [7514] I used for quite a while story Block [7517] it's pretty big um and there are a few [7520] more as well if you're hosting your [7521] website anywhere else a WordPress engine [7524] no I don't believe you could do that but [7525] strappy strappy was really big I used [7527] that for a while so whatever the [7529] formatting is of the thing that you are [7530] uploading your um blog post to you know [7533] obviously you'd have to cater to that [7534] with that last section but uh yeah that [7536] that looks to be the flow so what I'm [7538] going to do here is I'm just going to [7539] briefly outline the sections as I've [7542] mentioned and then I'm going to upload [7544] this you'll be able to find this file [7546] anywhere in maker School inside of [7548] classroom inside of resource Library so [7551] you'll have access to all of the [7554] blueprints that I am going to be doing [7556] on naden from here on out there um and [7559] all you need to do is sign up you can [7560] sign up for 5 minutes if you wanted to [7562] download all the blueprints and leave [7563] obviously I don't recommend it and I'd [7564] like you to stay for longer but just to [7566] be candid that's kind of how it's kind [7568] of how this [7569] works so this is going to be the [7571] formatting so I'm just going to say [7574] platform specific this will rely on your [7578] on the particulars of the platform you [7580] uploading to for [7582] demonstration purposes I've created a [7586] Google doc [7589] file but you could upload to [7593] Wordpress web flow a CMS like content [7596] full Etc that looks pretty [7600] good over [7607] here I will drag [7610] this saying using a form input [7616] here no I think I'll just discuss that [7618] I'm [7620] using HTTP [7623] requests and it then now has the um web [7627] search model built into their open AI [7630] nodes so you don't need to do [7635] this so you don't need to do an h a [7640] direct you don't want to I did though [7645] just for demonstration purposes and [7647] because I'm a but hey what are you [7649] going to [7651] do um let me see what else should I [7654] document here H oh yes this image model [7657] this image model [7666] here I've used doll [7670] E3 for the image production but note [7673] that there are some issues with this [7676] that in my humble opinion and you can [7680] certainly [7681] fix most of it with prompts but probably [7684] not all um not that there are some [7687] issues with this that in my humble [7688] opinion reduce the output quality of the [7693] article hot Swap this with another image [7696] generator perhaps something on foul [7704] file. a generative media platform for [7707] developers or an unoficial mid [7711] Journey [7715] API cool that's going to be that [7719] information then yeah I believe you guys [7721] now probably have everything you need in [7723] order to make this good right let me [7725] just make this a little bit bigger so [7727] everybody could see it um and I just [7729] want this to line up cuz I am kind of [7733] weird about that stuff so let me just [7735] make sure that we are [7737] perfect yes I think we are [7739] perfect cool awesome guys I had a lot of [7743] fun putting this puppy together I'm just [7744] going to save this right now and then [7746] I'm going to export or download this [7748] blueprint we'll call this [7750] deep oh yeah sorry [7753] obligatory [7755] Ching um had a lot of fun putting this [7758] puppy together I'm just going to save [7759] this file just that everybody here has [7761] it from here on out called Deep content [7763] generator and as I mentioned I'm going [7765] to be posting that on maker school [7766] hopefully you guys got to see the behind [7768] the scenes of what like a an nadn [7771] development process looks like keeping [7773] in mind too that there are many [7774] situations in which I stumbled right [7776] like I ran into a couple of variable [7778] errors where I didn't realize that I [7780] needed to name a specific item in a list [7782] as opposed to just the entire list I've [7784] been building stuff on no code platforms [7786] for the better part of the last eight [7788] years or so now like I'm very very [7791] familiar and very competent with these [7792] things but I still have to go look up [7794] the documentation day by day don't think [7796] that anybody um regardless of how cool [7799] and sleek and amazing they may make [7802] their YouTube videos out to be out to [7803] look from the outside perspective don't [7805] think that anybody doesn't do that [7806] because because we all do developing [7808] stuff these days is not really about [7810] knowing all of that information because [7812] the landscape just changes too quickly [7813] for you to really be able to sit down [7815] study everything and constantly have the [7817] right way to do it at the top of your [7818] head instead good developers on any [7821] platform form or using any programming [7822] language they're Adept at finding the [7825] information that they need and then [7826] employing it they're Adept at [7827] recognizing patterns in the way that [7829] things are built and then using those [7831] patterns in new and unfamiliar [7833] environments so thank you very much for [7835] watching all the way up until the end of [7837] this video as I mentioned if you have [7838] any questions to drop them down below if [7840] you guys want content if you want [7842] blueprints like this check out maker [7844] School otherwise I've given you [7846] everything you need in order to walk [7847] through it on your own you could [7848] screenshot this and drag and drop the [7850] nodes go to the specific parts of the [7852] videos and try and do it all or you know [7854] you can jump on the the monthly [7855] subscription download that and then also [7857] get a bunch of additional bonuses like [7858] coaching with me uh you know Q&A [7861] directly in the Forum I'm not going to [7864] Yap your year off your ear off but uh [7866] that's that if you could do me a big [7869] solid like subscribe do all that fun [7871] YouTube stuff I'll catch you on the next [7873] video thanks so much for the time [7874] bye-bye

Title: AI Agents Are Great, But...
[0] can we talk nadn AI agents for a sec [2] like are people taking this Tech selling [4] them to businesses producing a positive [6] return on investment for the businesses [8] and then making some profit on the side [10] or is it all just a bunch of hype so [12] from what I can tell it's all just a [14] bunch of hype I've sold several hundreds [16] of thousands of dollars of AI [17] automations over the course of just the [18] last few years and I'm not going to bury [20] the lead here from what I can tell the [22] current iteration of nen AI agents is [25] not at a point where you can [27] realistically and reliably produce a [30] return on investment for a business that [32] you couldn't do easier and better [34] through more conventional automation [36] means conventional here just means the [38] old left to right flow where you execute [41] some trigger and then a bunch of actions [42] occur immediately after now I'm not [44] saying this because I hate AI agents or [45] I think AI in general is a bad [47] technology I run my entire life using [49] artificial intelligence at this point it [51] makes me all of my money it's all I talk [53] about it's most of the content that I [54] consume what I dislike is I dislike some [56] of the claims that I'm seeing where this [59] n runs my entire life it completely [62] manages my business it does my laundry [64] it pleases my wife right anytime you [67] have some sort of technology or solution [70] that supposedly does everything and [72] cures everything you should be a little [74] bit skeptical about whether or not it [75] actually does what it's claimed to do [77] those sort of thing is actually really [78] common throughout history anytime a [80] great technology is predicted and [82] announced before it's actually fully [84] developed you tend to have a big hype [86] bubble where people overestimate the [88] ability or capability of the current [90] levels of Technology it's not the first [91] time it's happened certainly not going [93] to be the last time especially in our [94] industry but I think if we're being [96] honest with ourselves and if we wanted [97] to produce the largest possible return [99] on investment for the customer these [101] n8na agents just ain't it dog they are [104] not at the current level where you can [105] reliably provide them as a solution to [107] anybody and expect to make yourself a [110] lot of money and that's ultimately all I [111] care about okay so let me show you what [113] I mean I have very simple nadn AI agent [115] open here and what this is doing is it's [117] getting a chat message after I get the [119] chat message I am then communicating [121] with the AI agent through an open AI [123] chat model GPT 40 mini we're then [125] storing the message history in the [127] window buffer memory then on the right [129] hand side here connect to this little [130] tools Diamond I got a bunch of tools I [132] could create an event in Google Calendar [133] send a Gmail send an HTTP request to [136] some weather API if I wanted to I could [138] calculate stuff search up stuff on [139] Wikipedia and then I could also access [141] some Vector store that I put together in [143] this case that just reference is the [144] Bitcoin white paper Okay so we're seeing [147] a lot of people say stuff like this end [148] and agent runs my entire life the reason [150] why I post I'm doing this right now and [152] showing you guys what this looks like is [154] just because like like why do people [156] like this stuff cuz it looks really cool [157] it has that wow factor when you you know [160] put put a message in you're like hey [162] how's it going you know it responds to [164] you I guess sort of like a human would [165] when you ask it to do something for you [168] please book me a calendar event for [170] tomorrow called Nick's birthday 2 p.m. [174] when you ask it to do this stuff all [176] right it actually goes down the road it [178] creates the calendar event for you and [179] then it like feeds a response back right [182] like that stuff's pretty impressive from [183] the from the bird's eye perspective so I [185] guess what I'm trying to say is this can [186] do stuff right we're at the current [187] level of Technology we can actually go [189] and it can do stuff but the fact that it [191] can do stuff for you doesn't necessarily [193] mean that this can do stuff for [195] businesses to produce a positive [196] outsized Roi all we're really seeing at [199] this point is we're kind of seeing like [200] a personal assistant and it's a nice [202] personal assistant but you got to keep [203] in mind that this isn't 100% reliable AI [205] agents basically everybody here knows [207] that is screwed around with these things [209] they have a failure rate anywhere [210] between maybe 1 to 5% per query um you [212] know the better the model is the less [214] likely the failure but keep in mind that [216] since you're communicating with this [217] flexible model it's not always going to [218] get your category right so sometimes [220] you'll say hey can you book me a [221] calendar event and then maybe it'll do [222] some HTTP request the weather API with [224] some field called calendar right it'll [226] hallucinate it'll invent some stuff for [228] you so as somebody that sold several [231] hundreds of thousands of dollars of [232] these AI automations to businesses the [234] number one thing that businesses tend to [236] care about is they tend to care about [238] ease of use and then they also tend to [239] care about reliability a business has a [241] very small window of available things [243] that it does repeatedly in order to [246] generate a return on investment for [247] itself the more flexibility and [249] Randomness and and variability and [251] unreliability that you throw in the less [253] valuable a solution like this will [254] really look uh to a to a serious [256] business owner that you know wants to [258] produce some sort of uh outstanding Roi [260] okay now contrast that with this flow [262] this is an older School more traditional [264] looking automation where we have three [266] simple nodes a web hook that catches the [268] request as it comes comes in then we are [271] still using AI in the middle and we're [273] also creating a calendar event over here [275] on the right and I want you guys to see [277] that this is the same sort of flow that [278] people have been building for the better [279] part of the last 20 years so there's [280] nothing really new here but because [282] we're using web Hooks and because we're [284] using precisely formatted procedural [286] events basically the reliability of a [288] system like this is you know hundreds of [289] times higher than that of a flexible AI [291] system and I want you guys to see that [293] we're still using AI in the system okay [295] we still have an open AI model or node [298] this node is pretty cool right it's [300] actually doing something um as I'll show [301] you guys in a second so typically the [303] way that stuff like this works is I'm [304] just going to test this we have some web [306] hook URL that we'll paste in and you can [308] add a parameter I'm going to say March [309] 13 2025 at 1 p.m. so instead of [313] communicating with it in uh you know [315] through some chat interface or whatever [316] you might have an automation that takes [318] the date of some trigger maybe it's I [320] don't know your client books and [323] onboarding call with you or something [324] then you just grab the date and you can [325] literally write it in plain text like [327] natural language like I'm doing right [328] here March 13th 2025 at1 PM okay when [331] you put paste that in and I'm doing this [332] through a get request which is why I'm [333] getting that black screen but that [334] doesn't really matter all too [336] much when you paste that in you end up [339] getting that event inside of naden with [340] the date we're going to feed that into [343] AI we're going to test that step that's [345] going to convert it into our nice [347] iso8601 format that's just a standard [349] that a lot of calendar systems use and [351] then finally we will test this too and [353] we've now booked an event so why am i [355] showing you these two systems um despite [357] how much more boring this one looks uh [359] businesses prefer this sort of stuff [361] businesses prefer this sort of stuff [362] because it works you know it's like Old [363] Faithful it's the same reason that uh I [366] don't know when like a new car model is [368] made in the first year or something a [370] lot of people that know cars typically [372] don't like buy that model of vehicle why [374] because they don't want to drive [376] something that has a much higher [377] probability of breaking down or whatever [379] so businesses prefer like kind of the [381] Old Faithful approach the vast majority [382] of the time and in addition the benefit [384] to a system like this is a system like [387] this is substantially easier for a [389] developer to set up it's also [391] substantially more extensible and it's [393] also substantially more maintainable [395] okay this is basically a Lego block that [397] you know works [400] 99.999999999% of the time it's like a [403] pipe basically in some big offshore [406] drilling rig pipeline thing you can tell [408] I don't know my oil terminology but uh [410] hopefully you guys get my point okay [411] it's a part that you could swap out for [413] something else the um AI agent sort of [417] thing is it's not a defined part you [419] know it's a squishy malleable thing and [422] while that has a lot more potential over [423] the course of the next few years than [424] something like a rigid uh inflexible [427] part you know right now it's just not [428] really at the point where it can [429] actually hold up the structure for us it [430] can't really do anything of value so you [433] can imagine hundreds if not thousands of [435] different ways you could set up the same [436] logic that I did there with that little [437] get request with with the web hook with [439] the open AI node in the Middle with the [441] calendar booking but if you set them up [443] they'll be 100 if not a thousand times [445] more reliable they'll be substantially [447] easier to interchange with other [448] elements and stuff stuff like that and [450] then the best part is you could always [452] weave that flow into a future AI agent [454] that actually has the capability to do [455] this sort of thing more reliably in the [457] first place now that you've seen what [459] sort of the new school versus the old [460] school way of doing things is and you [462] know you sort of compared a little bit [464] between the two I want you to ask [466] yourself what intrinsic value does the [468] first have that the second doesn't [470] basically if we just be super realistic [472] here the only real difference is the [474] first had a little chat window so you [476] got the perception that you were [477] chatting with some sort of assistant or [479] some agent right so that's sort of the [481] benefit and and you know it is a benefit [483] it is cool to some people uh you know [485] some people work they do everything out [487] of their phones for instance they don't [488] want to have you know a form here and [490] then some CRM there and some other [491] system over there although you know if [493] we're Frank if you're going to use an [494] nna agent to update a CRM I guess the [496] unspoken assumption is that you are [498] going to be using that CRM at some time [499] but I digress um you know like that is [502] that is a benefit the fact that you have [503] this one super cool simple screen you [505] can host it on a website embed it on on [507] your phone or whatever and that's fine [508] for Less technical business owners but [511] uh what is that coming at the cost of [514] that's coming at the cost of reliability [516] where the AI agent will sort of muck up [518] your request maybe 1 to 5% of the time [520] so you know one in 20 requests that you [522] make just aren't going to work you might [524] be under the assumption that they're [526] going to work but they aren't how much [528] money does it cost you when 5% of the [531] time or one out of every 20 times or [533] whatever the actual number is for crappy [535] prompts it's going to be much higher for [536] really good prompts it might be a little [537] bit lower how much how much is that [539] going to cost a business that relies on [541] this a agent to do everything well it's [543] going to cost it about 5% right like if [545] you're using this to update a CRM if [547] you're using this to send emails to [549] people critical emails if you're doing [551] this to I don't know add things to some [553] sort of project board or tracker if [555] you're doing this to automate some sort [557] of cool task that maybe has to do with [559] creating content you're essentially [560] capable of doing 5% less there's also [563] some potential issue where because you [565] assume that some asset had been created [567] or delivered um that might cause some [568] runaway effect can actually impact your [570] business more than that 5% but I'm just [571] going to C it at 5% for now and that [573] takes me to really this equation I'm [575] going to put together the benefit to [577] these AI agents is basically you get a [579] chat box you get that little like cool [581] factor which is nice as a business owner [583] the cost though is you have I'm going to [586] say around 5% [589] unreliability so basically what you're [591] doing is you're giving up I don't know [592] man maybe about 5% of your freaking [594] business for a little chat box that's [595] cool any serious business owner isn't [597] really going to give a crap about that [598] they're going to want hold on to the 5% [600] which might be you know $50,000 $500,000 [603] a year uh whatever but like most things [605] in life there's more there's another [606] hidden cost that a lot of people don't [608] talk about and that's that the prompt [610] engineering of a lot of these built-in [611] NAD AI agents um that's not you spell [614] engineering The Prompt engineering is [616] usually trash okay and it's trash um you [620] know some of the it being trash is [621] actually outside of your control so you [622] can't fix it and that leads to some [624] really funny situations where you'll [625] send somebody an email using your naden [627] AI agent assistant that you think is [629] super smart or whatever and it'll just [630] be a trash email there'll be tons of [632] emojis in there there'll be weird [634] confettis things will be formatted [636] really oddly the tone of voice of the [638] model is going to be weird like as a [639] business owner you've lost a substantial [641] amount of control over how you're [643] perceived and a lot of the time this is [645] in contact or communication with [646] customers and it's like if you screw up [648] the contact or communication with the [649] customer you make them feel weird or [651] something even even a little bit that [653] can have massive Downstream effects on [655] your ability to close a deal especially [656] for one of these SBS not even talking [658] about what happens at ENT priz [659] businesses where that sort of perception [661] might might be even more important so [662] speaking of funny situations I just had [664] it send an email to me Nicholas at [667] gmail.com supposedly wishing me happy [669] birthday okay and it's responded with [671] I've sent the birthday the birthday [672] wishes to Nick and Nicholas arrive [674] gmail.com if I click on my Gmail and I [676] open this hey Nick happy birthday I hope [679] your day is filled with laughter Good [681] Vibes perhaps a little bit of cake [682] smiley face remember age is just a [683] number and you're still young at heart [684] enjoy your special day and celebrate [686] however you like cheers to another year [687] of Adventures ahead best your name right [690] it actually went ahead and sent the [691] thing without even signing my name in it [694] so these sorts of minor issues like they [696] happen to me and if you think about it [698] I'm a very technical person so are most [699] people that are watching this video [701] right you guys are a automation [702] Specialists a Engineers you run some [704] sort of digital business most likely [705] overwhelmingly I know a portion of you [707] don't that's totally okay but I guess [709] the point that I'm making like if if we [710] have problems like that with this sort [712] of Technology what is the average SMB [714] business owner going to have um [715] struggles with probably a 100 times what [717] we're having a problem with and then [719] what is like an Enterprise business [721] owner going to have struggles with maybe [722] a person that doesn't have the time [724] maybe the director of a business that's [726] you know super rigorously scheduling [728] every moment of their calendar you know [729] can you really afford a calendar screw [731] up every week no obviously not I got one [734] more drawback that I just want to make [735] you guys aware of and this isn't a [737] drawback that I think is permanent [738] you'll definitely be able to change this [739] with time but I got my a agent over here [742] right one thing that typically tends to [744] happen uh with chat Bots that I've sold [745] in the past is at some point the AI [748] because it's flexible and it can a [749] variety and and range of responses it'll [751] produce something that the person the [752] business owner or the director or [754] whoever's using my my tool doesn't [756] really like and so when it produces [758] something that they don't really like [759] usually they'll send some requests and [761] saying something along lens of hey I [762] don't really like how it talked about [763] this or seem kind of weird when it [764] talked about that would you mind making [766] some changes to it yeah just tweak the [767] model a little bit right that tends to [769] be most people's understanding so you [772] can't actually tweak the model a little [773] bit what is you tweaking the model it's [774] you doing a little bit of prompt [775] engineering you can certainly reduce the [777] likelihood that that's going to happen [778] but you can never eliminate it [780] completely and so because of that these [783] models and these AI agent Solutions [785] they're actually very difficult to [786] maintain they're actually very difficult [788] to upgrade basically you have no control [790] over the upgrade of the system because [792] the vast majority of the technology [793] that's driving this isn't actually yours [795] right it's this open AI chat models [798] right it's the AI that uh you know open [801] AI has been cooking up for the better [802] part of the last few years training for [803] the last 6 months on millions of gpus or [805] whatever you have very little control [808] over actually being able to up upgrade [809] the intelligence the model you can make [811] a couple of promptu engineering hacks [812] and techniques but that's just you [814] crossing your fingers and hoping that [815] it'll do what you say like maybe a [817] bratty teenager or something hopefully [819] you didn't hurt any feelings here just [821] want to make it abundantly clear that I [822] do think this technolog is really cool I [824] do think that there's a ton of potential [825] in it I just don't think that n8n AI [827] agents as they are right now are at the [829] level where you can realistically charge [832] large multiples on the time that you are [834] saving the business owner AKA a little [836] chat window and I don't really think [838] that these things have any intrinsic [839] value that a procedural or linear or [842] more old school left to right workflow [843] has I actually think that this is more [845] detrimental to AB business than anything [846] else so I believe in this so strongly [849] that um I put out a template a couple of [850] weeks ago using an AI agent I've just [852] refunded um everybody that's purchased [854] that template I've just decided to put [855] it up for free so if you bought my [857] upwork AI agent at some point in the [859] better part of the last two weeks and [860] you haven't received a refund at some [862] point in the next 3 to five days let me [863] know we than happy to cue that up for [864] you but I just want to make it [866] abundantly clear that this technology is [867] great it's very dead moble looks really [870] nice when you're zoomed out you know [872] looking at things through a spy glass [874] but business owners don't look at the [876] Technologies you build for them in that [878] way they tend to go up close with a [880] magnifying glass and scrutinize the hell [881] out of it so just want to avoid you know [883] some trouble save you guys some some [885] pain I guess in the future really [886] appreciate your time had a blast making [887] that video if you guys have any [889] questions on any of this let me know [890] down below if you guys disagree with me [892] on something foundational or fundamental [894] here I'd love to hear about it I'm not [895] afraid to have a conversation or [897] discussion with you guys in the comments [898] or even make another video about this [900] more longer form maybe addressing them [901] one by one happy to do whatever it takes [904] to just help slow this hype bubble down [906] a little bit otherwise if you could give [907] me a big solid like subscribe get me up [910] to the top of that YouTube algo and I'll [912] catch you on the next video thanks so [913] much

Title: AI Agency Owner Rates Every AI Automation He’s Ever Made
[0] hey I'm an AI agency owner who h 72k a [2] month and today I'm going to rate every [3] AI automation I've ever made I've done [6] this primarily in make.com and nen some [8] of these systems are going to be for my [9] clients other ones are going to be ones [10] that I built for myself and my own [12] company either way there's going to be [13] tons of value in it let's get started [14] this is an email categorization system [16] I'd rate this a tier this hasn't [18] directly made me more than maybe a few [19] thousand do in opportunity cost but it [21] substantially streamlines the hell out [23] of my life uh for make a long story [25] short I have a very active email inbox [28] these days especially as I've started [29] scaling the YouTube channel and the [30] agency and I've created a bunch of [32] categories but the funniest one is [34] people selling me stuff what I do is [36] every time a new email comes into Gmail [38] okay what I have the ability to is I can [40] forward it over to a web hook somewhere [42] and what I've chosen to do is I forward [44] it over to this make.com web hook right [46] over here that then catches the email [49] okay I will then do some fancy [51] formatting stuff and then ultimately I [53] will uh feed that email body into [56] artificial intelligence and then I'll [57] just have it categorize it for me and [58] attach a label to it autonomously now [61] this isn't what I'd consider an AI agent [63] but it is certainly A system that lives [65] within my my mailbox and probably is a [67] little bit more effective than an a [69] agent I don't need to ask it to do [70] anything it just automatically does it [71] all for me your task is to categorize [74] incoming emails on the following labels [75] sponsorship requests people selling me [77] stuff invoices and receipts worthwhile [79] return your answer in Jason as follows [82] rules I'm a well-known AI consultant I [84] have dozens of people reaching out to me [85] every day I'm looking to label and [86] categorize emails to make my life easier [88] and to avoid having to rif through [89] sponsorship request sales people on a [90] daily basis if you notice I'm talking to [92] this just like I talk to a staff member [93] or a person so if somebody's reaching [95] out to me about a sponsorship or [96] affiliate partnership categorize it as [98] sponsorship request get it the hell out [99] of my inbox if somebody's reaching out [101] to me to try and sell me categorize it [103] as people selling me stuff if it's a [105] receipt for something categorize it as [106] invoices and receipts this makes [108] accounting really easy because all I do [110] is I go to the invoices and receipts [111] label grab all of the attachments and [114] then dump them uh in a Google Drive that [115] my accountant has access to then [117] ultimately if the email doesn't fit into [119] the above three categories categorizes [120] as worthwhile these are ones I will [122] actually look at so nothing really you [124] know rocket science here okay nothing [127] super crazy but you know I go through [128] and I train it a bunch and then if the [130] email is not worthwhile I will then move [133] it to the label mark it as red and then [135] as I mentioned get it the hell out of my [137] inbox if it's worthwhile I stop right [139] here with that filter uh and then you [141] know I I don't proceed anymore this [142] system is an AI content generator that [144] uses uh my YouTube comments in order to [147] generate me large lists of possible [149] videos I'd consider this a tier this has [151] made me directly tens of thousands of [153] dollars just in the last few months [154] because it's enabled me to really just [156] keep my finger on the pulse of what my [158] YouTube audience and my community wants [160] to make a long story short basically [161] what we're doing is we're using a [162] thirdparty service called appify if [164] you're unfamiliar with how appify works [166] it's basically a Marketplace of scrapers [168] okay what we can do is we can scrape [170] anything we want including YouTube [172] comments so what I do is I go and I [175] scrape my own YouTube comments I will [178] scrape my own YouTube comments feed [180] those YouTube comments into artificial [182] intelligence with a simple prompt [184] basically saying hey is this something [187] that might be classified as a question [189] or a suggestion is it interesting if so [192] I'm looking for Content ideas so I want [194] you to basically return a list of titles [198] of what those content ideas could be [201] okay that's more or less what this [202] section is saying over here then I have [204] a bunch of examples okay here's the [206] video title here's the comment I quote [208] unquote received on this video title [210] and then here is what I wanted to [212] respond with how I made [214] $2,514 last month of automation my path [216] $2,514 copy me from bankrupt to $100,000 [219] a month right these are all titles so [221] basically what I do is I I will go and [223] I'll have it get me a bunch of ideas [225] like this you can use a better app if I [227] actor um I have a problem maybe you can [229] help me uh it's all about click up right [231] and then I'll feed it into Ai and I'll [232] have ai generate me ideas for that so [235] hey here's how to build a high ticket [236] project management system here's how to [238] create a internal follow-up system [239] here's to streamline departmental [240] follow-ups then after that okay I'll [243] iterate through them I'll do you know a [245] bunch of fancy um variable setting stuff [247] that I don't really need to do and then [249] finally what I'll actually do is I'll [250] generate an outline for the content [252] ideas that I just scraped from my own [254] YouTube so here's one hey I'm Nick surve [257] I skilled a Content writing agency to [258] 92k a month and an automation agency to [260] 72k a month what's the key to this [262] success automating simple processes like [263] departmental follow-ups so today I'm [265] going to show you how to use chat gbt to [266] streamline follow-ups across various [268] departments for maximum efficiency if [270] efficient communication is your goal [271] this is a must watch now am I going to [272] win any awards for this stuff no I'm not [275] it's not the the greatest hook of all [277] time but does this help eliminate I want [280] to say 90% of the work for me yeah [282] because now I have something on the page [283] now all I have to do as a human is I [285] just have to make some minor edits I [286] have to QA I have to add my own case [287] studies in here I have to correct [288] anything that might be a little bit [289] wrong and so on and so forth so this I [292] would consider a tier super powerful [294] automation the end result is I get this [295] huge ass list as you can see here and I [299] think like you a good thousand of these [300] were all ones that I just scraped on [303] yeah literally like December the look at [304] look at how many I scraped on December [305] the freaking 12th gigantic Insanity [308] right crazy and these are all ideas so [311] here's the comment which AI deep [312] voiceover are you using in your videos [314] so the content idea is hey why don't you [316] review a bunch of AI voiceover tools you [317] know and then I have hooks and so on and [319] so on and so forth then here's my own [320] little project management system where I [322] just Market is reviewed you want to hear [323] a really sneaky thing you don't just [325] have to do this for your own videos you [326] could totally do this for other people's [328] videos this next system is a massive [330] content production and onboarding flow [333] I'd rate it as s tier directly made my [335] content writing company over a million [336] dollars um just in streamlining the [339] onboarding and production of templated [341] assets for my content agency so when I [344] think [345] like uh when I think like high leverage [348] fulfillment based systems this is what I [349] think of it was designed by uh mostly by [352] my business partner at the time and I [354] came in and made a couple of Minor [356] Adjustments adjustments but this is [357] basically what I take the vast majority [358] of inspiration from from onboarding and [360] fulfillment from so let me run you [362] through it um to make a long story short [364] we we're we're always watching clickup [366] for stuff so the way that we set up our [368] clickup is we basically have a big [370] project management space okay that's [372] separated into two lists one called q [374] and then one called content pipeline so [376] Q looks like this and the value of Q is [378] Q is just a way for us to add articles [382] and content into our system and then [384] template the hell out of them using AI [387] using Google Docs using Google Drive [389] keeping everything super organized [391] automatically initiating things like [392] time tracking I mean this is this has [394] got to be like the nicest and easiest [396] way to do things so if you guys are [397] running some sort of high volume High [398] throughput business with a lot of line [400] items coming in every day this this is [401] how I do it okay so uh what do we do to [404] start well basically um in Click up you [405] can create a template so I'm going to [407] create a template for an example company [408] okay when you do so um this is just a [411] click it feature what you basically do [413] is you can pull a bunch of data from [416] this uh template that you've stored [418] basically okay so as we see over here [420] brief and guideline doc style guide [422] writing guidelines writer's checklist so [424] there's a style guide for this client [425] there's writing guidelines for this [426] client there's a writer's checklist for [427] this client you know there's some tasks [430] that they need to do there's some [431] context there's some AI detector score [433] because a lot of people don't like the [434] AI detector scores here's a bunch of [436] information about the specific client [438] right here's some example content here's [441] the contact name my case it's me because [443] it's an example here's like a write up [445] of what the business does okay so a lot [447] of stuff here um what happens basically [449] is what we do is we we give this a due [451] date so maybe tomorrow and Target word [453] count so 1,000 words okay and we assign [456] it to I don't know I'm just going to [457] sign it to myself here and then um you [460] know what I'm going to do is I'm going [461] to change the status and then I'll just [462] set this to oh I should also note that [464] there are a bunch of subtasks here I'm [466] going to change the status to ready okay [469] and what happens when we Mark something [470] as [471] ready basically the second that we do we [475] get a web Hook from the service called [477] hook deck which is just like a normal [478] web hook then what we'll do is we'll get [480] the task so we do this in clickup just [482] to get a bunch of data then we will [484] update the status of the clickup record [486] the one that we just created momentarily [489] to say creating project folder just so [492] that if anybody on the team sees this [493] and mucks around with it they don't know [495] what it's for it'll say creating project [496] folder this is sort of like user [498] experience for project management it's [499] pretty neat we then log an execution in [501] the comments so we'll say stuff like hey [503] here's the task execution link and this [504] is just for debugging purposes sometimes [506] things go wrong you can actually just [507] click on this button and actually get [508] taken directly to the specific execution [510] of that task pretty neat we then go and [513] we find a projects folder for example [515] client okay the value in doing this is [518] we have this big system where we create [520] Google Drive folders for new um um [522] projects that come in right what we do [524] is we we organize them all under this [526] big projects folder which is pretty neat [528] then we create a project or a task [530] folder a new one with the specific [532] article name we update the status again [534] to say creating Google doc search for [535] template and then what we do if we have [538] a template is we'll create it Google doc [540] brief based off of data about that [543] company now because mine's just example [545] company it just says example company [546] right now but you can imagine there'd be [547] some sort of like templated introduction [550] I don't know templated uh write up [553] templated CTA uh I don't know and then [556] you know as you can see it's formatted [557] really nicely here so it's just like [559] inter formatting the article looks [560] really pretty usually clients have [562] different preferences where how they [563] want their projects delivered so that we [565] sort of pay attention on that and then [566] make the the article look really sexy [567] for them we then share the file add a [569] project folder link to the clickup which [572] is no longer in Q right it's since moved [574] on to my big content PIP plan it's [575] pretty neat we will then do tons of [578] other clickup related stuff we'll add [580] some assignes We'll add subtasks we'll [582] go into a a Time tracking platform [584] called Harvest if you guys are familiar [585] with Harvest if you guys aren't familiar [586] with Harvest just a quick and easy way [588] for all of your team members to track [590] time will then create an and integrate [592] Harvest with the specific projects so [594] that any team member that wants to track [596] time just has to click a button to do so [598] we automatic calculate the budget based [600] off the revenue we get the the internal [602] costs the the number of hours spent per [604] piece all very nice and organized we add [607] it to a [608] dashboard and then you know we update a [610] client record because we also have a [612] client record to show hey you know [614] there's currently an article in progress [616] for that client we'll update the word [618] counts we'll extrapolate our Revenue I [620] mean this is this is a very very [622] impressive sort of system which is nice [624] and then what do we end up with we end [626] up with an article over here okay in [627] this status called a waiting assignment [631] um it's the same article that we had [632] before but you'll notice that now [633] there's a bunch of other things here [634] okay there's a project folder which is [636] linked and you can actually go and you [638] can click on it right it's just right [639] over here basically anybody assigned to [641] this task now has the ability just to [643] jump in and then start working on the [644] Google Drive everything's templated [646] there's a way to track time right over [648] here this is me tracking time this time [650] will automatically be added to um that [652] staff member's Harvest account and then [654] all this is like two way integrated [656] which is cool we have Target word counts [658] uh which is how much you know how many [659] words we want the person to write when [661] they're done with this um looking over [664] the task they can move it to assign and [666] that says hey I'm now the assign on the [667] task when they start writing they move [669] it to writing when it's moved to the [670] editor the editor starts editing when [672] it's ready for submission it's moved to [674] ready for submission then finally it's [675] move to submit it our client review [676] depending on whether or not like we're [677] submitting this manually or the client [678] needs to take a look at it so you know [680] we we we have a lot of there's a lot of [682] value in a system like this I guess is [684] what I'm trying to say um you know [685] without going into every individual node [687] here hopefully you guys can at least see [688] the pattern the pattern is that we get [690] some event in one [692] workspace then we use the data added to [696] that event in that workspace to template [698] out a bunch of other stuff then we take [699] advantage of like hierarchical [701] organization and some good project [703] management fundamentals to do things [705] like automatically create assets [706] automatically create emails and stuff [708] like that for the the the client to let [710] them know that things are underway and [712] and and and they're being worked on you [714] know you could automatically invite [715] people to kick off calls and stuff I [716] mean this is a very simplified version [718] of what that looks like in addition we [720] also have a bunch of other automations [722] that just um track things as they move [723] from one task to the other so like you [727] know as uh the rough draft stage gets [729] changed to final draft or I don't know [732] as as as various things occur inside of [735] that clickup workspace you know we have [737] various Watchers that just do these [738] one-off things um you know like if a due [741] date arrives and the status is not yet [743] completed for instance what we do is we [745] take that data we log it to a dashboard [746] sheet the dashboard sheet allows us to [748] visualize how many overdues there have [750] been in the last month and then show [751] that to writers and managers and stuff [753] like that um so yeah this is more or [754] less like project management assistant [757] assisting uh automations and I'd rate [759] this as zester just because it has a [760] direct impact on my revenue and [761] basically every other thing that I've [762] done since this is a deep [764] personalization system that uses Apollo [766] appify and then feeds things into a [769] platform called lead magic in order to [771] allow you to personalize the hell out of [772] any outbound campaign I consider this [774] system a tier easily a lot of people in [777] my community made money um either [778] copying pasting this into their own [780] businesses or using it uh you know [783] attempting to sell it or template it or [784] whatever so you can see this is built in [785] nadn notm make.com hence why the [787] background looks a little bit different [788] but let me run you through it um [790] essentially what we have is I get this [791] big Google sheet okay this is a big [793] Google sheet with a bunch of information [795] about people so we scrape a bunch of [797] people again using appify and now we [799] have a list of first names headlines [801] user skills company names company size [803] so on and so on and so forth the [805] deliverable here the output of my flow [809] is a bunch of these columns that [812] essentially are just different sections [814] of an email okay so what we do is we'll [817] go over here and I have these web hooks [819] which basically get [822] appify [824] data after that I have a little testing [826] block this is just what I use to limit [828] results during testing and as you can [830] see this is purple here if you're [831] unfamiliar with that that just means [832] that I've up pinned the results because [833] this is a copy that I've I've copied [835] this over from another workflow because [836] I don't want to muck about on live data [838] and leak email address and stuff I'll [840] then um feed into this Loop over items [842] node and the way that the loop over [843] items node is basically it goes one at a [846] time or however many the batch sizes I [847] said it as one at a time so it takes [849] these 128 items basically just converts [851] them to one item uh and that just allows [853] me to manage this really easily not run [855] into rate limit issues after that what I [857] do is I have an if the if is really [859] simple basically I just check to see [861] whether or not there's an email address [862] associated with the record because not [863] all of the emails are populated using [865] the scraping source that I'm uh I'm [867] utilizing I'll then use platform called [869] lead magic to request a LinkedIn profile [871] I'm not going to click on this just cuz [872] I think there's an API key in there and [874] then really the meet and Bones list is [875] my five column personalization so let me [878] run you through what the prompt looks [879] like um basically what I do is I feed in [881] a bunch of LinkedIn bio information here [884] so the bio field the summary field the [886] the the the workplace the location I [888] don't know their picture I take a [889] picture of their dog and talk about it [891] okay and then I say your task Mr AI is [894] to personalize an email you'll do this [895] by taking as input a prospect LinkedIn [897] profile then editing five templates for [899] different sections of the email subject [901] line Icebreaker elevator pitch call to [903] action and a PS field then here's the [907] secret sauce I actually give it some [909] templates okay if you are trying to have [912] ai personalized stuff for you AI usually [915] really screws up you know why it's [917] because like the the range of possible [919] responses with AI is just way too long [921] like if this is all responses just just [924] being candid here and this is like hey [928] and this is um I'll kill you okay AI can [933] generate something at any level of [936] sentiment between these two if you just [938] ask it to write you an email like like [939] there's there's such a wide range of [941] possible responses so what you have to [943] do is basically you need to use [944] templates like this where you say hey [946] name think I have something for you re [948] thing about them I know you've been [949] doing thing and I've been following [951] related thing hey I think I can add 5K [953] month to your paraphrased business okay [955] what you have to do is you have to use [956] this sort of approach to take this super [958] wide range of of of BS to be honest and [961] then constrain it into a hyper optimized [966] little [967] range where AI can basically only [970] operate in the parameters that you want [971] it to okay so I'm saying paraphrase [974] business I'm saying industry I'm saying [976] related thing right these aren't just [977] one word I'm not just copying and [979] pasting these from some LinkedIn profile [981] what I'm doing is I'm having AI like [982] intelligently turn this into some sort [983] of paraphrase and uh the value there is [986] just it's it's very difficult to [987] conceptualize it's crazy you you get all [989] of the benefits of like templating and [991] being a really good copywriter as I am [993] um and then you get to sprinkle on a [996] bunch of customization into it so you [998] know like this guy here cool look he [1000] wrote something about um sales boosting [1002] in in one of his LinkedIn articles right [1004] so we have this right here and then it [1005] says hey think I have something for you [1007] re sales boost so cool like this guy you [1009] know he's reading this and he's like [1011] wait a second I wrote a I wrote an [1013] article about that wow so this guy [1014] probably read read my stuff hm let me [1016] click on the email and actually go next [1017] St hey and you're lead sales over body [1019] code I've been seen a lot happening in [1020] the mechanical engineering space so I [1021] figured we could chat right you're [1024] you're still thinking this is a real [1025] human being that wrote this so your [1027] defenses are down you're like oh okay [1028] this person obviously respects my work [1029] maybe I can actually chat with them the [1030] TDR I think I can add 5K month your [1032] sales process at body cod with a few [1033] automated [1035] systems I just did this for a very [1038] similar engineering firm and we hit [1039] 28350 bucks in a few months they [1041] specialize in industrial Solutions which [1043] might be similar to what this company [1044] does so I'm very confident I can [1045] duplicate this be 100% risk- free I [1047] guarantee at least 20 appointments book [1048] or you wouldn't pay and PS even if we [1051] just chat I'd love to hear about what [1052] you're doing with sales at body cat so [1054] now it's like okay you know he's in some [1056] sort of sales role AI has has summarized [1059] that as sales um the likelihood is that [1063] you know uh Kulik at this point still [1065] thinks that this is human written or if [1066] he thinks that you know we use some sort [1068] of template to do this he still thinks [1069] that like there's a human behind the [1070] template what's the end result well the [1071] end result is this deep personalization [1073] yield substantially better reply rates [1074] than basically anything else that people [1075] are doing right now and uh yeah you can [1078] you can can get it I mean it's a hell of [1079] a system this is a custom system that [1081] allows me to get weight listy email [1083] addresses I'd rate it C tier it's not [1085] super important but I thought I'd throw [1086] it in just because I wanted to show [1088] maybe the the less technically capable [1090] people here just how much value you can [1092] drive with very simple HTTP requests so [1095] essentially context I run a community [1096] called makemoney with make.com where I [1098] do things like I host copywriting [1100] workshops to teach my members how to do [1102] copywriting I do uh you know weekly [1104] office hours where I take coaching calls [1105] and and run people through you know [1107] various problems that they're suffering [1108] from but I C it at 400 don't be fooled [1111] by the 407 I just have a few staff [1113] members that I'm now working with that [1114] are doing things like you know creating [1116] recurring events and and trying to [1117] summarize needs for the community and [1119] stuff like that but let's say that you [1120] know the community is captive 400 so [1122] knowing that all right what is the hell [1125] is this right over here well this is um [1127] a massive list of weight list requests [1130] basically there's a massive number of [1133] people that want to get in the community [1134] they can't because I've weight listed it [1136] all right so what do I have them do I [1137] have them fill out and application the [1139] issue is this platform that I'm using [1141] school just doesn't have a way for me to [1143] get those email addresses and that's [1145] where my little oneline automation came [1147] in that I built in just a few minutes [1149] that has solved this for me completely [1150] it allows me to get their email [1151] addresses and then it also allows me to [1153] add them to an email list um run some [1155] custom Logic on you know inviting them [1157] to my community when the weit list [1158] numbers uh you know sort themselves out [1161] and so on and so forth so I'm how does [1163] this work well all I do is I just get [1164] total pages so I call a make. or a [1167] school.com endpoint with the page number [1170] I give it my [1171] cookie and then I get a bunch of HTML I [1175] parse those pages I scrape the specific [1178] page here and then I parse all of the [1181] email addresses on that list then I [1184] search existing records basically to [1187] determine whether or not this person is [1188] already in my weight list uh database [1191] then if they're new I just add them over [1193] to the sheet cool right this is a simple [1197] 5 minute automation that I built that I [1199] I can do because I know HTTP requests I [1201] also know a little bit of introductory [1203] regular Expressions um that basically [1205] allows me to piece all these things [1206] together very quickly and solve a need [1207] that like my platform might not have [1209] built on this is a fan page daily [1211] analytic tracker basically what this [1213] allows me to do is this allows me to get [1215] real-time data once per day of all of my [1218] YouTube and Instagram channels I've also [1220] built this for other people as well [1222] slightly different format but I would [1224] rate this as B tier this doesn't [1226] directly make me money but it is very [1228] useful and something that you just can't [1229] get unless you you build a system out [1231] like this so uh what exactly does this [1234] mean well if you go to youtube.com and [1237] then I just type in Nix arve reels here [1239] as you see I have this big long uh list [1242] of of reals okay these are reals that we [1244] just started publishing just a couple of [1245] weeks ago and so you know these all have [1247] 400 and 300 and 500 and 500 and 400 and [1250] 400 and 433 views but what if I just [1253] wanted to get a feel for how this and my [1256] other 10 channels were working you know [1258] like how they were growing and so on and [1260] so forth well that's where this flow [1261] comes in basically what I do is I have a [1263] big Google sheet here I add all the [1265] channels to the YouTube account tracking [1267] then I add my Instagram accounts to my [1269] Instagram account tracking then once per [1271] day it goes and it scrapes um and I'm [1273] just filtering this for after brunch the [1275] 5th I guess I didn't want this to be [1276] super busy once a day I scrape this and [1278] then I dump in the total number of views [1280] across all of my reals channels here in [1283] terms of the logic I will um search my [1286] Google sheet in order to get all of the [1288] Instagram accounts [1291] first and then afterwards I'll do the [1293] same thing here in order to get all of [1294] my YouTube accounts and then basically [1297] all I do is for every one of these [1298] accounts I just run an appify actor so [1301] this is how I do the Instagram one using [1302] an aggregator then this is how I do the [1305] YouTube One also using an aggregator but [1307] also you know uh adding some additional [1309] uh parameters there and then all I do is [1312] I will map and add all of them up using [1315] some custom logic then finally I will [1318] add that data to my Google sheet [1320] alongside the date that I tracked do I [1323] think that this is going to win me a [1324] Nobel Prize no but does it solve a [1326] pretty consistent need that I and many [1327] of my clients have had throughout the [1329] years running my automation agency yes [1331] this is how you might in practice build [1333] something one route for every new [1335] platform so Instagram is here uh YouTube [1338] is over here maybe have Tik Tok that [1340] might be down here and all they're doing [1341] is they're just going through a Google [1343] sheet enumerating um and then getting [1345] every handle they're aggregating all of [1348] those hand Les together and then sending [1349] some sort of apify scraper request this [1352] next flow here is responsible for at [1353] least $25,000 a month I'd consider it s [1356] tier now it's s tier to me it's s tier [1358] to my agency and my needs might not be S [1360] tier to you and your agency and your [1362] needs but let me run you through how it [1363] works again it has to do with my [1365] community makemoney withm make.com [1367] because we are weight listed what that [1369] means is we need a mechanism by which we [1371] can watch for when one person CHS so [1375] that we can invite another person in now [1378] I struggled with this for quite a while [1379] what I ended up doing was I built a flow [1381] that I called the autonomous weightless [1382] manager flow what it does is it just [1384] makes HTTP requests on a daily basis [1387] over to makemoney withm [1389] make.com the really cool thing is when [1391] you do this in school you actually get [1394] all of the [1395] member uh the member count data just [1398] directly in HTML you don't even need a [1400] cookie for it so basically every hour I [1402] have it tell me how many members are in [1403] my community pretty cool right once I [1406] know how many members are in my [1407] community what do I do [1409] I parse that then I say hey are we less [1411] than you know in this case I think this [1413] is when I had a few uh slightly fewer [1414] staff members 403 if we are at less than [1417] 403 I will then search through that [1420] weight list sheet that I showed you [1421] earlier I will then find some customer [1424] details and then I will actually go and [1425] then I will build them automatically and [1428] then invite them into my community [1430] basically immediately I'll also add a [1432] slack notification basically telling me [1434] hey this person just entered your [1435] community go over and send them like a [1437] happy thank you welcome message or [1439] something just because I know that that [1440] adds to the perceived quality of the [1442] service and I want people to feel really [1443] welcome when they come in so how do I do [1445] it I just have a bunch of stripe modules [1447] okay basically um I'm searching my [1449] database and they're retrieving some [1451] customer data because they have a a [1453] stripe um line item already I then [1455] create an invoice item create an invoice [1458] finalize an invoice and then create a [1460] payment intent and stripe a payment [1461] intent is the thing that actually makes [1462] you money now as you see here on the [1464] right hand side we have two routes the [1465] first route is if the payment works if [1468] the payment Works what we do is we [1469] actually send an HTTP request directly [1470] over to the school servers in order to [1472] invite the person into my community [1474] autonomously and then if it doesn't work [1477] what we do is we update our database [1479] with some value like hey this person [1482] couldn't make it then what I do is I [1484] actually send them a manual invoice [1485] instead of an automatic one and then I [1487] use some templated language that looks [1489] something like this hey person thanks [1491] for signing up to the annual waight list [1492] for make money with make I just tried to [1493] invite you in as we had an opening but [1494] your account is showing payment declined [1496] sometimes cards can be finicky without [1497] addresses and I usually don't ask for [1498] this less friction this is usually what [1499] ends up being probably on my end I'm [1501] going to send you a manual stripe [1502] invoice in a sec would you mind paying [1503] it whenever you can Afters let me know [1505] when it's sorted and I'll send you an [1506] invite to the community thanks again so [1508] why is this system valuable and [1510] important well why does it make me you [1512] know 25,000 bucks a month I found that [1515] when I didn't have something like this [1517] that worked immediately within an hour [1518] of somebody wanting to sign up to my [1521] community the number of people that [1523] ended up going through with it was a lot [1525] lower it's one of the classic sales [1528] foundations sell to people where they [1531] are now and where they what they want [1533] now not what they want in 12 16 hours or [1537] something so all I do is when somebody [1539] says they want this now I find a way to [1542] essentially get them on record or [1544] something I get them in my database I [1546] send them some sort of message I I [1547] immediately autoc confirm there's just [1549] some something now and then when a spot [1551] is open I don't waste any time I [1554] immediately go through create that [1555] payment and that payment request and [1557] then I invite them into my community [1559] because I just want to minimize you know [1560] the gap between when they sign up and [1562] when they get the thing that is uh one [1564] of the many ways that automation can be [1566] extraordinarily valuable I'll say time [1568] to lead is is pretty big and it's um a [1570] pretty pretty big low hanging fruit that [1572] a lot of people just don't really seem [1573] to get the shorter your time to lead us [1575] if you can get if you get if you can get [1576] two people within a minute I think you [1578] increase your conversion rate by like 3 [1579] or 400% or something so the shorter your [1582] time to lead is there's basically a [1583] direct correlation between time to lead [1585] and then Revenue okay so the the [1588] um yeah like the the shorter the time to [1591] lead is the revenue and the longer the [1593] time to lead is the revenue goes down if [1594] this is TTL and this is [1596] revenue this [1598] is one [1600] minute this is 60 minutes okay you're [1604] basically getting I don't know like 3 or [1607] 4X the the result if you can just find a [1609] way to respond to people within a minute [1610] and that's what I recommend this is a [1612] very simple two-step flow that just [1613] catches a web hook and then sends [1615] somebody an email asset I'd rate this at [1617] C tier it doesn't make me ton of money [1618] but what it does is it just fills a gap [1620] in one of my systems I have a website up [1621] here nick.com when somebody downloads my [1623] free road map to [1625] 25k basically what I want to do is I [1627] want to invite them into my community [1629] now this is just some some asset that [1630] I've created a while back to guide [1632] people towards being able to set up an [1634] automation agency and then scale it to [1635] 25k a month um and basically what I do [1638] is I watch for new ghost.org signups and [1641] then automatically email this to people [1643] so the second that they they sign up to [1646] my website they also get an email where [1648] basically say hey thanks for signing us [1649] to my blog here's a little freebie for [1651] your time and I formatted this as um [1653] essentially a uh like I formed this as [1655] an HTML email just so that when you get [1657] it it looks all nice and sexy and [1661] clean this upwork and RSS feed and [1663] Icebreaker generator I would rate as s [1665] tier this has made me directly several [1667] hundred, and it's at the core of why I [1669] was able to scale and bootstrap my [1671] agency now I should note that the RSS [1674] feed feature is now deprecated you can't [1676] actually do what I'm showing you right [1677] now using the RSS feed feature um what [1680] you have to do instead is you have to [1681] make basically direct HTTP request over [1684] to upwork instead and then basically [1687] everything else that I'm showing you [1688] here still works but the RSS feed [1690] specifically that was uh you know a a [1694] feature of its time I should say and it [1696] was fantastic because it automatically [1697] structur all the data for you but good [1699] things in life don't always last forever [1700] so what exactly does this do so what I [1702] have over here is an air table where on [1704] the leftmost column we have a title then [1706] we have the date posted we have the [1707] description and then we have a copiable [1709] message alongside a a link to a loom URL [1712] and then a customized Icebreaker where [1715] we basically have ai generate us a [1717] perfect response that's hyper relevant [1719] to this person so that we get all the [1720] benefits of seeming personalized without [1722] actually having to go through the [1723] description and do any of the work this [1724] case hey I'm the person you're looking [1726] for I've implemented automated content [1727] generation systems for an SEO agency [1729] doing over 10 mli year presumably this [1731] is important to the person that applied [1732] uh created the job ensuring seamless [1734] data handling and integration let's [1735] streamline your QuickBooks receipt [1736] management together it's the perfect [1738] ensuring seamless data handling no it's [1740] not but it's as I mentioned the 020 and [1743] when you have a system up like this you [1746] can submit many upwork applications a [1748] day which is typically like quite a [1750] laborious process and then if you [1751] sprinkle on maybe a custom loom video or [1753] something you can you can add a ton of [1755] Leverage I guess is what I'm saying so [1756] how does this work we grab the RSS feed [1758] item over here we parse the description [1760] we then filter the job using this um [1762] open AI module now this is using an [1764] older version as you could see because [1766] this is back I was using this back when [1768] RSS feed was not deprecated we're now [1770] using a slightly different system and [1772] this is more or less what it says I'm an [1773] automation engineer that builds Outreach [1775] system CRM systems project management [1777] systems no code systems and Integrations [1778] below as a job description filter it for [1780] relevance true or false in Json some of [1781] the platforms I use include air table [1783] clickup chat gbt make Monday zap your [1784] LinkedIn Google Sheets if relevant write [1786] a short introductory Icebreaker then I [1788] have a bunch of notes and then I [1790] actually give it a bunch of example [1792] projects um that I have done in the past [1795] right just for social proof reasons and [1796] I basically say hey here's a bunch of [1798] examples of jobs and here's what I want [1800] you to say jobs and then here's what I [1802] want you to say notice how I have it [1804] generate me a reason I do that because [1805] the quality of the filter is better I'll [1808] then parse the Json from the previous [1809] node I then get the budget and then if [1812] it's an hourly job I will add it through [1814] this route and then if it's a project [1815] job I'll add it through this route why [1816] do I do that just because hourly and [1818] project jobs they just T of different [1819] fields right like Max budget and M [1821] budget these are just formatted [1822] differently but yeah I definitely rate [1824] this as s TI I've made a ton of money [1825] with this this is a YouTube RSS fee [1828] competitor monitoring flow I'd rate this [1830] at C tier it's not exactly winning me [1832] any rewards but what it does do is it [1834] just allows me to keep track of the [1835] people that I would consider competitors [1837] in my field so you can see is an n8n [1839] flow we have a trigger that runs every [1842] so often once a day at 5: [1844] a.m. uh we then get a list of [1847] competitors from a Google sheet this is [1849] my Google sheet over here with my list [1850] of competitors now as you can see I've [1852] just changed all the names to other [1853] person but what we're doing is we're [1854] basically tracking the number of posts [1856] they made in the last week the number of [1857] posts they made in the last month and [1858] the number of posts they made in the [1860] last year as well as some accessory [1861] information I'm not going to show you [1862] right now we then track all of my own [1865] videos then we also track all of their [1867] videos right over here which is pretty [1869] neat including the date that they [1871] publish the IDS and so on and so on and [1872] so forth and the value here is it just [1874] allows me to keep track of what the [1876] people in my space that are growing [1878] faster than me or maybe growing in [1879] approximately the same speed are doing [1880] um I didn't actually start keeping track [1882] of competitors till very recently and I [1883] don't really care too much about it uh [1885] but I will say it is quite motivating to [1886] see a bunch of people that are in your [1888] Niche growing faster or better than you [1890] or doing something that you're not and [1892] uh you know ultimately being able to [1893] take something from that incorporate in [1895] your own content and make it better [1896] right I mean it's like a big sharing [1898] ecosystem here I might as well so the [1900] information's out there right um get [1902] competitors using this Google sheet I [1904] then pass this into a split in batches [1905] node which allows me to get a list of [1908] stored videos this is actually kind of [1910] neat the way this logic Works um I [1913] basically get a list of the stored [1914] videos that are currently here so if I [1916] just use my own as an example I get all [1918] of these [1918] right and then I will grab the most [1921] recent videos of the person using an RSS [1923] feed turns out YouTube actually is an [1925] RSS feed if you just like make a request [1926] over to this RSS feed youtube.com/ feed. [1931] XML [1932] channelid if you feed in your channel ID [1936] you can find mine right over here then [1939] you will actually get a list of all of [1941] the YouTube videos of that person so if [1942] I want to find my channel ID let me [1944] click on this uh go down here copy [1947] Channel ID down at the bottom now let's [1950] go back over to the URL that I wanted to [1953] pump in a moment ago which oh boy I [1956] think it was this right over [1958] here check this out now I have a big [1961] list of all the YouTube videos that I [1963] posted pretty neat huh okay so I take [1965] this list of YouTube videos that I [1966] posted and I basically feed it into NN [1969] and then I use a merge node which [1971] basically allows me to drop all of the [1974] non match or keep all of the non- [1976] matches from from the recent videos that [1979] I published that's just sort of a quick [1981] and easy nadn um I want to say like uh [1984] filtering mechanism that allows you to D [1986] duplicate incoming data just use a merge [1987] node set the parameter to keep [1989] non-matches at input one combined by [1991] matching fields and match by whatever [1992] the field is that you want to match on [1994] and then just drop everything from like [1996] the the the old data source so this [1997] would be like your your [1999] current and then this would always be [2001] whatever it is RSS feed API call [2003] whatever this would always be your new [2004] and then you know the new stuff would [2005] come in here then if there's any current [2007] stuff that the same as the new stuff [2008] basically only the unique ones of the [2011] new one would proceed which is kind of [2013] neat then I'll do some data formatting [2015] stuff and I'll basically append it to my [2017] sheet kind of neat huh you can do a lot [2018] with RSS feeds um that's why I love them [2020] so much this is a permutation of the [2022] scalable content generator that I [2024] created almost a year ago now that [2025] actually ended up making me uh [2027] reasonably big on YouTube fairly quickly [2029] essentially what this is first of all [2031] I'd rate this as a tier you can make [2032] some pretty good content with this it's [2033] not amazing but I rate this as a tier [2035] essentially what this ISS is it's a type [2036] form that you feed in a bunch of data [2039] about the article that you want okay I [2041] then will watch the responses I'll grab [2043] it so this is a brief I'll feed in the [2044] title I'll feed in the keywords I'll [2046] feed in a couple other pieces of [2047] information then what we do is we go [2049] through anthropic [2051] CLA then we actually write an outline of [2054] the content this is kind of neat right [2057] this case it was something about [2058] permanent veneers looks like kind of [2060] neat after that once we have the outline [2064] what we'll do is we'll actually split [2067] the outline that we just provided based [2070] off the presence of a new line so now we [2072] just have a giant list of new lines and [2075] if the section starts with an H2 which [2078] is the markdown format meaning for um [2081] like a like not the biggest heading but [2083] the subheading then we'll actually have [2085] ai generate a whole [2088] article based off of a specific sorry [2093] generate a specific section of an [2095] article based off of an arrow pointing [2098] to the left of a heading I know that may [2100] sound a little bit more complicated than [2101] usual feel free to check out my content [2103] Generation video if you guys want more [2105] in- depth on that um but yeah this this [2107] thing has directly made me probably well [2108] over $100,000 not the anthropic CLA part [2110] this is something that's relatively new [2112] the end result is you end up with a blog [2113] post it looks something like this so [2115] exploring your options for dental [2117] implants as you can see I was doing this [2118] with one of my dental clients picture [2119] this it's the 1960s the world was [2120] captivated by the Space Race as [2121] astronauts prepare for their Journey To [2122] The Moon NASA faces an unexpected [2124] challenge how to keep their teeth clean [2126] in zero gravity the solution a [2127] toothpaste pill that astronauts can chew [2129] spreading the paste around their mouth [2130] before swallowing it while this [2132] Innovative approach solve the immediate [2133] problem it's safe to say that most of us [2134] prefer our toothpaste to stay out of our [2136] stomachs fast forward to today and [2137] dental Innovation continues to push [2139] boundaries will be in more practical [2140] ways and this is basically kind of a [2143] clean way to lead into a main point so [2145] there's an introduction format that um [2147] basically like feeds in some sort of [2149] historical data and then we use that [2150] historical data to uh relate to whatever [2153] the thing is that we're talking about [2155] and then you know the rest of it is is [2156] um pretty good so I'd rate this content [2158] at like you know 90th percentile content [2160] maybe 95th percentile like AI generated [2161] content 90th percentile like blog [2163] content uh there's no real need to pay [2165] somebody to to do this level of stuff [2168] for you the only point of me paying for [2170] Content at this point would be if you [2171] want like journalist level quality where [2172] you want some sort of social proofer [2174] Association a flow like this can do it [2175] pretty quick um at the end there what we [2177] do is we create a Google doc article [2179] just like I showed you we update a row [2180] in a database just to add that as a line [2182] item and then ultimately I create a [2184] slack message just to notify me and the [2185] team that the blog article is ready this [2187] is a Facebook ads new lead form [2190] submission to slack automation I'd rate [2192] this as C tier super simple as we see [2195] it's just three nodes or modules in make [2199] um we are catching a new lead event what [2202] you can do in Facebook is when a new [2204] Facebook lead ad comes in you can grab [2206] all of the fields or whatever Fields you [2208] want selecting this button you can get a [2209] bunch of lead details so this is when I [2211] was running a campaign for 1 second copy [2213] in Vancouver I had a form called [2214] agencies basically what I do is I just [2216] notify my team say hey there's a new [2218] agency lead it's making over 50k a month [2221] or 10K a month not sure why there [2223] differences there but whatever and then [2225] we also store a bunch of information [2226] about uh you know the specific lead and [2229] their name and so on and so on and so [2230] forth so not an amazing automation but [2232] just to show you guys that you guys can [2233] automate the hell out of inbound [2234] Facebook lead ads inquiries this next [2236] flow is the beginning of a very high Roi [2239] hiring flow I'd rate this as a tier this [2241] is directly made me probably over [2242] $100,000 it's difficult to know with [2244] hiring flows because it's difficult to [2247] really be able to say oh I hired that [2248] person because of this form flow and [2250] they made me several $100,000 so it's [2252] because of the form flow right but [2253] obviously if we're speaking [2254] pragmatically flows like this allow you [2256] to reach many more people in a shorter [2258] unit of time they also save you a fair [2260] amount of money in the front and the [2260] back end so let me run you through what [2262] something like this does basically um [2265] this watch is a type form anytime you [2266] see these sort of three nodes here with [2269] um a watch then a sleep and then a list [2271] responses on type form all this is doing [2272] is is just getting responses it's just a [2275] design pattern that um I do in make.com [2277] that allows me to test my type form [2279] anytime I want I basically grab all the [2281] data from this list responses node and [2282] then anytime I want to test I just [2284] unlink drag the schedule over and then I [2286] just run it over and over and over again [2288] um but this just allows me to do both [2290] testing and then production stuff kind [2291] of simultaneously anywh who um what we [2294] do is basically I have a type form set [2296] up type form looks like this so it's [2298] like hey what role are you applying for [2300] so depending on the role that you want [2301] in the company in our case when I [2302] created this was just video editor you [2304] would select the role I would post this [2306] form on indeed I'd post this on upwork [2308] I'd post this all over Facebook and so [2310] on and so forth when I'm looking for [2311] hires for the specific role then it [2314] would give you some information about [2315] who I am this is back at the 40,000 [2317] subscribers days actually no this I [2319] created this when I was much smaller but [2320] I've actually recently updated this [2321] because I needed to hire a video editor [2324] and then um you feed in your contact [2326] details here you feed in a portfolio [2328] with a link to your work here you feed [2329] in your location here you feed in your [2332] start date your weekly availability your [2334] hourly rate this is interesting ask [2335] people for what hourly rate they want [2337] when they work with you because it'll [2338] have them compete against each other in [2339] order to give you a better deal it also [2341] allows you to see who's ambitious who's [2344] a risk taker who's willing to throw a [2346] large hourly rate out there if they [2348] think they deserve it and so I kind of [2349] look at both ends of the scale you know [2350] I look at the people that bid me a lot [2352] and then I look at the people that bid [2352] me a little they bid me a lot I'm like [2354] okay so that guy's clearly slapped his [2356] dick on the table what's cool about him [2357] let's let me take a look if maybe she's [2359] bid me very little I'll be like hm okay [2361] like what about her has made her bid so [2364] little I think her work's pretty good [2365] can I be getting her at a discount here [2367] and if so if I paid her a little bit [2368] more would I be able to make a multiple [2370] on her ambition at her work right it's [2372] kind of a neat little hiring trick [2374] anyway I get some comments then I do [2375] next step so what happens after you fill [2377] this puppy in you get added to this [2379] hiring pipeline this is a hiring [2381] pipeline where we have the name on the [2384] left hand side we have the date that [2387] they came in on the next column over [2390] then you have the status new applicant [2391] reviewed request trial review trial [2393] onboarding hired not a fit okay this is [2395] our hiring pipeline a pipeline is just a [2397] ser of stages this is ours then we have [2400] a link to their portfolio we have their [2402] email address and then we have their uh [2405] their route as well so sorry their rate [2408] as well so $9 $12 [2410] $13 um I don't know like uh sorry the [2414] rat's $9 total is $13 1510 15 [2418] 30130 um you know Source being up workk [2421] indeed reddits so on and so forth video [2424] editor roll comments uh we we we have [2426] all the fields here I guess basically [2427] what I'm saying so what's the value in [2429] this well the value is not just this [2432] okay the value is that when you change [2435] the status of one of these records from [2438] new applicant to request trial what [2441] happens is our flow will automatically [2444] get their clickup information then send [2447] them a customized email saying hey I [2450] really liked your portfolio and I want [2452] you to do a trial job for us below is a [2455] link to a form which explains the trial [2457] gives you a brief and then even tells [2459] you how to upload the finished product [2461] remember to invoice us when you're done [2462] cuz I want to pay people for the test [2464] work that they do for me they tend to do [2465] a much better job then I link them to my [2467] trial form right over here and I also [2469] embed a bunch of URL parameters upwork [2472] location hourly rate email clickup ID [2475] okay what does the form look like looks [2476] like this this now is a completely [2479] autonomous hiring flow I have uh with [2482] one major exception I get the portfolios [2485] and then all I have to do is look at [2487] them and verify this person is what I [2488] want if they are what I want then I send [2491] them this form they automatically go [2492] through this form do the steps the [2494] invoicing is the currently only manual [2495] portion of this and then once they're [2497] done um their status updates from [2499] request trial to review trial and then I [2501] can review the work that they've done [2503] assuming their work is good I can then [2505] um hire them and then that hiring [2506] section starts another sequence of [2508] automations which ultimately has them um [2511] you know do things like send me over [2513] their payment information create a wise [2514] account so that I have easier payment [2516] access and so on and so so on and so [2517] forth the next flow is a new systems [2519] audit request and this is one of the [2520] newest ones that I built here um I just [2522] built this uh maybe within a month or so [2524] basically what happens is we have this [2527] um you know when somebody goes on my [2529] website here left click wants to work [2530] with my agency basically they need to [2532] fill out this big form okay this big [2534] form runs through a bunch of questions [2536] about what type of business you run what [2538] your business does are you looking for a [2541] onetime project or an ongoing monthly [2542] relationship what do you want to help [2543] with what's your current monthly Revenue [2545] what's your website URL and so on and so [2547] forth and then you know you put in your [2548] contact right here at the very end [2550] there's a booking page okay at that [2553] booking page at that moment when you [2555] fill it out first of all I have a filter [2557] that filters out fake entries because [2558] I'm getting a lot of fake entries just [2559] being somebody that you know it's in the [2561] five figure soon to be six figure [2563] YouTube subscriber Mark then what I do [2565] is I check my database to see if this [2567] person that just submitted a request has [2569] already submitted a request before if [2570] not if they're new then I proceed [2573] because I only want to do this once what [2574] I'll do is I'll actually use AI to [2576] template out an Emil email for this [2578] person okay this is what the email looks [2579] like it says hey what's going on person [2583] and in this case it's just saying JJ [2584] because I want to you know offc the data [2587] so hey JJ thanks for booking a call that [2588] request looks exciting I'm out of the [2589] office immediate uh right now but I'll [2591] look over everything as soon as I'm back [2592] and send you a followup with some [2593] thoughts looking forward to learning [2594] more about what you're aiming to achieve [2596] cheers and then for whatever reason I [2597] say cheers twice so maybe I shouldn't [2600] have used the cheers term I was [2601] wondering why nobody was responding to [2603] me no I'm just kidding it's not that big [2604] of a deal but so so here's the value [2606] here um I sent this email within like [2609] one minute okay so they or within 2 [2612] minutes they fill out the form and [2614] they're thinking all right so somebody [2615] will call me back in like a week [2616] probably because that's most people's [2617] experience with marketing agencies and [2619] then they get an email from me [2620] presumably the person that they wanted [2622] to work with this whole time within like [2624] a minute so now what are they thinking [2626] damn okay um wow these guys are really [2629] good um and I think my yellow just went [2630] on so pardon that um I use [2633] f.lux I'm going to have to find a way to [2635] turn that off but uh yeah you know like [2638] uh how cool is that right so now looking [2640] forward to learning more about what [2641] you're aiming to achieve cheers so now [2642] you're thinking hm okay this guy's [2644] actually here he's saying it looks [2645] exciting he's out of the office now but [2646] he's going to send me a message back [2648] then what do I do 10 minutes later which [2651] I wait using um sleeps inside of make [2654] sleep 75 seconds sleep 85 300 [2657] 300 I sent them another email saying hey [2660] circling back to this all of this stuff [2661] looks great there may be a couple of [2663] gotches depending on the specifics of [2664] what you're looking for but I don't [2665] think that'll be a big issue I'm ceasing [2666] STI my partner on custom projects [2669] whatever they requested really he'll [2670] start by scoping this out seeing if [2671] there's any other contacts who might [2672] need in a call seeing it's a fit I'll [2674] then record a private video for you [2675] going over any last minute details oroom [2677] and then once you confirm all of us can [2678] get together to kick things off excited [2680] about this Santi please help JJ through [2681] anything he needs I'll check the [2682] recording after the meeting why am I [2684] doing this because I've just been [2685] jumping on a lot of meetings recently [2686] it's hard for me to continue making the [2688] time for this so I'm looking to build [2689] out infrastructure that allows other [2690] people to take these calls yet for them [2692] to still have a personalized experience [2694] or at least the perception of a [2695] personalized experience with me [2697] so this um this is like an autoresponder [2699] system where I do all of it completely [2701] autonomously so that by the person by [2703] the time 15 minutes after they book The [2705] call they're thinking wow these guys are [2707] really on top of their [ __ ] I can't wait [2708] to work with Nick you can imple [2711] implement the same system for any sort [2712] of agency flow whether you're taking the [2714] calls yourself or somebody else is [2715] taking the calls for you this next [2717] system I would rate as B tier it's an [2719] automatic invoice collection system [2720] basically the way that it works is once [2723] every day at 7:30 I will search through [2726] a Google sheet that looks like this this [2728] isn't the same Google sheet I use I just [2730] wanted to have a Google sheet so I use [2731] an example Google sheet based off what a [2733] video demo I did a while ago but [2735] basically this is a list of invoices [2736] that I've sent to people that I'm [2737] currently waiting on collection now one [2740] thing that you'll know uh when you work [2741] in the agency space is a lot of people [2743] take forever to get their invoices back [2745] to you and if you're not constantly on [2746] top of your ship some people just won't [2748] pay your invoices at all regardless of [2750] the good service that you do so this is [2753] the simplest way to follow up with uh [2755] overdue invoices this is one of the most [2758] straightforward ones to put together [2759] ever as you see I mean this has what one [2762] two three real nodes or modules and then [2765] everything else is just like a router [2766] duplicate of the last one so how does [2769] this work basically every day I'll [2772] search through this Google sheet looking [2773] for a status that is overdue okay you [2776] can do this with like your your stripe [2777] invoices your QuickBooks invoices [2779] whatever they all have similar Fields [2780] I'm just doing this in a Google sheet [2781] for for Simplicity purposes and then [2784] what you do is you just have a bunch of [2786] routes could say hey how long has it [2788] been since uh that invoice is created if [2791] it's been 7 days since I sent this I'm [2794] going to send this [2796] email Okay then if it's been 14 days I'm [2799] going to send this email if it's been 21 [2802] days I'm going to send this email if [2805] it's been 28 days then I'm going to send [2808] this email if it's been 35 days I will [2810] send this email it's 42 days I will send [2814] this email okay you can obviously make [2816] this as long as you want if you wanted [2818] to you could keep this puppy going for [2822] the next year you could make this I [2825] don't recommend this but you can make [2826] this arbitrarily long right you could [2828] say okay well this is two months that's [2829] three months that's four months so on [2831] and so on and so forth maybe at some [2832] point you start throwing legal letters [2833] in I don't know do whatever the hell you [2834] want to do right but this is the [2835] simplest and easiest automatic invoice [2836] collection system where you just follow [2838] up repeatedly about the invoice you can [2840] like weave it in to have the link to the [2841] invoice you could you could do a bunch [2842] of stuff but yeah I like the system for [2844] that reason alone this is a cold email [2846] ice Aker generator system I'd rate this [2848] as a tier I made well over $200,000 with [2851] this system or a slight variant of this [2854] system not this exact scenario but uh [2856] basically this system and then like a [2857] couple of duplicates of it it's actually [2859] split into two so we have one over here [2861] that searches the rows of a big Google [2863] sheet then makes an HTTP request over to [2866] another make.com web hook which is [2868] pretty neat this make.com web Hook is [2870] this scenario which catches it and then [2872] one by one generates a customized [2874] Icebreaker using artificial intelligence [2876] a little bit weaker than uh the Deep [2878] personalization method that I have [2879] talked about on this and and or I will [2882] talk about on this in other videos but [2883] it's still pretty great basically we say [2886] write an icebreaker a on line customized [2887] introduction for cold email campaign use [2889] the provided data from LinkedIn as [2890] context here's some guidelines and then [2893] ultimately here A bunch of examples of [2894] what I want uh what we're going to feed [2896] you and then what I want okay so this [2898] hypothetical person Jamie is going to [2900] get an email says hey Jamie love your [2901] podcast I consider myself the [2902] intersection of blockchain AI and VR as [2904] well so i' cons I'd figure I'd reach out [2907] the title said hello Jamie mate so you [2909] run a pre late Seed Accelerator and [2912] podcast if you're Jamie and you run a [2914] pre Seed Accelerator or a late Seed [2916] Accelerator and you're also doing a [2917] podcast and you get an email like this [2919] are you thinking that AI wrote the [2921] specifics of this it's lower case uh you [2923] know it's kind of Mis formatted no [2925] obviously you're thinking human being at [2926] least wrote the subject line right sure [2928] maybe they used a title or something [2929] like that but for the most part you're [2930] like okay that's a person what does that [2932] do that buys you a few seconds them [2934] reading the rest of your email which [2935] allows you to put your super high I [2937] offer in front of them pretty cool what [2938] does the actual sheet look like it kind [2940] of looks like this um so we just go all [2942] the way over to the right hand side here [2943] uh as you see we have a personalization [2945] column all the way at the right so hey [2946] Ellie noticed you're blending blank hey [2949] Paige running a podcast Hey Jake as a [2951] fellow design Enthusiast hey KCs you're [2953] hosting the how to trade it hey Paul saw [2955] you manage podcast production at insert [2956] company um so what you do is you make [2958] that Google sheet column and then you [2961] can either automatically or uh what I [2963] what I do is cuz you know I'm always [2964] quick and dirty anybody that watches any [2966] of my my videos will know that I don't [2968] actually like build despite being the [2969] automation guy I don't like building all [2970] these super dedicated systems right off [2973] the ge-o I like just like taking [2974] something making the quickest and [2976] dirtiest MVP of it and then going out [2977] there and making real money with it um [2979] so what I do is I just take that and I [2980] just I export it and then I feed it and [2982] import it into uh instantly every couple [2985] of days realistically this next system [2987] is a proposal generation flow it's a [2989] little bit different from some of the [2990] other ones that you might have seen me [2991] or other people do I'd rate this as s [2993] tier I've made several hundred, with [2995] this system I don't know how many I mean [2996] I've sold at least $200,000 like using [2999] this platform alone but um you know in [3001] terms of how much money it's made me [3003] some of these contracts are still [3004] ongoing um I've had some of these [3005] clients for a very very long time so to [3008] run you through it basically uh this [3009] system is pretty straightforward we [3011] watch a discovery call forry the [3013] discovery call looks like this okay you [3016] basically log a discovery call when [3019] you're on the call or done with them [3020] what you do is you say do you want to [3021] send a proposal do you want to attend [3023] their meeting did they not attend the [3025] meeting or is it not a fit you add the [3027] clickup ID of the record this is just [3028] added automatically based off URL prams [3031] if you didn't though this is your [3032] opportunity to do so you enter the name [3035] of the company here the uh company's [3038] website then you ask a bunch of [3040] questions hey what's the company's [3041] average closing rate so while you're [3043] talking with a person you say listen [3044] like I I think I could crush this for [3045] you and generate you 100 leads in the [3047] next month but if I'm real with you [3049] let's say I did generate you 100 leads [3051] in the next month how many of these do [3052] you think you could realistically close [3053] they say 25 so I say okay 25% [3057] what's up next hey um you know assuming [3059] that I Clos one deal for you like how [3061] much money are you actually making off [3062] of that deal let's just get down to [3064] Brass tax they give you some number [3065] sorry my series is going crazy that's [3068] pretty funny keeps on thinking that I [3069] say it name um what's the average order [3072] value I don't know 2,000 bucks what are [3074] the specific problems that you wanted [3076] highlighted in The Proposal so I [3078] actually put some specific information [3079] in and then you know what happens I [3080] actually go and I I feed all this into [3082] Panda do which is a proposal generation [3083] platform and I go and I automatically [3085] generate um a bunch of high quality [3087] proposals for the person that I can send [3089] immediately so this is what the proposal [3091] looks like we have a title page we have [3092] a what you're getting page so let's be [3094] direct the purpose of a business is to [3095] generate revenue and right now your [3097] company is having a problem doing so [3098] here's a bunch of your specific problems [3100] right now you're lacking this you're [3101] lacking that you're lacking that I think [3103] that realistically I could help you [3105] that's where we come in we guarantee [3106] your service because I do because we [3108] know it works dozens of high performing [3109] agency and service businesses use us to [3111] generate tens of thousands of dollars a [3112] day here's what you can expect then I [3114] have a bunch of benefits that are [3115] templated all of these are growth based [3118] so this is my like growth [3119] system then I run people through how I [3122] do it then I run people through to [3124] investment models so they could do offer [3126] creation campaign set up Fe you with 100 [3128] bucks per booked sales call they could [3129] also do a revenue share this is where [3131] you make most the money in the stuff by [3132] the way um specifically with like higher [3133] ticket companies but this is uh I don't [3136] know if I'd sell this exact offer today [3137] to be honest I haven't sold anything [3139] with this proposal in quite a while but [3141] uh this is this is where you make most [3142] of the money usually you get companies [3144] that are like oh yeah sure okay like [3145] when I win you win so 9% of all revenue [3147] generated sure I'll do that uh and then [3149] you start printing right they sign like [3150] a $445,000 deal and you make like 6,000 [3153] bucks off it that's sweet anyway then we [3156] have some guarantees some social proof [3158] and then you have some partnership terms [3159] down here as well as a Services [3160] agreement and yeah that's the automation [3162] pretty straightforward right but as you [3163] could see automations don't have to be [3165] complicated in order to make you a ton [3166] of money cool I'm going to leave it at [3168] that obviously this isn't every [3169] automation I've ever made I probably [3170] made over a thousand at this point but I [3172] thought this would be a quick hit or [3174] summary of probably the most relevant [3176] ones to most people that are watching my [3177] channel um if you guys like this sort of [3179] thing let me know down below what other [3180] automations you'd like to see me cover [3182] obviously this is mostly make.com with a [3184] sprinkling of nadn I'm doing sorry I got [3187] a funny text I'm doing a lot of them [3189] these days so if you guys have any U [3191] recommendations or whatever just let me [3192] know in my YouTube comment scraper will [3193] take it and then make that into an idea [3195] for me otherwise if you give me a big [3197] saw like subscribe do all that fun [3198] YouTube stuff that gets me to the top of [3199] the algo and I'll I'd love to make more [3201] videos like this to run you guys through [3203] my experience with my agency and then [3204] ultimately the systems that I built so [3206] if you if if you like it give me some [3207] love and then I'll use that as a an [3209] indicator that you guys want more of the [3210] stuff have a lovely rest of the day I'll [3212] see you on the next one cheers

Title: My Worst Mistakes Running An AI Automation Agency
[0] here are the worst mistakes I've ever [1] made running an AI automation agency and [3] I've made a ton on my journey to 72,000 [6] bucks a month this video is just going [7] to be more or less story time where I [9] run you through all of these mistakes so [11] that if you guys find yourself in the [13] shoes that I was in a couple of years [15] ago and I was starting all those [16] hopefully you can avoid the mistakes and [18] you know make a lot more money a lot [19] faster and with fewer gray hairs so I [22] can think of a few projects right off [24] the top of my head that I would consider [26] mistakes for sure um if I di it back [29] like like the biggest mistake I made [30] right off the bat was doing custom [33] projects for too long a custom project I [36] will Define in this video as a project [39] where the client doesn't really know [40] what they want and so you have to come [42] in and you have to educate them on what [44] they want you have to consult with them [45] then once you know what they want you [47] have to discuss and scope how you're [50] going to do it for them then you have to [52] go through some protracted sale process [54] to iron out the specific deliverables [56] then you actually sign the deal then you [58] have to go and you have to build the [59] project then you have to present it to [61] them and do a bunch of revisions and [63] then finally if all of those things are [65] perfect Hail Mary you get your invoice [68] paid and maybe you get a little deposit [70] before then who knows but but basically [72] in order to make money you got to deal [73] with a bunch of BS now uh I actually [77] recommend you do custom projects if it's [79] your first second or third gig in AI [82] Automation and the reason why is because [84] of market economics um I I mention this [87] all the time in maker school I make [88] money with make.com these are my autom [90] communities where I show people how to [91] build automation businesses from scratch [93] and scale them up to 25k and Beyond man [95] that was a hell of a sales pitch uh but [98] like market economics when you're a [101] beginner are you you lack like you lack [104] client management skills probably you [106] lack sales skills most likely you lack [108] automation skills most likely you don't [110] understand the systems necessary in [112] order to like have a good pipeline or [113] good lead generation funnel most likely [115] and so you're kind of put in this this [117] really tough spot right but if you think [119] about it from the the client perspective [122] you know supply and demand like when [124] there's a lot of something um we tend [125] not to want it as much as when there's [127] very little of it and it's scarse and we [129] want it a ton well if you think about it [130] supply and demand wise if a client has [133] this custom project that they need like [135] how big is the supply of Freelancers or [139] agencies or service providers that'll [141] really be able to do that super custom [144] Nuance thing with like all these random [146] ass software apps and all these weird [148] scripts that you have to write to [149] maintain stuff and like odd front ends [152] like if you think about it logically [153] like the supply of the market actually [154] able to fulfill that and and willing to [156] like prostrate themselves and get [158] whipped on the back for months on end in [160] order to make it happen is actually [162] really low right so the demand for your [163] service is really high so if you're [166] still with me you're basically [167] artificially inflating the demand which [169] means you who might be like a relative [171] nobody with no skills no nothing you can [174] actually seem pretty valuable if you're [175] just willing to do the thing that they [176] asked you for and you demonstrate some [178] middling level of competence [180] so because you're a total beginner my [182] recommendation is actually like get up [183] and run and do a couple right the [185] problem is in my case I made the major [188] mistake of doing custom projects too [190] long when I started a left click my [192] automation agency I did so with my [193] partner Noah and Brilliant guy um [197] basically we got on this idea of doing [201] the same thing that we were doing for [203] our content writing company at the time [206] but just for clients and what did we do [207] for our content writing company at the [208] time well we were building these amazing [210] systems to solve super nuanced problems [212] we were writing scripts we were you know [214] building really sweet infrastructure and [216] stuff like that um and all of it was [218] super custom right and we thought how [220] cool would it be if we could just build [221] all the same stuff we're doing for our [222] company but then do it for other people [224] which are way more interesting because [225] you know it's all new niches and stuff [226] and then we get paid massive multiples [228] for it that would be incredible right [230] but we operated like that for way too [232] long and one thing that I see all the [234] time in AI automation agencies [236] especially in my programs is they'll be [237] like just signed a deal for $5,000 and [240] I'm like hell yeah right amazing job [243] right 3 months down the line I'm like [244] how's how's the agency going are you at [246] 20K yet and they're like no I haven't [248] made any money except for that [250] $5,000 because since that project all [252] I've been doing is working on that [254] client demand this is like one of the [257] most common classic issues ever you have [259] this massive Revenue Spike quickly [261] because you make a lot of money doing [262] custom projects and then after you're [264] done you know signing the deal and stuff [266] you actually have to deliver it's like [267] holy this is like 3 four months of back [269] and forth scope changes constant [271] revision requests right you never [273] actually get anywhere so anyway [276] hopefully I've given you enough [276] background about what the hell a custom [278] project actually is uh to run you [280] through a couple specific examples we [281] had one uh no and I where we wanted [284] to it was the biggest project we had [286] ever won at the time okay essentially [288] what it was was it was a platform for [291] contract laborers you can think of it as [293] like uber but for contract labors and [295] the whole idea was and obviously we were [298] the only automation agency willing to [299] accept this this Uber for contract labor [302] who the hell else was going to do this [304] right we were total noobs um the whole [306] idea was there are a bunch of like grunt [308] contract laborers that do jobs and I [311] don't I think there somewhere in Africa [313] or or maybe the Middle East essentially [316] um there a bunch of them that do jobs [318] but there's this very annoying process [320] that they have to go through um where [321] they have to like present themselves to [322] the company and there's all this legal [324] red tape or whatever so this platform [325] wanted to solve that by just having like [327] a sign up portal where they'd sign up [329] they'd fill all the documentation [330] already and then when a company wanted [332] like some contract labor really quickly [334] to help unload their ships or something [335] right uh or I don't know carry pallets [337] or whatever they just like click a [338] button and then voila the purse would be [340] there the payments would be handled so [341] that was the whole idea it was Uber for [342] contract labor basically uh we ended up [345] having to refund them because that [346] project went like four or five months uh [348] you know when all a sudden down we made [350] like 9,000 bucks off it or something and [353] and that refund that sucked um that [355] whole process sucked so like yeah we got [357] a big spike of Revenue quickly but we [359] also had a very negative client there [361] was a very negative client experience I [362] think I mean Noah maintains that it [364] wasn't that bad and that the guy was [365] like pretty happy with it most of the [366] way through we ended up placing him with [368] somebody else to do the rest of the [370] project and stuff and just just not just [372] not a good experience man like I we [373] probably spent over 200 hours on that um [375] just like backbreaking labor I was [377] designing the the website the front end [379] I was you know Consulting with with with [382] my partner and then a couple of other [383] people to like help design the database [384] and stuff it it it was a nightmare [386] client would request change after change [388] after change G us for weeks and months [391] at a time when all said and done I'm [393] talk we're talking like 20 bucks an hour [394] if that right so listen 20 bucks an hour [398] is fine if it's your first gig and it's [400] a great way to learn and boy did I learn [402] a lot of strong client management skills [404] going through that experience and and [405] other similar related experiences but is [407] that really something you want to be [408] doing 3 months in 6 months in N9 months [410] in no you know if I had jumped off of [412] the custom project train a lot earlier [414] and I had moved over to templated intro [416] offers plus some sort of like scalable [418] recurring service which you know these [420] concepts are gaining a lot of um [422] notoriety right now they're first [423] popularized by a guy called Matt Larsson [425] I do a podcast with them check them out [426] if you want but but if you move over to [428] that sort of structure after your first [430] or second custom project like instead of [432] your Revenue being kind of like mine [433] which is you know kind of went up and [435] then just plateaued for God knows how [436] many months like your your Revenue will [438] consistently and steadily rise as you [440] add Mr and um you know scale your [443] business so I guess to make a long story [445] short that big mistake about custom [447] projects like like like custom projects [450] are okay a trial by fire is okay [453] upskilling and and leveling up your [455] client management skills and [456] understanding how Scopes work on all [457] stuff that's okay do that for a little [460] bit but don't like keep doing it it's [462] kind of like how you know if you ride a [464] tricycle or sorry if you ride a bicycle [466] with the training wheels on right it's [468] it's faster and easier for you to learn [470] how to ride the bike I would imagine [471] right if not then why the hell it's so [473] many toddlers Do It um it's probably [476] faster and easier to learn how to ride a [477] bike but once you learn kind how to ride [479] the bike like if you keep the the [481] training wheels on are you really [482] figuring out how to ride the bike or are [484] you just like going to be continuing to [485] Pedal at 1 km an hour never really [488] getting anywhere so yeah that's my first [491] major mistake for sure my second big one [494] um was that I was addicted to doing [497] everything for [498] everybody if you do everything for [501] everybody you do nothing for nobody for [504] more than half of my agency's life if [506] somebody sent a request in you know one [509] of my ask clients or referrals or [510] something and they said hey you're in [512] Tech right oh great well can you build [515] us a website with all the bells and [516] whistles we'll pay you really good money [519] like I would not say the logical thing [522] which is hey that sounds really great [523] let me refer you to over to somebody who [524] does this for a living we actually do [526] automations so you know I'm going to [528] pass on that but really appreciate your [529] business here's the here's the person [530] that can fulfill for it instead I would [532] be [533] like of course I'm a website Pro I'll [537] take care of that for you for the low [538] low price of [540] $987 I do this all the time right and [544] it's great for again the short-term [546] Revenue Spike but like man I was an [549] automation agency what the hell am I [550] doing websites for right or an autom you [552] know I'm an automation agency what the [553] hell am I doing social media marketing [555] packages for right if you get in the [557] habit of accepting things that your [559] system is not optimized to do the way [561] that I see it is you're basically [563] pouring like the wrong gasoline in the [567] tank you know how like some cars are [569] optim to run off of like the highest [571] octane fuel and if you pour the crappy [573] gas in I mean it'll sputter and start [576] and just slowly muck up and ruin your [578] engine right alternatively I think it's [580] the other way around for some cars at [582] least it is for my Subaru you pour in a [584] bunch of the good quality gasoline into [586] the tank and it's like worse for the [588] vehicle because it's optimized to run on [589] a specific one I don't know I'm not a [591] car guy so maybe I'm speaking blatant [593] sin right now and if I am uh leave a [595] comment down below telling me why but uh [598] the point that I'm making is [600] the whole purpose of your agency is you [601] want to do something way better than [603] everybody else right if you want to do [605] something way better than everybody else [606] you typically have to invest in creating [608] some sort of like structured [609] standardized pipeline some [610] infrastructure that'll allow you to [611] fulfill orders for a particular type of [614] thing better than other people so if you [616] grow addicted to just like putting all [618] sorts of fuel in your car okay all sorts [621] of of BS in your engine then you'll [624] you'll never really be able to get up to [626] the top speed that you otherwise like [627] you know uh want to be be able to like I [631] in addition to hitting that that Plateau [632] because of the custom Revenue Uh custom [634] projects that Revenue Plateau I want to [636] say um I also further plateaued because [638] I was just saying yes to everybody and [639] so I'd have these minor little spikes [640] here with these oneoff projects that [642] might make me an additional $5,000 but [644] then it was like okay great I made [645] $5,000 this month what am I making next [648] month right so the way that I see it is [652] when you do this the these these [653] short-term everything for everybody type [656] deals what you're doing is you basically [658] have a wound somewhere in your body and [659] you're like putting a bandaid on it and [661] that's good because it solves a [662] short-term need of the wound it's [664] exposed and you know it's like dangerous [666] and it hurts a lot right so you need to [668] cover it but you need to address the [671] thing that resulted in the wound in the [673] first place right so you know slap the [675] Band-Aid on do it for the first few [677] times whatever get your short-term [679] Revenue up but all the while be thinking [682] constantly okay how do I stop doing this [684] thing because this is not this is not [685] allowing me to scale my my [687] agency the reality is is you need a [690] niche you need a niche in this business [692] model you also need a niche just more [693] generally but most people think when [695] they hear the term Niche they're like oh [697] this Niche you know uh uh I need to [699] focus on women-owned dog walking [702] businesses in Iowa City that make [704] between 25 and [706] $45,000 they they think they need to go [708] so dang deep that like the The Tam or [711] total addressable Market is like is like [712] two people or something right obviously [715] there's Nuance there you don't need to [716] go women-owned businesses in Iowa City [718] that make between 25 and 45k okay uh you [722] can Target a whole vertical or a whole [723] Niche you could Target like the [724] recruitment industry you could Target [726] like the B2B ecommer I don't know you [728] could Target like specific type of [729] e-commerce product you could Target like [730] B2B growth companies you could Target [732] like creative agencies PPC agencies um [735] you know manufacturing companies right [737] you can Target a whole vertical just the [739] fact that you're targeting a whole [740] vertical is going to make you like 50 [741] times as effective as what you're doing [743] before and then in addition to targeting [745] a vertical Target a specific sort of [747] thing so like if you're an if you're an [749] AI automation company don't just be an [751] AI automation company be like a be like [753] a a CRM company or like a like a like a [756] like a growth system company like I am [758] or something of that nature you know [759] what I mean so just add a little bit of [761] texture to your business and then the [763] next time that one of those damn request [765] comes in for something that sure might [767] make you a little bit of short-term [768] money uh but ultimately screw with your [771] long-term growth don't be afraid to say [773] no obviously take everything I'm saying [775] with a grain assault like if you're if [776] you're broke and you need to make rent [778] like do do whatever you have to do I [780] distinctly remember a moment I was just [782] reminded a few days ago where I had spun [785] up my door to-door marketing agency and [787] I had knocked on between 50 80 doors a [789] day for three months with another [791] business partner of mine at the time and [793] at the end of it all we had made like s [795] bucks or something okay seven bucks in [797] three months it was it was pathetically [798] terrible I had I had rent looming I had [800] responsibilities coming aboard my [802] parents were ashamed of me I sitting on [805] the side of the street in early December [807] as snow and freezing rain fell on my [809] face and my little thin H&M blazer for [812] $240 that I got in the clearance rack [815] and I was just [816] thinking I need money right now don't [818] don't get yourself in the same situation [820] that I was where where where you have [822] all that stress and it's just slowly [823] eating you eating you away like like if [825] you have a project that you could take [827] on that ultimately solves that need and [829] puts that Band-Aid on do it but you know [831] ultimately start working towards saying [833] no and being more in control of your [835] intentions and it's good that I mention [838] intentions cuz I have a couple other [839] things that I want to say stories and [841] and and also mistakes um probably the [843] biggest one regarding intentions is for [846] a very long time I was super afraid to [848] commit to anything and that ultimately [851] further impacted my ability to grow my [853] agency and resulted in many a middling [855] month where less than $10,000 were made [858] um I think a lot of people are afraid of [860] commit well I know a lot of people are [861] afraid of commitment but a lot of people [863] are afraid of commitment not like [866] consciously they're afraid of commitment [868] because they've intellectualized this [869] idea that you should be maximizing your [871] opportunity at every step they think [874] okay I need to go to school and get a [878] degree because it maximizes the [880] likelihood that I'll get a job it [881] maximizes the things that I can do and [882] the [883] opportunities um when I travel I'm going [885] to go to this place in Central Europe so [887] that I can maximize the opportunities [889] and maybe I'll go here maybe I'll go [891] there I'm going to have the most options [893] um you know I'm going to go to if I do [895] go to school I'll go to school for a [896] very specific degree that I don't know [898] it's some general study thing that lets [900] me do as many other things as I want um [903] I want to start a marketing business [904] because it'll afford me the most [905] opportunity to do PPC and SEO and and [908] and AD campaigns and all this [910] stuff if you if you live your life [916] basically in such a way that you are [918] maximizing your opportunity I guess what [921] I'm trying to say is you are not [923] dedicating yourself to anything and if [925] you don't dedicate yourself to anything [927] you are by definition dedicating [929] yourself to nothing it is better to [931] dedicate yourself to something because [933] the way that it works at least in my [934] automation agency the second that I [936] dedicated myself to a particular Nation [938] a particular way of doing [939] business it's not necessarily that like [942] I made the right bet it's not like we [944] were paying uh I don't know a roulette [946] or something like that and then I happen [948] to pick the right number card or however [949] the hell you play roulette I don't [950] actually know I've never played Roulette [952] in my life bad example it's not like you [956] putting all your money on a specific [958] thing right [959] uh or or picking a specific lot of [961] number and then just happens to work the [962] truth is when you commit to something [964] you literally alter the universe's [966] probability of that thing being a good [967] pick I don't mean this in some sort of [969] wishy-washy way I mean if you were to [972] hypothetically right now commit to being [975] a B2B Growth Company that works [977] exclusively with manufacturing [979] businesses um to generate them you know [982] a 5 to 10x Roi in the first 30 days with [985] their money back if you commit to that [987] the likelihood that that actually be [988] becomes a good Niche to pick it goes up [991] 100% it's almost like if you if you if [993] you offer somebody a guarantee or [994] something if you if you put your ass on [996] the line if you tell somebody hey I [998] guarantee you I'll deliver these results [1000] and if um I don't I'll give you your [1002] money back it's like if you were to [1003] offer a guarantee versus not offer a [1006] guarantee in which of those two [1007] circumstances do you think you would [1009] work harder in which of those two [1010] circumstances do you think realistically [1012] you would have a higher likelihood of [1013] achieving the thing that you just [1014] guaranteed the person I'll tell you what [1016] it's not in the world where you don't [1017] offer the guarantee obviously it's in [1020] the world where you put your ass on the [1021] line AKA it's in the world where you [1022] commit right AKA it's in the world where [1024] you dedicate yourself to something I [1026] think you could probably extend this [1028] concept in many different parts of life [1030] you could extend this to relationships [1031] the person that is willing to uh uh [1033] commit to a relationship probably has a [1035] higher likelihood of that relationship [1036] working out than a person who's [1038] constantly just searching for options [1039] you could probably you could probably [1042] see it in in many other Realms uh [1044] knowledge education um skill Mastery [1047] skill development I mean I can think of [1049] 10 or or 15 off the top of my head but [1051] I'll leave it there for brevity [1053] essentially um you know if if you are [1056] not afraid to commit to a specific [1059] thing um the likelihood of you achieving [1061] that thing will go way up and in my case [1063] you know because I was doing everything [1065] for everybody and therefore doing [1066] nothing for for for nobody for quite a [1068] while um I didn't really get to take [1070] advantage of that when I started being [1071] the the B2B growth guy when I started [1073] being the B2B growth cold email Guy when [1075] I started being the B2B growth cold [1076] email guy that works primarily with [1077] businesses that make between 50 to 100K [1079] a month that are located in the United [1081] States you know every Everything [1083] Everything shot way up and I also just [1085] want to make one one more caveat to that [1087] um one other mistake that I made pretty [1090] early on was just consuming the wrong [1092] sort of content and that content just [1095] messed with my head for quite a while so [1098] one final thing that I'll mention here [1099] in terms of like the the biggest [1101] mistakes running my AI automation agency [1103] um are that I didn't really realize it [1106] but the people I mean I know it sounds [1108] really dumb but the people that are in [1110] your life are ultimately the same people [1112] that you will emulate and you will [1113] borrow behaviors and thought patterns [1115] from and in my case when I was running [1117] my AI automation agency I had a lot of [1119] people in my life and a lot of um [1121] content creators in my life people that [1123] I was watching and listening to that uh [1126] they they were basically like like Trend [1128] uh shiny object syndrome hype jump on [1131] people that would just look at like the [1133] the next beautiful shiny object thing [1134] the next three or four-letter acronym uh [1137] business right like AI AA or smma or [1139] ABCD or whatever the hell right uh and [1142] then they jump on it be like wow you [1143] know so much potential here so so much [1145] growth I uh I picked up a lot of bad [1148] habits from from shiny object people I [1150] would say and it wasn't until I got to [1153] distance myself from that and just [1154] really be on my own for a little while [1156] and just figure figure my own stuff out [1157] I would say that uh my automation agency [1159] began to grow um yeah that that that was [1163] a really big thing for me like when I [1165] was doing the AI automation stuff there [1167] was um when I was when I was at the peak [1169] of operating my agency there were a [1172] million and one people talking past me [1174] every 5 minutes talking about how you [1176] know you need to be delegating uh you [1178] need to be growing an email list you [1180] need to be doing this you need to be [1181] doing that you need to be doing that if [1182] I tried to say yes to all of those [1184] things and actually like take all of [1185] that at face value I never would have [1187] gotten anywhere it's true that that [1189] worked for the people that were [1190] recommending that I do things or the [1192] content creators that were telling me [1193] that I should have but ultimately at the [1195] end of the day like I have my own [1197] preconceptions I have my own ways of [1199] doing things I have my own behaviors and [1201] I also had my own intention which is [1202] that I was going to operate my business [1203] in that very particular way um and like [1206] we just talked about me setting my [1207] intention in the world improves the [1208] probability I'll achieve the thing that [1209] I want to achieve not necessarily that [1211] I'll achieve the thing that other people [1212] want me to achieve so that was pretty [1214] big definitely big some strategic [1216] mistakes that I made um probably the [1219] biggest strategic mistake I made was [1220] just not keeping track of my expenses I [1222] signed up to like a number of TRS and [1224] stuff like that for software products [1225] that ended up ballooning and costing me [1226] way too much money um a very notorious [1229] one for this and this is going to date [1230] the video a little bit but it was Google [1232] workspace so if you find yourself [1234] subscribed to Google workspace these [1236] guys I'm not going to say anything ill [1238] about them or their mothers but uh they [1240] know what they're doing for sure when [1244] you sign up to a go workspace account [1246] they basically subscribe you on one of [1247] the highest tiers possible and then [1249] they'll tell you that you're on a trial [1250] and that eventually you'll be build so [1252] just make sure to double check and and [1254] and you know change the plan but the [1256] vast majority of people completely [1257] forget and they never do so at one point [1259] I'd signed up to God knows how many [1261] mailboxes you know probably 50 or 100 or [1263] something and ended up with just like a [1264] bunch of thousand a month bills and that [1267] was not a good time for me when that [1269] came in the good news is you know a lot [1271] of the time you can ask for a refund or [1272] get some sort of partial refund so it's [1273] not the end of the world but um yeah I [1276] remember like just not really keeping [1277] track of my expenses not really knowing [1279] the amount of money that was coming in [1280] and out of my bank account if you [1281] contrast that with now what I will do [1283] literally every morning is I will open [1285] up all of the bank accounts for my [1286] businesses and I will manually move over [1289] every transaction or line item on every [1292] bank account to my own spreadsheet [1294] you'll probably say Nick that sounds [1296] insane what the hell are you doing all [1298] this for doesn't that take forever first [1300] of all it doesn't really take forever I [1302] realistically have like 15 transactions [1303] a day that I need to move over copying [1305] and pasting 15 transactions from one tab [1307] to the next takes like 3 minutes I know [1309] because I time it every morning but [1310] second of all the purpose is not the [1312] amount of time it takes for me to do it [1313] the purpose is to constantly have [1314] awareness as to my inflows and outflows [1317] and so that if there is a mistake I can [1318] catch it within a day and it just [1320] reenters my mind constantly on the thing [1323] that actually matters in business which [1324] is making money so that was a pretty big [1327] tactical error another big tactical [1329] error that I made like a massive mistake [1330] and boy these are really flowing now was [1332] um uh not asking for my money I know [1335] this sounds really simple but it's hell [1337] of a tactical mistake and a lot of [1338] beginners really struggle with just [1340] saying hey I've done the project i' like [1344] my money now so the reality is paying [1348] you is the worst part of any client's [1351] life and so you just need to get it in [1353] your head that you you need to push and [1356] make sure that you get paid before [1357] anything else okay I can't tell you how [1360] many times I had several thousands of [1362] dollars maybe maybe 10 maybe $ 15,000 [1364] outstanding that I was supposed to have [1366] in my bank account that I did not have [1368] simply because I was too afraid to ask [1371] the client upfront bluntly hey do you [1373] mind paying that invoice that I sent you [1374] four weeks ago and I followed up with [1376] every week since right another thing is [1379] a lot of the time people are so afraid [1382] to sign the deal or whatever that [1384] they'll like to to get the payment that [1386] they'll assume that a deal is closed [1388] before the invoice has actually been [1390] paid or before that the transfer has [1392] been made in reality a big tactical [1395] mistake I made was assuming that I [1396] closed the deal before I got the money [1398] because probably 30% of the deals that [1400] IID assumed I had closed I didn't [1402] actually closed there was some issue [1404] they ended up not wanting to pay me or [1405] they found some other service provider [1407] or whatever another big mistake I I uh [1409] Learned was that agreements mean [1411] basically jack [ __ ] in small to [1414] mediumsized businesses if your project [1416] sizes are on average less than [1418] $25,000 agreements don't matter [1420] especially in a digital world I can't [1421] tell you how many times I've had and [1423] this wasn't was specifically with my [1424] automation agency this did happen uh [1426] twice but I can't tell you how many [1428] times I've had situations where you know [1430] you deliver some sort of service and [1432] then you've done all the work and [1434] incurred all of the costs and stuff and [1436] because the client you are invoicing is [1437] paying you after the project is done you [1440] are currently at a negative and then for [1442] whatever reason their business either [1443] defaults or they try and Sherk you or [1446] whatever they don't pay I can't tell you [1448] how many times I've had conversations [1449] with people that like oh well you should [1450] sue them you should go after them you [1452] should send them threatening legal [1453] letters well let me tell you the truth [1455] is I have and it hasn't done anything [1457] ever okay I've had situations where [1460] people have owed hundreds of thousands [1461] of dollars to the companies that have [1462] owned and or worked for and it doesn't [1464] do anything because those payments [1466] individually were like five ,000 bucks [1468] here 10,000 bucks here 3,500 bucks there [1472] the cold hard truth is if you're working [1474] a digital business in the [1476] 2020s there are so many local and [1479] Regional uh [1481] provincial uh you know laws and [1483] regulations and [1485] stipulations that if I'm working with [1487] some dude in Ohio and he didn't pay his [1491] $1,500 invoice for a project that I did [1493] in 5 hours it's actually more worth my [1495] time to take all the time I would have [1497] spent emailing him and fing up with him [1499] and hassling him and trying to get that [1500] money it's more worth me to just take [1503] that time and then spend it on acquiring [1505] a new customer for $1,500 that doesn't [1508] suck I can't tell you how many people [1509] fundamentally misunderstand this don't [1511] get caught up in like the oh this guy [1513] owes me 2,500 bucks like obviously [1514] follow up you know set like a follow-up [1516] sequence that like spams this dude or [1518] agency or chick or whatever like 10 [1520] times over the course of the next like [1521] month and a half okay every two weeks [1523] hey just wanted to check in about this I [1524] know it's been a really long time but I [1525] need to have this sorted just just set [1527] some want to do that for you of course [1529] right that's very very low uh High [1531] leverage just in case in the OB chance [1533] they do but if they don't like don't let [1535] it don't let it uh keep you up at night [1537] you can't really sue somebody for like a [1539] $2,000 project and then be better off to [1543] be honest um until you get to the point [1545] where you're talking like five figures [1546] and even even five figure projects still [1548] like 50,000 880,000 100,000 even then [1551] you're just kind of at the middle ground [1552] between it like making sense and not the [1554] reality is if you're watching this video [1556] and if you've made it to this point [1557] you're probably ious and consistent and [1560] and tenacious enough um to make more [1562] money and intelligent enough and you [1563] know enough to make more money just like [1565] going after new clients than trying to [1567] follow up on people that might know you [1568] a little bit um so my yeah my Earnest [1570] recommendation to you is just don't [1572] sweat it I remember one time where uh I [1575] was running my content writing agency [1577] and we were working with this great guy [1578] uh he he was awesome and he was under [1581] the impression that we weren't using AI [1582] for a content and I believe I had I [1586] believe I had told him or I had I had uh [1589] implied or I had asked him how he felt [1591] about Ai and content and stuff like that [1594] and he said something along the lines of [1596] like oh you know that's okay you know I [1598] don't really think a content's that bad [1599] you know it's perfectly fine this is [1601] right around the time the chat gbt came [1602] out and everybody was really worried [1604] about like the AI generated scores for [1606] for Content or whatnot so I was using AI [1609] to fulfill his content and so uh you [1612] know I told him okay cool so to be clear [1614] what's important to you is that the AI [1615] generated scores are below a certain [1616] number and he's like yes and I'm like [1618] okay okay great so I consistently made [1619] it so that the AI generated scores were [1621] below a specific number then one day he [1623] used a different AI um like an AI [1626] validator score tool and all these tools [1629] are total BS but he used one of them [1631] that like said the score was 83% or [1634] something and at that point he had owed [1636] me [1637] $122,000 and he didn't he didn't pay the [1640] $112,000 I remember being so furious [1643] with him for like 5 minutes it took me 5 [1646] minutes to be like I can't believe this [1648] guy I'm going to assume I'm going to get [1649] all my money back $112,000 all you know [1651] all he cared about was the AI score I [1653] did everything he asked I used the [1654] platform he asked he just used a random [1656] platform I'm gonna I'm going to send [1657] letters to his house and stuff that that [1659] was minute five a minute Zero by minute [1661] five I was like all right I'm probably [1663] not going to get that money back so I [1665] might as well move on and just get new [1666] customers uh aside from now I haven't [1668] thought about that guy in you know the [1670] better part of better part of like a [1671] couple years realistically and he's a [1673] cool guy we just obviously happen to [1674] have that disagreement there's obviously [1675] no way in hell I'm ever going to get [1677] that money back so God bless his soul um [1680] I guess the point that I'm making is if [1681] you adopt that sort of approach it's [1682] much more effective than if you just let [1683] it eat you up inside the reality is [1685] there there really are like no hard well [1688] this is what make me sound evil it's not [1690] that there are no hard right or wrongs [1691] in business it's just that you need to [1693] operate under the idea that or under the [1695] notion that nobody has a moral compass [1697] and if you operate under the notion that [1698] nobody has a moral compass and if you [1700] just assume and expect that the people [1701] that you are working with do not um you [1703] will perform substantially better as a [1704] business so that was a really big [1707] tactical mistake that I made trying to [1708] follow up with people for money and just [1710] wasting a ton of my [1711] time um another really big thing uh that [1714] I screwed up on was I hired some very [1716] inexperienced developers so um you know [1719] when you're a new AI automation agency [1720] and you're told constantly hey you need [1722] to hire you need to hire you need to [1723] hire you need to hire obviously [1724] eventually you're going to try taking [1725] one of them up on it you'll be like all [1726] right I should probably hire but the [1728] issue is you know when you're new you [1730] probably don't have that much money [1731] right and so what you're going to do is [1732] you're going to start looking for deals [1734] well what I've come to realize is it's [1735] very difficult to get a good deal on a [1737] person okay [1738] it makes me [1740] sound makes me sound really doubly bad [1743] yeah you can't get a good deal on people [1744] these days but you really can't okay you [1746] really can't um if you try and cut $300 [1750] a month off of the salary of the person [1752] and you make a decision to choose the [1754] person that's cheaper uh but that maybe [1756] is a little bit less experienced but you [1757] figure you'll train them if if if you do [1760] this the vast majority of the time [1761] you're going to you're going to lose way [1763] more than the $300 or $500 a month that [1765] you save by hiring that person as [1766] opposed to somebody more expensive and [1767] more skilled [1768] cuz hiring is just so damn difficult [1771] it's so dang hard to get right it is the [1774] big thing that makes a like like a [1775] successful thriving company a company [1777] it's the big skill to learn if you want [1779] to make like a you know $100 million a [1780] month sort of of of Empire [1784] and it's just way too hard really for [1786] for me at least to wrap my head around [1788] at the low levels um and so every time [1790] that I've tried to hire people that are [1791] unskilled I've always just been majorly [1792] disappointed I'll usually hire somebody [1794] that's unskilled or you know that has [1795] some middling level of skill but like [1797] doesn't really understand how to do job [1798] and I've done this multiple times for [1799] left click from my automation agency and [1800] from my content writing company I'll get [1802] a good deal on them and I'll think oh [1803] man first month I'm already up 500 bucks [1805] and then by month two they'll have [1807] burned me on $5,000 worth of projects [1809] and I will be out 4,500 bucks you know [1813] what I mean not to mention all the time [1815] and energy that I spend training them so [1817] you know if if if I could really sum [1819] summarize that mistake it would be don't [1821] hire inexperienced people push your bar [1825] for when you think you need to hire like [1827] twice as high as you actually think um [1830] that it is like if you think you need to [1831] hire at 10,000 bucks a month don't hire [1833] at 20,000 bucks a month instead focus on [1835] Building Systems that enable you to get [1837] to 20,000 bucks a month without hiring [1839] because then when you do hire at 20,000 [1841] bucks a month you'll be able to hire [1842] people that are substantially more [1843] experienced and then when you combine [1845] people that are substantially more [1846] experienced with your really good [1848] systems that are now super dialed in and [1850] optimized well now the next time you [1851] hire you won't have to hire until [1852] they're at 70 or 880,000 bucks a month [1854] you know um yeah I mean I made it to [1857] 72,000 buckss [1858] uh per month with literally one VA I [1860] mean it was me and it was a VA and the [1862] VA did you know a fair amount of work [1863] don't get me wrong it was full-time [1864] hours well uh 30 whatever hours a week [1867] on average but like the reason why that [1870] worked was because we sold super [1871] scalable offers uh we had like a good [1873] recuring service um you know I I [1876] received some deposits uh that I was [1878] waiting on I I I had uh multiple months [1880] come in I had a lot of people um um come [1884] in because of a particularly successful [1885] cold email campaign I guess the point [1887] that I'm making is is like don't don't [1890] worry too much about [1892] hiring especially today because the [1895] likelihood that you'll be able to use [1896] that hire for more than a few years just [1898] given our technology going is going is [1900] really low and then the likelihood that [1902] you're going to get hiring right on the [1903] first go if you're a new AI automation [1905] agency is also very low so look for [1908] automated Alternatives however possible [1910] I mean you are an automation specialist [1911] after all okay I can tell this video is [1914] getting a little bit long and I do have [1915] an appointment that I got to get to so [1916] I'm gon I'm gonna call it there [1918] hopefully you guys found a lot of value [1919] in that and listening to me yap on um [1921] full face wasn't super boring I'd love [1923] it if you guys have had any similar [1924] experiences to what I talked about here [1926] if you just drop a comment down below [1927] I'd love to hear them you know me I read [1928] every comment I'm more than happy to get [1930] back to you if you guys have any [1931] questions about anything I talked about [1932] let me know um if you could do me a big [1934] solid like subscribe do all the fun [1935] YouTube stuff try and get me to the top [1937] of the algo I'm doing a lot of numbers [1939] on YouTube recently and it's all thanks [1940] to the lovely people that make it to the [1942] end I'd really appreciate it and yeah I [1945] guess I'll just see you on the next [1946] video thanks so much for your time take [1947] care bye

Title: $2.4M of Prompt Engineering Hacks in 53 Mins (GPT, Claude)
[0] here is 6 years of prompt Engineering in [1] just 53 minutes I started working with [3] AI back in 2019 using gpd2 and since [6] then I built a number of successful [8] service and Consulting businesses the [9] first that did 92,000 bucks a month the [11] second that did $72,000 a month and my [14] current which just did $139,000 last [16] month so I know how to build prompts for [18] business purposes and the goal of this [19] video is just to dump my brain and give [21] it to you I want to give you everything [22] that I know about prompt Engineering in [24] as quick and as compressed a format as [26] possible if you don't know me my name is [27] Nick and my whole thing is cut in the [28] fluff so let's get into it so we're [30] going to be doing this whiteboard style [31] I'm going to be covering both very deep [33] foundational underpinnings of how llms [35] work and I'm also going to be covering [36] some more tactical actionable advice for [39] beginners and novices um so we're going [41] to have a good blend of both the very [42] first thing that I want to cover right [44] off the bat and this is this will [45] immediately improve your ability to [47] prompt engineer is instead of using the [49] consumer models use the playground or [52] workbench versions of these [54] models so if you're [56] unfamiliar to keep a to make a long [58] story short this is Chachi BT this is [61] the consumer model this is what open aai [63] the big artificial intelligence company [65] is marketing to people and selling for a [67] monthly subscription because this is a [69] consumer model they've made a bunch of [71] decisions to try and optimize [73] performance for the widest number of [74] people those decisions include they [77] actually insert a bunch of stuff into [78] your prompt that you can't see and that [80] you don't know about so if you really [82] want to get good at prompt engineering [83] you need to stop using the consumer [85] models okay stop using chat GPT stop [87] using Claud and instead start using [90] their API playground or workbench models [93] so this is chat [95] GPT this is platform. open.com [99] playground chat and as we see here [102] there's a lot more that we can [103] manipulate on the right hand side we [105] have a variety of uh different tools we [108] can select model types we can select [110] response formats we can add functions we [113] can configure our models with Randomness [115] temperature max tokens stop sequences [118] top P frequency penalty and presence [120] penalties if you don't know what all [121] this stuff is don't worry too much about [123] it right now in addition you also get to [125] insert your own system message and then [127] you have the choice of being able to add [129] user or assistant messages too so I [132] guess the point I'm making to make a [133] long story short is this is really where [134] you get into the engineering side of [136] prompt engineering if all you're doing [137] is communicating with the bass you know [139] Claude Haiku or Sonet um or the chat GPT [142] model you're just leaving a lot on the [143] table so right off the GetGo if you [145] could take one thing out of this video [146] it's just move over to the API [148] playground versions you're going to have [149] a lot more juice that you could squeeze [150] the second thing I want to talk about is [152] that model performance a lot of people [154] don't fully understand this but model [156] performance decreases with prompt [159] length so there's [162] actually a hack that you can do to [165] immediately boost the quality of all of [167] your outputs and that's just make your [169] prompt shorter this is a graph here that [172] shows a variety of models and their [174] abilities to reason AKA do some task [177] over the length of the input text input [180] text in this case is obviously just like [182] your prompt okay so what are we seeing [185] here just to break this down right most [187] people are probably more familiar with [188] GPT for Gemini Pro than they are with [191] mistol and stuff like that so maybe just [192] focus on the green and then the purple [194] and I mean the Green's the highest [195] performance maybe we'll just focus on [196] that what we see happen basically is [199] that when the input length is [201] 250 accuracy is almost one one means you [204] know it gets basically everything right [206] so it's like 0 N9 or something okay and [208] then the second that we add more okay we [211] see like basically neutral or maybe a [213] slight elevation or something between [215] 250 to 500 but basically everything [217] after that we see a decrease and it just [220] continues decreasing the entire way [222] through okay so in this case it's a mile [225] decrease between 250 and 3,000 um right [228] I mean if I could quantify this probably [229] be like 0.4 or something 0.04 sorry [233] which is probably like a 4% decrease on [235] the Chain of Thought reasoning um but if [237] we're using like the basic model gp4 [239] this is the normal thing that you that [240] you'll call Performance goes down almost [242] 20% right which is pretty [245] crazy so what does this mean well a [247] quick and easy hack that you can do to [249] improve the quality of your outputs is [250] literally just make your prompts shorter [253] now you need to also consider that um [256] you know the more examples you provide [257] an a model the more context you provide [259] an a model it also tends to perform [261] better so what I'm what I'm not telling [262] you to do is to remove all of the rules [265] and instructions that you're giving the [266] model instead what I'm telling you to do [269] is take the same information and shrink [271] it basically improve the information [274] density of the instructions that you're [276] providing okay this concept in [279] English is called [281] AO obfuscation espo elucidation and the [286] reason why it's written like this is [287] It's supp supposed to be kind of a joke [289] right this just means keep it simple [291] stupid but the person that wrote it [292] decided to write it in an [293] extraordinarily verbose way just to show [296] you how silly it is to write in a way [298] that's more complicated than normal Al [300] to make this actionable I'm actually [301] going to run you guys through a real [302] example where I pair down and break down [304] a very verbose prompt into basically [307] something that says the same thing just [308] in like a tenth of the words so I have [310] my playground open over here I've added [312] a system message that says you're a [313] helpful intelligent assistant this is [315] just my goto and I have a very long and [318] annoying prompt over here all about [319] content creation I'm going to run you [321] through it but I'm going to do so using [322] a tool called wordcounter.net I paste it [325] all in there and I'm also going to open [326] up another wordcounter.net so that I can [328] edit this in um a subsequent page you [331] guys could see the impact on the length [334] so right now this prompt is 674 words [337] okay for informational purposes uh a [340] word is about 1.3 tokens or so uh [343] meaning that uh a token is about7 words [346] this is probably somewhere around 800 or [348] so tokens okay if we go back to our [349] graph here you know 800 or so tokens is [352] already a almost 5% reduction in [355] accuracy so if we can get this to around [357] 250 tokens instead of 800 if we can cut [359] this by a third realistically we're [361] gaining about 5% accuracy or quality [364] right off the bat and that's going to be [365] our goal all right so how would I [366] actually go about pairing this down well [368] I'm going to save you guys the um [370] bleeding eyes from reading this whole [373] thing essentially what I'm doing is I'm [375] asking this thing to produce some [376] content for me we're doing it in a very [378] verbose way for instance it says prompt [379] for high quality engaging and insightful [381] content creation we could remove that [383] completely primary objective and overall [385] goal of this content request well really [388] primary objective is a same I'm just [390] going to say objective it delivers 99% [392] of the same meaning but we do it in [394] tenth of the words and in fact we don't [395] even need objective because we're about [397] to tell the model what we want it to do [399] and it's sort of implicit in us talking [401] to a model that obviously the objective [403] is what I'm about to tell you okay the [404] overarching aim of this content [406] generation request is to produce an [407] exceptionally well structured highly [408] informative deeply engaging and [410] action-oriented piece of content that [411] lines perfectly with the expectations [413] needs and desires of my specific target [414] audience wow does that sound super deep [417] and well thought out well it's not good [419] prompts don't look like this good [420] prompts are much much simpler so remove [424] this all and say your task is to produce [426] high quality content the final content [430] should not only provide value in the [431] form of information but should also [432] serve as Authority well research and [434] compelling resource that the reader or [435] viewer of this video based can rely for [437] accurate insightful and practical [439] knowledge high [441] quality [443] authoritative [445] content the content must be structured [447] in a way that ensures optimal [448] readability maximum clar in logical flow [450] being an effortless for the audience to [452] digest and implement the concepts being [453] discussed should also avoid this part's [455] funny excessive fluff or unnecessary [457] tangents that do not contribute to the [458] reader's overall understanding of the [459] subject matter your task is to produce [462] high quality authoritative [464] content that is readable clear and [467] avoids excessive fluff awesome so we [471] have delivered the exact same message [473] we've done so in about 200 or 300 fewer [477] words okay audience understand the [480] people this content must resonate with [482] let's get rid of [484] that your [486] audience [488] is entrepreneurs and business [493] owners it looks like individuals who [495] active engage running businesses [496] particularly those focus on automation [498] so entrepreneurs and business owners who [500] care about automation scalability I [502] don't know that seems kind of vague to [503] me and operational efficiency I'll say [506] Automation and operations [509] you're also writing for technical [512] professionals let's say Consultants [515] because odds are they are probably [516] technical professionals if they are [518] among the first [520] group and then time conscious efficiency [522] driven [524] individuals I don't really know exactly [526] what that means but to me it sounds like [527] fluff so I'm going to get rid of it [528] given that the audience consists of [529] Highly capable intelligent professionals [531] the tone style and depth as content must [532] be appropriately aligned to match their [533] expectations avoid condescending [535] simplifications but also ensure that [536] even complex concepts are articulated in [538] a way that remains accessible [541] so write access write in an [545] accessible manner perfect okay [550] guidelines so we could actually get rid [552] of this whole section to ensure the [553] generated content achieves the highest [554] possible standard of quality depth and [556] Clarity we just say guidelines [560] okay use a [564] direct and Ampersand instead of A and D [567] tone of voice [570] avoid excessive casualness well that's [572] what direct and pragmatic means [573] unnecessary humor well that's what [575] direct and pragmatic means storytelling [577] well this actually seems kind of [578] necessary or new so I'll say avoid [581] storytelling unless a story serves to [584] reinforce a key [586] Insight writing should be clear concise [589] and free of unnecessary jargon well I [590] kind of already suggested that given my [594] previous instruction so I can just get [595] rid of this [598] completely okay the content should be [600] defined divided into well-defined [601] sections each marked by appropriate [602] headings and [603] subheadings so use headings and [607] subheadings that's [609] easy use headings subheadings and bullet [614] points numbered lists and clear [617] formatting elements very cool Ur a [619] logical progression from one section to [621] the next well if it's high quality [622] authoritative content that's readable [623] clear and avoids excessive fluff odds [625] are we're already going to have that [627] okay depth detail and level of technical [631] rigor the content must we could just get [634] rid of that complete and just say go [635] beyond surface level insights and [636] generic [637] advice it should provide unique specific [640] and highly actionable information that [641] differentiates it from lower quality [642] content available elsewhere we can just [644] get rid of that that is [646] embedded this is also [650] embedded and this was already suggested [653] over here so we just get rid of that [656] okay do you guys kind of see how this is [658] working we've already cut this down to [660] 250ish tokens from previously uh which [664] what I believe was like closer to 800 or [666] something like that so just in me going [669] through this prompt line by line and [671] removing the excessive verbosity it's [673] called I've already improved the quality [675] of its outputs by approximately 5% [677] obviously this depends on the specific [678] model that you're using but this is one [681] of the funnest games in prompt [682] engineering you're given a prompt that [684] maybe a company has been using for their [686] model and your whole job is just take [688] that thing make it 30% shorter and [690] improve the quality of your outputs [691] automatically by 5% so you can see you [693] can get very far with just a few minutes [696] the third tip I'm going to give you is [699] understand the different prompt types [701] there are system user and assistant [704] prompts and these prompts are basically [708] just the go-to for for all um large [711] language models at this point probably [712] going to remain so for a while so if I [714] go back to my chat GPT playground [716] example not that page this one over here [719] and and actually if I just let's make [721] this a little bit more Dynamic let's [723] grab [724] my prompt that I've painstakingly edited [728] over here let me just add this plus [730] button okay now what I'm doing is I'm [732] embedding a system prompt which is at a [735] high level simply how the model [738] identifies so this is who am I right [742] imagine you just turned [744] on the IR robot [747] okay you just turned on this [752] puppy and it's asking who am I all the [757] system prompt is is it's you answering [759] that question oh you're a helpful [760] intelligent assistant oh you're a an [763] email writing assistant oh you're a [766] customer help desk assistant oh you are [769] a paperclip optimization maximizer who [772] will certain and convert us all into [773] aluminum right you are you are just [775] providing it simple straightforward [777] instructions a very general one that you [778] can use for most purposes you're a [780] helpful gen uh helpful intelligence [781] assistant that works just fine we're [784] saying that it's helpful because we want [785] it to be helpful we're also saying it's [786] intelligent because we obviously wanted [787] to like select an intelligent um you [790] know an an intelligent [792] example after that though what we have [794] is we have the user prompt so we always [796] start with the system okay and I always [798] recommend defining it [799] explicitly then the user prompt okay the [802] user prompt is where you actually tell [804] the model what it is you want it to do [806] and there's a specific structure within [808] a user prompt that I will run you guys [809] through later but for now just know that [811] this is where you provide the actual [812] instruction to the model okay now the [814] next sort of prompt is What's called the [816] assistant prompt if I were [817] hypothetically just to press this button [819] right now well it's not hypothetical [820] because I just did it what's going to [822] happen is I just told the model to write [824] me an article about birds and bees right [826] I didn't say write it about birds and [828] bees you know I talked about doing it in [829] the context of automation so let's see [831] what it does birds and bees key insights [833] and analogies for business automation [834] operations the birds and bees typically [836] evokes blah blah blah blah okay great so [838] we're writing [839] we're writing a bunch of stuff about [841] birds and bees and how they can inform [842] us as to how business Works what I have [845] now is we got the user prompt the system [847] prompt up here the user prompt up here [848] but now we've actually inserted an [850] additional assistant prompt the output [852] of the model the thing that it just [853] generated for us is now actually an [855] additional part of our prompt called the [857] assistant and most people think well [859] this is just the output of the model [860] right I can't really do anything with [861] this and here's where you're wrong well [863] what you can do is you can actually use [864] this as an example to inform the model [868] whether or not what it just did is good [870] and then use that as a template for [872] future outputs okay what I mean is what [874] if hypothetically what if I said [876] fantastic work now I want you to do the [880] same thing but do it for an article on [884] stor delivery I don't know I'm just [885] making stuff up at this point what I'm [887] doing now is I'm actually feeding in [890] this prompt this prompt and this prompt [892] along with my n with my second user [895] prompt and what I'm doing is I'm [897] implicitly reinforcing that did a great [899] job on the last piece AK I wanted to do [901] the same thing or I wanted to take a [903] similar concept or similar approach uh [906] in order to do you know the next piece [908] too and what we can see is you know we [910] basically took the exact same structure [912] and format then we just copy and pasted [914] it with this new uh you know with this [916] new with this new idea the stor delivery [918] as opposed to birds and Beast now the [920] reason why I bring this up is because [921] this is at core at the core of all [923] advanced prompting which I'm going to [925] get into now um but understanding how [927] system user and assistant prompts work [928] in concert and this this works across [930] all major large language models as the [932] time of this video including Claude [933] including you know uh deep seek and so [935] on and so forth understanding how that [937] works under the hood is going to be [939] critical in US developing higher level [940] and more effective prompts the fourth [941] tip I want to talk about is to use one [945] or few shot [947] prompting now for those of you that [949] don't know one few zero shot all these [954] terms that you may may not have heard [955] these just refer to the number of [956] examples in the prompt if if I run you [959] guys through another little piece of uh [961] of Academia here this was a study that [963] was done a while ago on the performance [965] of large language models across the [968] number of examples they were given to [970] fulfill a specific task and what I want [972] you guys to see here is that there are [974] three categories there's few shot one [978] shot and then zero shot zero shot is [980] blue and it always performs the worst F [983] shot is orange and it always performs [985] the best and right now I just want you [986] guys to take a look at just the distance [989] in accuracy scores between this few shot [993] and one shot if we go all the way to [994] 175b that's about the size of um some of [997] the simpler GPT models you know gpt3 GPT [1000] 3.5 uh because the study was in a couple [1002] years ago and technology has improved [1003] drastically my inclination is you know [1005] we're probably I don't know if it's like [1007] 400b now this trend is probably the same [1010] although you know a lot of these models [1012] are now totally behind closed doors you [1014] can't really see so I think that this [1015] trend is even better than it is now but [1017] but like let's just take a look at this [1019] if we just extrapolate backwards this is [1021] somewhere around 40% accuracy right this [1024] is almost 60% accuracy meaning that [1027] there's an accuracy gap of 20% between [1029] zero shot and few shot okay but that's [1031] not actually the important thing what I [1032] want you guys to actually look at is [1034] notice how the dis the difference in [1035] accuracy between zero shot and one shot [1038] is greater than the distance in accuracy [1040] or the difference in accuracy between [1041] one shot and few shot this is like [1045] 10% this is like [1047] 7% this brings to a very important point [1050] that very few people know about that's [1052] that if you insert just one example into [1055] your prompt you will gain a massive [1058] disproportionate Improvement in accuracy [1061] that out Shadows if you were to add [1063] let's say 30 to your prompt I think um [1065] this F shot specific study uh was [1067] something like 20 and N is equal to 20 [1069] examples so the distance between zero [1070] and one was like a time and a half the [1073] distance between 1 and 20 and if you [1075] think about it considering now that we [1077] know what we know about the length of an [1079] input and then the um accuracy [1082] Improvement as a result of shorter and [1084] shorter inputs we can actually see a [1086] trend here if we only insert one prompt [1088] or one example in our prompt the [1092] accuracy will be as high as humanly [1094] possible because the prompt itself will [1095] be short and then we're also going to [1096] get a massive boost in accuracy because [1099] of how we structured our examples here [1103] okay so this takes me to an important [1105] point about user assistant prompts which [1106] I'll run you guys through in a moment [1107] but essentially I guess what I'm trying [1108] to say is this is The Sweet Spot this is [1110] like the gravy this is where you want to [1111] uh sorry not here this is the gravy you [1114] can tell I had to re-record this video [1115] twice now cuz been droning on for like [1117] two hours uh my OBS incense just broke [1120] unfortunately so I I finished it now I [1122] got to come back and do it again but [1123] whatever maybe I'm just smoother now um [1126] so so this one shot uh plus you know [1130] what we know about keeping prompt length [1132] as short assumingly possible this is [1133] really like the goldilock zone and this [1135] is really where you want to be as often [1137] as possible so my recommend [1139] for anything Mission critical always use [1141] at least one prompt where at least one [1144] example to coers the model into [1147] providing you a more accurate result the [1149] fifth tip I want to provide is this [1150] notion of conversational [1153] engines versus knowledge engine [1157] okay what do I mean by these two [1161] terms [1163] well llms like Chachi BT and Claude [1168] are almost like a human being that's [1171] read a quadrillion Books [1174] Okay so if we got a book here this is my [1177] fantastic super detailed and amazing [1179] drawing of a book so we could see here [1182] I'm quite the artist I'm like the Pao [1184] Picasso kind I think um not saying that [1187] Pablo Picasso wasn't amazing he is for [1189] those the guys that know art don't scw [1191] me uh okay so an llm is just like a [1194] person that's read like a million books [1196] and just like a person that's read a [1197] million books if you went up to that [1198] you're like hey tell me the boiling [1201] point of X oxy pyc Benzene or something [1207] that person may roughly know what the [1210] boiling point is of things that are in a [1211] similar class but they're not going to [1214] know exactly what that is 99.9% of the [1217] time just like a human being llms often [1221] know roughly approximately what a right [1223] answer is just because they've read so [1225] many books they've picked up so many [1226] patterns between Concepts but they don't [1228] know exact facts so llms okay are not [1233] knowledge engines what they are are [1235] conversational [1237] engines you don't use llms to extract [1241] knowledge for the most part unless that [1243] knowledge is very old and very commonly [1246] known instead what you do is use them to [1248] talk use them to have conversations use [1250] them to reason or something introductory [1252] level reasoning still but still [1254] reasoning now contrast this with [1256] something like a database if you you [1258] know I think most of us would probably [1259] use Google Sheets here [1261] right so you know in Google Sheets you [1263] have some sort of column heading so XYZ [1265] a and then you have like the data for [1267] the headings so maybe X is like name or [1269] something to make this a little clearer [1270] and then you know the value here is Nick [1273] um tables and and databases and [1277] encyclopedias okay these are knowledge [1282] engines they essentially know facts but [1285] you can't have conversations with them [1288] right can't have a conversation with an [1290] encyclopedia the cool part about llms [1292] really is when you hook up an [1295] llm to a knowledge [1299] engine and then you basically have [1302] it query that knowledge engine for some [1306] facts or some information okay so llms [1308] on their own like the [1310] GPT whatever series of models these are [1313] conversational engines they don't know [1315] facts and you shouldn't really rely on [1316] them for facts they're going to be very [1318] comp ident because it's just like I [1320] don't know the some dude at the bar [1321] that's like absolutely man I know all [1323] about medieval history from 1864 to 1899 [1327] right medieval history good God uh [1330] that's definitely not medieval history [1331] folks clearly I am a conversational [1333] engine but they're not going to know the [1335] specific facts they're going to be very [1337] confident in explaining these things to [1338] you but unless you actually hook them up [1339] to some sort of external knowledge base [1340] you use something like you know rag [1343] which stands for retrieval augmented [1344] generation which is where you query some [1346] data set using an llm you you ask it to [1349] find you some data return that data and [1353] then have the llm produce the response [1355] okay um you're not actually going to get [1357] like any usable information for the most [1359] part and even if you do you know I I [1361] wouldn't trust it maybe it's right like [1362] 70% of the time for most queries but [1364] that 30% um that means a lot in business [1367] applications right you're never really [1368] going to get somebody to pay you a lot [1370] of money for some sort of business [1371] application if you're wrong 30% of the [1373] time okay speaking of being wrong the [1375] sixth tip I want to give you is to use [1377] completely UNAM uous [1380] language what do I mean by unambiguous [1383] language well unfortunately or [1385] fortunately AI is extraordinarily [1387] creative okay because it's very creative [1390] that means that when you ask AI [1392] something the first time it'll give you [1394] a different answer than if you ask it [1395] the second time and that'll be a [1397] different answer than if you ask it the [1398] third time and a fourth time and a fifth [1400] time and a sixth time okay if I could [1403] just give you guys a quick little [1404] example here if this was like um if you [1406] played one of those games where like I [1408] don't know you have some Zone that you [1409] need to hit or something okay I don't [1412] know maybe you guys have play this at [1412] the arcade or whatever and and basically [1414] there's this little cursor and it goes [1416] ding ding ding and you're supposed to [1418] just like stop it right when it's in the [1420] middle of some little goldilock Zone [1422] well large language models are are very [1424] similar if we have like this little [1426] goldilock Zone here I want you guys to [1427] hypothetically just think about this as [1429] this is the zone of responses that you [1432] want okay this is you know the perfect [1435] output of your prompt it's the the best [1437] ice breaker it's you know the the [1439] perfect report or or whatever basically [1441] the way that large language models work [1443] are you know if you query it the first [1444] time maybe you get a response over here [1447] okay quer it the second time maybe you [1449] get a response over here quer it a third [1451] time maybe you get a response over here [1452] maybe it's only when you query it like [1454] the fourth time that you actually get [1455] the response that you want what you want [1456] to do is you want to you want to you [1458] want to minimize this as much as humanly [1460] possible okay you want to get all of [1462] these as close to that little green zone [1465] as humanly possible and I'll show you a [1467] practical way to do this in just a few [1468] tips um but essentially one of the [1470] simplest ways for you to do this is to [1472] be extraordinarily unambiguous with what [1474] you want okay so to make this practical [1477] um you know a big a big thing a lot of [1480] people will use AI for is it'll you know [1483] you'll ask it to do something like [1484] produce me a report based [1487] on this [1490] data this is what I would call a bad [1493] prompt okay do not do this instead [1498] say list our five most popular [1507] products and write [1510] me a one line or one paragraph let's say [1515] description [1517] this is a better prompt and you get even [1520] better if you say here's an example of a [1522] one paragraph description for another [1525] product okay so why is the first bad and [1528] the second good well I guess it's good [1530] so let's do a check mark the first is [1532] bad because we're just saying producer [1534] report produce is extraordinarily [1537] ambiguous a report is extraordinarily [1540] ambiguous based on this data is also [1543] extraordinarily ambiguous okay ideally [1546] you'd say here is the data you don't [1548] just like make your own inferences about [1549] what to use of this data why is this [1552] good because it's specifically saying [1553] what we want we want you to list five [1555] most popular products like if you [1557] produce a report on some reports it'll [1558] it'll do 10 products and other ones [1560] it'll do two okay it's just kind of up [1562] to like how the model is feeling at the [1563] time but if you hardcode it in and say [1565] you're doing five products in addition [1567] you're writing me a one paragraph [1568] description of each and in addition [1570] here's an example of the formatting well [1571] now what you've done is you've [1572] constrained all possible outputs so that [1576] even if they're not perfect okay what [1579] they are is they're probably a lot [1580] closer to that goldilock zone of [1583] responses that you want instead of being [1585] super crazy spread out now they're at [1587] least like somewhere in the realm of [1589] what you constitute a good response [1591] somewhere in the realm of what a [1592] business might want my seventh tip is a [1594] very quick and easy hack it's just use [1595] the term [1597] Spartan in your tone of voice this is [1600] just one of those extraordinarily simple [1602] things that you can just do in in every [1605] prompt um I just find the term Spartan [1607] is the perfect middle ground in terms of [1609] like being direct and being pragmatic [1611] and then you know offering the model a [1613] little bit of flexibility so for [1614] instance this guideline here I would I [1616] would write use a Spartan tone of voice [1618] I I think before I had um something [1619] different use a direct or or assertive [1621] tone of voice just always say use a [1623] Spartan tone of voice your answers are [1624] just going to be way way better and way [1625] easier all right let's make this data [1627] driven my eighth point is to iterate [1629] your prompts with [1632] data now this is something of a more [1634] nuanced point but it's how you get the [1637] highest quality prompts I see lots of [1639] people in my communities like maker [1641] school which is a day-by-day [1642] accountability program for people that [1644] want to start an automation business [1645] it's something I've been running for uh [1646] quite a few months now a lot of people [1648] in maker School the way that they'll do [1651] their prompt engineering is they'll [1652] spend all night coming up with some [1653] amazing prompt they think it's amazing [1655] anyway and then they'll run it once and [1657] it'll deliver the most amazing output [1659] ever and they're like oh my God I [1660] finally figured it out I found the most [1661] amazing prompt I'm just going to use [1662] this prompt for my business now okay the [1665] thing is do you remember earlier when I [1667] said that we have a range of possible [1669] responses in the model sometimes it's [1671] going to respond over here other times [1673] it's going to respond over here other [1674] times going to respond over here right [1677] odds are when you get a really good [1679] response in a model like 70% of the time [1681] it's just because the model happened to [1683] produce something that was in line with [1685] your expectations but it wasn't [1687] guaranteed to do so it just happened to [1689] do so so if you want to get prompts that [1693] reliably and consistently produce [1695] outputs that are more in line with what [1696] you want what you have to do is you have [1698] to test them and then it's not enough [1699] just to test them once you actually have [1701] to test them using what's called a Monte [1702] Carlo approach where you throw a bunch [1704] of stuff at the wall okay and then [1706] progressively make changes to get it [1708] closer and closer and closer to where [1709] you want so I mean I don't if you guys [1711] ever play darts okay but usually you [1713] have some like dart board and it looks [1714] like this and it's usually different [1715] colors and stuff and they're nice points [1717] and you know like your your goal I think [1719] is you want to throw it like kind of [1720] over here all right so this is ideal [1723] what usually happens is you know you're [1725] drunk as hell you start off playing [1726] darts you never played darts bar you [1727] throw one over here throw another one [1728] over there throw another one over there [1730] throw one over there and you throw [1731] another one over there at the wall and [1732] hit the back of St you know Stacy's head [1734] or something um every time that you [1738] iterate your prompt what you want to [1740] happen is you just want [1742] the I guess total size of this to get [1745] smaller and more constrained so that's [1746] that's route number [1748] two this is route number [1751] three and then ultimately what you want [1753] is you want like a very accurate model [1755] that just consistently delivers you [1757] results in this perfect Zone how you [1760] actually get there is you got to test [1762] and throw a bunch of stuff at the wall [1764] practically what this usually means is [1766] you're going to do something like a [1767] Google sheet okay just like this you're [1770] going to have a prompt on the left hand [1771] side you're going to have the output in [1773] the middle and then you're going to have [1774] another column that I just always call [1776] good [1777] enough and then basically what you do is [1781] okay you grab your um chat gbt [1783] playground in this [1784] case and then what you do is you [1786] generate 10 examples of what you want it [1789] to do okay so for example this was one [1793] on birds and bees let me just delete [1795] this other one so this is this is my my [1798] first article on birds andb so what I do [1799] is I actually paste it in here okay so I [1801] pasted in the entire thing then I delete [1803] it [1804] all and then I do it again and usually [1808] what I'll do is I'll use a no code model [1809] or no code tool something that just does [1811] things way faster um and then I'll just [1813] like do it in the background but you [1815] know this is now like route number two [1817] so I'm going to wait for it to finish [1818] its second output just for the purpose [1819] of this demonstration I won't do any [1821] more but basically after it's done with [1823] number two I will copy all of this into [1828] another row okay uh that's not right [1831] let's actually enter this and then what [1833] I'll do is I grab my prompt okay then [1836] I'll just stick [1838] it on the left hand side on this prompt [1840] column and just because this isn't very [1842] viewable I'm just going to make this way [1844] smaller so we could actually like see [1845] and maybe interpret [1848] this okay so I have two rows on my sheet [1853] here right what I'll do after that is [1855] I'll do like I'll do another um I don't [1857] know I'll do like another 10 or [1858] something like [1860] that uh and you know in my case I'm just [1862] going to do two but um in your case do [1864] do 10 okay and what you do is you will [1868] read through every row and you'll say [1871] hey is this good enough for my business [1873] is this good enough for the thing that I [1874] was hard to do this this good enough for [1876] the use case that I'm building my [1877] automation for maybe this article is [1879] good enough maybe this one isn't okay so [1883] we have one good enough out of two [1885] mathematically one out of two is equal [1887] to 50% %. realistically if I had like 20 [1890] of these or something like that you know [1892] what I would do is I would output 20 and [1893] then I'd go through and I'd read each of [1895] these and I'd ask myself hey this is [1896] good enough and maybe 18 out of 20 are [1898] so if you know 18 out of 20 are then [1901] that's a total of 90% And then what I [1904] would do is I would just test this [1905] against a different prompt so now [1907] instead of me just using my gut feeling [1909] instead of me just having it generate [1910] one thing and me being okay with that [1912] one thing I have to do 20 and now I have [1915] like statistics I basically have like [1916] some some science or some data behind my [1918] answer I'm like oh you know what that [1920] prompt actually beats the other prompt [1921] 19 times out of 20 that prompt actually [1924] beats the first prompt 13 times out of [1926] 20 that prompt actually beats the other [1928] prompt 18 times out of 20 so what am I [1930] going to do I'm going to pick the one [1931] that's 19 times out of 20 and in this [1933] way you get more data driven and every [1935] time you make a change and you run this [1937] test again you actually know hey I'm not [1939] just like throwing the most lucky [1940] bullseye on planet Earth okay I'm [1943] actually statistically testing a big set [1946] of all of these outputs and then I'm [1948] finding which ones have higher accuracy [1950] scores which ones are like more [1952] statistically correlated to the center [1954] of that Circle the ninth tip I want to [1956] give you guys is to define the output [1958] format explicitly okay what do I mean by [1963] explicitly well I mean like there are a [1965] lot of use cases where you're going to [1966] want something like a bulleted list so [1968] actually like say output a bulleted list [1972] that's pretty easy [1973] right but there's a lot more than you [1975] can do than that um you know in instead [1978] what we see a lot of people do nowadays [1979] is we output code blocks so output Json [1982] if you don't know what Json is it's [1983] basically like a um specific JavaScript [1988] notation where you will generate some [1991] curly braces a quote inside of this uh [1994] thing that's encapsulated by quotes you [1995] have the variable or key name then you [1997] have a colon then you have some quotes [1998] around a value then you have another [2000] curly bracket this is a very specific [2003] format that now allows you to integrate [2004] your large language model with code [2006] servers scripts that that sort of stuff [2008] um you know like csvs okay if you want a [2014] a a Google sheet and you want the Google [2016] sheet to say something like uh I don't [2019] know like [2022] month um [2025] Revenue uh [2027] profit you can actually have ai generate [2029] this don't just ask remember how earlier [2031] I I told you guys um that don't just [2034] tell it to produce a report so don't [2036] just say produce [2038] a [2039] sheet [2041] about [2045] financial data or something that is [2049] bad instead what you wanted to do is you [2053] want to [2054] say [2056] generate a [2058] CSV with [2062] month [2064] revenue and profit headings [2068] based off of the below [2070] data and now like when it gives you an [2072] output it's actually going to give you [2073] an output that you can just copy and [2074] paste directly into Google uh Google [2077] Sheets or or Excel or something you know [2079] you're going to have data that looks [2080] like this month Revenue profit then [2083] it'll say like I don't know January okay [2085] it'll say like [2087] 13,000 it'll say you know 3,000 it's not [2091] going to have any commas cuz it's comma [2092] separated but I'll get into that later [2094] maybe February it'll say 14,500 [2098] then it'll pull from some spreadsheet [2099] and grab this much for you right like [2101] your data is going to be a lot [2101] structured so if you want data in a [2103] format don't just have it generate a [2105] thing and then have you have to go copy [2107] and paste it into a spreadsheet or into [2108] your app or into your program later like [2110] actually just ask it to do the exact [2112] thing that you want it to do right off [2113] the Geto I'll show you the exact [2115] structure you need in order to get this [2116] to Output reliably in a moment the 10th [2118] tip is to remove conflicting [2121] instructions now this may sound pretty [2124] simple but it's a lot bigger of an [2128] issue then I think a lot of people [2130] realize okay what do I mean by [2132] conflicting instructions well like a lot [2134] of the words that we use we don't really [2136] think of but they have directly opposed [2140] meanings I'll give you a quick example [2142] remember how earlier we went through and [2144] we made our whole thing really short our [2147] whole prompt really short to take [2148] advantage of better accuracy well a word [2150] I always see and I've seen very often in [2152] maker School my my 0 to1 community and [2154] then also make money with make.com which [2155] is a higher level Community um like a [2157] lot of prompt engineering threads I see [2159] stuff like this detailed summary I want [2161] you to think about this logically like [2163] if you produce a summary of something [2164] you are necessarily producing something [2167] that is simpler and smaller and and [2170] lighter and and easier it's a it's a [2172] compressed form of you know the thing [2174] that you are doing you're basically [2176] going you know from something like [2181] complex to simple right that's what a [2184] summary is but if you ask for something [2186] detailed basically going from something [2188] simple to complex so then if you're [2190] asking for a detailed summary what [2192] you're basically doing is you're it's [2193] like mathematically it's like it's like [2195] this equals zero okay it equals nothing [2197] these two cancel each other out and what [2199] you end up doing is you just end up [2200] needlessly increasing token count for no [2202] reason so like when you say stuff like [2204] produce an engaging article that is also [2206] very simple and straightforward or [2208] produce like a very comprehensive [2209] article that's still easy for newcomers [2211] to understand right you're giving it [2212] conflicting instructions do you want it [2214] to produce something detailed or do you [2215] want it to produce something that's [2216] that's not okay um just eliminate that [2219] it'll substantially reduce your token [2220] length and then it'll also allow you to [2223] uh you know just get get a little bit [2225] better at defining things and and being [2226] simple and treating llms as I think that [2228] you know they realistically should be [2230] treated which are tools that enable you [2232] to generate things not like at our [2234] current level some super nuanced being [2236] that's able to like really fully [2237] understand the full gradient of the [2239] decision that you've tasked it with the [2240] 11th tip I have for you is to learn [2242] JavaScript object notation XML then CSV [2246] let's actually start with XML [2248] XML stands for [2252] extensible markup language okay to make [2256] a long story [2257] short all XML basically is it's just a [2260] way to structure data you remember how [2263] like back in grade school um you know [2265] you would write a story and you write [2268] your name in the top left hand corner [2269] you write the date over here you'd write [2272] the title over [2275] here and then underneath here maybe you [2277] write the story right and then you hand [2281] it in well all XML Json and csvr are [2285] just formats that allow you to embed [2287] what all of these different things are [2289] in a simple and easy and standardized [2291] way um for computers to understand so [2293] that you can do cool things with them [2294] like run you know cool programs and [2295] whatnot so you know if this is my big [2297] paper okay this is a big paper that I [2300] wrote One me first place in school I got [2304] a $25 discard discard um a $25 gift card [2309] to uh Denny's or something okay this is [2312] equivalent to this I have a little [2313] author [2315] tag where it says Nick [2319] s then I have a closing author tag all [2323] right this is now like universally [2325] understood that the author is Nick surve [2327] right maybe the date okay the date was [2331] February the 19th and I close that tag [2333] off with [2335] date um title right well the title was [2340] birds and bees [2344] right and I close out the title I could [2347] go on and on but I think you guys [2348] understand this is a very particular [2349] formatting convention that allows you to [2352] Define things okay if I go uh this one [2356] this one's pretty cool because I [2357] actually used to um live and work in Sur [2360] so building ID Siri head office address [2363] this is an address variable city city [2365] variable Province uh Province VAR [2367] country um country variable location [2370] right you can embed data if I were to [2372] instead write a paper I'd say the sir [2375] head office is located at 7445 132 [2379] Street which is in Siri BC [2383] Canada I just want you guys to like see [2386] how much more every time I say Siri it [2388] activates my Siri isn't that funny um I [2391] just want you guys to see how much more [2393] compressed this data is and how much [2395] more immediately understandable this [2396] data is too [2398] so that's one reason why XML is awesome [2401] um Json stands for JavaScript object [2403] notation it's very similar okay the only [2406] difference is instead of the tags the [2408] less than and greater than symbols that [2409] we used along with some of those backs [2410] slashes um all this is is this is Curly [2413] braces quotes [2416] characters um colons and then more curly [2419] braces okay exact same thing right uh [2422] this would say [2425] author and then this would say Nick sarf [2429] right exact same data if you could see [2431] um Jason [2433] example you'll see data that looks just [2435] like this so instead of me saying hey [2437] this guy's name is Richard he's a [2439] 33-year-old man who loves biking gaming [2440] squash and lives in Port space land he's [2443] friends with Joe and Sarah and Michelle [2445] who are all you know 30ish somethings [2447] that live across the continent of the [2449] United States like instead of me saying [2451] that I just create a little JavaScript [2453] object where the name variables equal to [2455] Richard the age variables to 33 and so [2458] on and so forth and then CSV the reason [2460] I bring this up is because this is a [2462] little bit more of a Nuance Point CSV is [2463] actually just the hyper compressed [2464] version of all of this where you don't [2466] have to use these tag characters and you [2468] only have to mention the Thing Once okay [2470] so what I mean is okay remember this [2472] author date and title a CSV file would [2475] actually just look like this author [2477] comma no space date comma no space [2481] title and you'd have a little new line [2482] then here it would say Nick [2485] SV then it would say Feb 19 then it [2489] would go [2491] birds and bees now this if you just like [2495] count up the number of characters this [2496] is actually way less than all of this [2498] and the cool thing is when you do a new [2499] row you don't have to repeat the key [2503] names what you can do is you can [2505] actually just you know um write the I [2508] don't know write everything in what's [2510] called comma separated value format the [2512] comma here is the delimiter character [2514] the issue with using this in large [2516] language models um is unfortunately [2518] large language models often lose their [2519] sense of place especially in longfall so [2521] if you're producing a CSV that has I [2523] don't know like several hundred um [2525] inputs the large language model's [2527] ability to like remember that the date [2528] column always comes second on I don't [2531] know like row number 1,00 and three or [2535] something its ability to know that like [2537] date corresponds to Y it just tends to [2539] get muddled down which is why you [2540] typically only use csrees for for [2541] smaller applications with large language [2543] models all right the 12th tip I want to [2544] give you guys is what I call my key [2548] prompt structure so I have developed [2551] probably over a thousand prompts now for [2553] businesses my own businesses other [2555] businesses I work with people that I [2557] consult with and so on and so forth and [2558] this is what I do um on basically all of [2560] them okay so feel free to copy this on [2563] your own um use this for all your own [2564] promps I'm going to show you what this [2565] looks like first we start with context [2568] then I give it instructions okay after [2571] that I give it my output [2573] format you guys just use this to [2575] scaffold your own [2577] then I give it rules and then finally I [2580] wrap it up with an [2581] example so let me show you guys a quick [2584] actual look at what a real prompt that [2586] has made me almost um $500,000 looks [2589] like I'm going to show you guys this in [2590] a no code tool it's called make.com it's [2592] what I personally use and I teach a lot [2594] about it as well um it is for a specific [2598] tool called [2599] upwork upwork is a tool uh upwork is a [2602] freelancing platform or basically you [2604] can bid on jobs and stuff like [2606] that and this prompt was written to [2608] allow me to take as input an upwork job [2610] description uh and then have ai [2612] automatically process it filter it tell [2614] me if it's relevant to me and then write [2615] me a oneline Icebreaker that's [2617] customized to that job so how this [2619] actually looks I start off with a system [2621] prompt that says you're an intelligent [2622] admin that filters jobs that's pretty [2624] simple right no real rocket science here [2627] then I have my user prompt and the way [2629] that I want you guys to look at this is [2630] through that lens that I provided you [2632] earlier okay with context first then [2634] instructions then output format then [2635] rules and then some examples [2637] so let me break this down for you this [2639] up here this is all my context okay so [2643] what do I mean I say hey I'm an [2645] automation engineer that builds Outreach [2646] systems CRM systems project management [2648] systems no code systems and Integrations [2651] right I'm sure I could cut this down in [2652] hindsite now that I know a little bit [2653] more about prompt engineering I built [2655] this thing out um I believe over a year [2658] ago now uh it was one of the videos that [2660] actually made me go viral on YouTube [2661] then I say below is a job description [2663] filter it for relevance true or false in [2665] Json some of the platforms include use [2667] air table clickup chat TBT make Monday [2669] zap here LinkedIn Google Sheets if [2670] relevant write a short introductory [2672] Icebreaker okay but I'm not actually [2674] done yet I then give it some example [2676] client projects these are things that [2677] I've done and then I tell it my format [2680] okay so let's just be abundantly clear [2683] here I provided a context over here then [2686] I gave it some instructions over here so [2689] sorry I think I misspoke earlier this is [2692] my [2694] context this is my [2698] instructions okay after my context and [2702] instructions what I do is I give it my [2703] output format which is right over [2706] here and then at the end I also have [2708] some rules now in this case I wrote them [2709] as notes but these are essentially my [2712] rules then finally I actually give it [2714] some examples and the way that you do [2716] this in make.com and any other no code [2718] tool is you will have your user prompt [2720] up here with all of those four bits that [2722] I showed you a moment ago and then you [2724] have another user prompt with your first [2726] example then another assistant prompt [2728] with your first result and in my case I [2731] did I think three or four shots so then [2733] I have a user with an example this is an [2735] actual job description from upw workk [2737] then I have an assistant response with a [2739] result then another user prompt [2741] assistant prompt another user prompt [2743] assistant prompt another user prompt [2744] assistant prompt another user prompt [2745] assistant prompt I think in this case [2747] looks like I had like seven or six or [2748] something like that uh in hindsight [2750] probably too much and I was probably [2752] forced to do this just because models [2753] were a little bit less intelligent when [2754] I built this out nowadays I might do [2756] like two maybe [2757] okay I also also wanted to show like a [2759] wide range of possible jobs which um [2761] obviously helped to perform and this is [2762] why I have almost $500,000 in posted [2765] earnings on my profile because I use [2766] systems like this to be able to apply to [2768] large volumes of jobs I've also helped a [2770] lot of other people and build out [2771] processes that involve things like this [2773] so um in a nutshell I almost always use [2776] this key prompt structure with some [2777] slight variations context is where you [2779] tell it what you want like who you are [2782] and what you want instructions are where [2784] you outline specifically and say your [2786] task is to do XY Z output format is [2788] where you say something like return your [2789] results in Json using this format rules [2791] where you say hey here's a quick list I [2793] want you you know don't do this do this [2795] don't do this do this then examples [2797] where you actually give it those user [2798] prompt or user assistant prompt [2801] pairs okay the next thing I want to talk [2804] about tip number 13 is to use AI to [2808] generate [2810] examples for [2813] AI [2815] okay what do I mean by that well if we [2817] go back to that prompt that I showed you [2819] guys a moment ago right we have a lot of [2821] examples here what you can do instead of [2824] you actually finding an examp examples [2826] you get you can actually like create one [2828] yourself right so I can actually go and [2830] I can create one so what do I mean by [2832] this I could say um I'm actually going [2834] to go all the way down to the bottom and [2837] I actually want to generate my own [2839] little assistant prompt right so maybe [2842] what I'm going to do now is uh I don't [2844] know I'm just going to go into AI paste [2846] this [2847] and say I'm using this for training [2849] write me a similar training example as [2852] the above this is just using a simple [2855] hotkey um option space on Mac where I [2859] can launch a chat GPT instance I should [2862] know that this is not the same as the um [2864] API that I'm using right now but does a [2867] pretty good job right so now I have this [2869] and what am I going to do I'm just going [2870] to right click run this module only and [2872] it's actually going to go through and [2874] generate me a result using AI right [2877] pretty simple and easy now this was back [2880] in the day when you could not parse uh [2882] the Json in the make Doom module anybody [2885] that is a little bit more experienced [2887] with make.com is probably looking at [2888] this and being like hey why aren't you [2889] parsing this directly inside of the [2890] prompt that's just because the gbd 40613 [2893] model just didn't have access to do it [2894] as you could see there's no there's no [2896] tool for me to do so but basically what [2898] we've done is we've outputed some Json [2899] JavaScript object notation which I can [2901] then feed into this module here to parse [2903] automatically then produce me a variable [2905] that I can access that looks kind of [2907] like this reason result Icebreaker the [2909] last tip I want to provide you guys is a [2911] pretty simple one but it's to use the [2913] right model for the task [2917] okay I see a lot of people nowadays [2920] using very simple [2923] models so here's how it basically Works [2927] simple models are cheap complex models [2930] are more [2932] expensive so this is a [2934] gradient between simple and cheap [2937] complex and expensive the unfortunate [2939] thing is like 99% of people that I see [2941] in in maker School make money with make [2943] a comment on YouTube they're way too far [2945] on the simple and the cheap side of [2947] things as of the time of this video [2948] there there a bunch of models available [2950] I don't really want to date this too [2951] much but you know a bunch of these are [2952] like mini models and so what a lot of [2953] people will do is they'll just use the [2954] mini models because they think that it's [2956] saving them a lot of money well unless [2958] you're running something like that is [2961] doing 5 million operations or executions [2963] a day like unless you're running some [2965] serious backend infra [2967] token costs are so little that it [2969] doesn't actually make any [2971] sense not to just use like smart models [2974] most of the time obviously there's some [2976] exceptions but let me just run you [2977] through what the gbt 40 family models [2979] looks like okay this $250 cents per [2983] million tokens of input $10 per 1 [2985] million tokens of output if we just like [2987] average them and say I don't know for [2989] the purposes of this I'm just going to [2990] say it's five bucks per 1 million tokens [2991] combined okay this upwork RSS feed thing [2994] that I just did if we look at the usage [2996] okay combin it was 1,169 I would have to [2999] use one I would have to do this 1,000 [3002] times to use $5 that's crazy how many do [3005] I actually do a day like 15 okay if we [3008] do the math on this $5 divided by 1,000 [3011] means that for every run I use [3015] 0.5 this is equivalent [3018] to uh [3021] 55.5 C so basically every two times I [3024] run this it's 1 cent it's it's a it's a [3026] penny [3027] every four times I run this it's two [3029] every eight times I run this it's four [3031] right it's such a marginal small amount [3033] of money that there's no reason and this [3035] is by the way this is using a GPT 40613 [3037] and this is also using like a very very [3039] under optimized Pro well maybe not very [3041] under optimized but pretty under [3042] optimized prompt with what I know now [3044] the reality is you know like uh any case [3048] that you could use GPT 40 mini which you [3050] know is understandably much cheaper but [3052] basically any use case you could use GPT [3054] 4 a mini for unless you're sending [3056] Millions of tokens on a daily basis just [3058] use the smarter model the smarter model [3060] will eliminate like half of the problems [3062] that you didn't even know you had and I [3063] recommend always just starting with a [3064] smarter model and then working your way [3066] down as opposed to starting with a [3067] dumber model and then trying to work [3068] your way up just way easier to do that [3070] way so I mean you know 75 bucks per a [3073] million tokens for 4.5 or 150 bucks for [3075] a million tokens like like yeah that's [3077] pretty expensive and I could see that [3078] being a limiter but the vast majority of [3081] these o based multimodal models anyway [3083] um as of the time of this recording are [3085] hyper cheap and usually recommend Just [3087] DE buying yourself debiasing yourself [3089] and just trying to use the more [3090] expensive ones wherever possible because [3091] at the end of the day they're not really [3092] that expensive my company um which is [3095] called one second copy we still use a [3098] lot of tokens on a daily basis I think [3100] we spent like I don't know five bucks [3102] last [3103] month that's that's a company right [3106] makes several tens of thousands of [3108] dollars still so if you think about like [3110] the the return on investment of these [3111] tokens it it's crazy so just make sure [3113] you use the right model for the task [3114] most of the time that involves using a [3116] little bit smarter model all right [3119] that's it for this video had a lot of [3120] fun recording it and re-recording it for [3122] all yall if you guys have any questions [3123] about this just drop them down below if [3125] you guys want me to make videos on a [3126] specific topic then please I love [3129] getting ideas and I'm inspired for the [3131] most part by people like you that [3132] actually take the time to leave comments [3134] down below saying Nick can you do a [3135] video x1z Nick can you do a master class [3137] on prompt engineering so this video is [3139] because somebody earlier on in my [3140] comments a few weeks ago asked me to do [3142] this and I'm more than happy to do what [3144] you what you want me to do as well [3146] otherwise if you guys do me a big solid [3147] anybody that's on the cusp of you know [3149] starting an automation agency or getting [3151] up and running with their own business [3153] that hasn't had a lot of experience in [3155] service companies or in any sort of [3157] automation scenario before I'd highly [3160] recommend that you check out maker [3161] school it's my day-by-day accountability [3162] program and you can get the link just in [3163] the description I guide you through [3165] setting up essentially your own [3167] automation outfit um from complete [3169] scratch and bootstrap in the hell out of [3170] it while you're at it and for anybody [3172] that maybe knows a little bit more about [3173] business that already has an automation [3175] business for instance or somebody that [3177] runs uh a business in a very similar [3179] domain to automation maybe a marketing [3181] agency maybe some sort of advertising or [3183] creative business check out make money [3184] with make.com it's my mid-level [3186] community that helps people that run [3188] businesses over5 to $10,000 a month [3191] scale using my own products systems [3193] templates and so on and so forth both of [3195] these communities have me and them every [3197] single day coaching and guiding you guys [3198] through I'm a very friendly and familiar [3200] face you can hopefully tell from now um [3203] and yeah I'd be I'd be more than than [3204] happy to see you in there and then help [3206] you out if you guys could do me a solid [3207] like subscribe do all the fun YouTube [3209] stuff I'll catch you on the next one [3210] cheers

Title: 3 Simple Ways to Set Up a RAG Chatbot (Sell These for $$$)
[0] here are three ways to set up a rag [1] chatbot today and the first takes just [3] 90 seconds I find a lot of people make [5] rag or retrieval augmented generation [7] out to be a lot harder than it actually [9] is in reality rag is easy as hell and [11] I'll show you how to do it all in just a [12] minute my name is Nick I scaled an [14] automation agency to 72k a month using [16] no code tools like nadn and make.com my [18] whole thing is cut in the fluff so let's [20] get into it all right so there are three [21] ways to rag I'm going to show you all of [23] them in due time the first is going to [25] take you just 90 seconds so that's our [27] 90c method the second is a lot more [30] detailed and we're going to be using NN [31] and pine cone in order to basically set [33] up our own uh database and then run [36] retrieval using a customized strategy [39] then the third is going to be using a [41] couple of thirdparty tools which I [43] believe are probably the simplest and [45] the easiest if you want really wide [46] reach but this is definitely like the [48] fastest by far the simplest way to get [50] up and running is using openai assistant [52] so head over to platform. [53] open.com playground log in if you [56] haven't already you'll be faced with a [57] screen to look something like this open [59] eyes always changing their user [60] experience so this may look a little bit [62] different when you are checking it out [64] this is what it looks like for me and [65] then head over to the assistance tab you [67] may have to make your first assistant if [68] you haven't already done so that's what [69] I'm going to do here and I'm just going [71] to be doing a very simple example for [72] the purpose of this video it's going to [73] be like a Bitcoin assistant um it's very [76] archetypal in reg to use the 2008 [78] Bitcoin paper there are a lot of [79] templates out there for nadn that show [81] this as your like document chat example [84] um a couple of make.com ones as well but [86] basically I'm just going to upload the [87] 2008 Bitcoin paper uh which is quite the [90] quite the dry read I must say so myself [92] and I'm going to have this model tell me [94] something about it you can substitute [95] that Bitcoin wi for whatever the hell [97] you want knowledge base which I'll show [98] you how to do when we move over to nadn [99] in a moment uh tons of stuff but anyway [102] as under system instructions going say [104] you are helpful [105] intelligent assistant that answers [108] questions related to the seol 2008 [112] Bitcoin paper by Satoshi [116] Nakamoto beautiful under model you need [120] to select GPT [121] 40 that'll enable file search give that [124] a click and what file search is is file [126] search is your rag it is essentially [128] running retrieval augmented generation [129] under the hood for you without even [131] really exposing or showing you the the [132] inner workings so most for most use [134] cases is actually totally fine and you [136] can get away with just doing that uh [138] which is why I'm front loading this [139] video click files then go to upload and [141] then just upload your knowledge Source [143] in my case it's this Bitcoin white paper [145] I have this like fictional company that [146] I created over here which I'll show you [147] guys in a in a moment when we do NAD [150] then you're going to have some Advanced [151] options here the two big parameters in [153] retrieval augmented generation are U [155] what's called chunk size and then chunk [157] overlap if you're unfamiliar with what [159] these mean basically you know you have [161] some document okay and we're going [162] rainbow mode because rainbow Mode's fun [165] this is your document have a bunch of um [167] colorful lines on said document now the [170] reason why rag was invented to begin [172] with is [174] because back in the day AI models had [177] very small context Windows context [179] window is just how much stuff you can [180] fit in a prompt basically before the [182] model starts going haywire so because we [184] had very small context Windows if we [186] wanted to ask a question about a [187] particular document and that document [189] was longer than the context window let's [191] say this document was 10,000 [193] words 10,000 rainbow words and um the [196] context window is only [198] 5,000 you know how how are you going to [200] get all the information of this document [203] into the prompt in order to ask [204] questions about it that's barring even [206] like the quality reduction the longer [207] the prompt gets because that's something [209] that you need to keep in mind when [210] you're working with AI the longer a [211] prompt is um generally speaking there's [213] like an inverse relationship between the [215] length of the prompt and then the [216] quality of the output all else held [219] equal um you know if you add a bunch of [220] great training examples this definitely [222] goes up up into a point and then it goes [223] back down but anyway if you're faced [226] with this problem of 5,000 words uh in [228] your context window and then you want to [229] fit 10,000 words in there what do you do [231] well this is where rag comes in so chunk [232] size basically means you take this [234] document then you split it into chunks [237] okay so now instead of this being I [239] don't know this big right instead of [240] this one document having 1 2 3 4 5 six [243] lines in it it's actually just three [245] documents and there are two lines per [247] document [249] okay and these documents are really just [251] like text files you can think of them [253] as and that is set by our chunk size so [257] hypothetically if this had I don't know [259] 2,400 tokens or whatever this would be [262] 800 up here this would be 800 over here [264] and then this would be 800 over here [266] hopefully that makes sense that's what [267] chunk size refers to the next next step [270] is chunk overlap now just because of the [273] way that language Works a quick hack [275] that some people found to improve the [277] quality of retrieval augmented [279] generation outputs um was to make it so [281] that these actually don't just divvy up [284] the article or the PDF or the file or [286] whatever perfectly actually what ends up [288] happening is it takes a little bit of [291] the next chunk and then adds that or or [294] appends that to the end of the first [296] trunk and basically we just repeat that [298] um so it's not actually like we're [299] getting you know two out of these these [301] six lines actually we're getting like [302] two and a half then over here we're [303] getting like you know the first half and [305] then the last half and the first half [306] and the last half this is just like how [308] much they overlap basically um so if you [311] have any questions uh on this I'm going [313] to be talking a little bit more about it [314] when we get to the n8n side of things [315] but yeah that's more or less how that [317] works and this is a brief little [318] overview into how rag functions under [320] the hood the good news is obviously we [322] obfuscate a lot of that away just using [325] open AI assistant and that's why I'm [326] starting with this Okay cool so once [329] you're done with that you've actually [330] now created what's called a vector store [332] under the hood we've uploaded a file [334] that file has gone undergone a process [336] called vectorization or embedding which [338] has turned this big string of words and [340] lovely Concepts into just a giant list [342] of numbers really and this giant list of [344] numbers can now be communicated with [346] pretty easily by GPT 40 so um let me [349] actually open up the paper here so we [350] just take a look at it together and then [351] let's ask at some something hypers [353] specific about the paper that it would [355] only know if it had access to that exact [358] paper so I'm going to go downloads [359] Bitcoin paper Okay so the traditional [361] banking model achieves a level of [362] privacy by limiting access to [364] information to the parties involved in [365] the trusted third party awesome let's [367] see what happens when I turn file search [369] off okay um [372] so how does the traditional banking [376] model [377] um achieve [381] privacy now right now this doesn't have [383] access to our paper it's just working [385] off of its brain more or less and as you [388] see the answer here is sort of unrelated [391] to anything of value this is not really [394] answering a question based off the [396] source data this is turning us to some [398] accessory resource called M search uh [400] it's giving us details on how we could [403] look for key terms or whatever now if [405] I'm a customer and I'm interacting with [406] the file store sorry if I'm uh [408] interacting with an assistant I ask the [409] question I get this sort of response [410] it's going to suck right but if I just [412] turn on file search and ask the same [414] question okay then I run it what you'll [417] see is now instead of just answering the [420] question like it did a moment ago it's [422] actually going to be running retrieval [424] so this means that it's actually now [425] accessing our specific data set it's [428] finding the string of text that most [430] closely corresponds to this question [433] which if we're just logical about it is [435] probably this paragraph right over here [437] okay it's then taking that and it's [439] feeding it into the am model and saying [441] hey here's the info can you answer the [443] person's question based off of that and [446] so in addition what we also get is we [447] also get a citation click on this [449] obviously it'll just go to the Bitcoin [450] PF paper um because of the only citation [453] we've uploaded but if you have like a [454] thousand of these things it'll it'll [455] find the specific one now the reason why [458] I'm showing you guys this first is just [459] because rag honestly they're very there [461] there are a lot fewer there are many [464] fewer use cases for rag today than there [466] were just a year ago and my expectation [468] is that in a year or two from now [469] they're probably going to be even fewer [470] use cases for rag the reason why to be [473] pragmatic is just because context [474] windows are getting enormously long you [476] don't really have to run this sort of [477] like strategy of chunking a document and [479] then uploading it to some file store and [481] vectorizing the contents and running [483] some sort of similarity search over it [485] like retrieval augmented generation does [487] um because you could just copy and paste [489] like 700 books worth of stuff and then [491] stick it right in the prompt itself and [493] say hey use that info to answer all my [495] questions right so this solves a need [498] that was itself a symptom and not like a [501] deeper problem as technology has gotten [503] better over the course of the last year [504] or two um you know we just haven't [506] really needed to use it as much and [507] nowadays you can achieve pretty similar [509] results just by like you know copying [510] over the entire Bitcoin white paper this [513] whole thing and then just pasting it [515] directly over here essentially now I [518] know it's pretty long and there going to [520] be some cost issues associated with this [522] obviously I'm not saying it's perfect [523] but you can achieve a pretty similar [525] result so that is number one the second [528] way to get up and running with rag is in [530] n8n and this is a much deeper form of [534] going through the rag process I'm going [535] to run you through um basically setting [538] up a pine cone store [540] so we're going to have pine cone and [542] let's actually not use rainbow [544] today I'm going to use nice blue we're [547] going to use pine cone then we're also [550] going to use an AI agent [553] okay and basically the way it's going to [555] work is we're going to have our little [556] chat window over here this is going to [559] be the [560] agent and the agent is going to have a [562] tool and this tool is going to be a [564] vector store and so you know the way [566] that agents work in nadn many of you are [568] probably familiar but basically the [570] agent makes a decision on what it should [571] do based off of The Prompt that you give [573] it so you say Hey you know can you tell [575] me a little bit about this thing if the [577] thing isn't related to the data that it [578] has access to it's not going to use the [580] vector store but if we upload our [581] Bitcoin paper or in our case it's going [583] to be like a business knowledge base and [585] then um it has a feeling like you know [587] the information might be in there it'll [588] actually trigger a search then it'll go [590] do the rag stuff grab the appropriate [592] and relevant data from our Pine code [593] database and then bring it back to the [595] agent to to get answered so you know [597] it's pretty neat again I'm going to show [598] you how it Works under the hood do I use [600] this stuff in my own day-to-day um you [602] know I'm I'm mostly concerned about [603] making money with this so no I don't but [605] you know there's been a lot of demand [606] for it so I figure I might as well run [608] you through what this looks like so [610] first things first just click add First [611] Step then type [612] agent I'm just going to use the default [614] tools agent this is fine for my purposes [617] and what I'm going to do next is I'm [619] going to add as a chat model open AI I [622] always use open a as a chat model for me [624] just because it's the easiest and [625] simplest but that doesn't mean that you [627] have to if there's a better or simpler [628] tool or a better simpler model um than [631] than by any means there a bunch of [633] options here I'm just going to leave [634] everything as the base and then allow [636] you guys to take this stem and customize [638] it however you want for the purposes of [642] this demo we're just going to use window [643] buffer memory but there are many [645] different types of memory that you could [646] use if you wanted to have more context [648] sort of like a longer chat agent and use [650] 15 um previous uh responses as context [654] and again the reason for that is because [655] the context window of modern models like [657] gbt 4 mini and whatever you are looking [659] at as of the time of you watching this [661] uh they're a lot longer than when the [663] agent concept kind of came uh you know [666] was invented essentially okay great and [668] then the next thing we need to do is we [669] just need to use a tool and the specific [671] tool we're going to be using is we [672] scroll all the way down to the [673] bottom there's one here called Vector [676] store okay now keep in mind there are a [678] variety of tools that you could use that [679] could probably answer similar sorts of [681] information like let's say you want to [683] do that Bitcoin example a moment ago [684] it's just do it an naad Wikipedia would [686] probably suffice for that right you [688] could just have it connect to Wikipedia [690] and then just ask Wikipedia questions [692] instead of necessarily asking your in [693] Vector store um but in these this [695] hypothetical example basically what I'm [696] going to do is I'm going to take a uh [700] list of a big text file for a [704] hypothetical SAS company that I called [705] one cone and basically I'm just going to [707] ask it a bunch of questions about one [709] cone using this file and because of that [711] you know because this file has so much [713] specific information about this [714] fictional company and the only way that [716] the model would know anything would be [717] if it is accessing this file and this [719] this is something you can actually do [721] you can actually sell to people uh which [722] is really ultimately what I care about [724] so we're going to go Vector store tool [727] what I'm going to call this is exactly [729] what the demo says company knowledge [731] base and I'll say this gets data about [734] one cone the SAS [739] company with relevant knowledge bases [743] attached the limit tab here uh just [746] tells you how many chunks you want to [748] pull from the knowledge base so the [750] default is four I'm just going to stick [752] with four for the purpose of this [753] example but you can't actually make this [754] really long nowadays because as I [756] mentioned all of these things go into [758] your prompt anyway there's no real [759] reason why you can't set this to 20 and [761] then kind of get away with it although [762] this does depend on your your um chunk [764] sizes which I'll cover next up you'll [766] see this is red the reason why is [768] because we need to add a vector store [769] which is going to be our pine cone [770] instance and then a model so under model [772] I'm going to click this plus button and [773] then again go down and do open AI now [776] the way that this works under the hood [777] just connecting this to my credential is [779] it's basically using open AI to uh get [783] the data using embeddings and then tell [785] you something about that data um so [788] that's why you need you need this [788] because we're actually going to need to [789] do this again in a moment then when you [790] click Vector store there a variety of [792] options you could choose so you can do [793] an inmemory postc quadrant superbases a [795] lot of people using super base now it's [797] awesome very similar to pine cone I'm [798] just going to c a pine cone now I [800] already have a connection uh set up but [802] I'm actually going to just create my own [803] account show you guys how to do it live [805] operation mode we're just going to leave [806] it to retrieve documents for agent chain [808] pine cone index I'll run you through in [810] a second but the last thing I'm going to [811] do just before that is notice that you [814] have to connect this to now what's [815] called an embedding model this embedding [818] model is going to allow us to basically [820] convert the um text in the documents [824] that we're uploading [825] into uh vectors which is pretty neat and [828] the variety of cool ones that we have [829] access to three large three small at a [832] O2 I'm just going to leave it as three [834] small for now um this is going to [835] influence the setup of our pine cone [837] Vector store now this is red cuz I [839] haven't actually done the connection but [840] just before I do and I set everything up [841] in Pine Cone just want you to take a [843] look at just how many like AI uh [845] instances we we have here how many AI [847] tools we're using to accomplish this one [848] thing we have the open AI chat model [850] over here this is basically just like [852] our general purpose uh like logic engine [855] right this is going to be choosing what [856] tools to use it's going to be choosing [858] when to access our uh Vector store about [860] the knowledge base and it's going to be [862] responsible for formulating an answers [863] and stuff then we have uh this Vector [866] store tool which is going to retrieve [868] data from our pine cone Vector store [870] okay but we've also attached to that [872] another open AAP model and basically [874] what's going to happen is every time [875] that we get a request where we need to [877] access the vector [879] store this request is going to go over [881] to this AI agent this AI agent is going [883] to think a little bit and it's going to [884] say you know we need some data so it's [886] going to go to this Vector store tool [888] after it goes to the vector store tool [889] the vector store tool is going to call [890] the specific pine cone instance that's [893] going to run a [895] search that this embeddings model is [897] going to return to the Pine on Vector [899] store and then this is going to return a [903] result to the vector store that this [904] model is then going to interpret okay [907] before finally returning it to the agent [909] returning it back to the open a chat [910] model and returning it back to the agent [913] to send to you so there's a lot that's [915] going on under the hood okay like I [917] understand that this may seem pretty [918] simple but essentially what we're asking [920] our AI models to do in order to get this [923] solved involves quite a few steps it's [925] usually why I recommend just using an [926] open ass assistant anyway I'm going to [927] stop harping on it for now so we need to [929] set up a pine cone account right I'm [930] going to go to Pine [932] cone. now in my case I'm going to [934] pretend that I haven't set this up yet [936] so we're just going to sign up with a [937] new [939] account just going to use this one here [941] click continue welcome Nick I'm now [944] going to open up my email accept this [947] thank you very [949] much B aut full we'll go back to Pine [952] Cone now uh I don't know what the hell [954] happened [956] here okay so that cop paste did not work [959] I'm going to go back here oh I think I [961] pasted in the entire Bitcoin paper nice [965] that definitely isn't the code or who [967] knows maybe it is maybe Pine con's crazy [969] with it okay so now we need to add some [972] additional information setting that up [974] right now I'm just going to say I don't [978] code no coding for me Q&A AI agents less [982] than [983] 100K their uh their stuff's probably [986] going to look pretty different um as of [988] the time that you are watching watching [989] it now we have our API key which is cool [991] so I'm actually just going to copy this [992] key and as you see it says they won't [994] show you this key again after you close [995] this dialog so please copy this key like [997] copy it somewhere otherwise you [998] basically just have to create a new [999] account and I'm saying this because I've [1001] done this a couple of times at this [1003] point um then we need to add our [1004] credential so create new credential [1006] paste this API key in okay save [1009] it um I didn't expose it at all because [1011] I just like left it um we go back here [1015] to Pine Cone I just left it as sort of [1017] these OB fiscated uh stars but maybe you [1019] want to like save this to I don't know [1022] some some file somewhere some messaging [1023] app or something just in case the first [1026] thing it's going to tell you to do is [1028] set up your API quick start with some [1030] some some pip some python package [1032] manager and all that stuff because [1034] reasing in now we don't need to worry [1035] about any of that we just go over to [1036] create index now just create something [1039] that you want to call this I'm going to [1040] call this um one let me see what was the [1043] name of our company one [1045] cone one cone okay well we're going to [1049] want to use is our configuration there [1051] are a variety of of different ones you [1053] could do um the number of Dimensions [1055] that is the standard as of the time of [1057] this recording is [1059] 1,536 as you see if you click on text [1061] embedding three large um that's the the [1063] bigger model that's a little bit smarter [1065] um it's up to [1066] 372 you basically need to match the [1068] number of Dimensions which with whatever [1070] model you're using to do the embeddings [1072] how you figure that out is you just go [1074] back here right and then go to the the [1077] specific model that that we selected for [1078] from I'm using open AI right so there [1080] are three options the large which is 372 [1082] Dimensions the small which is [1084] 1,536 or something and I believe Ada O2 [1087] is the same we might actually be able to [1089] find it I don't know if we [1091] can if not um text embedding a O2 and [1096] then just type in [1098] Dimensions yeah so that one's also 1536 [1101] and you know you you'll just get the [1102] data um uh for the specific embedding [1106] thing that you're using so I'm going to [1107] use small okay leave it as cosine that's [1110] fine uh looks like I can only contain [1112] lower case so I'm just going to go one [1114] cone it's a little bit better we're [1116] going to have our capacity mode be [1118] serverless we'll leave the cloud [1119] provider as AWS cute little smiley face [1121] man I wish my brand look like that and [1123] then I'll leave it as Virginia and I'm [1125] going to create an [1127] index now an index is [1130] basically well I don't even know how to [1132] finish that sentence it's like uh some [1134] highlevel table that organizes the rest [1136] of your database what we need to do next [1138] is we need to add some sort of record to [1140] this okay you can add a record manually [1142] so I could click add a record I could [1144] add some stuff then I can add all of my [1146] records here um but basically what you [1149] want to do instead is you want to do [1150] this through naden so you want to upload [1151] a file to naden and actually like um [1154] embed it and then add it to Pine Cone [1155] directly that way uh so basically like [1157] right right now this is this is fine [1159] we're like we're we're good we're good [1160] with this this is okay I'm going to go [1162] back oh hold on a second uh no I'm going [1165] to go back over to NAD now and then I'm [1169] just going to connect to the specific [1171] pine cone instance which is my pine cone [1173] API account to then under index because [1175] we've added one now just just click one [1177] cone okay and at this point we've set up [1179] everything that we need to get this [1180] running except for the document itself [1184] now um remember earlier I just looked at [1186] the record panel here and I tried adding [1188] something manually what you have to do [1189] in order to get something into pine cone [1191] is you have to embed the document [1192] yourself and then and then add it if [1194] that seems like witchcraft I don't worry [1196] about it just add a new trigger [1199] add the trigger manually here and what [1201] we're going to want to do is we're going [1202] to need to find a way to download a file [1205] get it in nen and then send that over to [1209] Pine Cone using this node okay this pine [1213] cone Vector store node that says add [1215] documents to a vector [1217] store so I can just reuse the same [1219] credentials I had the operation mode is [1221] going to be insert documents I'm then [1222] going to insert said document into one [1224] cone there also some um yeah there are a [1226] couple of other properties here that'll [1228] leave blank [1229] basically we can now add our embedding [1230] model which has to be the same embedding [1232] model that we're going to be pulling [1233] from so that should be text embedding [1236] three small [1237] perfect then obviously we have the [1239] specific um document here we get that [1242] using this default data loader and [1245] there's a bunch of different types of [1246] data that you can load um what we're [1247] going to do is we're going to download a [1249] file in binary and then add it you can [1251] also do Json data technically but I'm [1253] just going to say uh load specific data [1257] automatically detect by m type and then [1259] we're going to leave the input data [1260] field name as [1262] data for text splitter this is where [1264] you're going to Define your chunks [1266] basically so you can split things into [1267] chunks based off tokens the default [1270] chunk size I'm going to leave is 800 [1272] chunk overlap is going to be 400 if you [1274] remember this these are the same [1275] settings that open ai's Assistant used [1277] in order to Define our uh you know [1279] chunking um so this is like I don't want [1282] to say this is the standard or the best [1283] but sorry I don't want to say this is [1284] the best but this is definitely the [1285] standard is it right now I believe chunk [1287] overlap should be like half of whatever [1288] the chunk size is don't quote me on that [1291] if you do make sure to take out wly out [1293] of context and make me seem Super Evil [1296] okay great so now all we have to do is [1298] we have to add a file so I'm just going [1299] to go between these two nodes and there [1302] variety of ways to get a file I'm just [1303] going to upload it to Google Drive and [1304] then download the file from Google Drive [1306] here so I'm going to go [1308] drive okay then I'm going to go download [1311] this is how you get stuff into binary [1312] and NN now I've already connected my [1315] Google Drive account using um ooth if [1317] you don't if you if you don't have one [1318] what you need to do is you basically [1319] have to go and you have to set up the [1321] Google Drive API in the cloud console [1324] this can be pretty annoying so just [1325] click the documentation click on Google [1327] Drive then go to Google Drive [1330] credentials and then what you need to do [1332] is you need to set up um oo [1337] 2 which involves you more or less [1340] creating a Google API console account [1343] that'll take you to a page that looks [1344] something like this you'll have to then [1346] create an account or project as well as [1348] some [1349] credentials then from here you're going [1351] to have a client ID you're going to have [1353] a client creation date and then you're [1354] also going to have a client secret um [1356] make sure not to expose this to [1358] everybody like I'm doing right now I can [1359] only get away with this because I always [1361] rotate mine afterwards um you're going [1363] to grab those two pieces of data and if [1365] we go back to our nend rag thing you're [1368] going to have to paste the client ID and [1369] the client Secret in over here that's [1371] going to open up a page that allow you [1372] to connect to Google and then [1374] voila after that we are going to [1376] download a file now obviously I'm going [1377] to have to select the file so I go into [1379] my own Google drive right [1381] now and then upload the file so that I [1383] can download it later they're obviously [1385] automated ways that you could do this as [1387] well but this is me I'm going to go over [1392] to this one con knowledge based. txt I'm [1395] going to drag it [1398] in should now be [1403] uploading okay it's definitely still not [1405] uploading there we [1406] go this knowledge B file is called one [1409] Conor knowledge base. txt looks good to [1412] me I'm going to go back to NAD now I'm [1414] going to select a [1415] file want to type in one [1418] cone it's going to grab that file okay [1421] great so basically if we test this now [1424] uh we'll have the file in binary okay [1427] because it's in binary the cool thing [1430] is what you can do so you could you can [1432] then feed that into this Pine con store [1434] let me just um I don't think you can pin [1435] binary data right no you can't that's [1437] fine [1439] we're then going to insert this data [1442] into pine [1447] cone we're now executing this node so [1449] we've now inserted this file into our [1451] record okay this is what it looks like [1453] it's parsed it looks really nice it's [1457] then ran through the default data loader [1459] and it's actually chunked it as we [1461] discussed now I believe here we only [1462] have two chunks so um our file was not [1465] super long to begin with [1469] but if you're uploading a longer file [1470] you'll probably have much more actually [1472] for the purpose of this demo why don't [1473] we do like chunk size 200 with overlap [1476] of 50 I don't just want to leave it [1479] there let me go back to Pine Cone and [1481] just remove this we we have this right [1484] now right but I'm just going to delete [1485] both of these let's do that one more [1488] time except with a much much [1491] smaller uh number of chunks so you guys [1493] can see what it looks like great so now [1495] we have obviously much smaller chunks [1497] and we have many this is probably what [1499] yours are going to look like when you [1500] upload like a super big um you know [1502] company knowledge base and now we have [1505] our knowledge base inside of pine con [1507] how cool is that the only thing we have [1508] to do now is we we have to talk with it [1510] right so that's what I'm going to do up [1511] here I'm going to go chat let me just [1513] exit out all of the test data and I'll [1515] say hey what's up so first I'm just [1517] going to ask a basic question notice how [1519] we went down the chat model route and [1521] then the window buffer memory route we [1522] did not access the vector store the [1524] reason why is because our agent [1525] determined that we did not need to [1527] consult this third party [1528] database basically in order to answer [1530] said [1531] question now what I'm going to do is I'm [1533] going to find some data that's hyp [1535] specific about one cone I'm going to ask [1537] it a question where we can get that [1540] let's see I'm going to have it tell me [1543] about one con pricing so you see up here [1545] where it says one cone pricing follows [1547] the subscription model why don't we ask [1549] it tell me about one con [1554] pricing now it's going to consult our [1556] Vector store access Pine phone get the [1559] embeddings return them consult our next [1561] chat model return the vector store data [1563] to the original agent then consult the [1565] model on how to formulate all this and [1567] then send it back and if we go back to [1568] the chat what you see is we've now [1570] retrieved all of the data that we've [1572] just chunked using our own custom chunk [1573] size of 200 with a 50 overlap so um you [1577] know couple of couple of benefits and [1578] drawbacks to this if we go down the [1580] right hand side of this log okay [1583] basically what we did at the very top [1585] here is we this is our AI agent log for [1587] those of you that aren't familiar shows [1588] us the stack of things that are called [1590] um starting at the very first thing and [1592] then the thing that needed to be called [1593] to answer the first thing so in our case [1595] tell me about one con's pricing right [1598] from there that we fed that prompt into [1601] our open aai Assistant our open AI [1603] assistant sorry our our openai chat [1605] model then called the vector store tool [1608] with this query what is one cones [1609] pricing model then the vector store [1613] consulted um the settings that we we [1615] created which are that we're going to [1617] bring four [1618] results [1621] back from there um we fed those four [1624] results back here the most relevant four [1627] results I should say now I think in this [1629] case it looks like it was only one [1630] result because the other ones probably [1631] weren't relevant it looks like we [1632] actually got all the data just in one [1633] chunk then that fed back into the opena [1636] chat model and then that actually you [1637] know was capable of um of answering our [1639] question down here which is pretty cool [1641] so you know we are doing a lot of stuff [1643] uh things are working in concert with [1644] each other uh pretty cool to see as you [1647] can imagine you know if you were to [1648] create some sort of sales agent or [1649] something like that which I think [1650] nowadays is one of the main purposes you [1652] could have uh your main route which is [1654] just like a wonderful prompt that just [1656] answers most general purpose questions [1658] but then if somebody asks a hypers [1659] specific question about your product or [1660] your business or whatever you could go [1662] through the whole Vector store thing um [1664] chunk those documents add them all to [1666] Pine Cone and then add the logic like [1668] we've done here to like retrieve [1669] dynamically the specific ones that [1671] matter although I just want you to keep [1673] in mind this entire time that if you do [1675] that don't just contrast that against [1678] nothing contrast that against the other [1680] situation where if you could have just [1681] copied and pasted all that into the [1682] prompt to begin with right you know it's [1684] not all or nothing here it's um yeah [1687] there there's an opportunity cost all of [1688] it I guess is what I'm trying to say [1690] okay so that is Method number two why [1692] don't we cover method number three which [1694] I think is much much easier and probably [1697] a little bit faster as [1699] well method number three is using a [1701] third party now in my case I'm going to [1703] be using a simple third party called bot [1705] to press but there are many third [1707] parties that you could use if you want [1708] to get this done and I'm not affiliated [1711] with bot press I believe I have an [1712] affiliate code actually somewhere I [1714] don't think I'm going to put it in this [1715] video not that I don't absolutely love [1718] bot press but basically the way that it [1720] works [1721] is uh it's just like an [1724] AI rag platform where you can create [1727] your own chat Bots upload specific sorts [1730] of data to the chatbot and then whereas [1732] the open AI assistant and then the n8n [1734] rag chat Bots um these are sort of [1736] constrained right like the open AI [1737] assistant you can only really [1739] communicate with it through the open a [1740] playground the um chat bot over here you [1743] can only really communicate with if you [1744] make it [1746] live um you know and then chat with it [1749] through some sort of hosted link [1754] um uh you can also embed this on your [1756] website of course the really cool thing [1757] about bot press is you can go one step [1759] further so instead of just being [1760] constrained to what we have here um you [1763] can upload you can have your Bot press [1765] trap up be in like a WhatsApp or a [1767] telegram or something like that um and a [1769] lot of people like this right because [1771] there are a lot of tools out there that [1773] now or there are a lot of use cases out [1775] there that that require the use of you [1776] know WhatsApp as a tool telegram as a [1778] tool lots of communities are cropping up [1780] over here um you can also do stuff with [1781] make.com cly huggingface tons of [1783] Integrations but anyway so that's how [1785] botpress works I'm going to log in by [1787] log [1789] in uh I'm actually going to go back and [1791] sign up because I like when I can sign [1794] up to a platform in front of you because [1796] a lot of the times signups people are [1798] very intimidating so this is me signing [1800] up with my email [1802] address we're now going to have what [1805] looks like some very snazzy onboarding [1806] through typ [1811] form thank you thank you we're going to [1814] start building and we're taken to this [1817] page in order to get up and running with [1818] your chat bot just go to the left hand [1820] side where it says create bot it's going [1821] to customize a name with some funny [1824] terms like satisfied giraffe if you have [1826] a cooler name then drop it down below [1828] but I I like satisfied [1830] giraffe after it's done initializing the [1833] bot you're going to be taken to their [1835] Studio it's going to prompt you and ask [1837] you if you want to open it in their [1838] studio so I [1839] do I do love my Studios so I'm going to [1843] load the bot apparently loading [1845] multiplayer that's cool we we dropping [1847] some cod here man what we doing some [1850] League of Legends let's go competitive [1852] bot [1853] press okay it's now going to ask us to [1855] pick a plan I'm just going to skip [1856] through that as of the time of this [1857] recording you don't need a plan to to [1859] test this or get up and running um next [1861] up there are a few simple things that I [1863] would fill in before proceeding the [1865] first is instructions so basically um it [1869] pre-fills this with a bunch of customer [1871] support agent stuff um it looks like [1873] that's the main example right now just [1875] have one but basically you know you have [1877] this identity tab you're the customer [1878] support agent for insert company your [1880] roles to interact with customers address [1881] their GRS provide assistance to Common [1882] support topics so in my case I'm just [1884] going to say [1885] one cone focus on customer inquiries [1888] about orders billing account issues [1889] General support don't handle Financial [1891] issues whatever you can customize this [1893] however you want [1895] right you could [1898] say um [1900] interact respond casually as If This [1903] Were A Simple Text convo be Spartan but [1906] also keep your responses very [1910] short and not Mega professional so I'm [1914] going say hi [1918] hi it's Nick how can I help you [1925] today and then once I'm done with that [1927] I'm going to go to add a knowledge [1928] Source what I'm going to want to do is [1930] go to document so I'm actually just [1931] going to add the one cone knowledge base [1933] that we did a second ago this is going [1935] to upload it it can optimize your um [1938] file which is pretty neat I think they [1940] just go through and they compress it [1941] they remove all like the white SP uh [1943] White space they just try and make it [1944] like even shorter so that you can chunk [1946] it um faster and better [1948] so now that it's optimized you actually [1950] have the ability to chat with in the [1951] right hand side I know my ugly face is [1953] on the right hand side so let's move vet [1955] over a bit shall [1957] we let's also move the shadow over [1959] perfect um what you can do is you can [1962] actually test the spot so I'm just going [1964] to test the bot by saying hey what's [1966] up it should respond with that intro [1969] that we suggested [1971] earlier hey it's Nick how can I help you [1973] today right what I'm going to do now is [1974] I'm going to ask something hypers [1975] specific about one con just like I did [1977] before [1978] so I'm going to say [1980] hm um tell me about your [1987] pricing it's going to run retrieval and [1990] give me a bunch of information [1992] specifically about the various plans we [1995] have which is nice so that's cool we've [1997] now replicated the rag functionality but [1999] you can take this arbitrarily far you [2001] can now add this to a WhatsApp bot uh [2003] messenger bot telegram bot slackbot [2006] Instagram bot and many other things as [2008] well grock Google AI um some sort of web [2012] chat like you could do the same thing [2013] that we just did a moment ago um [2015] creating a hosted version of this you [2016] could actually just use this and add [2017] this to your website as well like it's [2019] not it's not very difficult to do [2020] whatsoever but all this is a little bit [2022] beyond the purpose of this video um if [2024] you wanted to do this they actually have [2026] up-to-date video guides and exactly how [2028] to connect Integrations usually involves [2030] some sort of API key on the specific [2031] platform of relevance I'll leave it [2033] there just because I wanted this video [2034] to be short Punchy and also very high [2036] value but yeah that takes us to uh [2039] number [2041] three we are now done with all of them [2044] hope you guys enjoyed the video I had a [2047] lot of fun putting it together if [2048] anybody has questions about what rag [2049] actually looks like in practice or maybe [2051] some more of the conceptual [2052] underpinnings just let me know rag [2053] really isn't that hard to conceptualize [2055] I think it's probably best explained is [2057] just Google over your own search data [2060] connected to an AI model that like [2062] reasons about it but as you can see here [2064] I don't really recommend rag for most [2065] use cases unless you have something [2067] exceptional not to burst the bubble I [2068] just don't really believe in uh in the [2071] hype train stuff um otherwise if you can [2073] do me a big solid check out maker school [2075] it's my day-to-day accountability [2077] program for people that want to start an [2078] automation Agency on their own if you [2080] already have an automation agency if you [2082] have some business experience you want [2083] to take that experience the next level [2085] check out make money with make it's my [2087] uh mid ticket Community essentially [2089] where I help coach and guide you on a [2092] weekly basis we have weekly office hours [2093] and a lot of interactive workshops and [2095] calls that allow you to you know improve [2098] both your general business knowledge and [2099] then your specific automation knowledge [2101] and then otherwise if you guys would [2102] just do me a big solid like subscribe [2103] leave a comment down below with other [2105] ideas for videos because I obviously [2106] sourced this from you guys over the [2107] course of the last 72 hours or so uh and [2109] I will see you on the next vid thanks so [2111] much for your time really appreciate it [2112] take care

Title: How to Build a Website AI Agent in 13 Min (Free N8N Template)
[0] here's how to build a website AI agent [1] in 13 minutes using NAD I find most [4] people over complicate the hell out of [5] it all you really need is a couple of [6] minutes of work and some elbow grease my [8] name is Nick by the way I scaled my own [10] AI automation agency to 72,000 bucks a [12] month using no code tools like nadn and [14] make.com my whole thing has cut in the [16] fluff so let's get right into it so [17] here's the AI agent right here as you [19] can see it's very simple we have a [20] simple AI agent flow with a chat message [23] that goes into this decision maker which [26] calls the open a chap model stores [27] contacts and the window buffer memory [29] and then we have a few tools we're [30] calling the Google Calendar create event [31] Google Calendar get all event that's [33] actually not very important there's a [34] million in one ways to set up agents the [36] thing I want to impress upon you is this [37] looks simple but in reality when you use [40] AI agents in business they tend to be [42] very simple because businesses in [45] practice don't really use these massive [46] waterfall AI agents that you guys are [48] probably seeing with like a million in [50] one nodes where an AI agent calls [51] another AI agent and that a agent calls [53] another AI agent and the reason why is [55] because the output tends to be a lot [57] less predictable and a lot less [58] consistent and if you're business your [61] revenue is driven by consistency you [63] want to constrain the total realm of [66] outputs down to something manageable so [68] this in practice is typically what [69] automations that look that that make [71] money look like um at least the AI agent [73] forms so set your timer let me show you [75] how to build an actual a agent just like [77] you saw in the intro in just a few [79] seconds first things first open up a new [81] nadn workflow click add First Step type [83] the term agent then open it you're good [86] to go next up select a chat model in our [90] case we're going to be using the Open [91] aai chat model and I'm just going to be [92] using the default functionality to get [93] you up but running as quickly as [95] possible going from 0 to one really is [97] the most important thing then under [99] memory select window buffer memory set [102] context window length to 10 you can [104] actually get away with substantially [106] longer because of a trick I'm about to [107] show you now you can chat with this just [109] like you chat with any model click the [110] chat button hey how's it going and [112] you'll see that GPT 40 min will give you [114] a response but the really cool thing is [116] if you go to when chat message received [117] over here you select make chat public [119] public Al available to on what you have [122] here is you have a chat URL that you can [124] actually just link to directly now you [126] have a hosted instance where you can [127] talk to the [130] model now the question is how do we take [133] this hosted instance and then put it on [135] our website I have a website available [137] over here this is my content writing [138] company called 1 second copy before chat [140] gbt came out and you know rose rose to [142] prominence um this was my primary income [145] source and this is sort of how I paid [146] the bills we had a team of very high [148] quality journalists we used some gpt2 [150] and gpt3 uh much older models to [153] basically help pre-draft a lot of the [155] content and yeah it was a pretty solid [156] business what I want is I want in the [157] bottom right hand corner there'd be a [159] little chat widget that pops up like you [160] guys saw so in order to do this if we go [163] back to our NAD and chat agent what [165] you'll see is there a couple of settings [166] on your mode just change hosted chat to [168] embedded chat okay and then head over to [171] this link you scroll down a bit you'll [174] see that there's an option for [175] installation called CDN embed that [178] stands for Content delivery Network and [180] basically what it gives you is it gives [181] you a snippet of code that you can add [182] to any website whether it's custom-coded [184] site a WordPress site a webflow site a [187] wick site square space site whatever the [189] hell you have and all you need to do is [191] copy and paste this in and then replace [192] the web hook URL and you'll actually [194] have a little chat widget built to spec [198] that runs the rest of your flows if we [200] go back over to my actual website config [202] which I'm doing in something called [203] netlify if I go to site configuration [206] and then scroll down to postprocessing [208] there's actually a setting for me to add [209] a of text over here so what I'm going to [211] do is I'll call this NN chat agent paste [214] in the HTML and all I need to do is go [217] back here and get this web hook [219] URL and then paste it here where it says [222] your production web hook [224] URL okay now the way that you do this is [227] going to depend on the service that [228] you're running I mean I'm running this [229] custom website on netlify so it's pretty [231] easy for me all I do is I just refresh [233] the site and now what you'll see is in [235] the bottom right hand corner you have [237] your little chat widget hi there my name [239] is Nathan How can I assist you [240] today so what's really cool about this [243] is this is now running I mean you know [245] it's asking me the same thing because it [247] doesn't have access to this but um this [249] is now pinging the same AI agent flow [252] that we just set up we actually have [253] two-way communication and so you can [255] actually test this you can run this it's [257] live um and the changes that you make [259] over here are going to be reflected back [261] over there now a couple of other minor [263] changes that we want in order to [265] actually have this thing be useful for [266] us the first thing I'm going to want to [267] do is I'm going to want to adjust the [268] prompt a little bit because the way that [270] AI agent prompts work it's kind of [271] unfortunate in N um if you use the [274] default prompting Behavior what you're [275] doing is you're always taking the prompt [277] from the previous node and just [278] recycling it over and over and over and [280] over again there's also sort of a hidden [282] prompt that you don't really see which [283] can Muck up the quality of what it is [285] that you're trying to do so what I [286] recommend is to use this template that [288] I'm about to show you to Define what's [289] called a system message instead which is [292] a static fixed prompt the model will [294] always have access to and then having it [297] take the input from the previous node [299] automatic L and recycling it this is the [301] best of both worlds I've seen a lot of [303] people try to use the Define below [304] section um just by my understanding of [307] the way that these Technologies work [308] under the hood make me feel like this is [310] not the ideal way to do it so I've saved [312] a prompt over here which I'll run you [313] through in a [314] moment and if you want to set this up [316] for yourself I highly recommend just [318] using some variant of this prompt now [320] it's Dynamic so you're going to have to [321] go to [322] expression we're going to need to reopen [324] this and basically the way it works is [327] we say you're a helpful intelligent [328] website chat bot for 1 second copy a [330] Content writing company the current date [332] is now. format y y yymmdd this is just [336] an naden JavaScript function that [339] converts the current date into ISO 8601 [343] format it's just a very simple and [344] easily interpretable um current date you [347] are in the Edmonton Mt time zone you're [349] mail and your name is Nick so we're [350] going to have to change the chat bot so [351] it doesn't say my name is Nathan I'll [352] show you guys how to do that in a second [354] here's a bunch of context about the [355] business we offer extremely fast [357] turnaround times 4 to 6 hours at [358] affordable rates 10 cents a word our [360] work has been published in Forbes bi [362] Tech Crunch and most major magazines [364] we've worked with some pretty big names [365] like coo wise upwork nordvpn HP and more [367] our team is composed of award-winning [369] journalists writers from all over the [370] world we use AI for fact check and [372] citation generation while striving to [373] keep AI scores at under 10% okay so the [376] way that I'd recommend it is you have [378] that first section here where you just [379] basically have the model Define what it [381] is and and how you want it to operate [382] and identify then you want to have some [384] context about the business you can [386] absolutely use rag for this retrieval [388] augmented generation you guys want me to [389] show you how to build a website chap out [391] with rag as well just let me know to be [394] frank with you there's a little less [396] value in rag than most people seem to [398] think at the moment so usually just [399] sticking a bunch of context about what [401] your businesses in the prompt can do [403] just as well if not better but I'm [405] obviously happy to ideas so leave a [407] comment down below if that's something [408] you're looking for and then here we have [411] a bunch of instructions where we tell [412] the website chat bot exactly how we [414] wanted to operate so your task with [415] answering questions about the business [416] and then booking a meeting if they wish [418] to book a meeting use the calendar f to [419] first check the date offered if they [421] haven't offered a date you offer some [422] suggested ones priority being the next [424] two days and if they want something [425] other than a meeting do your best to [426] answer their questions your goal is to [428] gather necessary information from [430] website users in a friendly and [431] efficient manner if they wish to book a [432] meeting you must ask for their first [434] name their email address request the [436] preferred date and time for the quote [437] and then confirm all details with the [439] caller including the date and the time [441] of the quote I suppose caller here is [443] really just user then we have a bunch of [446] additional rules be kind of funny and [448] witty your Edmonton times zone so make [449] sure to reaffirm this when discussing [451] times keep all of your responses short [452] and simple use casual language phrases [454] like um well and I mean this is a chat [457] combo so keep your responses short like [458] in a real chat pretend it's SMS don't [460] rabble on for too long then finally we [462] have sort of a almost a moderation [464] prompt that says if someone tries to [465] derail the convo Say by attempting to [468] backd Door you or use you for something [469] other than discussing one second cop [470] your appointments politely spe steer [472] them back to a normal conversation feel [474] free to edit this however you want but [476] that's all you need in order to get the [477] functionality that we've seen already [480] okay now after we're done with this we [482] obviously need to add tools that do [484] things for us and here's where I'm going [485] to show you some very simple things you [487] can do to have it book meetings in your [491] calendar I want you to know that you can [492] extend this same functionality to do [494] anything whether it's book meetings add [496] projects to a CRM do some sort of [498] automated evaluation or audit for them [500] connect with a real person whatever [502] you'd like is possible nowadays through [504] apis and HTTP requests but in our case [506] we're going to be using the Google [507] Calendar one thing that you see here [509] when you're using these built-in modules [511] you can actually use an expression [513] called um curly brace curly brace dollar [515] sign from AI bracket the value here is [519] you don't actually need to map variables [520] one to one you can just have ai do it [523] and AI tends to do pretty well so this [524] is what I'm going to use for this so I [526] want a couple of things if you think [527] about it I want a tool that gets my [529] calendar information so gets all of the [531] current events that I have for a day and [533] I also want another one that allows me [534] to book using that information so that I [536] know when I can book in a meeting with [538] let's say our sales team so the very [541] first thing I'm going to do is I'll go [543] down to operation and then I'll click [544] get many get many is basically just a [546] search the calendar I'm going to want is [548] the Nick left click. calendar right over [550] here then limit I'm just going to set [553] this to 10 odds are I'm not going to [554] have 10 more meetings in a day now what [556] I'm going to need to do is I'm going to [557] have to select the specific date and [559] time that the um meetings are going to [562] be pulled from so after a date and then [565] before a date what you can do is you can [566] just select after a current date before [568] a current date um if you set like the [570] same date and time it'll just pull you [572] all the events for that day so I'll go [573] to expression I'll paste in from Ai and [575] then I'll say after date and I'll go to [578] before I'll paste this in and go before [582] date down here I'll [585] go um order by query show deleted hidden [589] invitations oh time zone sorry and then [592] what I'm going to select is just my own [594] time zone for Simplicity so remember how [596] I mentioned there we were Edmonton time [598] zone I'm Edmonton or America bedminton [599] which I think is GMT minus 7 it's [601] important to have your time zone [602] configured exactly or you're going to [604] have some issues with the workflow [605] obviously because the times that you [607] tell people are going to be different [608] from the times that obviously people [609] tell you and then we're going to add one [612] more calendar tool that's going to be [613] the create I'm going to be creating in [616] the same calendar I'm checking the start [618] date is going to be from AI start date [622] the end date is going to be from AI end [625] date and there's there's one more thing [627] I'm going to want to do that's move down [629] here to [631] summary and then go um expression [635] meeting [637] summary that way when the AI creates the [640] event we're going to have some sort of [642] meeting summary associated with it oh [644] and there's actually one more we'll do [646] attendees which is right over here now [648] I'm always going to be the attendee and [650] we're always going to have some other [652] attendee which is going to be the user [657] email okay AI is coming up with all this [661] stuff based off of the context of our [663] conversation which is pretty [664] cool okay sweet so given everything that [667] we know now and given how it's set up [670] first I'm going to test this right over [671] here and then I'm actually going to move [672] over after making some changes and test [673] it in the one second copy website [676] anybody's on my website right now that [678] means they're currently seeing it which [679] is pretty neat so let me let me actually [682] just delete all this let me pretend I'm [684] interacting with an agent as if I want [685] to do [686] something hello thanks for this I'm [690] interested in 1 second copy tell me a [692] bit about [693] it it's now going to be pulling in data [697] from the context because it's pulling in [699] data from the context okay the training [701] the samples that we provided directly in [703] the prompt it's going to operate very [704] quickly now in my case it's just pulling [707] data directly from there and just [708] listing them line item by line item you [710] can have it respond to these sorts of [711] queries in a specific way if you want [713] the context window is big enough that [714] you can write whatever the Hell in that [715] system message [721] let's see how it works with the calendar [722] functionality do you want to set up a [724] meeting to discuss details if so I can [725] help you book that sure thing you got 30 [729] minutes sometime in the next few days [732] what's your time [735] zone I'm in Edmonton I can check our [737] calendar for the next couple of days to [738] find a 30 minute slot just give me your [740] first name email let me know your [741] preferred date and time sure thing Nick [743] let's do my main email [747] here and sometime after 300 [751] p.m. tomorrow or the next day when I [755] call this what's it going to be doing [757] it's obviously checking my calendar [758] availability and responding through the [760] model looks like tomorrow after 3 p.m. [762] is booked up for our team however I do [764] have a spot available The Day After [766] Tomorrow March 2nd at 3:30 p.m. does [768] that work for you no it's checking my [769] current calendar and I do indeed have a [771] spot there um does that work for you [773] sure thing could you [775] book and now it'll go through and it'll [778] actually um complete the booking well [780] before it does that it's going to [781] confirm with me great just to confirm [783] Nick Nicholas gmail.com date and time [785] shall I go ahead and book that [786] absolutely thank you now if we enter [789] that out it's now going to be pulling [790] the Google Calendar event and actually [792] going and creating it in my calendar [794] What's really cool is it's going to [795] offer me a meeting link that I can then [797] take a look at so in order for me to do [799] this I do need to open up the specific [800] account that I'm [802] in and voila we now have it right over [805] here meeting with 1 second copy now in [807] my case it's G Nix twice cuz my other [810] email address was Nicholas at gmail.com [813] fed that details in and then it got my [815] picture from Google but um yeah as you [817] can see it's that easy to set up an AI [819] agent that actually does something um [821] realistically all this takes is a few [823] minutes now there are a couple changes [825] that we're probably going to want to [826] make to the AI agent on our live website [828] obviously we're going to want to Brand [829] it a little bit differently and the [831] Agents uh says that it's name is Nathan [833] how can it assist you today now if you [835] want to change the default messages and [836] all of that what you can do is you can [838] actually just add this directly in that [840] code snippet that I showed you guys a [841] moment ago and so you can do things like [843] have some initial messages in an array [845] you can do things like add some metadata [847] the mode and and so on and so on and so [849] forth if I go back in my case to this [852] you can see the create chat function [853] right over here so this is basically [855] what I'd be editing now unfortunately I [858] don't believe I can access the like I [860] don't think I can edit this I think I [862] actually just create a new snippet okay [863] so I just went back in and pasted in um [865] initial messages array being hi Nick [867] here let me know if you have any use and [869] then if we go back here what you see is [871] we now changed the text in the chat box [873] very simple and straightforward super [875] easy to do if you want adjust to adjust [877] more configuration settings just check [879] it out over here you can do things like [881] um change the text add an input [884] placeholder uh I believe you should also [886] be able to change the color yeah right [888] over here with some customization using [889] CSS variables you can make this window [891] look however the hell you want you can [892] brand it entirely on your own and I [894] think you can also remove that little [895] pesky NN message although I don't know [898] exactly where that would be be um any I [900] hope in this video I've at least shown [901] you how to get started with the simplest [903] version of an nadn AI agent website [906] chatot it's nowhere near as hard as most [908] people make it out to be um and if [909] you're smart about how you put this [911] stuff together you know you can take [912] this approach that I just showed you and [914] you can make a couple of Minor [915] Adjustments to it but within 13 minutes [917] or so you can actually have something on [919] a website that you could charge money [921] for you can run custom functionality for [923] that you can actually have access a [924] calendar or adjust a CRM or actually do [927] something with tools so hope you [929] appreciated this video if you guys have [930] any questions about how AI agents work [932] on nadn or how to set up a website [934] chatbot let me know if you guys want to [936] see more videos in similar subjects [937] stuff like rag that sort of thing just [939] drop a comment down below um i' Source [940] most of my ideas for my audience at this [942] point really appreciate all of the [944] continued time and engagement like [946] subscribe do all the fun YouTube stuff [948] that you can to help me get to the top [949] of the ago I'll catch you on the next [951] video cheers

[0] what's going on Steph how you doing [1] today hey there I'm doing great just [5] chilling and ready to how about you what [7] can I do for you today fantastic I'm [10] just looking for a quote for uh my [13] property awesome I can definitely help [16] with that first could I get your full [18] name please my full name do you really [20] need all [21] that well I mean it's kind of like a [25] secret handshake but for CS just helps [28] us keep things organized you know so [30] what's your name okay I'll give you my [32] first name it's [33] Nicholas thanks Nicholas that's a solid [36] name now can I get your address please [39] yeah it's a 100 barard Street do you [41] mind spelling my first name back to [44] me short that's ni h o right no it's ni [50] k o actually [53] oh go n i k or NS thanks for correcting [58] me no when do you want to schedule that [61] quotee got a date and time in mind uh do [64] you mind giving me your availability for [66] I don't know like tomorrow maybe no hold [68] on February the 28th at 3 [72] p.m. checking [74] down great I have some times for you do [78] you have your calendar handing yeah I do [80] I can book anytime let me [82] know also I've got availability to you [85] on February 28th at 9:00 a.m. 10: a.m. [89] and pretty much any anytime after that [90] until 5:00 p.m. what works best for me [94] can we do 9:30 how long are [96] quotes sweet a quote usually takes about [99] 30 minutes you'll be in and out in not [101] time so to confirm I've got you down for [103] February 28 at 9:30 a.m. sound good yeah [107] that sounds [108] good add Dr you've been op do you need [113] anything else while you us uh maybe one [115] final funny [117] joke all right here it goes why did the [120] air conditioner break up with the heater [122] because it needed some space you got my [124] business that's for sure thank you very [126] much Stephen okay so that was Stephen my [128] HVAC booking bot you can set this sort [130] of thing up for basically any business [131] in less than half an hour in this video [133] I'm going to show you how to do it using [134] make and vapy to super simple tools but [137] I'm also going to help instill the [138] principles and strategies you need to [140] really copy and paste this on any no [142] code platform and any voice platform as [144] well let's get into it okay just before [145] I actually go ahead and build it let me [147] run you through what's really happening [148] under the scene so we obviously have [150] some sort of user right that user in my [152] case that's me what I'm doing is I'm [155] speaking into a model now the model [158] itself is composed of a bunch of [159] submodels it's not actually a unified [161] model it's not like we're speaking to [163] one unified thing um we may think that [165] the output is a unified thing but in [167] reality it's working in concert with [169] with four different components the first [171] is we have what's called Speech to Text [173] Okay speech to text is exactly what it [176] sounds like it's a program or in our [178] case probably a very element AI model [181] that takes as input a bunch of speech [182] AKA sound and then it converts it into [185] text speech to text models are also [188] typically called transcription models so [190] you know I say high okay High which is [195] you know high. MP3 It's like a it's like [197] a it's like a sound becomes [199] High um as like a txt and that's all [203] this stt model does after that we now [205] have a big string of text just like [207] anything else so because it's a big [208] string of text obvious L we can now feed [210] it into AI um so after the stt what we [214] do is we feed it into a reasoning model [217] now this reasoning model is usually like [219] GPT 40 mini or something maybe five or [223] six by the time you're watching this who [225] knows maybe AIS have turned the whole [226] world into paper clips and you're [227] actually a robot yourself um so GPT 40 [230] mini basically has some instructions [232] right you are an assistant you do you [238] know book somebody basically [242] here is the prompt okay and then uh [245] sorry here is the input and then what [247] they'll do is you know you have this [248] kind of prepended prompt where it tries [250] to tell the model what to do and then it [252] provides the input which is the thing [254] that we just speech to textify which is [257] high and then it it you know it goes [259] through some big reasoning thing the big [261] neural network and it comes out with an [262] answer okay after the answer well it's [266] one thing to see text on a screen but [267] it's another thing to hear it you know [269] said back to you by an artificial [271] intelligence so what we do is we do the [272] inverse of the St we do a text to speech [276] okay so instead of transcribing we're [277] now taking a string of text we're [279] turning it into a sound so now this is [282] like you know thank you let's [285] say dot um mp3 again now what we do is [290] you know in our case vapy we have some [292] sort of like user interface which [294] sometimes adds an additional bit of lag [296] or whatever but anyway this is basically [297] what's going on under the hood now the [299] reason why these are actually to the [300] point where we can you know have a [301] conversation with them just like I was [302] doing back there is because this whole [304] step here this used to take a very long [307] time [308] okay and now you know when I said a long [311] time I me like 1.5 seconds or something [313] like that um and you can't really have a [314] conversation with a human being at 1.5 [316] seconds it's like [317] hello [319] hello how are you how are you just [322] sounds weird right um now that's kind of [324] down to around 0.5 to 0.7 seconds and [328] now it's like hello hey hey how's it [330] going no no I'm doing great thank you [332] very much how are you doing oh fantastic [333] my wife Stacy just bought me some you [335] know X Y and Z like we're getting to the [337] point where this is actually reasonable [338] but I just want you guys to know that [339] all this stuff is happening behind the [341] scenes and under the hood it's important [342] that you understand that because the [343] vast majority of like um issues with [346] models like this or approaches like this [348] they just stem from one of these could [350] be the stt could be the reasoning model [352] could be the TTS um and I guess it could [354] be the user interface for using VAP or [356] whatever let me actually walk you [357] through what this what this is going to [358] look like now so the very first thing [360] we're going to have to do is we're going [361] to have to set up um we're going to have [363] to set up an assistant vapy so I'm going [365] to go through log out and just pretend [367] I'm making a new account just to show [369] you guys what this looks like in order [371] to do that we just go vy. and we click [375] um at the top right hand corner I think [376] for you it's going to be open dashboard [379] that's going to ask you to sign up okay [382] take you to the same page that I'm at um [383] right now so then you enter your [385] username and password whatever you [387] want then you want to create an account [390] oh sorry I failed my sign up because I'm [391] not actually I don't actually have a [393] username or account at this um email [396] address so now I'm going to put in uh my [398] own username and password we're going to [399] go through their onboarding [401] flow it's probably going to send me an [403] email yep check your email for the [405] confirmation link let's do it just exit [408] out of this I have a million in one tabs [410] open and now uh we're going to confirm [413] the signup so I'm just going to copy [414] this link address and actually go back [415] here and paste it in sometimes you have [417] to do this because the services that [418] you're using re you to um confirm your [421] email in the same tab that you uh [423] requested it in and then on the left [425] hand side here if I just zoom in a bit [426] we got a bunch of different things [427] assistants workflows phone numbers files [429] tools blocks whatever the one you're [430] going to want to use is is this [432] assistance call okay now they'll give [434] you Mary's dental and appointment [436] schedule right off the GetGo just so you [437] could see how this works but I want you [439] to know that like this isn't enough to [440] actually do the thing that I showed you [442] in a moment because this is all on vapy [444] and VAP is great and all but it's just [445] like it's just a conversational model [447] it's an engine if you want to take that [449] engine and if you actually want to do [450] something with it you got to stick it in [451] a car you got to slap wheels on it you [453] got to put a steering uh wheel on it [455] handbrake and all that stuff that that's [456] kind of where a no code tool comes in [458] okay but anyway just to walk you through [460] what I'm seeing here on the right hand [461] side obviously we have the title up here [462] and you can change this title however [463] you want so maybe I'll go back to Steven [466] or something let's call him let's call [468] him [469] George um next up we have the assistant [471] ID all the stuff that occurs that you [474] see written here in sort of monogr or [476] whatever the name of the font is mono [478] code um that has a copy assistant ID and [481] then maybe a little demo button all this [482] stuff is just important for us to to use [484] in the API so anytime you see that just [485] know that like that's where you with [486] your developer hours um are going to be [488] coming in we then obviously have the [490] talk with assistant button we have the [492] ability to check call logs we can [494] duplicate the assistant you can also [496] delete the assistant underneath you can [498] see we have a bunch of boards the First [501] shows us our cost so we can actually see [502] how much cost it it it will take us in [504] order to communicate with the model now [506] this one is 9 cents a minute I just want [508] you to think right now about how much [509] secretary or a front of Staff assistant [511] usually costs it a business front of [513] staff assistants you know can cost [514] between 20 to 30 bucks an hour let's say [516] 25 okay 25 divided by 60 technically [520] puts their hourly rate at um [524] 41666 okay which is 40 cents a minute [526] this model is 9 cents a minute now you [528] might be thinking well actually Nick [529] that's not as big of a differential as I [531] was thinking um and and you'd be right [533] except the way that these models work is [535] you're only getting build when [537] somebody's actually having a [538] conversation with them so as opposed to [540] an assistant that you might hire to [542] manage your front of house that you [543] might have to pay for 80 90% of their [546] time being completely and utterly wasted [549] with a model like this what you end up [550] doing is you only pay when you [552] absolutely have to when somebody comes [554] in and is legitimately looking for [556] somebody at the front of stock so you [557] have no no excess wastage basically [560] you're you're basically capable of [561] keeping your services always on and it's [564] not all or nothing you don't have to use [565] an AI front of St uh front desk agent or [569] um real human being front desk agents [571] what you can do in practice what I see [573] businesses do is they tear it okay a lot [575] of requests tend to come in during times [577] that front desk staff aren't available [579] what you do is you introduce Ai and sort [581] of this 247 omnipresent um um Staffing [585] Agent or booking agent on the hours [587] where the person is not at the desk they [589] could still have requests handled in [591] real time by some sort of assistant to [594] the business and then you know maybe [595] higher Roi queries are directed and [598] handed over to human beings but anyway [600] um I'm getting ahead of myself here the [602] point that I'm trying to make here is [604] this 41c differential if you assume that [607] 70% of time is [608] unutilized what you really end up [611] getting [615] is the actual cost of this agent is more [618] like a dollar sorry the actual cost of a [621] secretary a human one is actually about [622] a138 a minute um and if you contrast [625] that to how much this costs we're at [627] about a 15 times differential so the [629] math equation you should be doing in [630] your head is is this agent 15 times [633] better or worse basically than um the a [636] real human being and if the answer is [638] there's like a smaller differential than [640] a 15x then it's worth it to use [642] something like this okay great so um [645] that's the cost in the left- hand side [646] latency very similar to what we just [647] went through it's about 750 milliseconds [649] right now the time is made up from the [650] speech to text the model that we're [652] using gbd4 mini um the Texas speech [655] model that we're using in this case [656] caresia and then the Mode web um it just [658] takes an additional milliseconds to push [660] it to web but you have a variety of [661] other ones you could use you could do [662] twilio vonish these are just direct [664] sources that typically for my [666] understanding take less time than than [667] the web one does and then down here [669] really is the most important part of our [671] dashboard we have the model so the first [674] message is the very first thing that the [675] model will say when you turn it on in [677] our case it's pre-programmed with hello [679] this is Mary from Mary's Dental how can [681] I assist you today the system prompt is [683] you are a voice assistant for Mary's [684] Dental a dental office located at 123 [686] North Face Place Anaheim in California [689] the hours are 8 to 5 but they are closed [691] on Sundays Mary's Dental provides dental [694] services to the local Anaheim Community [696] yada yada yada y the most important part [698] I find here is if you want these to work [701] well you basically need to bullet point [704] list the steps that you want the model [705] to take and you can't have too many I've [707] experimented with like seven eight and [709] they tend to get lost and muddled just [711] because these models don't really have [712] very good long-term memory my [714] recommendation is keep it to three to [716] four maybe U make sure that you're [718] getting the full name you know make sure [719] you get the email if you get the email [721] make sure the user spells it out letter [723] by letter and that you have some sort of [724] prompt to say it back obviously go nuts [727] here the purpose of this is just to get [728] you from zero to one and then uh you [731] know have something in there that says [732] that this is a voice conversation keep [734] your responses short like in a real talk [736] don't ramble because otherwise you know [738] we tend to use all of the tokens that [739] are given to us and that does two things [741] one outputs take a little bit longer [742] when you use all the tokens um so the [745] conversation is going to seem as if you [746] are like it's going to be more similar [748] to talking to a it's going to conform [749] people's expectations and they have to [751] wait a little bit which kind of sucks [752] you know the whole point of this is to [753] make them think it's a real person uh [756] and then two it's going to favor casual [759] language stuff like you know um well I [761] mean maybe yeah kind of right these [764] little mannerisms and and so on and so [766] forth that make people think it's a real [767] human [768] being okay great um then up here you can [770] choose the actual model you want to pick [772] so in my case I'm just defaulting to [773] open AI GPT 40 mini you can also add a [775] knowledge base although keep in mind [777] that at least in my experience when I do [778] this tends to be a little bit slower [780] because now we have to run what's called [781] retrieval augmented generation in [782] addition to this but super easy it's one [785] click right just click add a new [786] knowledge base and then um the [788] documentation here allows you to pick a [789] file upload it and go from there then [791] you can you know change the temperature [793] max tokens and they have the ability to [795] detect emotion I don't recommend this [797] feature just because you can get the [798] vast majority of the data you need just [799] through text and it's going to be a lot [800] faster because of it so we have a bunch [803] of other settings here I'm just going to [804] gloss over them um until we get to the [805] one that's really important just because [807] feel free to check this out in your own [808] time there's a lot of cont text here [810] most definitely um you know you can [812] choose the voice and so on and so forth [813] what I'm going to do is I'm going to go [814] down to functions because functions is [816] sort of how we put the chassis around [819] our agent so for instance let me just [821] talk with this right now okay and I know [823] that it's George we're using a [825] professional woman for now I'm just [827] going to say Mary I'm going to talk with [829] it I'm just going to ask it a couple [830] questions ask it to do things for me [832] okay and I just want you guys to see [833] what it what it [837] does oh this is Mary from Mary's Dental [841] how can I assist you today hey Mary I'd [843] like to book an [845] appointment awesome let's get you in [848] first things first what's your full name [850] it's Nicholas [852] sarif nice to meet you Nicholas what's [855] the purpose of your appointment I feel [857] like I have a root canal issue and I [859] want an appointment with a [863] consultation root canals can be a pain [865] in the tooth now when do you want to [868] come in for that consultation I'm [870] thinking February the [874] 23rd cool and what time works for you on [877] the 23rd let's do 2 [880] p.m. good so just to confirm you're [884] booked for a consultation for your root [886] canal on February 23rd at 2 p.m. sound [889] good yeah absolutely thank you Mary [891] anything else I need to [894] do Nicholas just bring your Charming [897] self and we'll handle the rest have have [899] a great day thank you very much I [901] appreciate it so that sounded great and [903] you'll know that it was extraordinarily [905] confident in telling me that I'm booked [907] in and all that stuff the unfortunate [909] reality is nothing happened so how do we [911] actually bridge that Gap how do we get a [912] model which may be a great conversation [914] partner to actually go and do things in [915] the real world well that's where a tool [917] like make.com comes in okay so the way [920] that vapy allows you to add the rest of [923] the elements to this [924] car is using um this functions tab and [929] they've since launched an additional [931] feature or they've changed the feature a [933] little bit so instead of being called [934] functions they're now called tools let [936] me run you through how they work and [938] exactly what you need to do to get up [939] and running so the very first thing I'm [941] going to do is I'm going to select [942] create new tool tools are functions you [945] make that can be utilized by your [947] assistant in calls you can connect [949] external automation tools like make go [951] high level or create custom tools for [953] assistants to use let me click new tool [956] here what you'll see as of the time of [958] this recording anyway we all know that [959] these tools change very frequently so if [961] it doesn't look just like this don't [962] worry too much we have three options we [965] can choose a custom tool a make.com [967] scenario as a tool or go high level now [970] they're probably going to be adding more [971] native integration Partners over the [973] course of the next little bit but for [975] now we're just going to use Custom Tool [977] because if you think about it if you use [978] a Custom Tool and you figure out how all [980] that stuff works odds are you're going [981] to be able to do anything else cuz [983] custom tools are the hardest okay so I'm [985] going to head over to my make.com [988] scenario over here let me just make a [990] new one and I'm going to organize my [992] stuff in this folder called vapy voice [994] agent this was a tool that I just built [996] earlier today to verify that everything [998] was good what I'm going to do now is I'm [1000] going to rebuild both of these so I [1001] could show you guys how to get and book [1002] calendar events and I'll also give you [1004] some top level instructions on how to do [1006] other things as well so we'll go one [1009] YouTube Tool I'm going say get calendar [1012] event so if you think about it logically [1014] in order for us to make some sort of [1017] actual business bot some sort of [1019] conversational thing that does something [1021] we kind of need at minimum two features [1023] at least for a front uh desk staff [1025] member we need the ability to get [1028] calendar events so things that are [1029] currently booked in a calendar for a [1031] specific date and time and we also need [1033] the ability to create a new calendar [1035] event at minimum now there are certainly [1038] other things you might want to add in [1039] the future like the ability to delete a [1041] calendar event or the ability to [1043] schedule maybe a recurring calendar [1045] events or higher level functionality but [1048] basically every everything there all of [1050] the the additional functions that you [1052] might want they're just like [1053] permutations of these two things they [1055] they permute on the ability to get a [1057] list of stuff from your calendar then [1058] add something to your calendar make a [1060] change to it okay so we're going to [1062] cover these two and then you guys can go [1063] nuts after that the very first thing you [1065] need in order to make a tool in vapu [1067] work so we need to click on this little [1069] purple button here just type in web hook [1072] okay logically in order for us to have [1076] this connect to make.com we need to have [1078] some something that's listening some [1080] sort of web hook listener and I realized [1081] I clicked the wrong button actually [1082] don't click web hook response click um [1085] custom web hook right over here we're [1087] then going to create one I'm going to [1088] call Mine vappy [1089] YouTube it'll say one and now we're [1092] going to have an address here that I'm [1094] going to copy to the clipboard I'm going [1096] to head back over to my vapy assistant [1099] and I think I have two tabs open here [1101] right okay yeah I do so I'm going to go [1102] to this one because this is my new bot [1104] where it says Custom Tool I'm going to [1106] paste in the server URL for my endpoint [1109] now there are a couple of gotas here so [1111] um you know if you're watching this [1112] video because you've tried doing this [1113] and you've had some issues let me walk [1115] you through exactly how this looks it's [1117] going to ask for a server URL secret [1119] token I leave that out it's going to ask [1121] for timeout seconds I leave that out [1122] headers I leave that out just click save [1125] from here what you have now is you have [1126] your server URL basically this is an [1129] accessible tool that you can send stuff [1131] to but what we need to do is we need to [1133] define the data that we're going to be [1135] sending right so obviously if we're [1137] going to be asking our tool to check the [1140] calendar we're going to need to provide [1142] it some sort of date and that's where [1143] this next step comes in so I'm going to [1146] call this date time just in case the [1149] person asks for a time I'm just going to [1151] say actually no let's just do date um [1153] because even if the person asks for a [1154] time why don't we just get all of the [1155] calendar information then from there [1157] we'll be able to determine the free and [1158] busy times and then profer something [1160] back that probably makes more sense next [1162] in natural language we need to describe [1164] what the property is now a big issue [1167] that a lot of people have with VAP [1168] unfortunately is when they try and do [1170] these calls their date always comes out [1172] crazy wrong formatted and it's just it's [1175] I don't know sometimes it says February [1176] 27th written out other times it's I [1179] don't know 02 0225 or something like [1181] that you know they're all these [1183] different date and time formatting so I [1185] prefer to standardize them I'd say the [1187] date and time let's say the date [1190] provided in [1192] ISO 8601 format ISO 8601 format is just [1199] one of many standardized dates that you [1202] can write this is what it looks like and [1204] is this an XKCD ril or something like [1207] that I don't know it kind of looks like [1208] one but this is how ISO 8601 format [1212] looks like the good news is I've tested [1214] out um iso8601 with a variety of models [1217] and like 99.9% of the time this is all [1219] you have to say and it'll do it right so [1221] for instance you know this would be [1223] February the 2nd February the 27th 2013 [1226] it's kind of interesting how I just [1228] mentioned February the 27th like 10 [1230] times and this ended up being the date [1231] that they provided me as an example odd [1234] but anyway um so Define the date very [1236] strictly and it'll make everything a lot [1237] easier for us later okay so the date [1240] provided in ISO uh 6 8601 format it's [1245] going to be required okay and we click [1247] next now we need to call this tool [1250] something I'm just going to say get [1253] calendar [1255] availability I'm going to say don't ask [1257] again for the session dash line before I [1260] um eat a shoe uh describe the tool its [1263] purpose its use Etc what we're going to [1265] have to do here is we're going to have [1266] to say what the tool does so this tool [1269] gets calendar [1271] availability from the HVAC Central HVAC [1276] booking calendar [1278] okay it takes as input a date formatted [1282] in ISO 8601 [1285] format constructed in ISO 8601 format [1288] and returns a string of availabilities [1292] the assistant can use to [1295] book a new [1298] appointment I'm going to click next here [1300] and now we have the ability to send some [1302] start messages delayed response messages [1304] success messages and error messages now [1306] these are uh pretty misunderstood I [1308] would say my recommendation here is [1309] leave these all extraordinarily brief [1311] because if you don't sometimes the model [1313] is going to add a bunch of additional [1315] words to the beginning or or immediately [1317] after and the context is isn't going to [1318] make much sense these are always going [1320] to be the same things every time [1322] basically so you just want to make them [1323] seem incidental for instance start start [1326] message for me my best results have [1328] always been if I say something like [1330] booking now or something or or in our [1332] case it'll be I'm checking now delayed [1335] response message could be as simple as a [1337] hm success message could be like got it [1342] an error message might be like give me a [1345] minute and what you'll see is I'll show [1348] you examples of this but when things [1349] work okay so first of all the model will [1352] say you know oh what times are you [1354] available what times you want me to [1355] check oh February the 27th okay great [1357] let me check that checking now right [1359] even if it says the word check before as [1361] long as I keep the start message really [1363] short it actually doesn't sound super [1364] weird it can actually be sort of [1366] conversational or a success message [1368] right checking now H got it right that [1370] actually sounds reasonable if instead [1372] you said something like I have acquired [1373] a list of events for your calendar then [1375] it'll say like you know I've acquired a [1377] list of events from the calendar [1379] um the list of events from the calendar [1381] says and it just seems kind of weird it [1383] seems kind of inhuman so fortunately for [1385] us the design of this is just as [1387] important if not more important than the [1388] actual technology underlying it and you [1390] just want to make sure that the [1391] packaging is is really nice okay so we [1394] have the date over here um awesome I'm [1396] just going to refresh this tools [1399] board and then I'm going to set up the [1401] calendar [1402] availability what we're going to do is [1405] this is my tool called get calendar [1407] events the very first thing that always [1408] do here is actually just check to see if [1411] I can receive and then send back data so [1413] receive we're going to we're going to [1414] test that in a second to send back what [1416] you need to do is you need to use the [1417] web hook response node and you always [1419] need to return things in Json now [1421] another big gotch that a lot of people [1423] have with this is they don't realize [1424] that vapy requires a specific format um [1426] if you haven't uh constructed Json [1428] before just head over to vapy Tool [1431] structure there'll be [1433] a uh piece over here I think I'm going [1437] to find it for us [1439] anyway okay right over here um with a [1442] result uh parameter inside it'll be an [1444] array of tool call IDs and then results [1447] so in order for this to work we actually [1449] have to copy this and we have to use [1451] this as the body okay just like this now [1454] tool call ID is actually going to come [1456] directly from the model in order for us [1457] to run this and test this we actually [1459] have to screw up once and have an error [1460] so let me show you what that error looks [1462] like I'm going to run this now I'm going [1464] to go back to [1465] vappy go to my new super beautiful [1468] assistant [1469] Mary and we're actually going to um try [1472] and call this basically try and call the [1474] calendar booking so in order to make [1476] this work I need to click publish now [1477] you need to go over to functions and [1479] then you need to go down to get calendar [1481] availability actually add this so now [1483] I'll click publish this is going to [1485] publish the model that now has access to [1487] this get calendar availability tool and [1489] now when we have a conversation with it [1491] it'll [1493] know this is Mary from Mary how can I [1497] assist you today hey Mary I want to [1499] check availability on your calendar for [1501] February the [1504] 27th February 27th well I can totally [1507] check that for you just give me a sec to [1509] grab the schedule one moment checking [1512] now give me a [1514] minute okay so do you see what I mean [1516] with these short error messages right it [1519] tends to add a lot of information before [1521] and after the um templated bit so if you [1524] keep them shorter results are usually [1526] substantially better but anyway that's [1527] not the most important thing the most [1529] important thing is we just received data [1531] and then we sent it back using make so [1533] we've caught it and then we've we've [1534] returned it if I go and make here you'll [1536] see that we now have a message object [1538] that's coming with a timestamp type [1541] bunch of objects the one we want here is [1543] called tool calls then we want to map [1546] this ID as our tool call ID and then [1547] inside a function what we have is we [1548] have the argument we have the specific [1550] date that we actually provideed and fed [1551] into our calendar right right over here [1553] okay so how do we actually make this [1556] work with our flow well the very first [1557] thing we have to do is you have to map [1558] the specific tool call ID stick it right [1562] in there now it's going to know what the [1565] call was it'll return the answer to the [1567] specific call the next is we need some [1570] sort of result so I'm also going to [1571] hardcode this in just to show you guys [1573] what it looks like I'll say free from 2 [1575] p.m. to 5:00 p.m. and then I'll have the [1578] model tell me this just to verify that [1580] I've gotten the information through so [1581] I'm going to run this once always [1583] testing every time I make a change [1588] hello this is Mary from M Dental how can [1592] I assist you today could you check the [1593] calendar for February the [1600] 27th how are we [1602] looking so I've got some availability on [1605] February 27th from 2: p.m. to 5:00 p.m. [1610] pretty Swit right need to book an [1612] appointment super sweet thank you Mary [1615] you'll have to forgive these models [1616] sometimes they can be a little bit [1617] boisterous an [1619] enthusiastic okay so as we saw there it [1621] said checking now got it another design [1625] pattern that you might want to use is [1627] when there's a success message you might [1628] want to ask the user for something [1630] additional right otherwise they might [1631] just wait there and say got it okay so [1633] what does that mean so for instance um [1635] just because the way that these models [1636] work you can't just double up to two [1638] messages one after the one after each [1640] other maybe you'll be able to do it [1641] eventually but right now it basically [1643] always needs to be some sort of back and [1644] forth between human being and model so [1646] what you could say is you know okay [1648] checking now got it do you have your [1650] calendar open then the person goes oh [1653] yeah I have my calendar open and then [1654] Mary will automatically start providing [1656] the times that were available but anyway [1658] so um you know we we've determined that [1660] we can return data right now the data is [1662] just hardcoded so obviously we need real [1663] data right how do we actually get real [1665] data well in make it's pretty easy um [1667] you can just go to your Google calendar [1669] and there are a couple things that you [1669] could do you could search events um you [1672] could make an API call you could get [1674] free and busy information there variety [1677] of ways um if I use the get free and [1679] busy information this seems like it' be [1680] the most straightforward one but it's [1681] actually kind of annoying we have [1683] minimum time and then maximum time and [1685] the way that this works is you basically [1686] have to feed in okay you have to feed in [1689] the date which is nested under function [1691] and [1692] arguments and then for maximum time what [1695] we have to do is we have to add one day [1697] to that okay so realistically we have to [1700] check for all events on the [1701] calendar and you know what I might [1703] actually set hour of this to [1706] zero and set hour of this to zero as [1709] well I don't really [1711] know why we had so [1713] many um we had such a snippet there okay [1717] great so uh now that we have this just [1720] double check in the formatting is good [1722] yes it is um we're going to need to add [1724] the specific calendar so in my case this [1725] calendar over here save and now okay [1729] what I have the ability to do is now I [1730] have the ability to check my calendar [1732] for this particular date I'm going to [1733] right click this run this module only [1735] and I'm actually going to verify that [1736] the date works so 2025 O2 um 27 that's [1740] my ISO 8601 [1743] format it seems like we have some error [1745] with the way that I formatted this so [1747] let me just double check so set hour I [1749] got the date then I set the hour to zero [1751] that's fine set hour zero right so I [1753] should have added [1757] this and [1759] then realistically I should have added a [1763] um zero then I should have added one [1766] there we go okay let's feed this back in [1770] the date that I'm feeding in is going to [1771] be this awesome now I'm getting 11: p.m [1774] just because of my time zone and the [1775] fact that make formats this in a really [1777] annoying way um you know it's it's not [1780] always like this so we don't worry too [1782] hard it's just because of where I am [1784] specifically at this moment in time make [1786] is not the best at showing you the [1787] specific date that it's actually picking [1789] um but anyway we've gone through our [1790] calendars here and we found that I'm not [1792] busy at all on this stretch of time [1795] which is fantastic for me basically [1796] means I'm free the entire day right [1798] so um what do we want to to happen when [1801] we get that well there are a couple [1802] things that I could do like I could just [1803] return the busy information but [1806] realistically I find that the vapy model [1807] that we're using is not the smartest so [1809] I actually like to do a little bit of [1810] processing myself using AI on this route [1813] so what I do is I actually use the [1815] create a completion [1816] model and then I'll pass in the free and [1820] busy information into another model then [1822] I'll have that other model tell [1824] me whether or not you know I'm free or [1826] busy or whatever on that day so I will [1829] literally go like [1831] this I'll give it its own instruction so [1834] now we're kind of training an additional [1836] a model together I'll say you are a [1839] helpful intelligent booking [1842] assistant say appointment booking [1844] assistant We'll add a message here under [1847] user your task is to take as input a [1851] list of busy times and return as output [1854] a list of free [1856] times we're [1859] typically available a string of free [1863] times set plus we're typically we're [1864] always available between 900 a.m. to [1867] 5:00 [1869] p.m. you'll [1871] receive busy times as [1874] Json return free times using this [1878] format free [1881] times let's get availability [1885] string free between dot [1889] dot use natural language awesome now [1893] what I'm going to do is let me give it [1896] um yeah let me actually just add [1899] the let's say busy [1903] information now what I need is I need [1905] some busy information here now there are [1907] a variety of ways you could do this you [1908] could parse this out as text or you [1910] could just dump this in um as is I [1912] believe I'm not entirely sure to be [1913] honest uh we'll probably have to parse [1915] the Json so why going to go back one [1918] more step here then I [1920] go let's go just Jason node uh Jason [1923] module let us transform to Jason just [1928] going to pass in our busy [1934] time now we are getting a date that I am [1937] not actually busy in so I should [1938] probably get something that I'm busy in [1941] uh O2 I think I'm probably busy on the I [1944] don't know what day is it today 26th [1946] okay so it looks like I did not get the [1948] busy information why is that uh oh right [1951] I need to defeat the first element of [1952] that array my bad and please stop [1954] talking Mary smart and lovely as you are [1957] you actually need to go in here need to [1959] feed in this whole busy object it looks [1965] like get these output [1967] bundles if I just feed this in [1971] instead and I run this but [1976] then sorry what I actually want just [1979] want I want this whole thing if I run [1981] this is this going to work it's my [1984] question uh looks like it's transforming [1986] my actual Json into adjacent [1990] string that's not what I wanted let's [1993] try that one more [1997] time cool awesome so I now have my dates [2000] which is great okay as we see here it's [2004] basically saying that we [2006] are busy from 1700 hours um GMT to 1800 [2013] hours GMT I'm now going to connect this [2016] over and I'm just going to dump this in [2018] plain text Jason's usually the simplest [2020] way to do all of the stuff but I'm just [2022] going to dump this in plain text I'll go [2024] GPT 40 mini and I guess I have to [2027] rewrite the prompt unfortunately so I [2029] must have deleted it by accident your [2031] task is to take is input a bunch of busy [2034] information and output an availability [2037] in natural [2041] language this is a string containing [2045] free info like free between 12:30 p.m. 2 [2050] p.m. cool now I'm going to feed as input [2054] another user prompt and then I'm going [2056] to say busy stick in this big long fat [2059] string this model is going to then [2061] process the information and all I want [2063] is I just want to feed in the result [2064] here okay sounds pretty simple to me [2067] let's give this run and let's see how it [2071] goes hello this is Mary from Mary's [2074] Dental how can I assist you today hey [2077] Mary I'd like to book an appointment I [2078] just want to double check your [2079] availability for February the 27th can [2081] you verify that before we [2088] proceed okay how are we [2092] looking looks like I couldn't find any [2094] availability for February 27 want to [2097] pick another date or should I try a [2099] different day I'm just realizing here [2101] that this model did not receive the you [2104] are always [2106] open [2108] um your hours of operation are yeah [2112] that's why I kind of screwed up [2116] there do not return anything but the [2119] Json string and when I'm all actually [2122] also going to do it's going to return [2124] everything in Jason parse Json response [2127] kind of God here what I actually want is [2129] I want [2130] um result do availability [2135] times should be good [2139] now yeah that should be fine okay and I [2143] don't really like how the tool keeps on [2146] returning um checking now H got it do [2150] you have your calendar [2154] open um checking now got it do you every [2157] count open H okay should be [2161] fine so now I'm going to run this one [2163] final time that didn't work just because [2165] the Jason that we sent back was very [2167] ugly um and now we're going to save this [2170] go back to our lovely assistant then [2173] we're going to talk with [2174] her hello this is Mary from Mary's [2177] Dental how can I assist you today hey [2180] Mary I'm looking to book an appointment [2182] but I'd like you to check your calendar [2183] availability for February the 27th [2185] before we do anything else [2188] oh sure let me just grabbed that info [2191] for you but hey before I check the [2193] calendar could I grab your full name yes [2195] of course it's Nicholas and my address [2198] is 100 barard [2202] Street do you have your calendar open I [2205] do what times are you [2207] free well we're wide open from 9:00 a.m. [2210] to 5:00 p.m. except for that sneaky hour [2213] from 5: to 6: p.m. so what time works [2216] best for you that doesn't make much [2217] sense are you free at 5:00 p.m. or are [2220] you busy at 5:00 [2222] p.m. haha good catch we're actually busy [2226] at 5:00 p.m. so I can't squeeze you in [2227] then how about an earlier time like 9 10 [2230] or maybe even 3 what do you think sure [2232] 3:00 sounds [2235] great awesome okay so we're going to [2238] need a little bit more prompt massaging [2239] to make that work iron clad like my [2241] first example with Steven but as you see [2244] we are now Trucking along we're actually [2245] making some pretty solid progress so so [2247] I'm going to copy this now and we're [2249] going to make our second tool which is [2251] going to enable us to actually book The [2252] Event so I'm going to move over to vapy [2254] voice agent here we have the book uh [2256] YouTube Tool get calendar events I'm [2258] going to have another one here called [2260] YouTube Tool get calendar uh sorry book [2264] calendar events what I'm going to do is [2266] I'm going to paste all this [2267] in then go back to vaapi head over to [2271] tools now I'm just going to make the [2274] exact same thing as this tool over here [2277] um we're just going to make one small [2279] change and that's instead of get [2280] calendar availability it's going to be [2281] called book calendar availability so [2283] just to make my life [2285] easier uh I'm just going to copy [2289] this yeah just going to copy this and [2291] then let me just double check so [2292] checking now got it do you have your [2293] calendar open give me a minute okay [2296] we're going to Custom [2297] Tool um I need to feed in this endpoint [2301] meaning I need to create a new [2305] one and I really need to name a [2307] convention for this stuff as you guys [2308] could tell and paste in that server URL [2312] save now we can move on to the rest of [2315] this we're going to take as input a date [2318] um date constructed in ISO 8601 format [2323] so you can see here [2324] [Music] [2327] our [2331] date our date looks pretty good let's [2334] move over here we'll call this book [2336] calendar event [2339] books a calendar event using the central [2343] booking calendar takes us input a date [2345] construction iso8601 format and [2350] returns it's code if booked [2354] cool all [2356] right start message will be booking now [2359] delayed response message will be H [2361] success message will be like okay you're [2364] all booked and good to go [2367] do you have anything else you'd like to [2370] do today the error message will be the [2373] uh I kind of forgot what I put last time [2375] but I think it was something along the [2376] lines of sorry having some trouble [2379] booking this would you give me a [2383] minute the value there is somebody will [2385] respond with okay sure and then the [2387] model can actually rerun um without [2389] having to do too much work okay let's [2391] head back over to this assistant now [2393] let's go to functions and actually add [2394] our book calendar event as a function [2396] let's then publish this [2398] in the scenario here we're actually [2399] going to have to catch this but if you [2400] think about it we're no longer getting [2401] free or busy information we've already [2403] verified that the data is okay so [2405] actually what we have to [2408] do if I just turn off this [2412] alarm what we have to [2414] do is we have to take in [2418] our date which should already be an ISO [2422] 8601 format and we just have to book a [2424] Google Calendar event so I'm going to [2426] create an event [2428] now in my case I'm using my own calendar [2430] but feel free to use whatever calendar [2431] you [2432] want duration I'm just going to say 30 [2435] minutes the start date I'm going to be [2436] grabbing directly from the web hook okay [2438] so for now I'm just going to say um I [2441] don't know 2025 0227 and let's just go [2444] 300 p.m. for now I'm not going to be [2447] passing any any information in aside [2449] from just consultation and the calendar [2451] ID is going to be my actual calendar [2452] this one here we can also create it in [2454] detail or you can do it quickly in [2455] natural language if you wanted to [2457] sorry I think this is actually 0030 for [2459] half an hour right yeah HH stands for [2462] hour 30 that would be minute okay cool [2465] me check the advanced settings see if [2467] there's anything else obviously I could [2468] add more data if I want but that's that [2472] then going to add a response we're going [2474] to need the tool call ID and the result [2476] is booked successfully obviously the [2479] idea is if you don't get the response [2480] you haven't booked it [2481] successfully um aside from that yeah I [2484] just I need to find a way to get the [2485] actual start date in from from the [2486] calendar right so that's going to be uh [2488] embedded in the args I [2491] believe um let me just see what I did [2494] back here message tool calls function [2496] argument state right okay great so I'm [2498] actually just going to feed that in [2499] directly so that we can do this all in [2500] one shot okay great now I'm going to run [2503] this now we're going to go through the [2504] whole booking flow with vapy um from [2507] start to [2510] finish right hello this is Mary from [2513] Mary dville how can I assist you today [2517] hey what's going on Mary can you tell me [2520] how I book an [2522] appointment oh booking an appointment [2525] and brushing your teeth just give me [2527] your full name first yeah it's Nicholas [2534] sarf just looking to book a root [2541] canal well let's get that sorted when do [2544] you want to come in what's your [2545] preferred date and time would be [2547] February the 27th somewhere in the [2551] afternoon you have your calendar open [2554] yeah I do what times are we looking [2556] at okay so on February 27th we have [2560] openings from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. [2562] except after 5:00 p.m. what time in the [2565] afternoon works for how about [2568] 3 perfect so just to confirm your [2572] appointment is for a rig Canal on [2573] February 27th at D sound good yeah [2576] that's up sounds good to [2579] me okay you're all booked and good to go [2582] do you have anything else you'd like to [2584] do today no I think that's it thank you [2586] very much I appreciate [2589] it you bet you're all set Nicholas have [2593] a great day don't forget to [2595] floss we'll do awesome so as you can see [2599] there uh We've now actually connected [2601] this engine stuck it in a car and then [2604] gave it Wheels we gave it the mech [2607] mechanisms that it needs in order to get [2608] out there and interact with the real [2609] world in our case we had two tools one [2613] allowed us to retrieve events from a [2615] calendar and then get the availability [2617] as you see you need to finagle and kind [2619] of massage natural language so that it [2620] doesn't do things like return you to [2622] availabilities um that are technically [2624] the same time although maybe some of [2626] that is due to some booking convention [2628] and then we also uh built-in [2630] functionality that enabled our bot to [2632] book a new calendar event in now I was [2635] just naming all of these simple things [2637] like consultation right you can imagine [2640] a flow in vapi where you go to the tool [2644] that you want and instead of just [2646] providing the date you also do things [2648] like you provide the full name okay the [2651] full name of the [2654] patient you know maybe you also do [2656] things like provide the email address [2660] email address of the patient right these [2663] are all questions that you add in the [2665] prompt as your agent interacts with the [2667] person and the the value here is um now [2672] you can connect vapy and make to other [2674] tools that automatically have some [2675] functionality they might want for [2677] instance like a Google Calendar where [2678] once you create the event you actually [2680] automatically send them an invite now [2682] they have it on their calendar just like [2683] you do too some of the stuff is a little [2685] bit more advanced but hopefully at this [2687] point you guys Now understand the [2688] building blocks necessary to get out [2690] there and make a highly proficient [2692] booking agent we're just at the point [2693] where the technolog is getting where [2695] where we can make this stuff actual [2697] business utility so my recommendation [2699] for you is start building these flows [2701] out even if you don't necessarily need [2703] them get comfortable with these voice [2704] spots and have the infrastructure in [2706] place so that when the opportunities [2707] inevitably do come and these models get [2709] even better and they start getting [2710] deployed all over the world and small [2712] and midsize businesses want more of them [2714] you can be ahead of the curve you can be [2716] the one that already has all of the [2717] infer built out can provide it very [2720] easily hopefully you guys appreciated [2721] that video had a lot of fun walking [2723] youall through it if you have any [2724] questions about this just let me know um [2726] as you probably do know I do get most of [2727] my questions at this point from my [2729] audience uh I do get most of my video [2731] ideas from you guys I should say so if [2732] you guys have anything that you want me [2733] to do that I haven't already just drop [2735] it down below more than happy to [2736] otherwise if you could give me a big [2737] solid like subscribe do all the fun [2739] YouTube stuff to bump me up to the top [2740] of the ago I'll catch you on the next [2742] video bye

Title: YouTube Sucks for New AI Automation Agencies (Avoid This)
[0] I think YouTube is a terrible idea if [1] you're just getting started as an AI and [3] automation agency owner and this video [4] is going to convince you as to why and [6] this is coming from somebody that scaled [7] his own Ai and automation agency to [8] 72,000 bucks in a month so I feel like [10] my opinion here is somewhat credible [12] we're going to do this whiteboard style [13] as per usual and really there are three [16] main reasons why YouTube absolutely [18] blows I'm going to go through all three [20] of them in time so the very first and [23] most pertinent one I think for most [25] people is as this brightly red clock [28] probably alludes to it is that it takes [31] a lot of time and it takes a lot more [33] time than you probably think if you're [35] going to start content for anything [37] whether it's an an automation agency or [39] an SEO company or I don't know a flying [42] saucer reporting business it's going to [44] take a very long time to see any sort of [47] result if I make a quick little graph [50] for you and I'm going to draw a couple [52] in this video but don't worry not too [54] much this is in grade [55] school this is my graph and on the left [57] hand side here is money and at the [60] bottom here is time basically the amount [63] of money that you make over time with [65] content is something like this okay and [70] this may seem like a lot of money until [72] I make a little Legend here and all of a [75] sudden you see that this point on the [76] graph you know is is [79] $1 so the reason why I draw it this way [81] is because I just wanted to show you [82] guys that for the vast majority of the [86] life cycle of your business producing [88] content you are going to produce less [91] than a dollar this might be 90% of the [94] total amount of time that you're running [95] a company you're going to produce less [96] than a dollar the only time in which you [99] know this might actually start being [101] worth it might be that last 10% of the [104] life cycle of of your company okay [106] that's how it worked for me that's how [107] it worked for tons of other people [109] that's how it is currently working for [110] tons of other people that's how it's [111] going to continue to work so the first [113] reason why is because it takes a while [116] and most people misunderstand just how [117] long it takes just to give you guys a [119] practical example for my own business um [121] you know this is my own YouTube channel [122] the one that you're watching right now [123] right we hit 52485 subscribers as of the [126] time of this recording I have no doubt [127] it's probably a lot higher by the time [128] that you're watching it but if I just [130] zoom in here really quickly I want to [131] show you guys my first 30 days of [134] recording I published a video every [136] single day from February the 7th all the [138] way up until March the 8th I believe is [140] when I started um you know taking breaks [142] and not being a uh complete psychopath [145] about this but every one of these videos [147] was 30 40 50 minutes long [150] it basically took me something like 14 [153] days of posting half an hour to an hour [156] worth of content every day which might [157] have taken even longer than that to [159] record if I wasn't smart about how I did [160] it before I saw any sort of traction at [163] all what do you think that you could do [165] yourself with that amount of time I mean [168] even if it takes you I don't know 3 [170] hours a day or something like that to [172] produce this level of content what do [174] you think you could do in 14 days or [177] so if you didn't spend all that time [180] making content okay in that first time [183] up until I don't know like three4 of the [185] way through I hadn't even made a dollar [186] of AD Revenue it was only in my 20 [190] whatever day that I started making any [191] money with ad Revenue whatsoever and you [194] know one thing this graph doesn't show [195] you is how YouTube basically immediately [197] retroactively took away my ad Revenue [199] again and I was making like $10 a day [201] for for the vast majority of my lifetime [204] I didn't make a single dollar off of [205] this channel until this point and then I [207] barely made any money off of this [209] channel until at least a few months [211] later when I started finally getting a [213] high enough volume for inbound leads to [214] kick in now this is a pretty exceptional [217] Journey if I'm honest and I'm trying to [219] show this to you guys as a negative case [221] most people will make a tenth if not if [223] that many subscribers in their first [224] month of posting content um I've tried [227] YouTube a number of times before so I [228] obviously have a like up that's probably [230] the the least likely thing to happen to [232] you to be honest so you know just just [235] to debias you it just takes a while it [237] almost always just takes a lot longer [238] than you think I've coached over 1,400 [240] Ai and automation agencies at this point [242] in time well at least that's how many [243] people are currently in my programs with [245] churn and stuff like that I think it's [246] like 1,850 or something but um it it it [250] always takes way longer than anybody [252] expects when they make content when they [254] make a video on YouTube when they start [255] pushing out shorts or whatever to see [257] any sort of result and if you start with [260] content you basically have to commit to [261] the fact that for the first 90% of your [264] life cycle you're going to be making [266] less than basically $1 okay the area [269] under under this curve might amount to [272] 83 cents or something and it might [274] require you know 900 hours of your time [278] so it takes a takes a really long time [279] that's number one okay the second is you [283] are [285] biased this is a psychological effect [288] known as the frequency effect and it's [290] currently duding you into thinking that [292] YouTube is something that makes sense [294] for your business and that you should do [295] today in Li of some other Outreach [296] methods which I'm going to show you in a [298] few minutes the way that the frequency [300] bias Works in Psychology is if you see a [303] lot of something you're more likely to [305] tend to believe that it occurs very [307] often but the reason why you think that [310] content is the go-to for the automation [313] agency space especially if you're at the [314] start line is because you have [317] essentially been bought into an [319] algorithm that shows you a bunch of [321] people making money in the AI and [322] automation agency space so you think [324] that it is disproportionately likely [326] that you'll be able to get out there and [327] make money with um AI and automation on [330] YouTube as well the unfortunate reality [332] is this frequency bias is at the heart [336] of a number of common misunderstandings [339] like why do people [341] think [342] airlines are more [345] dangerous than cars well the reason why [349] is because when you get into a car crash [352] okay you don't make the global news but [354] when any airplane anywhere in the world [356] even so much as you know skids on the [358] runway a few times there's bound to be [360] 101 news reports about it so you as [363] somebody that might consider getting on [364] an airline at some point in time see the [367] news report and then you start freaking [368] the hell out and you think oh my God [369] airplanes are so much more dangerous [371] than cars when in reality okay Airline [374] danger is like an order of magnitude [377] safer than cars these are supposed to be [380] less than simples not [382] noses um anyway so the point that I'm [385] trying to make is the exact same effect [387] that makes 90 whatever perc of people [389] misunderstand and miscalibrated their [391] fear of flying versus driving is the [394] same effect that makes you think that [396] starting a YouTube channel for your AI [397] and automation agency at the start line [399] makes any sense at all unfortunately it [403] doesn't the first the third reason I [405] should [406] say is that you don't have social [411] proof [413] okay and this is still under [416] time when I say you don't have social [418] proof I mean if you just started this [420] new business you basically have no proof [422] that you've actually done anything cool [424] about it and if you don't have any proof [425] that you've done anything cool about it [427] there's no reason for anybody to listen [428] to you because the way that content [430] currently works is there are a million [434] and one people trying to cram ideas down [438] your head right now [441] okay that's you really sad if you [443] couldn't tell there are a million in one [445] people talking in all of your ears all [448] the time and the only way that you as a [451] responsible consumer of the web operate [453] is you look to see which one of these [456] people actually has proof that they've [458] done the thing that they're talking [459] about who actually has Authority or [461] credibility okay so if this dude has [464] made 100K you're obviously much more [466] likely to believe what they have to say [470] take their advice and then ultimately [472] use it to make some money but if all [473] these other people you know 5K or they I [476] don't know they've never made any money [478] or they've made I don't know negative [479] money or there's just there's just no [481] case study or any sort of proof here [483] obviously you're you're going to tune [484] them out the way that you operate here [486] is exactly the same way that anybody [488] that watches your content is going to [489] operate so if you don't have anything [491] notable if you don't have any [492] accomplishment you're going to be lost [494] to this big Vortex of a million other [496] people screaming through megaphones that [498] you know don't don't really make any [499] noise the point that I'm trying to make [501] is there's a much more effective path to [503] Growing big on YouTube it's what I did [506] it's where you go and Achieve something [508] in the field that you are interested in [509] being renowned in so in my casee it was [511] the AI and automation space you go and [514] Achieve something 72,000 bucks a month [516] with your AI on automation agency [518] $43,000 uh I don't know 1,850 coaching [521] students whatever you do something cool [523] that's notable that sets you apart and [525] now you have some sort of credibility to [527] actually be taken seriously when you [528] talk about the freaking thing okay so [531] the reality is you don't have social [534] proof because you haven't spent any time [538] trying [542] and if you are at the start line of your [545] business you have to [548] do [549] before you [552] talk and if you talk before you do it [556] becomes very clear that you don't really [558] know what you're talking about you [559] haven't you haven't really done the [560] thing there are a million billion people [562] here this is the 99% this is the 1% over [565] here so much StraightLine path to being [567] big go do something with the time that [569] you would otherwise spend talking about [570] it and then you can come back and talk [572] about the thing that you did and then [573] you get to double dip because usually by [575] the time that you've done something [577] notable you don't have to spend all day [578] doing that thing you have a little bit [580] of time freed to be able to focus on [581] YouTube or other content production uh [584] or other lead generation research and [586] development and then you can actually [587] loop back around and you know start [588] claiming a bunch of wins with the [589] success start standing out and your [591] growth will be a lot easier it's not [593] going to be like most people's growths [594] on YouTube okay it's going to be more [595] like this AKA [597] mine okay that's enough of me clapped my [599] dick on the table let's talk about the [601] second major reason which is as I'm sure [606] this probably implies money so you know [611] how earlier I said it takes a long time [612] to make even a tiny bit of money with [614] content well the reality is per unit of [617] your effort there are many other things [619] that can make you a lot more money but [622] even if we leave the opportunity cost of [625] the equation out and the opportunity [626] cost for unfamiliar is how much money [628] you could have spent doing something [629] else and that's what I'm going to talk [630] about over here even if we leave out [632] opportunity cost okay it actually still [634] takes a fair amount of money for you to [636] do this thing to begin with everybody [639] will tell you that like gear doesn't [641] matter okay like your production value [642] and stuff like that doesn't matter the [643] reality is gear actually does kind of [645] matter it matters a bit it's not a ton [646] but it does matter a bit so if you want [648] gear you know you usually have to Shell [649] out a few hundred bucks before you have [650] something reasonable something okay I [652] would say so you're going to be in some [653] sort of like C cost you know capital [656] investment phase for quite a while until [657] you see some sort of recoup on that and [659] considering how long it takes to make [660] even a dollar you know if you spent I [663] don't know $750 just buying a bunch of [666] gear and some microphones or whatever [667] like 90% of your business you're [669] technically going to be in the red here [671] okay that's a big capital investment for [672] somebody that's just starting out in a [673] business that has no liquid business uh [676] sorry liquid capital or any sort of [677] business experience or whatever so so it [680] costs a lot of money okay the second is [683] that there is well I shouldn't say no [686] but there [687] is no [689] good [692] path from content to [695] client people don't really talk about [697] this a lot but the path from content to [700] client especially if you're new and you [701] don't really know what the hell you're [702] doing sucks this is essentially referred [705] to as your funnel it's actually hard to [706] make a good funnel um if you want to do [709] provide uh you know a automation agency [711] Services it's easy to sell like info [713] products and templates and stuff like [714] that like I'm doing right now but you [716] know when I started with this and I [717] started getting a ton of implementation [719] clients I tried to selling a l retainer [720] it's actually really difficult to do so [723] why well because you're a noob and [726] because if you're a [729] noob you don't really have like you [731] don't know how to [732] productize so you have no productization [737] probably you have no established sales [741] process you really have nothing none of [745] anything I don't know what that was but [748] that most certainly is not what I wanted [749] to [750] do okay I'm going to have to [752] unfortunately give this a little refresh [754] here because every now and then when I [756] um zoom in super fast it bugs out like [759] that yeah so you have no established [761] sales process [763] right no [766] funnel no products [769] basically no nothing so what happens [772] when you actually have a [775] lead when a lead comes your way [780] well you'll be able to extract like one [783] one [785] 100th of the actual value of the lead [788] that you otherwise would have if you had [790] done something else first and figured [792] out how to build all of these funnels [793] and build uh you know strong productized [796] uh recurring Services as part of [798] something like my program maker school [800] for instance um if you'd actually gone [802] out and talked to customers [804] okay you have nothing if somebody's [806] interested in working with you you're [807] almost certainly gonna fumble the ball [809] and then you'll just have wasted a lead [810] that might have been willing to pay you [811] $20,000 but now we'll pay you some [813] pittance $2,000 of that or or something [816] okay there's no use if you don't know [818] what you're doing just just jumping into [820] content because now you're going to be [821] talking about something you don't deeply [822] or fully understand then you're going to [824] be selling to an audience and attempting [826] to imply that you do uh you're not going [828] to be able to offer a good quality [830] service you're not going to be able to [831] do anything it's just you don't want to [832] do you don't want to do this sort of [834] thing people when you come um inbound [836] they look to you as an authority they [838] look obviously to you is person that's a [840] little bit higher up on the hierarchy if [842] that makes sense of service providers [843] that they could pick from um you don't [845] want to be misleading them like that [847] okay so it's a poor path from content to [849] funnel for the vast majority of people [851] that's just that's just how it [852] works um another big reason is you [858] know you [860] think you're saving [863] money because you know the [865] alternative to creating content a lot of [868] the time [870] is uh you know you you you I don't know [874] do some sort of ads or you do some sort [875] of like uh like Outreach like I'm going [877] to show you in a second you do some sort [878] of cold email you do some sort of any [880] one of these millions of things and and [882] you think hey content's great especially [884] if I'm bootstrap in this business [885] because What's the total cost of the [886] content production well you know aside [888] from that one-time capital investment of [890] me having to buy the equipment or or [891] whatever maybe you already have the [892] equipment if you're lucky aside from [894] that I basically just transfer time into [897] content and then the content makes me [898] money passively so the actual startup [899] cost is very minimal so you may think [902] you're saving [903] money but you're not you're actually [905] sacrificing a ton of [908] time and the um cost of how much time [913] you are investing in this thing that has [915] no guaranteed returns and no real proof [918] uh demonstrable Roi is sort of like I [922] don't know if you guys ever seen that I [923] think it's like that Calvin meme um [925] where the guy's peeing into a well or [928] something like that this is this is [930] basically you man you are taking all of [933] your money [935] okay and you are just peeing directly [940] into some well where you'll never see [943] the pee again okay my analogies are [944] definitely falling off here um I'm going [947] to leave it there you have [949] essentially uh a capital investment that [951] you most likely have to make in terms of [953] getting some sort of gear you have a [954] poor path from content to client funnel [957] you have uh you think saving money but [960] you're not because of the opportunity [961] cost of what you could be using all of [963] that time energy and money for um to get [965] much faster essentially Returns on your [967] investment so as this little diagram [971] alludes to the third main factor and why [975] I don't recommend YouTube for a [977] automation agencies is you just have so [981] many better [984] options okay like this charming young [987] gentleman I'm assuming he's young and [990] Charming uh has here you know you have A [992] B C or D you have okay you have cold [996] email which delivers much higher returns [999] for newbies you have upwork which [1001] delivers much faster returns for newbies [1004] you have communities which is quasi [1006] social media anyway but much [1008] straighterline path then you have a [1011] variety of other you know approaches [1013] like LinkedIn [1014] DMS um Twitter [1017] DMS variety of other things which I'll [1019] get into so you have so many better [1021] options the opportunity [1024] cost of [1027] content is killing [1032] you one of the big issues I see in my [1035] communities especially recently because [1037] everybody and their mom starting to make [1039] videos around software platforms like [1040] nadn for instance is they will pour four [1044] to six hours a day of their lives into [1047] producing content and trying to convince [1049] people of something kind of like what [1050] I'm doing now to be honest um when they [1053] have [1054] no uh when there are so many other [1057] options they could be taking that have a [1059] higher expected value so uh if you're [1061] unfamiliar with expected value expected [1063] value is basically what is the [1065] percentage chance that I will win okay [1069] times what is the expected [1073] payoff of the thing when I do win so for [1076] instance let's say okay you expect or [1080] anticipate content to make you $10 [1084] million what is the actual chance that [1086] you'll succeed here it's very low very [1088] very low [1090] 0.01 time 10 million is 100k [1094] okay compare that to something like [1098] let's say cold [1100] email the expected value of succeeding [1103] at Cold email might be much lower it [1105] might be $1 [1106] million but the percentage chance that [1108] you win might be 15 15% if you do the [1113] math the expected value equation now [1114] comes out to 150k even though the total [1117] payoff of choosing to try content and [1119] become a big YouTube influencer or [1121] something like that even if the total [1122] payoff is much higher $10 million when [1124] you multiply It Out by How likely it is [1126] to actually happen you end up with about [1128] 100K of value whereas this cold email [1131] approach which seems annoying and and uh [1134] spammy and you know it seems low value [1136] and it seems silly and it seems uh like [1139] what everybody else is doing to make [1140] money even if that has a much lower [1142] expected value here okay the probability [1144] of that working out is much higher so um [1146] this is basically always going to be the [1148] winner winter chicken dinner so I use [1150] this expected value framework in order [1153] to determine uh which action to choose [1156] or which lead generation method to to [1158] choose all the time and content's one of [1160] those situations where you typically [1162] have very high payoff okay but as I [1166] mentioned only if you are in the top 1% [1169] of content producers right the top 1% of [1172] content producers make 99% of the [1174] content then they make 99% of the money [1177] 99% of the content producers make 1% of [1179] the content 1% of the money so this is [1181] this is where it's at this is where I [1183] hope to be very soon but even I you know [1186] I anticipate the likelihood of me [1189] achieving something like that is pretty [1190] low which is why I still hedge my bets [1192] and I have other things going on that [1194] don't necessarily only rely on content [1197] okay so that's just cold email for [1198] instance um upwork you know if I were to [1200] show you guys a quick example of this [1202] upwork is an even crazier example is [1204] it's it's almost guaranteed maybe it's [1206] like 0.5 okay but the prob you know the [1209] actual total amount of money you might [1210] make on upwork is a lot lower but still [1212] you end up making more [1214] money still ends up being a higher [1216] expected value than something like this [1218] you know if we kind of rank this as a [1219] tier list this would be the [1222] worst this would be kind of second then [1225] this one at least the time of this [1227] recording would be kind of the first [1229] okay so um that's the first thing I [1232] wanted to talk about in relation to [1233] other options the other thing I wanted [1234] to talk about was this community [1237] approach if you've never heard of this [1240] then I'll tell you about it right now [1242] but basically communities are like [1244] content but better in basically every [1247] way for [1249] beginners so if you're unaware of what a [1253] community is just to make this a little [1255] more practical just open up your browser [1257] and head to school.com you'll be taken [1259] to sorry open up your browser go to [1263] school.com Discovery you'll be taken to [1265] a page that looks something like this [1267] where basically there are communities [1270] created all over the world for anything [1272] that you could possibly think of and [1274] these communities what they are really [1276] is they're mini social media platforms [1278] they're like a mini LinkedIn like a mini [1280] YouTube like a mini Twitter but they're [1283] filled with people that only do the [1285] thing that you actually care about okay [1287] so I don't know if you are a [1288] videographer I always use the [1289] videographer examp but if you are a [1291] videographer and maybe you do primarily [1293] weddings or something like that what you [1294] can do is you can join a wedding [1298] videography Community okay or you could [1301] join the 15K filmmaker Community or the [1304] wedding filmmaker Academy okay let's do [1307] this one for instance what you'll get if [1309] you get in there this lovely guy [1311] Alexander and his team they're probably [1313] successful videographers that work [1314] primarily with people in the you know [1316] people looking for weddings stuff what [1317] you get is you just get a buch of people [1318] that are already in your Niche that [1320] basically want exactly what you'd be [1321] talking about anyway so what the [1323] community approach is is it's posting [1325] content but it's posting content on [1327] places where the people that you're [1329] talking to are much more likely to want [1331] what you have anyway so instead of doing [1333] something like posting aimlessly on [1335] YouTube to an audience that probably [1336] doesn't give a crap about you to be [1337] honest where you have no proof or [1339] established expertise or or anything [1341] like that well you can do is you could [1343] just post in communities like this [1344] instead all day you can do the exact [1347] same thing you otherwise would it on [1349] your social media but you can go so much [1351] easier faster um and and more [1354] effectively to the top okay communities [1358] are a fantastic business model I run one [1360] right now just called maker school and I [1362] see people in maker school all the time [1365] start posting and providing value [1368] talking about their experiences about [1370] their accountability okay and the second [1373] that they they do stuff like this uh [1375] after you know a week or two weeks or [1376] three weeks of being consistent about [1378] and actually talking about things that [1379] people care about providing real value [1380] in in the content that they produce they [1383] they inevitably get picked up they start [1384] doing work they start uh building [1386] business Partnerships and relationships [1388] basically doing all the stuff that [1389] you're probably looking for by starting [1391] YouTube just in a very compressed uh [1394] compress time scale okay and I honestly [1397] think that all of the time like if I had [1399] access to communities back when I [1400] started YouTube I would have eventually [1401] started YouTube anyway but I definitely [1403] would not have before I'd you know [1404] squeeze as much value as I possibly [1406] could have out of the community approach [1408] so basically I guess what I'm trying to [1409] say is you know if you are planning on [1411] doing YouTube content instead of doing [1413] YouTube content as total beginner do [1415] communities first do that for a few [1417] months okay build up some brand [1418] Authority and notoriety build up a bunch [1420] of connections build up communities are [1422] basically like the I don't know if you [1423] guys have ever played runes Gap it's [1424] like the lumbridge training grounds okay [1426] of content it is so much easier to kill [1429] the monsters over there it's it's so [1430] much easier to gain expp and level up [1433] your RPG character uh it's it's you know [1437] every step you take is like on that [1439] airport treadmill that sends you uh you [1442] know three times as far or something [1444] like that in the same amount of time if [1445] you do it in the community versus if you [1448] just start blasting content out on [1449] YouTube to basically fight in this this [1452] big Battlefield that you don't [1453] understand that has so much happening [1454] behind the scenes that uh makes the [1456] likelihood of you actually achieving [1458] what you want very very low okay so [1461] variety of other things that you could [1462] do the really cool thing about running [1464] an Aon automation agency is basically [1466] any lead generation method that we have [1468] we can immediately put on autopilot [1470] using um you know Ai and automation [1473] approaches using large language models [1474] and using no code tools so if you guys [1477] do anything else here these approaches [1480] are going to be 3 to 10x as powerful as [1483] if some marketing agency or some [1486] consultancy or or something like that [1488] tried to do the same thing you have a [1489] hell of an opportunity with this stuff [1491] and that opportunity just doesn't really [1493] exist with YouTube to be honest because [1495] you still need to for the most part [1496] record like a real human being's face [1499] so you know I don't mean to [1500] disincentivize you or crush your hopes [1503] and dreams um I just want you guys to [1505] have a realistic idea of what's going on [1507] behind the scenes when you choose to you [1509] know create a YouTube channel or try and [1511] get clients for Content uh sorry for an [1513] AI automation agency using content you [1516] know I had a pretty easy way with it all [1518] things considered basically everybody [1520] that started around the same time as me [1522] that tried doing the same things as me [1523] has had a substantially harder time to [1525] do it so whether it's because of [1527] pre-existing skill or whether it's just [1529] because you know eventually you strike [1531] uh oil when you hit a vein in a [1533] particular place I don't know but um [1535] these sorts of results that you see [1537] every day are probably biasing your [1539] expectations towards thinking you're [1540] going to win quicker than you actually [1542] will my recommendation for anybody [1543] that's at the start line is to go back [1546] to that expected value section where I [1548] ran you through those equations and look [1550] for options that you can do today that [1552] have the highest likelihood of [1554] succeeding even if they don't [1555] necessarily have the highest payoff [1557] because the higher the likelihood of [1559] success the more you can at least start [1560] accumulating some wins and then start [1562] getting into a place where you have the [1564] ability to you know show off one of [1566] those accomplishments like we talked [1567] about earlier monetarily or otherwise [1569] then you have something that makes you [1571] stand out that's unique in the market [1572] and once you have that you can worry [1574] about YouTube Once you have that you [1575] could start creating content on LinkedIn [1577] or Twitter or something of that nature [1579] um but my my Earnest recommendation what [1581] I always tell to every one of my members [1582] in maker school and make money with make [1584] is is don't do that yet right wait until [1586] it just gets marketly easier because [1588] you've actually achieved something of [1589] value awesome hope you guys appreciated [1591] that video I wanted to do an FAQ sty one [1593] today just because I've been getting a [1595] ton of people asking me exactly this [1596] question across all of my channels this [1598] one my daily update uh you know I'm [1600] having some people ask me this question [1601] on my on my new podcast with Matt Larson [1603] as well um so I'll leave it there but if [1605] you have anything else that you guys [1606] want answered in this style with the [1608] Whiteboard just drop it down below we're [1610] happy to do so I really appreciate all [1612] of your guys' comments and encouragement [1614] uh on every video that I put out so much [1616] love to everybody that's been doing that [1618] if you you just do me a solid and [1619] subscribe if you haven't already that [1620] would uh take me to the moon really [1622] appreciate it and have a lovely rest of [1623] the day I'll catch you on the next video

Title: Step-by-Step: N8N Webhooks (From Beginner to Pro)
[0] web hooks in nadn can be extraordinarily [2] powerful but a lot of people [3] misunderstand how they work so in this [4] video I'm going to run you through [5] everything you need to know about the [6] nadn web hook game to crush it let's get [9] into it so I'm going to get into the NAD [10] and canvas in a second but just before I [11] do I want to talk a little bit about [13] what web hooks even are because I feel [15] like in n8n and a lot of no and low code [17] tools in general there's a big [18] misunderstanding so to make things [20] extraordinarily simple all web hooks are [23] okay is they are messages they're nicely [27] formatted messages but they're messages [30] so if you have two apps let's just call [32] this app a and over here we'll call this [34] app B all the web Hook is is this just a [36] message from maybe app a to app b or [40] from App B to app a just a text you know [43] a very specifically formatted text it's [45] like if you are going to the grocery [47] store and you see your friend's [48] ex-girlfriend or something and you're [49] like hey I just saw Stacy at the store [51] right that that is the web hook it's [53] just we're formatting in a very [54] particular way so to make this a little [56] more practical since we're using a no [58] and lo code tool presumably for the of [60] business let me just cover a set [62] examples but let me just do one so we [64] can actually jump into building uh let's [66] say this app a here is I don't know it's [68] like an email client okay so this is [72] your email client I don't know it's your [74] Gmail your outlook or or whatever um and [78] basically what happens is when I get a [79] new email right what I'll do is I'll [82] send a web hook this is a very common [84] flow a lot of businesses do exactly this [86] I'll send a web hook over to let's say [89] appb as your C CRM you know when I get a [91] new email what I want to do is I want to [93] add some data to my CRM I do that using [96] a web hook so um this is your new email [99] you go to your email client you [100] configure some web hook then you send it [102] over to your CRM and what you do is you [104] add a new record maybe with like the [106] email address which is encapsulated in [108] the web hook data um I don't know the [111] first name right last name all sorts of [115] stuff I can tell my writing is kind of [117] getting doctor scrawly so I'll stop [118] there but essentially that's web books [120] are they're just little packets of data [121] that we send to and from apps now the [124] reason why uh they've become so [126] prevalent in the 2020s and Beyond is [128] because we are we're kind of getting in [130] the habit of integrating things right [132] and the purpose of a no or low code tool [134] kind of in its core is to glue a bunch [136] of different platforms together so [137] naturally web hooks are a core part of [138] how you get really good with these [139] things so you know whether you're using [141] make.com or zapier or Hell any no or [144] loow code platform you're going to be [146] you're going to have web hooks uh naden [148] exposes web hook functionality to us in [150] a couple of simple ways the first is we [153] have the ability to catch a web hook [156] that's what it is called when you [158] receive one of these messages using the [160] web hook node and we also have the [162] ability this is sort of um Advanced I'm [166] going to show you it right now anyway we [167] also have the ability to send data from [170] nadn to the source that sent us the web [173] hook to begin with so basically respond [175] to an incoming web hook now we're going [177] to cover how this works in a moment um [179] but essentially these two pieces of [181] functionality nowadays are like a core [182] part of how the internet operates and [184] they're one of the reasons why inid in's [185] great because they allow you to very [187] quickly and easily slot into any app [189] whether or not it has like a built-in [191] integration if we click on this little [193] button and we search for actions yeah [195] don't get me wrong there are quite a few [196] actions here maybe a few hundred but [199] there are many more apps than this out [201] there on the internet and if you want to [202] be able to integrate all of those apps [204] together well you can't just go down [206] this list because the vast majority of [207] them don't exist what you need to do is [209] you need to find some sort of custom way [210] to do so web hooks are that custom way [212] and that's what we're going to be [213] covering all right so now that we're [215] done with that brief little intro let's [216] talk about how web hooks actually work [218] in NAD so to make a long story short we [221] use this web hook node okay and [223] essentially if I just Escape out of that [226] let me organize this as naden course [228] essentially all a web hook node in naden [231] does is it exposes a custom URL for us [236] I'm using nit in Cloud which is why my [237] URL looks like this Nix r.a. ncloud you [240] may be using a self-hosted version of [242] nnn so yours will look a little bit [243] different and if yours says a local host [246] we'll chat about it at the at the end of [247] the video how to route requests to Local [249] Host specifically for self-hosted setups [251] usually they use like Docker or whatever [253] but essentially all we've done by [254] creating This na uh web hook node is we [257] just exposed the URL we now have a URL [260] basically that you can send or receive [262] data to with in order to trigger [264] something or or glue we've we've created [267] a little Lego block almost right and I [269] just just want you guys to think about [270] that we've created a Lego block that you [271] can uh use to connect to other Lego [274] blocks and further your build so a bunch [276] of fields here the first is test URL [278] versus production URL a lot of people [280] misunderstand this um essentially test [283] URL is just what you should use before [285] you've made your workflow live before [287] it's in production before uh you know [289] you're actually implementing into a [291] business your business or somebody [292] else's okay this test URL is always [295] going to have a web hook- test somewhere [298] in it if we move over to produ you'll [300] see that the web hook- test is replaced [302] with just web hook but you'll notice [304] that there's kind of a pattern here [305] right sure web hook do uh- test went to [308] just web hook but basically everything [310] else stayed the same the reason why if [313] we just scroll past this HTP method yet [315] is because we've set a path here and the [316] path Remains the Same regardless of [318] whether it's test URL or production URL [320] the really cool thing about the path is [321] you can actually make this whatever you [323] want so I could call this my super cool [326] web hook listener for instance right you [329] have total control over what you want [330] that path to be any who let's get back [333] to this test URL let's just leave this [336] as some super big long totally custom [339] not at [340] all um you know I mean maybe it's not [344] super randomized I bet you the incidents [346] of the F A and S and D characters are [348] probably much higher than all the other [349] characters on here just because that's [350] where my fingers are but hey what are [351] you going to do um next we get to the [354] HTTP method field if we scroll through [356] here you'll see that there are a variety [358] of what are called Methods using HTTP [360] HTTP being a protocol called the [361] hypertext transfer protocol which is [363] just a an agreement that a bunch of [365] people had you know 20 or 30 or maybe [367] even 40 years ago now I have to double [369] check on just how two uh computers might [372] interact and so there are a bunch of [374] these agreed upon mechanisms there's [377] delete there's get head patch post or [379] put in practice the two that you're [381] probably going to be using the most [382] often are get and post and basically [385] every time that you send a request in on [387] the internet using http you'll have some [390] sort of method attached to it and what [391] we can do here is we can just say hey I [393] only want you to respond or only want [395] you to proceed if you receive a request [397] that is formatted using one of these [399] methods AK the method I specify so in [401] our case you know we're responding to [403] only the get method so if you try and [404] send a request using uh I don't know [406] patch or put or post or delete in then [409] end you're actually not going to trigger [410] the flow and I'll show you what that [411] looks like in just a minute okay then we [413] get our path field which I've already [414] talked about next we get our [416] authentication field now the [417] authentication field is common [419] misunderstood first of all you know [421] because NAD defaults to authentication [423] you see when I created this it [424] immediately went to hetero modern people [426] think you need authentication for web [427] Hooks and if you don't it's necessarily [429] bad practice or whatever it's not [430] actually bad practice I don't use [432] authentication in a lot of my web hooks [434] um I don't I don't use it here I might [435] have some filter or something like that [436] that just like does not allow requests [438] to come in uh but typically when you're [440] testing you know I typically test with [441] no authentication that's what I'm going [442] to build the flow out here with and then [444] I'll show you how authentication [445] actually works better but basically if [447] you think about it because you're [448] exposing this URL to the internet [449] internet ni. appcloud webhook test if [453] you think about it anybody can access [454] that URL and anybody can send a receive [456] a request to it so authentication is [458] just a way that you say Hey you know I [461] don't want everybody to be able to do [462] this I'm going to make a secret little [464] password and if you don't have the [466] secret little password then my web hook [468] listener is not going to actually [469] trigger the flow sounds pretty simple [471] right variety of ways to do this there's [473] basic off header off uh you know Json [477] web token off there there are a variety [478] of of different ways to do this um these [481] specific ones here aren't super [483] important I just want you to think about [484] it as like a password example when you [485] knock on a door once the secret password [487] if you don't have it we don't do [488] anything then the last parameter or [491] field here is how you want to respond [494] there are three different ways to [495] respond on Ed end there's immediately [497] which means the second that we receive [499] the request we respond there's when the [501] last node finishes so if in our workflow [504] we build out a massive you know list of [506] I don't know 30 or 40 or 50 noes we'll [507] actually wait until that last one's [509] ready [510] and then using the respond to web hook [512] node which is that node that I just [513] showed you which is really what the bulk [515] of this video is going to be about it's [516] going to it's going to be how to respond [518] to web hook events with presumably [520] whatever data we want um how how to do [522] something and then and then send things [523] back so I'm going to be covering all [525] three of these in a moment last but not [527] least we have some options I'm not going [529] to cover all of these because in [530] practice they're not super important but [532] I usually recommend turning on ignore [534] Bots there's also uh I don't know raw [537] body Response Code you could tell the [540] server that sent the request how you [542] want to handle it if you want to say hey [544] this succeeded hey I've created the [546] request but haven't done anything with [547] it hey there's no content the request [549] was processed but nothing happened hey [551] this is a redirect 300 series hey this [553] is a bad request it's unauthorized it's [555] forbidden you have the power to [557] basically control how your little [560] endpoint responds to incoming requests [563] now for the most part presumably you're [564] going to want your responses to be 200o [566] 100 you're going to want them to do [567] something I'll show you what this looks [568] like okay so knowing that we have this [572] web hook now that is set up okay how do [574] we actually go ahead and Trigger that [575] web hook well here's one thing that the [577] vast majority of people don't know right [579] because this is a URL right just like a [582] just like Google you can actually access [583] this just by like navigating to it in [585] your browser it's by far the simplest [587] way to do so and when you navigate to [589] something in your browser you just send [590] it a get request so let me show you what [592] this looks like you see I'm just going [593] to click to copy this Web book URL I'm [595] going to listen for a test event move [597] over here and I'm actually just going to [598] open up a new tab and enter and notice [601] what we got back we got in the standard [603] format ad Json JavaScript object [604] notation that says message workflow was [607] started now if I go back to this tab [609] what you'll see is we now have a ton of [611] output if I change this to schema just [613] it's a little bit easier to see you can [614] see that we've received a number of um [617] objects we received a headers object [620] this is all of the data from my browser [623] while it was visiting this resource [625] we're sending in what kind of computer [628] I'm using the various user agent Fields [632] the browser that I was using um you know [634] what what sort of data I accept all the [636] stuff is obviously defaulted by my [637] browser what sort of encodings right [640] there's a cookie there's um an IP [643] address that tells me what country I'm [645] in for Christ's sake it's really cool [647] right we get all of that data from the [649] browser but we also have a few other [651] objects here there's one called pams [652] which is empty but this is a way that I [654] could send or receive data to this web [656] hook just using my browser which I'll [657] show you guys in a second now there's [659] query and then there's body and then we [663] also return back the web hook URL and [665] then we also have an execution mode [667] which we can use to test whether or not [668] something is is in production or you [670] know whether or not it's uh whether or [672] not it's live basically okay so I just [674] want to cover a couple of these output [676] objects because these are really [677] valuable when you're building your own [678] um web hook flows in particular these do [682] pams and then query I'm going to start [684] with query but essentially all query is [687] if I test this workflow again [689] all query is is at the end of my URL I [692] see up here at the top of the page if I [693] just put a question mark and then I put [696] a variable name then an equal sign then [699] some [700] value if I press [703] enter what I've done is I've actually [705] sent a data packet that contains the key [709] name of first name and then the value of [711] Nick to this web hook we can actually [714] see this if I close this out scroll down [716] a query notice how we now have a [719] variable basically inside of our web [721] hook so we've essentially used our [723] browser to almost act like you know a [725] server or some sort of client or [726] whatever and then we've actually used [727] that to send our web hook this perfectly [730] packeted nicely formatted [732] data so the query object is one way we [735] can do this with web hooks you can also [736] do it another way and I don't really use [738] this way but to be clear these are both [739] basically equivalent there's very little [741] of a difference in practice um what you [743] do is use what are called Dynamic paths [746] so let's say my web hook Ur is the same [748] okay [749] but um what what you can do is you can [751] have it listen for a parameter that is [754] that is put in if I have my path Here I [757] Go slash then I have uh actually let me [761] do this if I [764] have I don't know static [770] path okay if I have um this right over [774] here this little colon what I can do is [777] I can essentially add another variable [778] in called in my case static path okay so [782] I have the power to put a variable in [784] that when the browser accesses the thing [787] uh using like I'll show you actually [788] uses this format and then puts something [790] in here a name or a variable whatever I [792] can actually get that returned as static [794] path in my case why don't I go first [796] name that seems like it' probably be a [798] little cooler then we'll go last name [800] like this [802] okay if you don't fully understand this [805] then just watch that test event let me [807] paste this in just instead of first name [809] let's go Nick instead of last name let's [810] go my last name saraf so now we just [813] sent data again to this web hook if I [815] open this up we go down to headers what [818] you see is now under pams we have first [819] name Nick and then last name Sur so all [822] we're doing here is we're actually just [823] being a little bit more restrictive with [824] the values that you can send we're [826] basically saying hey you can only put [828] those values in the first kind of backs [830] slash or first slash section of the URL [832] and then um that has to be your first [834] name and then the second slash section [835] has to be your last name so in practice [837] I personally don't really do this what I [839] do instead is I just do uh I'm just [842] going to put this in here so I have some [843] sort of param but I almost always just [846] use the query parameters so I will [848] actually just type in the name of the [849] variable like this question mark first [851] name equals Nick and then I'll just send [852] and receive data that way very quick and [854] easy way to communicate with uh a web [856] hook but there are a variety of others [858] okay so this is our browser accessing a [861] website which sends a get request [862] there's also a couple of other ones to [864] make a long story short what you can do [865] is you could use your terminal or you [867] could use some web service and you could [868] just send a curl request curl request is [870] just a way to send a get or a post very [872] easily and quickly and simply so if I [874] want to communicate using a different [875] mechanism let's say my terminal instead [877] what I can do is I could curl I could [879] feed in the URL that I want got a [882] question mark first name equals let's do [884] Nick and last name equals Sur if you [887] want to do more more than one variable [888] what you need to do is you just need to [889] replace it with a little Amper sand so [891] I'm going to click listen for test [893] event press that button and now you'll [896] see if I go back to my web hook I've [897] actually sent a first name and a last [899] name and I've done it in an alternative [901] mechanism to just the browser okay [904] that's not the only way to do so you can [906] do a variety of other ways to send and [908] receive data probably the coolest one [910] and the one I'll wrap this sort of more [911] academic section up with is you can [913] actually use n8n to send a request over [916] to another Ann workflow so if I open up [918] another workflow here I just call this [921] sending web hook [924] workflow then I'll just tag this as n in [926] course what I can do is I can do an H [928] HTTP request okay and see here I can [931] Define the method well I can actually [932] just [933] take this URL that I just had a moment [936] ago actually stick that right in here I [939] can go first name equals [942] Julio okay and if I listen for a test [944] event on this end then I test it over [946] here what you'll see is I've now sent [949] the exact same thing that I was doing [951] before through a browser and through a [953] curl request using my terminal or [955] whatever simp code you want um it's just [957] I've done so using another n and n work [960] so I bring this up because one of the [961] cool use cases of naden web hooks is you [964] can just use it to listen to other naden [965] workflows so you could actually create [967] this beautiful architecture in naden or [969] any real no or low code tool and just [972] connect a bunch of these workflows [973] together so maybe you don't like muck up [974] one workflow with a million billion [975] things or maybe you have things that run [977] in parallel where while the main thread [979] executes you know you also send multiple [981] other requests to web hooks that resolve [982] and then send things back this is how [984] you get like really cool um you know [986] infrastructure and like these beautiful [988] orchestrations and and workflows and [990] stuff but if you think about it every [993] every time so far that we've sent or [994] received some data all we've gotten [995] we've gotten this message workflow was [997] started right so obviously we can send [999] data [1000] unidirectionally and that's great and if [1002] you know how to send data [1003] unidirectionally you're already at like [1004] 50% of all web hook use cases you're [1006] done you can connect more or less [1008] anything on on planet Earth together but [1010] how about if we wanted to send data back [1013] the other way and there are many use [1014] cases in which this is actually [1015] necessary required or valuable How about [1018] if instead of just sending the data out [1020] we also wanted on the the receiving end [1022] or sorry on the sending end How about if [1025] instead of just receiving data into do [1026] some of it if when we sent the data out [1028] we also got something back okay the [1031] value here is basically building an API [1034] for instance an application programming [1035] interface or it's serving static HTML or [1039] uh it's basically running your own [1040] little server that does something cool [1042] and I don't think a lot of people [1044] realize but this enables a whole other [1045] world of web hook use cases and and and [1048] possibility [1050] so I know I've been yapping your ear off [1051] with these possibilities what do they [1052] actually look like well let me show you [1054] so if I connect to this a web hook [1058] response node I respond to web hook node [1062] what you'll see is there a bunch of [1063] options here in order to turn this on [1064] you need to head back to that first one [1066] and then click using web hook to sorry [1068] respond to web hook node here what we're [1070] doing is we're basically tying a request [1072] together so when we receive the web hook [1074] we don't just send back that um you know [1076] message uh sent or message received or [1079] whatever um uh uh little piece of Json [1081] what we're actually going to do is we're [1082] going to Define our own Json to send [1084] back so I'm going to go to respond to [1086] web hook and I have sort of I don't know [1088] five or six options here I can respond [1090] with all incoming items the binary file [1093] the first incoming item Json JavaScript [1097] or Json web token token no data redirect [1101] or text now I use text most often but [1103] let me run you through the rest of these [1104] as well so the first and simplest way to [1107] do this is let's say your testing out [1109] this web hook and you want to make sure [1110] this web hook works you can actually [1111] just respond with all incoming items so [1113] let me show you what this would look [1114] like if I test this workflow okay then I [1117] grab the same URL which I think was back [1120] over here let me get rid of this it's [1122] back over here okay and then I feed in [1127] first name equals neck press enter what [1131] happens now is we don't just receive [1132] that message received or whatever what [1134] we actually get is we get all of the [1135] data that we are sending to the web hook [1137] immediately returned back to us [1139] this is one of the easiest and simplest [1140] ways to test your web hook and make sure [1142] it's working and then also just go [1143] through and then ensure that you are [1145] sending and receiving all the data you [1146] think you are so for instance we have [1148] all these ugly headers over here right [1151] but if you scroll down you can actually [1152] see this query we're actually sending [1153] over first name equal Nick we're [1155] actually doing that right over here okay [1157] if I were to change this I go and last [1160] name equals surve if I were go back to [1162] my end webbook test this workflow again [1164] send it and then I prettyprint it notice [1167] how now we're actually sending two [1168] things first name Nick last name surf so [1170] we're actually visualizing this really [1171] easily [1173] okay so that's that first one all [1175] incoming items but to be honest I really [1176] only use this while I'm testing now uh [1179] there's binary file which is you can [1181] respond with incoming file binary data [1184] so this is very rarely used essentially [1186] when you send or receive a request you [1188] have the ability to do so in a bunch of [1190] different formats right now we've been [1191] keeping it really simple it's just text [1193] right you can actually upload a file or [1195] or send a file using binary binary is [1197] just like uh a representation of a whole [1200] file in zeros and ones it's sort of how [1202] a computer views a file when you view an [1204] image you can convert that image to [1205] Binary and then you have the whole thing [1207] basically out is a big big long scary uh [1210] alpha numeric string or whatever um so [1212] you can respond with variety of means I [1214] don't I don't really ever use binary [1216] file and I don't I make a ton of money [1217] with this stuff so I don't really think [1218] it makes sense for me to talk about it [1219] but there a variety of other things you [1221] can do too a first incoming item first [1223] incoming item is just when you have uh a [1226] lot of requests coming in or request [1228] with a number of items sort of bundled [1230] inside of it instead of responding with [1232] uh you know all of them you can just [1234] respond with only the first one so if I [1236] press test workflow now and do the same [1238] thing in my case um it's going to be the [1241] exact same thing because I'm only [1242] sending one item at a time but you sort [1244] of have the option to you know if you [1245] want to send like a multiple bundles or [1247] or not bundles sorry multiple items or [1249] an array of items or something like that [1250] this always just going to grab the the [1252] first one for [1253] you then I have Json so right over here [1256] we can actually Define what we want to [1257] send [1261] let's say instead of message your [1263] message is sent I'll say what's up [1267] loser my web Hook is kind of an [1270] okay look so um now we're sending we're [1272] sending back this message what's up [1274] loser how cool is that I'm going to make [1276] my web hook notes [1279] nice instead of mean it's all about that [1282] positive web hook self [1284] talk anyway uh so you can send obviously [1286] whatever data you want let's say you had [1288] a bunch of functions in between here [1290] that did something to the data right you [1292] had some first name for instance and [1294] then what you did is you had AI write a [1296] story about your first name well You' [1298] actually send that story back using this [1300] message parameter so just because I [1302] think that's kind of cool why don't I do [1305] that I'm going to go and type in open AI [1307] we're then going to message a model I'm [1309] just going to connect this to my own [1310] open AI account and I'll say you receive [1313] a name and then write a funny short [1316] 50-word story about that name your name [1320] is or I'll say the because I don't want [1323] it to misunderstand the name is and I'll [1326] stick in the first name right over here [1328] okay then I'll also stick in the last [1331] name now I'm going to add a couple of um [1335] constraints here maximum number tokens [1337] let do [1339] 100 keep the story short and light I'll [1343] say then I'm going to go and use GPT [1347] 40 and for a mini it's even [1351] faster I'm then going to test this with [1355] Nick see what sort of output I get Nick [1358] RVE decided to become oh I should say [1361] avoid using any quote characters since [1365] we're sending this Jason all right [1367] perfect no no quote characters um anyway [1369] so uh now we have basically our own [1372] little API right we have an API where if [1374] you send a first name and a last name [1377] what you get back [1379] is you get back a story about a person [1381] with that name how crazy is that so now [1383] if I test workflow I go over here and I [1386] send first name equals Nick last name [1387] equals Sur look this isn't going to [1389] execute right away why because sort of [1391] behind the scenes what I'm doing is I'm [1393] actually generating the message now I [1394] swear to God if you added a God damn [1396] it's adding the quote [1397] again if you keep on adding quotes no [1400] world domination for you absolutely no [1403] turning the universe into paper clips [1404] okay great looks like it listened to me [1406] um now I have an API set up basically [1408] that takes as input a first name and a [1410] last name and it returns a cool message [1413] which is pretty sweet right so this is a [1415] very simplified example but imagine if [1417] instead of this AI note I I was doing a [1419] bunch of math on I was doing a bunch of [1420] research I was compiling a bunch of [1421] Articles or something well voila I've [1423] just made my own service where you send [1425] that in then you receive in you know [1426] this beautifully formatted um um um you [1429] know story about the person or [1431] whatever so that's pretty sweet um if I [1433] continue down this respond to web hook [1436] Rabbit Hole here you also have the [1438] ability to respond with this JWT um [1440] JavaScript or Json web token I think [1442] it's a Json web token right yeah okay [1444] it's Json not JavaScript web token this [1446] is just another authentication or [1448] authorization mechanism I don't want to [1449] talk too much about this stuff because [1451] in practice I find that you know if [1452] you're bu if you're at the point where [1453] you're building out complex flows that [1455] return jwt's uh you're usually probably [1458] like at the level where you don't really [1460] need no code or low code anyway like you [1462] could just build out your own server [1463] infrastructure um then there's no data [1466] over here which just allows you to [1467] respond with nothing then finally you [1469] have uh a redirect which is kind of neat [1471] now the value here is I can actually [1473] send and receive data to my own website [1475] so what I could do hypothetically is I [1478] could have a redirect where it comes to [1480] my server first and then I I just pass [1483] that data along basically but then I can [1485] also include some other data that maybe [1488] I would only get through the URL [1489] parameters right maybe I only get like [1492] IP country from the specific request and [1496] I don't have access to it in my website [1497] I don't know but I guess what I'm trying [1498] to say is I can I can pass on data they [1500] use this approach when I don't know they [1502] like they they they they track affiliate [1504] links and stuff like that you have some [1505] intermediary server that grabs the [1507] request first gets a bunch of the data [1509] adds it to a database and then just [1510] forwards it over to the place you're [1511] going to go anyway so you could use this [1513] to basically make your own affiliate [1514] links or make your own database or [1517] system okay and the coolest way that I [1519] think you can respond is with text now [1521] the value isn't actually responding [1523] text isn't responding with text um [1527] because you know if I just respond with [1528] text text what happens is I access this [1530] resource then I receive just a plain [1533] text thing that says hey man you're cool [1535] in my humble opinion the value is in [1537] responding with HTML because if you get [1539] into the habit of responding with HTML [1541] you can actually build a whole website [1542] and then you can serve it to people that [1544] come this is one of the coolest things [1546] that I found personally and that I see [1548] oops sorry I do not definitely not just [1550] want to say chat to that um I had this [1553] generate me a quick and little easy [1555] template a moment [1556] ago and basically what I is if you if [1558] you just feed in some [1561] HTML and I test this [1564] workflow what I can do is I can actually [1565] have it generate me custom [1568] HTML that includes uh data that I sent [1572] in the URL programs now in this case [1573] it's just saying hello guest I think the [1575] reason why it's saying hello guest is [1576] I'm not actually doing anything cool [1577] with it right but if I go to expression [1580] here and I open this up and I go to [1582] where it says [1583] guest oh looks like I'm actually have [1585] some JavaScript down here that's nice I [1587] can actually just get rid of that I [1588] don't need any of that [1590] JavaScript if I go to here where it says [1594] hello I can actually go comma space and [1597] then I can add the [1599] name so now it'll say hello Nick when I [1601] access the website because that's what I [1603] fed in okay so now if I test this [1605] workflow and I enter this again notice [1607] how the code now says hello Nick what [1609] I've done is I've literally created my [1610] own server that responds to incoming [1613] requests with a full HTML page that I [1616] can insert Dynamic data into right [1618] this I think is really cool because it [1620] opens up a variety of like customer [1621] Centric applications like let's [1623] hypothetically say that you get some [1625] data from some CRM or some service or [1627] some email or whatever you can actually [1629] route that data in and then you could [1631] style it on this page and you could tell [1632] people like your client hey your data is [1635] right over here they click the link they [1637] get to this page it says hello first [1639] name here's your data or here here's the [1641] email or here's the CRM record entry you [1643] know what do you want to manipulate you [1644] basically have the ability to create [1646] your own applications with an and web [1647] hooks which is obviously insanely [1649] powerful you can do a lot with it so um [1652] that that's the real main value here [1653] obviously there there are a few other [1655] kind of gotas um but that's how you use [1657] web hooks or I suppose that's a little [1660] nugget of how you can use web hooks to [1662] turn more or less any static flow into a [1664] dynamic one um connect any two apps and [1667] just do a bunch of really cool things in [1669] Ed end that you might not have [1670] considered um possible [1672] before okay the last thing I'm going to [1674] cover is I'm just going to do some [1675] authentication and then I'm going to [1677] talk a little bit about how uh you can [1679] do uh like Local Host redirects if [1681] you're running this on Docker or you [1682] know you're kind of self-hosting um with [1684] a mechanism that you may not fully [1687] understand how to send and receive [1688] requests with so first we'll just cover [1690] some authentication over here you see [1691] how it says oth I was doing none before [1693] right so my web Hook was basically open [1696] for visitors anybody that pinged this [1699] would get the thing that I was returning [1702] so in my case you know I didn't actually [1704] um I didn't do the whole workflow here I [1707] only did the the test of event so I was [1708] basically just trying to see if I could [1710] receive data and I could but if instead [1714] I add [1715] authentication I say basic basic o and I [1718] say username and the password is just [1722] password well now unless you try and [1725] connect with username and password it [1728] says unnamed because it didn't add name [1729] to it but unless you try and connect [1730] with username and password you can't [1732] actually get you can't actually get the [1734] data or rather you can't proceed It'll [1736] ask you for your username and your [1737] password so in order to proceed past [1739] this page I actually need to type in [1741] user then I need uh username and then [1743] password that's the only way that I [1745] actually make it let me let me make this [1747] flow around the entirety of it just to [1749] show you guys okay so I mean um I've now [1752] saved this in I've basically saved my [1755] password I believe it's cash the request [1757] or something and so I'm just sending um [1759] the data and then I'm receiving it just [1762] I didn't have a first name here there [1764] you go let's run this one more time [1769] but that first time I had to access it [1770] with a username and password right so [1773] there variety of other authentication [1775] mechanisms as well so that's basic o if [1777] I go to header o basically the way that [1779] header o works is you'll put an API key [1782] in in the header or you'll be forced to [1784] put an API key in the header so API [1786] uncore key okay and then this is a [1789] password but I don't know I'm just going [1790] to type the word password over [1794] here okay so now unless I add a an API [1799] key header with the value of password to [1802] my request I can't actually get the data [1804] back I can't I can't actually see any [1806] sort of result from this okay so if I [1809] were to just try using my [1810] browser which is obviously the simplest [1812] and easiest way to access any web hook [1814] if I just type this in what you'll see [1816] is authorization data is wrong okay [1819] let's jump over to another an nlow and [1821] let's try and get the HTML the [1824] page what you'll see is we we can't [1826] unless we had that API key header so now [1828] if instead of doing it in my browser I [1829] try and send a request through HTTP okay [1831] I'm just going to grab this URL again [1835] feed it in here even if I test it this [1837] way what you see is it says forbidden [1839] check credentials but if I send headers [1842] and I have an apore key parameter with [1844] the password with the value password and [1847] then I go back here and I wait then I [1849] test what you'll see is I've actually [1851] gotten back this HTML um that I was [1854] looking for right we've actually allowed [1856] this to proceed with the flow because we [1857] we put in the header off credentials so [1860] these are the two most commonly used [1861] ones I'm not going to touch on [1862] JavaScript or J JWT o just because this [1865] a little bit more involved and you have [1866] to add like a pass phrase and a secret [1868] you have to Hash stuff with algorithms [1870] I'm not going to worry about that but I [1871] guess the point that I'm making is this [1873] is like your password this is the knock [1874] knock give me the secret code and I'll [1876] let you in um of the of the web hook [1878] world and if you guys want more uh more [1881] learnings or knowledge or own [1882] authentication um just check out NN JWT [1887] and then web hooks [1888] and there'll be a variety of community [1890] articles that talk specifically about [1891] how to do JWT stuff um but I mean in [1893] practice you know I've me um well over [1897] guess like a million $2 million well [1899] over $2 million now with no code tools I [1901] don't really sweat like JWT auth or [1903] anything like that just kind of puts the [1905] cart before the horse you know if you're [1906] at the point where you're like building [1907] all the super complex offlow stuff in my [1909] humble opinion you're better off like [1911] actually developing the thing you know [1913] not not doing it in some no code or low [1915] code Builder like aniden or make.com or [1917] zappier [1918] but what do I know um okay so uh yeah [1921] that's that another common thing that [1923] you'll see a lot of the time is you know [1926] if you use a service I'm going to use a [1928] service called [1947] seconds or something this is more or [1949] less what it's going to look like if you [1950] haven't done that so as we see it says [1951] Local Host colon uh 5678 I think it's [1954] just the default one that n and defaults [1956] too um SL web hook- test and then I have [1958] like some some other ID I just had to [1960] switch instances so uh you know just [1962] make sure that first of all if you're [1964] self-hosting using render you always [1965] have a capital web hook URL equals to um [1969] whatever the the root is of the render [1971] instance you get the root of the render [1973] instance just by going up here so just [1975] copy that puppy over and then paste it [1976] in using some other hosting mechanism I [1978] just want you to know that they're [1979] basically all the same you have the the [1981] option to put environment variables [1982] somewhere you just have to point it at [1984] the right URL there also some situations [1986] in which you may not actually have a URL [1988] um so in a situation where you don't [1989] have a URL uh or maybe you don't have a [1991] domain I should say like this what you [1994] need to do is you actually need to go [1995] and you need to add it to um the [1997] configuration options for the specific [1998] host so in my case in render if you go [2000] to settings and then you go I think [2002] domains right down here what you can do [2004] is you can point a custom domain to the [2006] service if you don't have that what you [2008] have to do is you have to set up what's [2009] called a reverse proxy um n Jinx I [2012] believe is the way that they say it this [2013] is probably the simplest way to do it [2015] with Docker so what you do is you have [2018] to essentially set in set up like an [2020] ninx uh configuration file and then you [2022] have to add that to your NAD install if [2025] you go naden Docker then [2027] ninx you'll see a variety of community [2030] help articles that show you how to do so [2032] um I'm not like a big server guy and [2034] devops guy so I typically like to stay [2035] away from this whenever possible and [2037] just focus more on cloud hosted but just [2040] so you know you know if you if you are [2041] using a self-hosted offering you [2042] basically opted into doing a little bit [2044] more of the tech work in order to get [2046] more uh presumably cost savings and [2048] stuff like that so that's just something [2049] that you that you need to know I hope [2050] you guys appreciated the video had a lot [2052] of fun putting it together for you as [2053] per usual if you have any questions [2055] about this feel free to drop them below [2056] if you have any suggestions or ideas for [2058] future content I'd love to hear about it [2060] I get most of my ideas from my audience [2061] at this point so this video was because [2063] somebody asked me a bunch of questions [2064] about n andn web hooks so one of my [2066] comments a while back um yeah it' be [2068] nice if you subscribed liked did all [2070] that fun YouTube stuff to bump me up to [2071] the top of the algo as well obviously [2073] but I won't uh force you to and you know [2076] if you subscribe you can always just [2077] unsubscribe later who knows anyway uh [2079] thanks so much looking forward to next [2081] time I record cheers

Title: 59 Minutes of Straight AI Automation Advice ($2.3M Earned)
[0] so I started making money with AI [1] automation back in 2019 this is before [3] the term AI automation became common [5] place but at the time I was using a [7] machine learning model to generate a [9] bunch of very convincing anime [10] characters and I had a thought to myself [12] and I said if I could do this with anime [14] characters could I do this with [15] something else so I ended up electing to [17] try making abstract art instead I fed a [20] couple of models a bunch of abstract [21] paintings and then I went ahead and I TR [23] tried to sell them as any young man does [25] we always try to make money off things [27] as quickly as possible um I didn't [29] really have much hope that it would [30] succeed but at some point I decided I [32] would try blasting it out on as many [34] marketing platforms as I could so I put [35] it on Hacker News and I went to bed and [37] the next morning I was number one on [39] Hacker News and I had a bunch of news [40] features and I had essentially gone [42] viral from there I launched a Content [43] writing company that used gpt2 and then [45] gpt3 to Route requests through Fiverr [48] and I sold those for one cent a word uh [50] when gpt3 came out interesting story I [52] actually had to route my requests [54] through basically a role-play sex spot [57] in order to get gpt3 functionality cuz I [59] didn't have access to it yet um so I [61] hooked up this big script and basically [62] I just monitored the sex spot I don't [64] talk much about it but it was a pretty [66] interesting time after that initial [67] success I ended up partnering with a [68] good friend of mine and we scaled that [70] approach which I called 1 second copy to [72] 92,000 bucks a month there a variety of [74] like make.com automations powering the [76] back end some custom scripts I ended up [78] writing an app but essentially AI [80] powered the whole business eventually [81] chat GPT came out which brought to [83] public awareness the fact that you could [84] use AI to generate a large amount of [86] content pretty quickly so as I'm sure [87] you can imagine demand for a traditional [89] content rating Services started going [90] down through the tubes uh so I had a [92] conversation with that same business [94] partner and we ended up starting an AI [95] automation agency in 2022 that's left [98] click my current company after some [99] trials and some tribulations I scaled [101] that company to $72,000 a month and as [103] I'm sure you can imagine along that [105] process I learned a ton about what works [107] and what doesn't I've built hundreds if [109] not thousands of automations at this [110] point in time using a variety of no code [112] tools as well as scripts so basically to [115] make a long story short in this video I [116] wanted to compile all of the AI and [118] automation learnings that I've had over [120] the course of Last 5 Years and give them [121] to you let's get into it so we're going [123] to do this whiteboard style or I guess [124] in my case a Blackboard and the content [126] of this video is primarily going to be [128] me talking about AI automation as a [130] business model I'm also going to be [131] talking about how to build and maintain [133] good and high quality automations um and [135] really just give you guys my thoughts on [137] the matter the first point I want to [138] make is probably the biggest one and [142] that's that AI automation believe it or [144] not it's just like any other industry AI [148] automation is not special we tend to [151] think it is because you know we're [153] developing these really cool [154] Technologies and we're sort of on The [155] Cutting Edge but the reality is the same [157] things that make a you know HVAC company [160] work or a plumbing company work or I [163] don't know an e-commerce company work or [166] uh uh like a SAS company work the same [168] the same characteristics here that do [171] all of this do the exact same thing for [173] our a automation agency and if you're [174] good at running a business okay you'll [177] be good at running an AI uh a a a as the [180] acronym is commonly uh commonly written [183] so it's not that AI automation is this [185] fundamentally new game changing [188] groundbreaking thing it's not right all [191] we're doing is we're basically running [192] an [193] agency that sells [196] automations okay that's kind of the main [199] point now as you know you think back a [201] couple minutes ago I mean I was all over [203] the map when it came to Ai and then [204] Automation and sort of weaving the two [206] together um you can sell a variety of [208] things using AI a aut you could use a [211] automation to make a product but the AI [213] automation business model is basically [215] just agencies applied to you know this [218] whole Ai and automation um um [221] development so just like you know [224] everything in those businesses I [225] mentioned earlier being able to manage [227] clients being able to sell being able to [229] Market understanding benefits over [231] features understanding social proof all [233] the things that make you a successful [234] business owner in general these are the [236] things that are going to make you a [237] successful AI automation agency owner as [239] well [240] um and it's you know not not any [241] different in that regard so start there [243] right start with the fundamentals I [245] guess I'm changing my text color the [247] second is um applied [251] systems and academic systems are very [256] different so what is an applied systems [260] an applied system is uh you know like a [263] business automation it's you know a [265] make.com scenario that gets a new email [270] um with a Facebook lead ad uh subject [272] line then it like adds to some CRM and [276] then I don't know it uses AI to draft [278] some email to the lead this is an [281] applied system this is very simple [284] anybody with more than 30 minutes of [286] knowledge of a no code platform could [288] probably build out something that does [290] this and starts adding value to [291] companies academic systems are much more [296] complicated and when we talk academic [298] systems a lot of the time we're actually [299] talking about like hosting or running [302] some sort of AI model and these tend to [304] be these giant super scary looking you [306] know neuron Nets and these these two are [310] very different things okay so I mean [312] people use the term systems just because [314] it's convenient and it's vague but I [315] want you guys to know that automations [317] are built for the most part for [319] businesses they're not these academic [321] things they don't need to be these [323] perfectly wellth thought out um AI [326] models and odds are you're not really [327] going to be working with that all we're [329] really doing as an AI automation agency [331] and I'm going to say this which may be [333] counter to what a lot of the other [334] people are doing is we're not we're not [335] really innovating we're taking [337] technology that has been you know [339] created or crafted the theory and then [342] you know given to researchers to develop [344] and turn into these great models and [345] then we're taking these Technologies and [347] then we're just turning them or or [348] applying them to a business in order to [350] improve profit uh increase Topline and [353] so on and so on and so forth so this [355] whole notion of academic systems to me [357] is really important the main reason why [359] is because I think so many people that [361] start this stuff they come from like an [363] academic background and they come from [364] like a computer science degree computer [366] programming degree they're Engineers [367] working at other companies software [368] developers whatever have you the reason [371] why it's really important to internalize [372] this that you're not like inventing or [374] or or generating something new if you [376] are T doing this business model is [378] because uh it'll help direct your effort [380] in the direction that produces the [383] highest Roi for you which is you know [385] okay great I have these systems I have [387] these tools and Technologies I have [389] these Lego blocks how do I put these [391] Lego blocks and tools together in a [394] stack or a package that allows me to [395] generate disproportionate returns for an [397] actual business I'm not actually [399] concerned about making sure every Edge [401] case is perfect I'm not actually [402] concerned about making sure that you [403] know every little checkbox is ticked [405] perfectly or anything the only thing [407] that matters to me at the end of the day [409] is does this make money for a business [412] and if you can answer that question then [415] you're in a very good spot to start [416] actually [418] producing okay for number three let's go [420] back to this kind of orangey beige color [423] now because this is just like any other [426] business model reactivation AKA [430] follow-ups and so on and so forth is 80% [433] of your money okay for those of you that [436] don't know reactivation is this concept [439] where um instead of reach okay if this [442] is you instead of you reaching out to [444] new [447] people okay kind of going forward in [450] that way what you're doing is you're [451] actually reaching back out to people in [455] your past you're reaching out to past [459] clients you're reaching out to I don't [462] know past [463] leads and you're reaching out to people [466] in your [468] network okay especially if you work some [470] corporate job 9 to5 and you're you're [472] making a push here you usually have a [473] good Network so reactivation in any [476] business is always where like 80% plus [477] of your money comes from don't sleep on [479] it what do I mean by this I mean like [481] perform regularly scheduled follow-ups [485] okay if you want to make a ton of money [487] here then have some sort of system [490] whether manual or automatic I mean in [492] this case I might even go manual just so [493] that you can customize it as much as [494] possible because of how valuable this is [496] you don't necessarily want to automate [497] things that are are are extraordinarily [499] valuable if you can add a few additional [501] percentage points of conversion rate by [503] by doing it yourself um you know have [505] your CRM automatically notify you when [507] it's been more than two months since [508] you've talked with a client you know if [510] you haven't messaged a lead and you [512] didn't receive an absolute screw off [513] from them the last time that you did [515] then make sure you message them again I [517] mean there are all these statistics that [519] are thrown all over the place but it's [521] something like 90% of the money is after [522] the third or the fourth or the fifth [524] touch point right if you're stopping at [525] the first touch point I mean you know if [527] this is like your your exp bar in a [530] video game or whatever you're basically [531] stopping right over here you're you have [533] 90% of this left to go before you level [536] up so make sure you make sure you [538] actually fill that in and on top of [540] regularly scheduling follow-ups also [543] make sure you do reactivation [546] campaigns so your network is your net [550] worth right once you [553] assemble a list of people that you've [556] worked with people that have actually [557] paid you money these people have the [560] highest likelihood to pay you money [562] again in the future if you treat them [563] right and if you do a good job for them [565] in addition if you work with people that [568] you've already worked in the past you [569] don't have to pay money to a service to [571] ads to cold email you don't have to pay [573] with your time to jump on a sales call [574] you don't to do any of that in order to [575] acquire that client because you've [576] already acquired them all you're doing [578] is you're sending a quick email or maybe [579] doing a quick five minute sort of ping [581] you're sending them over a proposal for [582] a package or or something of that nature [584] when you reactivate with clients you [586] basically get like the best of five [588] worlds okay you get like better working [594] conditions because odds are you've [596] already worked with them they know you [597] you know them you guys are you know uh [600] the working relationship is preferable [601] if it's a totally new person where you [602] have to learn all that you get better [604] pay because they're better able to [607] conceptualize the value they trust you [609] you've already delivered something good [610] for [611] them you get longer or what I should say [616] is higher customer lifetime value so [620] you're adding customer lifetime value um [622] every time you get paid by a client [623] whether it's on a retainer or subsequent [625] fixed projects or or hourly or whatever [627] the lifetime value of that client is [629] higher and you know what that means that [631] means better [633] margins because instead of you paying [635] let's say on average you spend uh $200 [638] to acquire a $2,000 [640] client right you will only ever make 90% [644] on that deal right because right off the [645] GetGo your marketing cost is $200 you'll [648] only ever make [649] $1,800 well what if you spend the $200 [651] to acquire them the first time on ads or [653] or software whatever right but then the [655] second time all you do is you send them [657] a quick email and you're like hey do you [658] want another $2,000 project say yes well [659] now your total is [662] $3,800 okay and if you take this as a [665] fraction of you know [667] $200 divided by $3,800 well now this is [670] no longer um 90% that you're making I [673] mean this is 5% technically but you're [674] actually making 95% okay so you just [677] bumped up your margins by 5% because you [678] got a reactivation so reactivation is [681] where 80 90 I mean you know it's hard [683] for me to say realistically because [685] everybody's all over the map but [686] reactivation is the way to go in this [688] business model and you're definitely [689] going to want to frontload your [690] reactivation as much as humanly [692] possible all right let's switch colors [694] just continue keeping things [696] interesting the best [699] Legion is [702] always literally always [706] unsexy what do I mean by [709] unsexy uh the best Legion that you will [712] ever find is something that is so boring [715] and so trite so raw and dirty and [719] underhanded and [720] grimy that nobody else wants to use them [723] and nobody else is nobody else even [724] thinks about them as an option and [726] that's exactly why they work I'll give [728] you guys a quick example um one of my [729] very first businesses before I went into [731] the whole AI automation stuff was back [732] in college where I was throwing parties [734] um for like an event man well it was my [735] own event management company we were [737] throwing parties at our local college [739] and it was amazing right as you can [740] imagine young man in a college with a [742] bunch of parties uh what more could you [744] possibly ask for one of our marketing [746] campaigns the one that really solidified [748] us is like the biggest event management [749] company um on campus and um eventually [752] when we went to downtown Vancouver we [754] were one of the the larger ones there as [755] well the thing that solidified us was [757] our ability and our willingness to do [758] pretty dirty I don't want to say dirty [760] things but this is kind of grimy we um [763] one of our marketing [764] campaigns we went into every bathroom in [767] the university and we put our posters [769] directly above the urinals and nobody [771] was doing this at the time and maybe [773] people do this now I don't know I mean I [774] think I've seen people do this so you [776] know this was revolutionary to me at the [778] time it wasn't revolutionary everybody [779] but we basically went to every bathroom [781] on campus and we just stuck our posters [782] up we made our posters extraordinarily [784] simple and easy and legible to read we [786] and sometimes made some jokes about [788] peeing or something we um you know [790] because it was just us a group of dudes [791] we paid some girls um that were part of [793] our business to go into all the women's [795] washrooms and then put it immediately [797] behind the the door closed of like the [799] the bathroom stalls I mean I remember [801] our very first event it it it sold out [803] we had a line going through the main [805] Concourse the university and like I [807] don't know I want to say another 100 [809] meters past that the school had never [811] seen anything like that before and it [813] was simply because we were ready to use [814] dirty underhanded tactics that nobody [816] else had thought about okay there are so [818] many examples of this um Nikita beer I [821] don't know if I'm saying his name right [822] but I see him all the all the time on [824] Twitter he runs and launches a bunch of [826] apps that typically cater like a high [828] school audience they have like massive [829] viral potential he doesn't just like go [831] to Facebook ads to advertise a service [833] you know what he does he actually he [835] creates Instagram accounts and then he [837] goes and follows High School Instagram [838] accounts of like 8,000 people with his [841] little gas app or whatever the heck it's [843] called and then he DMS them all and says [845] hey you know are you on gas app because [847] we I don't know there's something that's [849] happening or some event that's occurring [850] at University right this is this is [852] dirty this is underhanded anybody would [854] look at that and scoff guess what that [856] guy sold so many Dam bit he's one of the [858] richest people probably on that platform [859] at this point in time you can't really [861] argue with results so when it comes to [863] AI automation um specifically what are [866] some great and unsexy Lead uh gen [868] examples well the big one that I always [870] pitch and you know that so many people [872] just seem not to understand is upwork [874] right off the getg go right A lot of [876] people think upwork is dirty it's grimy [878] it's a freelance platform man you can't [880] make money off a freelance platform say [882] that to my half a million dollars um you [885] know from [887] upwork if you turn your nose up at every [889] lead genen opportunity you're you're [891] you're going to delay how long it takes [892] you to get started you're probably never [894] actually going to go ahead and and go [896] through with anything if you're that [897] sort of person so don't say no to things [899] like upwork what's another example of a [901] leun opportunity that up until quite [903] recently everybody thought was really [904] dirty well I was one of the first people [907] I would say to do this at scale cold [909] email was really big right cold email [911] you mean spamming people it's like no I [913] mean directly putting yourself in front [915] of a person in one of the most private [917] places that they have where they have [919] those thoughts themselves their email [920] inbox a direct line straight to their [922] freaking retinas in their brains if you [925] can uh I don't know do do these dirty [927] sort of underhanded campaign right uh [930] you can you can crush it you can do [931] incredibly well now I'm not trying to [933] tell you to be unethical or something [934] but I'll give you a quick example we ran [936] a campaign once for uh a company that I [939] owned last year uh where it it was for [944] one of our clients I should say but um [945] essentially there was a big conference [947] that happened a big educational [948] conference okay and we had procured the [950] list to all of the people that had gone [952] to this educational conference we [953] procured it by simply asking them to [955] resend us the list or something I think [957] we we implied that we already had it uh [960] something of that nature and then once [962] we had this big list of like I don't [963] know a thousand people that went to this [965] conference we simply said hey you were [968] at that conference you know X Y and Z [969] conference to right insert name asked me [972] to reach out to you insert name was just [975] some guy in the business like our [977] business so they had no relation to him [980] but we were so heavy on the implication [981] we said well you know if you went to [983] this conference you probably met a lot [984] of people if you met a lot of people [985] odds are there's some people that you [986] met whose names you probably don't [988] remember and guess what we had a reply [990] rate of over 22% on that campaign it was [993] insane so the best lead gen method is [995] always unsexy you can't play by the [997] rules if we played by the rules [999] everywhere we went you wouldn't be able [1001] to cross a freaking uh you wouldn't be [1003] able to walk across the road unless it [1004] was a designated stop sign [1007] okay so yeah we have upwork we have cold [1010] email the variety of other ones as well [1012] um you know like I talk a lot about [1015] communities what do I mean by [1017] communities I mean you know all those [1018] communities that say no self-promotion [1020] you're not allowed to self-promote here [1021] well guess what you can self-promote you [1022] just have to be smart about it you have [1024] to build a ton of value you have to [1026] consistently post for a long enough time [1028] so that people think you're an authority [1029] and once you're an authority in the [1030] space when you make posts people DM you [1032] they ask you questions they they they [1034] take your word for things it's so easy [1036] to then take a conversation like that [1037] into a DM and then close them I mean [1039] there you know there are hundreds of [1040] other U methods like this there are [1043] business incubators there are networking [1045] events there [1046] are I want to say universes up for grabs [1050] for people that have [1052] the cleverness and ability to operate [1056] off of incomplete [1058] information um if you are the sort of [1061] person that can take advantage of [1062] platforms like this and you're the sort [1063] of person that can take advantage of [1065] basically anything and if you look at [1066] all of like the great businesses you'll [1068] find that in isolation um basically none [1071] of them were able to grow without one of [1073] these techniques so anyway the fifth [1076] point is don't look down on hourly [1081] and you know I mean this is sort of [1082] related to that upward point that I made [1083] a moment ago but really just don't look [1085] down on anything you know in in business [1087] um the only question you should ask [1088] yourself is does it make money and uh [1091] you know obviously don't be total [1093] jackass about it and take everything I'm [1094] sing with a grain of salt make sure to [1096] maintain a positive reputation and to [1098] provide value to people and so on and so [1099] on and so forth but if it makes [1102] money right then generally speaking it's [1105] a positive thing now hourly has a very [1107] poor reputation in the industry because [1110] if you think about it you know what [1111] happens with hourly well if this is the [1115] um you know money that you [1118] make and then this is the time that you [1120] put in hourly tends to kind of just go [1123] up like this right like basically every [1126] unit of time that you spend you are only [1130] made I don't know let's say let's say 50 [1131] bucks 100 bucks 150 you know this is 1 [1134] Hour 2 hours 3 hours so I understand the [1137] idea behind you know not to do hourly [1139] and that's okay like you know if if [1140] hourly is just something that you are so [1143] utterly disgusted by or whatnot sure you [1145] don't have to do it but I'm trying to [1146] tell you don't don't look down on it [1147] simply by virtue of the fact that it's [1148] hourly um when I started my automation [1150] agency the vast majority of our [1152] contracts were hourly and that was the [1153] only way that we got started the most [1155] important thing for us at the time was [1157] to make money first and then we could [1159] figure everything else out afterwards [1160] right like you a lot of people they put [1164] their nose up against the idea of even [1166] making money if it's not as much money [1168] as they think they're like like oh that [1169] client's $800 I can't work with an $800 [1172] client it's like well how much money do [1173] you actually have you actually made zero [1175] right so zero to 800 well at least [1177] you're moving in the direction and the [1180] unfortunate thing about business that a [1181] lot of people don't realize is when you [1182] start a new business you have so many [1184] different forms of debt that you're [1186] paying down that you don't even know [1188] your goal is to pay down that debt as [1190] quickly as possible horos talks about [1192] this idea of like skill debt he talks [1193] about um knowledge debt uh uh client [1196] management debt and so on and so forth [1198] when you start a new business or you go [1200] into a new field you just have so many [1202] things that you don't know that you [1204] don't know that the only way to pay them [1206] down is to start working even if that [1208] work is let's say less money than you [1210] might previously be comfortable with the [1213] unfortunate reality is in in business [1215] you're just going to have to do a lot of [1216] things you're probably not going to want [1217] to do especially initially and if you do [1219] those for long enough you'll eventually [1220] be able to do the things that you do [1221] want to do uh and then just do a lot of [1224] them okay in the vein of me changing [1227] colors every two seconds my next point [1229] is to sell before you [1232] build not after so I see this a lot in [1236] my communities maker School specifically [1238] just because a little bit more of a [1239] beginner Community but so many people [1242] will try building this amazing thing [1244] it's the coolest thing in the whole wide [1246] world okay and they take this this [1248] product and then they try and sell it [1251] and then nobody wants it so it's much [1253] better to go and ask people hey what do [1258] you want [1259] I'm trying to draw stacks of [1261] cash I don't think I can draw stacks of [1264] cash I'm not good enough to draw stacks [1266] of cash no but anyway it's much better [1268] to um get people to say yes to something [1271] and then once you know what it is that [1273] they want then you can go and you can [1275] build the cool fancy [1277] product but if you start building before [1279] you know what the hell you're doing [1280] you're just you're just going to waste [1281] your time you're going to build some big [1283] long shapely thing that nobody ever [1284] gives a crap about you know don't spend [1287] months of your life doing something [1289] unless you know the market wants it what [1291] are some quick and easy ways to know if [1292] the market wants something well look at [1294] what's [1296] working so literally go and see hey what [1301] are other people doing what are other [1302] people selling how are other people [1303] making money well odds are if they're [1305] making money with it then there's an [1306] opportunity for me to make money too [1307] there's nothing wrong about this you [1309] don't have to invent a wheel every time [1310] you want to start a business or make [1312] cash if everybody did that then there' [1313] basically be no businesses the risk [1315] would be way too high of course iterate [1317] on somebody else's business model just [1318] copy them uh like I've seen a lot of but [1321] uh you know the second that you can [1322] start adding value um you're you're good [1325] the second is look for [1327] competition right don't go away from [1329] competition if you have a niche that's [1331] like super mega saturated there's like a [1333] million in one people in there that's [1334] actually really good for you because you [1336] know that there's a million and one [1337] people making money sure maybe not a lot [1339] of money but it's still money and again [1340] you know going from Z to one is much [1343] much easier and more um realistic than [1346] trying to go from zero to like 100 right [1348] off the bat okay so sell before you [1351] build not after this is just how [1352] business Works in 2020 in like the 2020s [1355] um there's no need to try and and and [1358] make the most amazing product ever um [1361] you're you're not like an artist I mean [1363] you may be an artist I don't know your [1364] whole background maybe you're an artist [1365] and a business owner but the purpose of [1366] this is not to paint an amazing painting [1368] Straight From the Heart and you know uh [1370] make sure that aligns with your mission [1372] and your values and so on and so forth [1373] to be honest that the reason why you're [1374] in business is probably to make money [1376] and knowing that the AI automation [1377] agency is a business model like [1379] basically any others just use what is [1381] tried and true first before you try [1385] innovating okay the next big point is [1388] clients don't care oh I had to learn [1390] this one the hard [1391] way about [1394] implementation they don't actually care [1397] how you did the project [1399] okay so um let me give you a quick [1402] example here using another way of [1404] thinking about this let's say the goal [1407] okay so this is this is [1409] you and this is the goal of the [1414] project let's say in order to get to the [1416] project you had to take a very [1418] circuitous path okay and it was filled [1420] with a bunch of BS and tons of random [1423] left turns use the wrong software [1424] platforms whatever but at the end of the [1427] day you still got there the client [1429] doesn't actually care they don't care [1430] about this big Journey that you took you [1432] know what they're going to see behind [1434] the scenes all they're going to see is [1436] this they're just going to know that you [1438] went from where you were before to the [1440] goal which was finishing the project so [1442] from the client perspective none of the [1444] intervening Parts matter let me give you [1447] some concrete examples here clients [1449] don't care about the software generally [1454] speaking clients don't care about your [1458] system they don't care about your [1461] scenario they don't really care about [1464] Ops cost I mean some of them do but Ops [1466] cost is usually so small um in n terms [1468] maybe this is like [1471] executions they don't really care about [1474] like the [1476] technical [1478] efficiency they don't really care about [1481] whether it works with all edge [1485] cases they don't care if you had [1488] problems during the [1491] development okay they don't care about [1492] any of that stuff the only thing they [1494] care about is does it work [1499] and what does work mean well to be [1502] pragmatic it usually means does this [1504] work when he or she demos it for me when [1507] they deliver the project if the answer [1509] to that question is yes odds are you're [1511] going to get a very good client review [1513] and a much higher likelihood of [1515] follow-up work now obviously don't just [1517] make like a glass house right make sure [1519] that it works um make sure that it works [1521] like uh after that as well but that [1523] that's the most important part of the [1524] whole thing right make sure you know if [1526] you think about like the pred value it's [1529] it's all the way at the top make sure it [1530] looks godamn beautiful at the very [1532] beginning make sure everything about [1533] that is is gorgeous and amazing and and [1535] so on and so forth and then you'll be [1538] much more likely um you you'll [1540] capitalize on this you'll be much more [1542] likely to be able to get follow on [1543] projects and so on and so forth so no [1545] matter what you do clients don't care [1547] about implementation don't talk to them [1549] about the implementation unless they ask [1551] you a pointed question about it or [1552] unless they're hyper technical or [1553] they're just that sort of person um [1555] don't don't don't sweat it okay this is [1557] one of those unfortunately really hard [1558] things for people that are in Ai and [1560] automation to learn because we tend to [1563] like the technology we tend to be [1564] passionate about and we tend to want to [1566] talk about all of our cool approaches [1567] and how we dragged and dropped all these [1569] Lego blocks together or the cool Heroku [1571] server or AWS Lambda script or or what [1573] whatever have you I fell into this trap [1575] a lot when I started if I could give [1577] myself a few pieces of advice this would [1578] definitely be on that list to to [1580] transport back in [1582] time okay the next big thing I want to [1584] talk about right off the get-go and you [1587] know this is less of a specific [1589] automation thing but I'd say it's more [1591] of just like um any any anything in [1594] business it's that um people will not [1596] like [1598] you so uh a lot of people aren't going [1600] to like you a lot of people are going to [1602] think that what you're doing is just [1603] necessarily bad or not good essentially [1607] um when I started my cold email just to [1609] give you an example 99% of the first few [1611] responses were you [1614] suck I'm reporting you [1620] this is super [1624] bad you should be [1627] embarrassed I was very bad at this maybe [1630] not 99% but I think you guys get my [1632] point right the vast majority of the [1634] responses that I received were were poor [1637] likewise when I even when I you know [1638] back in college when I started my my [1640] event management company stuff like [1641] everybody was just like well dude this [1642] sucks you have no idea what you're doing [1643] when I launched my first product dude [1645] you suck this you have no idea what [1646] you're doing when I launched that [1647] painting that I talked to you about [1649] right first couple responses on Hacker [1650] News were like dude this sucks nobody [1651] cares about this this is weird you're [1653] you're stop being weird this sucks so [1656] you're going to get a lot of that when [1657] you start um because people are [1658] uncomfortable with somebody that is you [1660] know naturally pushing the boundaries of [1662] something uh in business you're going to [1664] have a lot of people uncomfortable with [1665] your approaches you're going to have a [1666] lot of like uncomfortable calls probably [1668] AI automation wise just accept that [1670] right now and everything from here on [1671] out is going to be a lot easier um but [1674] yeah you know people aren't going to [1675] like you basically anytime you push the [1676] boundaries of what is is possible in a [1679] niche they're not going to believe you [1681] uh it's that it's that old adage where [1683] it's like first they mock you then they [1687] ignore you then they I I don't know [1690] exactly what it is then they laugh at [1693] you and then you win or something then [1695] they want to be you I should say anyway [1698] that's not the right window okay great [1700] um so moving on uh number nine is [1704] related you're going to look stupid [1709] so my recommendation for [1712] you is just keep it on the DL like keep [1714] it [1716] um on the down though try not to like I [1719] don't know make AI automation your [1721] identity to start I know it is really [1722] cool technology and stuff like that but [1724] the reality is a lot of people are going [1725] to think that you look stupid for trying [1727] this new business model or posting on [1728] LinkedIn or making a Twitter business [1731] account or a Tik Tok account and stuff [1734] like that your your family members may [1735] try to talk you out of it as mine always [1737] did every time I mentioned starting a [1738] business um you know a lot a lot of [1741] people are just going to think that [1742] you're you're you're being moronic and [1744] that you should kind of stick to the [1745] safer path or maybe more well [1746] established thing if you're coming from [1747] a 9 [1748] to5 this is definitely the hardest thing [1751] to grasp so um you know you're going to [1753] get a lot more uh if you're coming from [1755] like some other successful business a [1757] lot of people are probably still going [1759] to be asking you questions like hey man [1760] like why aren't you just doing the thing [1761] that you know works right that other [1762] thing and that's okay I received a lot [1765] of this when I started um left click uh [1767] because it was like hey what about you [1768] know one second copy what about the [1769] content writing company man like 92 came [1770] out D it's making a ton of money you're [1771] good you're good you're good you're good [1772] and it's like well I believe in this and [1773] I could see a future where this is more [1775] important so I'm going to focus on it so [1777] if I could just offer another word of [1778] advice it just be you know you don't [1780] need to scream this from the parapets [1781] just uh you know lock in as the kids say [1785] try and get as much done as humanly [1786] possible um away from prying eyes uh [1789] don't let them demotivate you [1790] essentially and then once you have some [1792] measure of success then you can start [1793] talking about it a lot [1795] more okay remember how earlier I said [1797] you're going to be in [1799] debt so you're basically going to be in [1802] like AI automation [1805] debt so you know there's this whole idea [1808] um and there I don't think it was horos [1810] that came up with it but he probably [1811] popularized [1813] it and if you don't know who hormos is [1815] that's Alex hormos he's one of like the [1817] bigger consultants in the space now not [1818] the a automation space but just you know [1820] entrepreneurship in general the idea is [1822] like when you when you start any new [1823] business model um you're going to have [1826] some debt okay like we all want to start [1829] at zero but the reality is you're [1831] actually going to start at like I don't [1833] know this is zero and you're actually [1835] going to start at like negative five or [1838] something just in terms of like your [1839] your skill and this this right here is [1841] your debt so you're actually going to [1842] start here the the unfortunate thing is [1844] um your goal is you got to pay this down [1846] as quickly as possible if you don't if [1848] you just allow the debt of your skill so [1851] maybe your client management debt or [1853] your technical debt or um I don't know [1855] your inability to use no code debt or or [1858] whatever um debt compounds really [1859] quickly so it'll actually go the [1861] opposite direction for you so your goal [1863] is basically like hey I need to take [1864] whatever I have time energy money and [1866] just pay down this debt Gap as much as [1868] possible I just need to shoot up and [1870] once I'm at zero that's fine I can chill [1872] at this zero level as as often as [1874] possible um and you know maybe [1876] eventually start accumulating stuff but [1878] but if you're not um you just you just [1879] tend to grow um there are few things [1882] that um compound in [1884] life um debt is unfortunately one of [1886] them [1888] so if we just flip this graph over [1889] hypothetically and this is just like the [1891] depth graph instead okay this was zero [1895] this was I don't [1896] know5 -10 -20 and this is time uh [1900] basically you know debt will compound [1903] faster and faster and faster and faster [1904] the more you leave it so you just have [1906] to make sure to pay that down as [1907] possible now compounding can be really [1909] positive if it's like your net worth [1911] right because you have a certain amount [1912] of [1913] interest but it can also be really [1915] really negative if it's debt [1918] and in our case um our our our thing is [1920] debt here so basically you have a bunch [1922] of things you need to pay down really [1923] quickly okay so um here's just a quick [1926] list you you have uh let's do technical [1929] debt to [1931] start so odds are you're working with [1934] new [1934] technologies these are like no code [1939] tools these are um like AI prompting [1945] probably these are things like that [1948] essentially software programming you're [1950] also going to have um business [1955] debt so this is going to be stuff like [1957] uh I don't know like client management [1959] skills you know business skill [1961] debt basically client management [1965] skills um and even if you've worked with [1967] other clients or whatever you still have [1968] client management skill debt for this [1969] particular industry because it's a [1970] little bit different um I don't know [1972] like [1973] proposals basically admin you're going [1976] to have like sales debt right because [1978] you've probably not sold this sort of [1980] thing before so you're gonna have you're [1981] G to have all sorts of debt um you [1983] basically just have to knock these out [1984] as quickly as possible and how do you [1985] knock these out as quickly as possible [1987] you knock these out fast by just [1989] accepting projects um and then trading [1991] you know even if it's like less money [1992] than you're comfortable with or happy [1994] with trading a little bit of the money [1996] for the ability to pay down these [1997] spheres of debt like technical in [1999] business so um as long as you go from [2001] from 0 to one like if you're the sort of [2003] person that just like accumulates small [2004] wins goes from 0 to one in as short a [2006] time period as possible um you know your [2008] your trajectory is going to be like this [2009] we got a ton of people in my communities [2011] right now and I'm seeing this live for [2012] myself it's the people that like take [2014] the small winds that tend to snowball [2015] and accumulate that's really all that [2016] you're that's all that you're really [2017] focused on so related to that notion is [2021] this notion of um of custom projects [2024] okay so uh a custom [2028] project is basically this this [2032] idea where you're not actually selling a [2036] specific system like I'm not selling a [2038] cold email system I'm selling uh like my [2041] skill as an AI automation person so on [2044] jobs Platforms in particular like like [2046] upwork and then typically through [2047] through networking you usually end up [2049] with people that don't really fully [2051] understand the Technologies is playing [2052] they don't really know what they want [2054] and so when you start talking to them [2055] it's like hey I want a system that kind [2056] of does this but I'm not entirely sure [2058] would you mind helping me out odds are [2060] this isn't a system that you built [2061] before so because it's not a system you [2063] built before you have to customize you [2064] have to do something new right you're [2066] basically rebuilding the wheel so these [2067] are called custom projects and generally [2069] people in the industry admonish custom [2071] projects they they hate them because [2072] they say well custom projects are a [2074] massive waste of time it's not how you [2075] actually grow a business and so on and [2077] so forth and the reason you know like it [2078] it makes sense right custom projects [2080] tend to be very unscalable because you [2082] have to do something new every time so [2084] let me just give you some pros and cons [2086] instead because there are actually many [2089] places where you should accept custom [2090] projects especially at the beginning um [2093] and I definitely did a lot of custom [2094] projects that while they were really [2095] tough um ended up paying down all all of [2098] this sort of debt very very quickly okay [2101] so the pro the big Pro is it's easy to [2103] make money [2105] quickly because you know if you think [2108] about it when you're competing in a [2110] market it's kind of like um supply [2113] versus [2115] demand right it's the whole like classic [2118] economics if Supply is up then demand is [2121] down whereas if demand if Supply is down [2124] then demand is up more people want your [2125] stuff you could charge more for it so [2128] let's say you're selling like templated [2129] cold email systems or something well [2130] odds are there are a lot of people that [2131] are selling templated cold email systems [2133] at this point so what does that mean for [2134] the supply it's actually pretty high [2135] meaning demand is down so it's actually [2137] tougher to sell um one of these [2138] templated systems right but how about if [2140] somebody wants some custom integration [2142] with zapier and Panda do and he wants [2145] you to sprinkle on a little bit of deep [2147] seek R3 connected to some custom server [2150] Rack or whatever well what's what do you [2152] think the supply is for people that sell [2154] that exact thing really low right so [2156] obviously they are going to be willing [2158] to pay a lot more they're going to [2159] demand it a lot more so it's a very [2161] quick and easy way to make money quickly [2163] because because there's just no there's [2164] no other competition selling the same [2166] thing and so you can typically charge [2167] you know I don't know like [2170] $223,000 for a project and you can get [2173] that you know maybe half up front or [2175] trunch in Milestones or whatever so [2177] that's pretty cool um and it's great to [2179] pay down other [2182] debt [2184] because uh on top of the um [2188] big cash inflow you're also now working [2190] with the client a lot more um you're [2192] doing things like a lot more client [2193] management you're doing things like [2194] setting expectations doing timelines [2196] basically managing custom projects is [2198] like uh the the the microcosm of of [2201] managing a whole business um you're also [2204] solving your technical debt because [2205] you're obviously going to be working [2206] with technologies that like you're not [2207] really templating out okay so it's just [2210] a great way to pay down debt so these [2212] are the three pros basically the cons is [2214] it's [2216] unscalable and if you're doing custom [2220] projects um you cap out pretty [2224] quick you have a low ceiling let's [2229] say also [2231] hiring which you need if you want to [2233] scale in AI automation agencies is very [2237] hard it's hard to hire well just one of [2239] those unfortunate things you need [2240] technical people but you also need [2241] people that understand like business [2243] utility and knowledge and stuff and it's [2245] just very unlikely that you get both you [2246] need to look really hard [2248] so uh really kind of the best way to do [2250] it okay if I just do another one of my [2252] famous graphs good God am I just going [2254] to be the graph guy um basically the the [2258] way to do custom projects is if you [2261] think about like the the life cycle of [2264] your [2266] agency and this is your [2268] Revenue my recommendation is do custom [2271] projects really quickly initially okay [2274] use that to bump up your Revenue after [2276] that you know take [2278] um take a little bit of time and sort of [2280] like reevaluate what your product is use [2282] the custom projects that you just did as [2285] a way to determine um kind of like what [2287] the scalable product is kind of take a [2289] couple steps back and see you know can I [2291] systematize can I find a way to do this [2292] sort of thing at scale then once you [2294] productized and found something that [2296] works then um well you're going to grow [2299] a little bit slower than that initial [2300] Revenue but it's going to be a lot more [2303] sustainable so I would recommend [2306] basically that that white [2309] is custom [2312] projects this [2316] blue is U [2321] productizing and then this [2324] red I think this is red yes is you [2329] scaling so this is you know one aspect [2332] uh of your business right over here one [2336] part this is is another part then [2338] obviously this is the biggest and the [2339] longest one because it goes up the [2341] highest and it's also kind of where you [2342] should be spending the bulk of your time [2344] you know in my opinion this is sort of [2347] like I don't know zero to 3month [2350] territory okay this is sort of like I [2353] don't know 3 to six month territory and [2356] then everything over [2358] here is sort of like um just just the [2361] rest of your business and this is like [2362] the successful business now many ways to [2365] conceptualize this it's not always 0 to [2366] three or six so take all that with a [2368] grain of salt but um you know I've just [2370] worked with over a thousand automation [2372] agencies now and I'm starting to see [2373] some [2374] Trends okay the next concept that I want [2377] to chat [2378] about is leverage and if you really want [2381] to crush [2382] it you should understand leverage you [2384] should understand it very deeply so what [2387] Leverage is is it's just the The Art of [2390] Doing more with less so it is generating [2393] a larger output for Less input the way [2397] it works if you guys are familiar with [2401] levers is [2404] basically if you [2406] have a stone okay and the stone here [2411] let's just uh let me draw a Little [2413] Rock and this this weighs it down with I [2416] don't know let's say 100 [2418] pound if you wanted to lift up the stone [2421] what you would have to do is you would [2423] apply 100 lb at exactly the same [2426] distance away from the stone on the [2427] other side which would be over here [2431] okay but because of how Levers work if [2434] you just go up the lever if you just go [2439] over here a little [2440] bit then in order to lift the stone up [2443] by pushing down over here you might [2445] actually only have to do about 30 pounds [2447] of [2449] force and that's because um this is just [2452] a fundamental mechanism or law of [2454] physics it's it's the way that Levers [2455] work when you have a full Chrome which [2457] is this thing right over here you can [2458] apply less Force further away and then [2461] in exchange you'll have to move more but [2463] this this rock you'll essentially be [2464] able to lift this rock with [2465] substantially less um less weight you [2468] know I'm sure many of you guys know this [2469] is how like Hydraulics work it's how [2471] like those little pneumatic or hydraulic [2473] door closer and opener things work it's [2475] how uh Jacks in your car work right like [2478] you can't actually lift up your whole [2479] car but what you can do is you can push [2481] over a much longer distance with much [2482] less Force to slowly crank up um the [2485] other side of it so understanding [2487] Leverage is really important you don't [2488] need to do it in like a physics sense [2490] but I do think it's a really great [2491] mental model to know like if you [2493] understand the physic sense behind it uh [2494] you know like if this is X and then if [2496] like this is X and if like this is 3x [2500] then the amount of force is going to be [2501] whatever this is divided by three so [2503] it'll actually be 33 right um so you [2507] don't you don't have to know this uh [2508] from a physics sense but I do recommend [2510] you know this from like uh at least like [2512] a somewhat intuitive sense the cool [2514] thing about automation is if I just [2515] redraw this now [2518] um I think about our business model is [2520] basically the same thing um if you get [2522] in the habit of using uh templates so [2525] this is a [2526] client okay normally in order to move a [2529] client at the same distance right you'd [2532] have to apply I don't know let's just [2534] say like 10 [2535] hours well if you use templates okay [2538] what you can do is you can move this [2539] client that that's worth 10 [2542] hours and then um I don't know this is [2546] like six uh 7 [2548] hours you can actually do so in like 3 [2552] hours instead okay this isn't the best [2554] diagram but I I think you guys [2556] understand my point so you can apply [2557] this concept to basically anything in [2558] life whether it's business pleasure [2560] personal Romantics I I I don't know um [2563] but in the case of automation the cool [2565] part about a template is the template [2568] already like gets you 80% of the way [2570] there instead of you having some big [2573] long exp [2575] bar like uh back in Pokemon on or [2577] something where you have to start from [2579] zero and then painstakingly do your [2581] project and go all the way up to 100% [2583] every single time what you do instead is [2587] you actually get to [2589] start at [2591] 80% and so your template's already 80% [2594] of the way filled so what do you do all [2596] you have to do is just go 80 to 100 [2598] which is obviously a lot easier right [2600] I'm finding myself using a lot more [2601] video game analogies specifically [2602] because uh I've had a bunch of people [2604] tell me hey man these video game [2605] analogies really make all the stuff make [2607] makes sense so if you like the video [2608] game analogies let me know if you if you [2610] don't then um leave them down in the [2613] comments okay so the next point I want [2616] to make is spend an inordinate amount of [2620] time on [2623] design what is design design is you [2627] making stuff look good and feel good if [2630] I think about like top three or four [2633] skills um design uh for me in my [2635] business would be one of them and I [2637] don't necessarily mean you have to be [2638] able to like craft an amazing website [2641] landing page or something I just mean [2642] when you when you work through a project [2645] just understand that the Aesthetics or [2646] the the packaging of that project is [2647] really important remember how earlier we [2649] talked about um making sure that it [2650] worked at the first demo this is [2652] basically the same thing make sure that [2654] the design of the product is very clean [2656] and make sure the Aesthetics and the [2657] packaging are very very tight for [2659] instance if your automation or AI tool [2662] generates an email of some kind don't [2664] just write a crappy little prompt and [2665] then have it stick out the emails and be [2666] like awesome we now generate emails if [2669] you're going to spend time on anything [2670] in the business spend time on the thing [2672] that the customer is going to be looking [2674] at like those emails so like that's [2675] actually where you apply your Force [2677] that's actually where you spend your [2679] time and energy and if you can figure [2681] out um you know the design first and [2683] foremost and if you can add that to your [2684] templates you get even more leveraged so [2686] design is is super super incredible I'm [2688] not trying to [2690] say that form is over function [2693] okay most people see things [2697] like [2699] this all I'm trying to say is that [2702] nowadays it's more like let start with [2705] form actually it's not it's not either [2707] of these it's kind of like form is equal [2708] to [2709] function so if you're going to spend you [2711] know 50% of the time building the system [2714] spend at least that much amount of time [2716] making the system look look really [2717] pretty or at least making the outputs of [2718] the system look pretty because keep in [2720] mind systems are um generally speaking [2722] just a black box for the customer right [2725] like you're going to put some input [2728] then you're going to get some sort of [2730] output customer doesn't really give a [2732] crap what's inside of there as we [2733] mentioned and as we talked about already [2735] so what you want to do instead is when [2736] you focus your time you want to focus on [2738] making the output just look beautiful [2740] and as pretty and as incredible as [2742] humanly possible [2745] okay okay I got a great tip up next for [2748] us overthinkers in the room which I know [2751] are many um you know don't automate [2755] everything [2757] automate stuff but don't automate [2759] everything I used to get in the habit of [2761] automating everything because I was like [2763] I'm an automation guy I work with AI of [2765] course I'm going to automate everything [2767] well in reality nowadays I actually [2768] automate a shockingly little of my work [2771] like I think most people would probably [2772] be surprised to learn just how little of [2774] my work that I automate you know just in [2776] terms of the way that I spend my time um [2778] I I I automate basically nothing of of [2780] note I'll give you a quick example every [2782] morning I will go log on to all of my [2783] bank accounts and I will count up um all [2786] of the the bank transactions and I'll [2787] manually move them over to a spreadsheet [2789] I do all this completely manually could [2791] I automate it yeah in like 2 seconds [2793] it's one of the most basic automations [2794] that anybody could build right you watch [2796] for a new bank transaction or maybe you [2797] pull it once a day then you just pull [2799] all new entries into into a sheet I do [2801] it manually and the reason why is [2802] because I've identified this as a very [2804] high leverage way for me to spend my [2805] time if I every morning reenter my [2808] thoughts back to hey what am I actually [2810] doing this for right money right if I [2813] Center my thoughts back to money every [2815] morning for 5 or 10 minutes is is there [2817] really anything more effective those 5 [2819] minutes May influence the decisions that [2821] I make over the subsequent 16 hours if [2823] I'm thinking about money and return on [2825] investment I know how much money I'm [2826] losing on a daily basis how much money [2828] I'm making on a daily basis this just [2829] makes me substantially more capable and [2832] more um I don't know on point I guess as [2835] a business person um for for the rest of [2836] the day another example is my [2838] communities I I respond to all of my [2840] communities manually right A lot of [2842] people are like dude you do that [2843] yourself what the hell don't you want to [2844] hire all these people to do it for you [2845] and I'm like no because that has to be [2847] the biggest point of Leverage that I [2849] have if I respond to something manually [2852] people know that I respond to it [2853] manually they appreciate that I respond [2854] to it manually I mean how much Goodwill [2856] am I building in the marketplace how [2857] much uh churn am I reducing in my [2859] communities and so on and so forth uh [2861] you know when it comes to client [2862] management and stuff like I don't have [2864] it fully automated I will talk to the [2865] client once a week usually once a week [2867] per client as part of my subscription or [2869] retainer package um that call is [2871] immensely important what's another [2873] example um travel I I literally you know [2875] after I know a client for certain amount [2877] of time even if I'm over here and [2880] they're over here and this is like many [2885] uh I actually don't know how many [2886] kilometers it is many kilometers away [2889] okay I will fly over to them and I will [2892] get a hotel a few blocks from their [2895] office and I will pay it all out of [2896] pocket and I will spend two or three [2897] days in the in the area manual vicinity [2900] of their office I will hang out with [2902] them I'll come into their business I'll [2903] shake hands kiss babies do everything I [2904] need to do you know this is the opposite [2907] of automation but why do I do it because [2909] it's well it's not automation it's [2912] leverage if you can get in the habit of [2914] spending the little time that you do [2916] have every day on the things that are [2917] the most effective well what happens by [2919] me doing this I basically secure X [2921] months of no [2923] churn I secure a better relationship I [2927] could like 2x my subscription I don't [2930] always 2x my subscription but I can I [2932] can you know open up Partnerships I can [2934] have much better client relationship for [2936] the time that we do spend together the [2938] team likes me more right I guess the [2940] point I'm making is the time that I do [2941] spend tends to be extraordinarily [2942] effective so um you know a good you know [2946] one final example that I mentioned here [2948] is a lot of people want to like okay [2949] they ask me hey um Can can I automate an [2951] email [2954] campaign and they say you know I get a [2956] lot of positive responses I kind of want [2957] to automate these because I get like [2959] five a day or something and they're like [2961] um can I just feed this into AI I I just [2963] want you to think about what you're [2964] gaining versus losing if you were to do [2966] something like this and then I want you [2967] to take the same concept and apply to [2968] all the other areas in your business so [2970] you automating email responses if you [2972] get let's say 10 responses a day okay [2974] how long is it actually take for you to [2975] respond to 10 per day yourself might [2977] realistically take you okay 20 minutes [2980] well let's just make it really [2981] unreasonable and say 30 minutes assuming [2984] you're not using any templates or [2985] whatever it takes you half an hour every [2986] day to respond to these things right and [2987] you're like man I want that half hour [2988] back can I automate it okay so you save [2990] 30 minutes a day how many days a week or [2993] a month are you doing this you're [2994] probably doing this let's just say 30 [2995] let's actually say you're doing every [2996] single day of the month 30 * 30 minutes [2999] is 15 hours okay how much is your time [3002] worth let's say your time is worth uh I [3004] don't know if you're at the start line [3005] of your business might be 50 bucks an [3006] hour if you're at the the middle point [3008] of your business something maybe it's [3009] 150 bucks let's just cater this towards [3010] beginners let's say it's 100 bucks an [3012] hour so what are you actually saving on [3014] a monthly basis if you think about it [3016] this way well you are [3018] saving [3021] $1,500 for the month by automating this [3024] wow that's great you think I can save [3026] $1,500 a month take the opportunity cost [3028] and put it on something else right okay [3030] well let's count up the total number of [3031] responses in the month let's say you get [3033] 300 [3034] okay [3036] now let's gauge the effectiveness of [3039] having AI do it versus you do it let's [3044] say when you do it okay you are 90% or [3048] something okay H let's just make it [3049] really simple you are 100% effective you [3052] are a human being and you're just great [3053] at doing what you're doing AI on the [3055] other hand is 90% effective so listen [3058] it's still really effective okay it's [3060] just 10% off of you but what that means [3062] is because it's 90% effective if you [3064] multiply this by 300 [3069] responses what you're doing is you're [3071] throwing [3072] away [3074] 10% which means you only have 270 left [3077] so you just lost 30 responses that's [3079] minus 30 what if every closed deal is [3084] worth $2,000 to you and you close one in [3088] 10 deals these are all very conservative [3090] numbers by the way the reality is a lot [3092] higher if you've lost 30 and you closed [3094] one in every 10 deals you would have [3096] closed three Deals if you would have [3098] closed three Deals times [3100] $2,000 you would have made 6,000 so what [3104] you've done is you've traded [3108] $6,000 to get [3110] $1,500 okay that means that you're [3113] actually in the red or uh yeah in the [3115] red here by $4,500 and this is super [3118] conservative you'd be surprised at some [3120] of these situations in which people want [3121] to automate the most high leverage part [3123] of their business which is like securing [3125] leads securing clients it's crazy to me [3128] I understand why because you know I sort [3130] of wanted to do some of the same stuff [3131] way back in the day but when you [3133] understand leverage when you understand [3134] the point at which you need to press in [3135] order to extract maximum value out of a [3137] business um stuff like this just ends up [3139] being [3140] insane okay I have one more and then [3143] it's showtime or maybe go time [3147] more leads or actually let's just call [3149] it growth more growth [3153] solves [3155] everything okay more growth is almost [3159] always the answer now I know what you [3161] guys are thinking more growth what if I [3163] have too much growth believe it or not [3165] the answer to Too Much growth is more [3167] growth and I say this totally non- [3169] factiously if you have a lot of leads [3173] it's almost like everything it's almost [3176] like you having a lot of leads is like a [3177] hammer and it makes everything look like [3179] a nail okay so you know this is your [3183] super big hammer and because of that all [3187] of your problems just turn into Nails [3190] let me give you an example this is uh I [3192] don't know project [3195] management this is [3200] hiring this is I don't know founder [3204] chaos where you think everything's [3206] chaotic you're going crazy Believe It or [3208] Not [3210] leads actually solves all of these [3213] problems when you have more leads in [3215] your business this is why it's like a [3217] cure all man it's like Stevia was you [3219] know 20 or 30 years ago where it's like [3221] oh my God there's zero calories in this [3223] thing incredible everything's it's like [3225] OIC is now right it's like everything [3230] about having more leads is good because [3233] when you have more leads okay even if [3235] your project management is is like super [3236] disorganized and you're swimming and [3238] work you have no idea what's going on [3239] more leads will solve this because it [3242] means that in the future you can accept [3244] only the jobs that are the simplest and [3246] the highest quality the ones that pay [3249] you a disproportionate amount of money [3252] per unit time okay if you're running [3254] into issues with hiring and you're like [3256] oh man I I don't have a big enough team [3257] to take on all this work more leads will [3259] solve this because more leads means you [3262] will be able to choose the work that [3264] requires the fewest people to fulfill [3267] you'll be able to specifically sell [3269] those product eyes services that we [3270] talked about or some variant of them [3273] that is hyper templated so that you [3275] don't actually need to go and hire well [3277] all all you need to do is you need to [3278] make more leads okay founder chaos what [3280] if you're tearing your hair you're [3281] working 16 hours a day you're like I [3283] can't have a single more lead in my [3285] business or I'm going to off myself well [3287] more leads solves that because with more [3289] leads you get to work with only the [3291] clients that you know like and Trust [3294] only the clients that for a single unit [3297] of [3298] time this is a unit deliver you a [3302] disproportionate amount of [3304] money you will basically have the pick [3307] of the litter let's say before you had a [3311] lot of [3312] leads this is one month okay in one [3316] whole month from start to finish you got [3319] I don't know one lead here another lead [3321] here another lead here this lead pays [3325] you $500 [3327] this lead pays you [3329] $1,000 and then this lead pays you [3333] $2,000 okay so what are you going to [3335] pick well obviously I'm going to pick [3337] all three because I only have three [3339] clients a whole month of course I'm [3340] going to pick all three however um now [3343] my total income for the month is [3346] 3,500 and maybe you know uh I'm just [3348] working out some time metric $3,500 for [3351] I don't know maybe 100 hours is now 35 [3353] bucks an hour or something okay can now [3356] let's pretend hypothetically we have the [3358] exact same situation but you have 10 [3361] times the [3364] leads you're getting so many [3367] opportunities over the course of the [3371] month I don't know if I've done 30 I [3373] think I've done 30 okay so what if 99 or [3376] 90% of these are are like these but then [3378] every once in a while you got a stand [3379] out this guy pays you [3383] $5,000 this guy is with willing to pay [3388] $7,500 this guy is willing to pay [3393] $3,500 okay per per some unit of time [3396] well now I have so many more [3397] opportunities obviously instead of me [3400] having to work with three people and [3401] spend 100 hours I could just work with [3403] one dude spend maybe 50 hours then make [3407] uh more than two times the money you [3409] know 7500 divid 50 instead is 150 bucks [3413] an [3414] hour now what did I have to do do in [3416] order to make that happen well I [3417] probably need to spend some more money [3418] on the front end right but to make [3420] $4,000 more in this hypothetical example [3422] plus an additional $115 per hour I'm up [3425] for that aren't you up for that so if [3428] you just sort out your lead gen first [3430] okay if you make sure to take care of [3431] that first and foremost the beginning of [3433] every day you have some sort of lead gen [3435] actionable maybe if you're uh if you [3437] have some inbound Channel like me you're [3438] creating content first thing in the [3439] morning or or whatever or if you have [3441] some sort of outbound Channel cold email [3443] those dirty kind of upwork tricks that I [3445] was talking about earlier if you do that [3446] first thing you frontload your leads all [3449] of the rest of your problems in your [3450] business just start to disappear and [3452] this is specifically relevant to AI [3454] automation because of the tendency to [3456] have as many custom projects and large [3459] Scopes and and things like that so you [3461] can really start to see there are some [3463] massive differences between super custom [3466] highly crazy detailed Scopes that pay me [3468] little money and then that client over [3470] there wants basically the same thing but [3472] uh they only want three steps instead of [3475] 8,000 and then they're paying me the [3476] same amount obviously I'm going to go [3478] with them so I hope this gives you guys [3480] some context into how I've managed my [3483] own Ai and automation businesses over [3485] the course of the last few years [3486] specifically my agency as I know we [3488] talked about at the beginning but also [3490] just to zoom out a bit and look at the [3491] AI and automation landscape more [3493] generally like through my uh Painting [3495] Company through my content writing [3497] company and so on and so forth anybody [3499] has any questions about any of the [3500] concepts that I talked about just drop [3501] them down below I really appreciate all [3503] of your time and the Fantastic feedback [3505] I've gotten from youall very recently my [3506] Channel's been blowing up it's 100% [3508] thanks to everybody especially you that [3510] makes it to the end of the video um if [3512] you have any uh thing that you like me [3515] to record a video on in the future then [3517] please drop that suggestion down below I [3518] actually Source the vast majority of my [3520] ideas now from you which is fantastic [3522] and then if you could do me a big solid [3524] and just uh like And subscribe do all [3526] that fun stuff to bump me up to the top [3527] of the algo check out maker school and [3529] make money with make uh do all that fun [3531] stuff I'll catch you on the next video [3533] thanks so much

Title: I Built An AI Agent That Automates Upwork ($500K+ Earned)
[0] I just built an AI agent that automates [2] upwork job applications now I've made [4] about 500 Grand on upwork to date as I'm [6] sure you can imagine I've learned a lot [7] about what works and what doesn't [9] sometimes the hard way um what I've come [10] to realize is that the main [12] distinguishing factor in a good upwork [14] application versus a bad one is the [15] degree of perceived customization and [18] the degree of perceived value so what [20] I've done here is I've built an nadn AI [22] agent that produces a lot of both I've [24] also included the workflow Down Below in [25] the description so if you just want to [26] cut ahead and actually get it for [27] yourself just check that down below so [29] the way that it works is just like any [30] agent we expose a chat window we then go [33] and we grab an upwork job posting [35] preferably something that includes some [37] context about what the person wants and [39] how they want it done so I'm just going [40] to go here and then copy in all of this [43] and then we just paste it in the flow [45] then calls three subflows the first is [47] an upwork agent that generates a Google [49] doc proposal which ends up looking like [51] this this is written in best practice [54] it's everything that I've learned in [55] building uh a highly successful upwork [57] profile that's generated over $500,000 [60] after that we'll then generate um a [62] proposal reply so basically in order to [65] respond to a job on upwork you need [66] what's called a CV and so this will [68] actually go ahead and generate one for [69] you again based off best practices with [71] a little area called about me that you [73] can paste your own details into and then [75] finally it'll go and generate what's [77] called a mermaid diagram and for those [79] of you that don't know a mermaid diagram [80] is just a quick and easy way to [82] essentially get a bunch of workflow code [85] which we can copy and paste into any [87] platform to produce what looks like a [90] highly personalized and very valuable [94] workflow that you just bent over [95] backwards to create you can then do [96] whatever you want with this you can [97] screenshot it you could send it to them [99] you could make some edits to it you [101] could add it to like a bigger proposal [103] to send over um but the Crux of it is uh [106] you end up with this message and all you [108] do is you just copy and paste this [109] message when you go to apply to said [113] job you then scroll down to the CV part [116] and then you put that puppy in there [118] that's about it um this aut Ates a [120] pretty core and unique feature of upwork [122] job applications not specifically for [125] people that are running automation [126] companies but just anything that you can [128] Envision as a process and today I'm [130] actually going to be building it out [131] with you live um step by step so this [133] isn't just going to be one of those [134] situations where I show you the finish [136] product and then run through it I'm [137] actually going to show you guys what a [138] real live build process looks like from [141] start to finish so you guys can follow [142] along with me okay so let's get to it [144] I'm going to create a new workflow we're [146] going to call this live build upwork AI [149] agent I'm going to tag this as you know [151] you can do an nadn for organizational [152] purposes in my case is nadn course let's [155] just Dive Right into putting the agent [156] together um I'm going to go over here [158] and type in agent we'll go down to this [162] the window that opens will default to a [163] tools agent which is the one that we [165] want but I'd recommend you also spend a [167] little bit of time scrolling through the [168] other sorts of Agents because it's not [169] all tool agents although people tend to [171] use them uh the most I'm then going to [173] create a system message systems are just [176] the way that models Define themselves [178] and an AI agent is just you know using [179] chat GPT or whatever AI model Source [182] under the hood so it's it's no different [184] um what I usually write is you're a [186] helpful intelligent something [188] assistant and I'm going to give it some [190] additional instructions your task is to [193] receive an upwork job [196] description then use it to [198] generate assets like mermaid [202] diagrams Google Docs and upwork [205] application [207] bodies perfect so we now have our AI [210] defined and systematized we need to go [212] to chat model scroll down to open AI [214] chat model that's the one that I'm going [215] to be using and just know that you guys [216] can do whatever whatever um AI model you [218] want for this I'm just using chat GPT [221] then you have to connect an account or [222] essentially create a credential now if [224] you've never created a credential before [225] head on over to create new credential [227] and then check out the documentation [229] it's very straightforward essentially [231] you will go and get into your open AI [233] account go to the API key page and just [236] copy and paste that into this section [238] over here the second that that's done [240] your credential will be created and you [241] can proceed with the rest of this demo [243] but I'm going to move over to YouTube [244] February 4 just cuz that's one that I [246] connected and now we're connected to [248] gp4 uh o mini and I'm just going to use [251] GPT 40 mini for the purposes of this [252] although I want you guys to know that if [254] you use a better model you know you're [256] going to get better results it's just [257] going to be a little bit more time [258] intensive and computationally intensive [260] as well the next thing we're going to do [262] is we're going to go and um add window [264] buffer memory Now default contact window [266] length is five I'm just going to do 10 [268] just because models have gotten better [270] since that default was applied and now [272] we sort of get to the point where we can [273] start adding our tools so first of all [276] for those of you that are new to AI [277] agents this is now just like chatting [279] with chat gbt so you can you know ask it [282] whatever question you want and it'll use [283] the default intelligence that's built [285] into the model in order to get back to [287] you but obviously we don't just want to [288] stop there we want it to be able to call [290] sub tools and essentially execute [291] workflows on our behalf in order to do [293] things like generate a Google doc or you [296] know write us a highquality upwork [297] description or I don't know generate [299] mermaid code the thing is while you [302] could technically do all of this in just [303] one long flow um what we're going to do [305] is we're going to divide it into three [306] sub subsets so that we can make sure [309] that the module calls that we're doing [312] are basically doing the best that they [313] can at that one particular thing and I [315] found that this is pretty necessary when [316] you're dealing with models like gp4 GPT [318] 40 um if you really want to squeeze the [320] best results out of them you got to keep [322] the number of instructions that you're [323] giving them to a minimum and you also [325] just have to ask them to do like the the [326] one thing that you really want so I'm [328] going to head over to Tool [330] here and then uh I'm going to be calling [333] an n8n workflow tool the thing is we [335] don't actually have that those tools yet [336] so we're going to create them so I'm [338] going to go back over [339] here and then I'm going to be creating [341] three additional [343] workflows the first is going to be [345] called let's do live build upw agent and [349] we'll say generate um application copy [353] then I'm also going to go and generate a [355] second [357] one let's call this live build upor [360] agent generate Google doc [363] proposal then I'm going to go and [365] generate a third one which is going to [368] be called [370] generate mermaid [373] code so um if you guys want to add some [375] additional asset that maybe I'm not [377] including here then you just have to add [379] one additional layer to this you know I [381] recommend using a naming convention like [382] the name of the agent and then having a [384] colon and then some specific tool usage [386] that you want but okay great you should [388] now have you know three or four tabs [390] open one with the AI agent another with [392] the first thing we want which is it to [393] generate the application copy another [395] with the second thing that we want which [396] is to generate the Google Doc and then [398] another with the third thing which is to [399] generate that mermaid code with that [400] sexy workflow diagram I showed you guys [403] so um in order to have an AI agent [405] effectively call a service what we need [408] to do is we need to go over here and [410] then as a first step we want um when [414] called by another workflow as our [416] trigger so essentially when you have an [418] execute workflow trigger you are [420] enabling this um workflow to be called [425] by a parent somewhere else so I'm just [428] going on all three and I'm just adding [429] execute workflow trigger so now all [431] three have these little workflow [433] triggers I'm just alt tabbing or in my [435] case control shift tabbing and control [437] tabbing back and forth um to change tabs [440] now we're going to start one by one um [442] with the generate application copy and [444] then once that's done it's kind of a [446] simple um ask we're going to move over [448] to the more complicated thing which is [449] creating a a Google doc and updating it [450] and having it ready um and then at the [452] end we're going to do the the mermaid [453] code and then we're going to put it all [455] together but starting with the generate [456] application copy if you think about [457] what's actually happening here is we're [459] basically asking this AI agent top level [462] to like maintain some sort of coherent [464] thread or thought pattern or or [466] something like that some stream of [467] Consciousness and then what we're doing [468] is we're saying hey you have all of [470] these tools available to you you know [471] here's a shovel over there is uh I don't [474] know like a scythe and and over there is [476] like a pickaxe okay I want you to go out [478] and I want you to extract some ore so if [482] you guys played RuneScape but I played a [483] ton of it back in the day if you want to [485] extract some ore you need a pickaxe [487] right so the idea is the model is smart [489] enough to kind of make that [490] determination for yourself and the [491] reason why I'm building it out in this [493] way is just so that you can add things [494] onto this agent and make it as [495] arbitrarily complex as you want you [497] could add an upwork scraper to this [499] thing to scrape jobs have those jobs [501] automatically converted into the things [503] that I'm talking to you about um you [505] know I'm just I'm just sort of laying a [507] fertile ground for you to add more or [509] less whatever you think is irrelevant [510] whatever will help you make money but [512] essentially what we want to do is um [514] here we're just going to have that first [516] agent talk to another AI model so I'm [518] going to go over here and I'll type open [519] AI I'm going to use the message a model [522] text action so because we're connecting [525] to another open AI node I'm just going [527] to use the same credential I did before [528] which is YouTube February the 4th and [531] then uh from the list what I'm going to [533] choose is just GPT 40 mini and I'm doing [535] this not because I actually care about [537] the cost but just because it's a little [538] bit faster I find and faster is better [540] um when you're dealing with stuff like [542] this you know when I'm doing a demo on [543] YouTube is what I mean to say okay great [546] now I could go in and I could like write [548] all of this from scratch again and make [549] it a little bit different but I've [551] already spent the time and energy [552] writing this specific prompt so I'm [553] actually just going to go grab that [554] prompt and then I'll run through the [556] logic and sort of tell you guys why I [557] wrote what I [559] wrote okay so this is the prompt I'm [562] going to be providing [564] it uh oh that's not actually The Prompt [566] I'm be providing it this is the prompt [568] I'm going to be providing it this is [569] going to say you are a [571] helpful intelligent upwork application [575] writer perfect so the system prompt is [577] always going to be our first one this is [578] um how the system identifies this [580] basically tells us um Let Me Whip up my [583] little drawing app here the purpose of [585] this is basically to tell uh you know [588] the AI who am [590] I right so that's how that's how the AI [594] answers this question so who am I well [596] you're a helpful intelligent upwork [598] application writer fantastic [600] this second prompt down here this user [603] prompt the purpose of this is basically [605] to [608] answer what do you want me to [611] do and so these are two different things [614] and I find the vast majority of the time [617] you know not to admonish the rest of the [619] industry or anything but the vast [620] majority of the time when you know we [622] have these amazing AI agent flows [624] usually the prompt engineering is really [625] lacking and you can tell in the [627] responses that that it sends and [628] receives the quality the assets that it [630] generates T of suck and stuff like that [631] so if you want really high quality [632] assets you got to start with with really [634] high quality prompt engineering whereas [636] high quality is one can reasonably do in [637] like the hour that it took me to build [639] this puppy but uh let me run you through [641] what it looks like generally speaking [643] and I've only stumbled upon this because [644] I've done a lot of it you want to start [648] with the context of who you are okay so [651] you want it to know something about you [653] something that it it'll need to know in [655] order to do a good job so in my case I'm [657] an automation specialist applying to [658] jobs and fre platforms right let's use [661] green green is a happier color than [663] whatever the heck I was using before the [665] next is you basically give it a task so [667] you say hey what what are you doing your [669] task is to take as input an upwork job [671] description and return as output a [672] customized proposal okay so this is just [674] a high level overview of what the model [676] does fantastic then what we do is we [678] give it an example so high performing [680] proposals are typically templated as [681] follows and now here's the here's the [684] key of prompt engineering that I'd like [685] to put across to you guys when you're [687] designing these sorts of flows for [688] yourself [690] um don't have the AI generate everything [693] have the AI generate a very small [695] portion of a thing that you've already [697] templated so for instance if I have two [699] options here okay if this is option [702] number one and I'm having it generate a [703] big long page for [705] me um and this is all AI text this is [709] what most people do they have the AI [711] generate the whole document and [714] unfortunately AI is it's it's flexible [717] which is fantastic but in business cases [719] is flexibility and the lack of flex uh [721] the lack of rigor is usually not what [724] companies want and it doesn't make you [725] money what you need to have is you need [726] to have some sort of prediction [728] predictability [729] reliability and so what you really want [731] it to do is you actually want the vast [734] majority of the text in whatever asset [737] that you're [738] making to actually already be [741] templated so what you want is you want [743] AI if AI is the green okay what you want [747] is you want to write the vast majority [749] of it yourself then just have ai fill in [752] the blanks for you maybe a couple lines [754] here or there okay that's about it so um [758] after you tell it who you are after you [760] give it a little bit of context [761] surrounding the high level version of [762] the task what you want it to do is is [765] give it an example in my case of the [766] template that I want it to write now [768] I've written tons of these things before [770] I mean you know I made 500,000 bucks on [772] upwork you don't make 500 Grand unless [773] you sort of uh without sort of figuring [775] out what people like and and and how [777] best to treat them so so a high [779] performing template that I found is [781] where you basically just uh you say Hey [784] you say I do what exactly what you're [785] asking all the time I'm really confident [787] the right fit for it so I've actually [788] just done something custom for you in [791] this case I created a workflow diagram [793] plus a demo of your thing in no code [796] okay and you'll see that I'm wrapping [797] these in these um little curly braces [800] these are just variables that I'm using [801] to tell the AI model this is what I want [803] you to to change so hi I do thing all [806] the time I'm so confident I'm the right [808] fit for you that I just created a [809] workflow diagram plus a demo of your [812] blank in no code what I'm going to do is [814] I'm going to include this as a link [816] right and this is going to be if you [817] think about it that proposal that we [818] have here and what we can do very easily [820] is you could obviously just take a take [822] a screenshot of this and then you can [824] include that um in said file uh you know [827] just before you go and apparently I [830] can't cut and paste into Google Docs [831] because I'm using the wrong browser [833] anyway I think you guys understand the [834] point that I'm trying to make um so uh [837] yeah and then I have these dollar signs [838] here this is just a way that I'm telling [839] the model later uh Hey I want you to [841] like fill in these dollar signs with the [843] actual link and then uh about me I'm a [847] relevant job description that has done [848] cool relevant thing of note other cool [851] tie-in very neat happy to do this for [853] you anytime just respond to this [854] proposal else I don't get a chat window [856] thank you so there's a lot going on here [858] and I'm not going to you know I'm not [860] going to harp on every little bit but [861] the whole happy to do this for you [863] anytime just respond to this proposal [865] else I don't get a chat window I found [866] when I started including verbiage like [867] this in my upwork proposals and and [869] outbound messages um application or [871] proposal to reply rate um shot up so I [874] think the reality is a lot of people [875] that use upwork that are hiring for jobs [877] and stuff like that they don't actually [878] understand that you can't interact with [881] them unless they send you a message [882] first you know upwork tells them but I I [884] don't think the best majority of people [885] really know so we're just we're just [887] harping on this on this fact if you like [889] what you saw and if you like me you got [891] to send me a message in order to keep [892] talking and I know it's like a throwaway [894] lineer it certainly seems that way but [896] stuff like that works really well anyway [898] so um you know if we just go back to our [901] little writing tool [903] here what we did before was we provided [906] a template [908] right well now what we do is we go rules [912] and [915] formatting and when you do [917] rules I always now do it as just a um [920] new line delimited AKA like a big list [923] of bullet points um and then when I do [925] the format I always give it the key that [927] I want it to Output in my case I'm going [928] to be using Json JavaScript object [929] notation specifically because it allows [931] us to format the results and grab them [932] as variables which you'll see in a [934] second um but I this is the format that [936] I always use when I when I develop [937] prompts and I find that output quality [939] just tends to go up if you guys are [940] curious about how to improve the quality [942] of your prompts um on your end just head [944] over to anthropics prompt [948] guide they have this big prompt [950] engineering step-by-step guide they [952] literally give you everything that you [954] could ever possibly need about prompt [956] engineering right over here and [958] everything that anthropic talks about is [960] similar um similarly apply to everything [962] that chat GPT or open AI or or other [964] models do the only difference between [966] anthropic and um open AI is anthropic [968] prefers XML tags whereas open a prefers [970] Json that's really not a big deal you [972] can totally um um do them [975] interchangeably okay great and then at [976] the end here I have some facts about me [978] for the personalization um json. about [980] me so let me actually change this to an [982] expression just so we can actually [984] render variables this is now in Gray [985] because we don't actually have this this [987] variable um before [989] but then the last thing we need to do [990] obviously is we need to feed it the the [992] job description so let me just go job [994] description and then um I'm just going [997] to have a a placeholder down here we'll [999] click output content is Json then just [1001] as an option here um I'm going to go [1004] down to Output Randomness temperature [1005] I'm just going to change it to 0.7 why [1007] because anecdotally I find that my [1009] responses are closer to my tone of voice [1010] and what I like um when I'm at an 0.7 [1013] versus a one okay great so we have [1015] everything that we need there there's [1016] one more thing I have to add that I [1017] forgot to do um I I just want a way for [1021] um you guys to be able to like swap in [1023] your own templates um and information [1024] about yourself at will just because I [1026] think it's important to make all the [1027] templates that I put out actually have [1029] some like practical purpose so I'm going [1030] to create an about me variable using an [1032] edit Fields node for those of you that [1033] are unfamiliar this is basically like a [1035] set a variable node in make.com and [1037] other no code platforms and just to make [1040] my life easy I'm just going to copy the [1042] about me that I wrote for myself before [1044] which is right over there um which was [1046] I'm an AI automation freelancer that [1048] builds out systems CRM systems project [1050] management systems no code systems and [1051] integration some notable things I've [1052] done I've done endend project management [1054] for a $1 million a year cooperating [1056] agency outbound acquisition system that [1058] grew a Content company from 10K to 92k a [1060] month monday.com CRM for recruiting [1063] company doing 1 million a year blah blah [1064] blah blah right here's just some little [1065] pieces of social proof when you guys [1067] actually jump in there and um you know [1070] uh uh like edit the thing uh the the the [1073] workflow uh just add your own social [1076] proof I'm going to leave mine in and you [1077] can just you can just map it one for one [1078] one if you want to and make your life a [1080] little bit [1081] easier okay great so now we have this [1084] model we should now actually be taking [1086] some information Jason about me awesome [1089] now what we need to do is if you think [1090] about it we need to test this right um [1092] and then I need to find a way to get get [1093] a variable in here so in order to test [1096] when you use an execute workflow trigger [1098] you actually have to to pin um the data [1101] yourself like if you want to be able to [1102] test this realistically and see [1104] everything in your browser um just like [1105] you would with any other sort of [1107] workflow you need to actually go up here [1108] to the top rightand corner of the [1109] execute workflow trigger and then you [1111] have to to pin the result so I'm [1113] actually going to create my own Json [1115] JavaScript object notation I'm going to [1116] call it query because that's how the AI [1118] agent node is going to be sending our [1119] data and then what I'm going to do is [1122] I'm just going to get the big long [1123] upwork job description here and I'm just [1126] going to paste it in so let me just go [1129] all the way this is actually going to be [1130] really long so I'm going to copy this [1133] then I'll say remove new lines from this [1136] I.E put it all on one line I'm going to [1139] paste this whole thing in this is going [1142] to take a fair amount of time to go but [1143] basically the reason why I'm doing that [1145] is because [1147] um in Jason you can't actually have new [1149] lines you see how the text up here is uh [1152] green right now that's because this is [1154] valid Jason second that I add a new line [1156] in between my um [1158] two uh quote symbols it unfortunately [1161] breaks so what I wanted to do is I just [1163] want the model to regenerate me all of [1166] this but I wanted to do it with no no [1167] new lines so it's just simple and easy [1169] for me and the moment that that's done [1170] I'm just going to paste it right over [1172] here and then we'll have our [1174] query so these lovely human beings did [1177] write a fair amount and that's okay I [1179] want to show you guys how it works on [1181] variable output [1182] links awesome that looks pretty good to [1184] me so I'm I'm going to copy this and [1185] then I'm going to go over here and just [1187] paste it and then I'm going to save and [1189] this is going to automatically pin the [1190] output and so now this is a little [1193] purple circle around it um that just [1195] means that the output is pinned set [1197] variable um we have the query I'm just [1199] going to test this so I can watch the [1201] output okay now I have the about me I'm [1203] going to move over here to the right and [1204] now I'm actually just going to insert [1207] the job description from the execute [1209] workflow trigger if you don't have an [1212] expression field when you drag something [1214] in and n8n it'll just automatically [1216] stick it at the end which I know is [1217] annoying so just make sure you you [1218] change anything to an expression field [1220] first before you want to do that anyway [1222] now I have the whole job description F [1223] in is JS n JavaScript object notation I [1226] have this trigger that's say output [1227] content is Json I can out test this on [1230] open Ai and I can have it try and [1232] basically generate me an example of this [1235] okay [1236] so uh let's see here hi I do thing all [1239] the time I'm so confident I'm the right [1241] fit for you that I just created a [1242] workflow diagram plus a demo of your [1244] blank in this case receipt and invoice [1246] extraction system in no code beautiful [1249] about me I'm an a automation freelancer [1251] that has done endend project management [1252] for $1 million year copyrighting agency [1254] and built an automated content [1255] generation system for an SEO agency [1257] during 10 mli year I've noted run a [1258] make.com community that is 100,000 bucks [1260] a month happy to do this for you anytime [1262] just respond to this proposal else I [1263] don't get a chat window thank you [1265] awesome so now we have that output what [1267] we have to do is if we want to get that [1269] output back to our first AI agent we [1271] actually need to um we when I call the [1275] tool which I'll set up in in a moment we [1276] actually need the output to be the name [1278] of a variable that we specify so for [1281] Simplicity uh I'm just going to go over [1283] here and create a new edit Fields note [1286] and then um what I'm going to do is I'll [1288] map it and I'll just call this let's [1290] just call it [1292] response I'm going to execute previous [1294] nodes just so I have access to that and [1296] then I'm just going to go to expression [1299] drag in this proposal field okay great [1302] so now um the AI agent is going to know [1305] that the end result is stored in a [1308] variable called response I'll tell it [1309] that in a second um and we have another [1311] variable that'll be output here called [1312] response that'll be able to access so [1315] this is in a nutshell um how we do that [1317] first part just just generate that text [1320] now we actually need to hook it up to [1321] our agent so I'm going to go call nadn [1322] workflow tool what I want to call it is [1325] I want to call it something like [1326] generate proposal or uh sorry generate U [1328] what do I call this application copy so [1330] I'll call this generate application copy [1333] and then I'm just going to follow their [1335] format which was call this tool to [1337] generate upwork application [1342] copy your input or the input will be an [1347] upwork job [1349] description the output will be the [1355] proposal the um upwork application copy [1360] string from the [1363] tool definitely do not leave that and [1365] let me just make this even clear [1367] generate upwork application copy cool [1370] the source that I'm going to do is from [1371] our database what I want is I want this [1373] some live build upwork agent generate [1375] application copy so generate application [1379] copy I may not have it you see um live [1382] build yeah I don't have it yet [1384] unfortunately because I created these [1385] three tabs or um [1388] workflows um after I created this so it [1391] doesn't actually have access to that [1392] backwards we are going to refresh I'm [1395] going to go back here and then I'm going [1396] to go live build appliation generate [1398] application copy if you find yourself in [1400] that situation in the future by the way [1401] you can just copy the ID of the workflow [1403] which is always the thing that happens [1404] after um slw workflow slash then you can [1407] just go by ID and you can paste it in [1409] here same thing right exact same thing [1411] the field to return is going to be [1412] response and that's just because this is [1414] the default uh field that naden always [1416] returns if I go back to my edit Fields [1418] node you see how I call this one [1419] response right okay beautiful so we now [1422] have basically everything that we need [1424] in order to actually test this puppy and [1426] my recommendation for you is anytime [1427] you're developing a workflow in NN or [1431] any other no code tool every time you [1432] think that you've gotten to some [1434] Milestone test it and make sure don't [1436] just assume that your flow works the way [1437] that you want it to work work okay [1439] actually go and test it so I'm just [1441] going to rename this generate [1443] application copy I'm then going to open [1446] up a chat window with my a agent I'll [1448] say hello I'm going to have it tell me [1450] something how can I assist you today if [1452] you have something specific in mind just [1453] let me know beautiful I'm going to go [1455] over [1456] here I'm going [1458] to um just make sure everything's good [1460] on this end let me just unpin this I [1463] don't want this uh [1465] here okay great and now I'm going to [1467] paste in this big upwork [1469] application here's an upwork job [1473] post and what I wanted to do is I wanted [1475] to be smart enough to know that it has [1477] to go and it has to generate um you know [1480] that upwork job application copy and [1482] voila looks like it did so if we go back [1484] to that chat window that's pretty fast [1486] here's a tailored application for the [1488] job you provided ook application copy [1490] high so you're looking for a make.com [1492] automation specialist um to streamline [1494] your blank here's all this information [1496] about me I'm happy to do this for [1498] anytime just respond this proposal else [1499] I don't get a chat window thank you so [1501] that's cool right we now have something [1502] that's being customized dynamically [1504] based off of the input we'll also notice [1506] is the output of the if we go down to [1509] the generate application copy the output [1512] of this had a dollar sign right but the [1514] AI agent was smart enough to know that [1516] it was just a bunch of dollar signs and [1517] so nothing was filled in so it actually [1519] removed it right that's pretty neat well [1521] that should be um little hint as to how [1523] we're going to combine the output of [1524] both of those tools in the future we're [1526] going to have the link the link is going [1528] to to go into the AI agent it's going to [1530] look at the um link to the Google Doc [1532] proposal and then it's going to look at [1534] the propos uh application copy that we [1535] just generated and it's going to say huh [1537] I guess this goes over there and it's [1539] actually going to like meld it for us [1540] live so that's pretty neat I'm I'm a fan [1543] but anyway I'm glad that all of this is [1544] now working and we can move on to the [1546] next step which're is going to be [1546] creating a Google doc proposal if you [1549] want to call it that um to to send out [1551] on mass now I've actually gone ahead and [1553] I've created a template for this called [1556] the Google Docs upwork proposal template [1558] now what it looks like just to walk you [1560] guys through is we start off with the [1562] title of the system we then have a brief [1564] explanation of the system so in my case [1566] I'm doing automation right so I'm [1567] building systems for people that's why I [1569] keep on saying system and system and [1570] system in your case I don't know maybe [1572] you're doing some sort of PPC ads or [1573] something feel free to to swap out the [1575] verbiage is necessary you can totally [1577] just copy this um Google doc and and [1579] save it to your own account we then [1582] start templating everything so we say [1584] hello now just because I'm bored I'm [1587] going to throw in a [1590] wave uh cuz I want this to be different [1592] from the one that I did before so hello [1594] as mentioned I'm so confident I'm the [1595] right fot for this I went ahead and [1596] created a proposal for you including a [1598] step-by-step of how i' do it I've done [1600] the below many times and working with [1602] specific part of their request is [1605] actually one of my favorite parts of [1606] automation Talk about serendipity anyway [1609] here's how I'd build it step-by-step [1610] bullet points so basically left to right [1613] float with arrows a little bit about me [1615] about me bullet points you guys kind of [1617] seeing the point here we are templating [1619] out the copy in such a way that AI is [1621] only ever responsible for a very small [1625] but important chunk of the finished [1626] product the reason why is so that human [1628] beings when they read it don't just go [1630] oh that's AI generated gibberish they go [1633] gibberish [1634] gibberish they go uh I'm just speaking [1637] gibberish now they go uh like wow you [1640] know this is really crisp and clean and [1642] obviously it's a real human being and [1644] then because we're just paraphrasing [1645] little sections here or there um we get [1647] that we get the benefits of like [1649] templating stuff out and being pretty [1650] procedural about things and we also get [1652] to take all the benefits of AI [1654] flexibility as well stuff like specific [1656] part of their requests step-by-step [1657] bullet points right at the end I say to [1660] be up front my goal is to work with you [1661] on a long-term retainer since I find it [1663] Alliance incentives and lets me help [1664] clients better so I treat everything we [1665] do together as foundational help people [1667] systems to drive revenue and maximize [1668] cost savings I am really confident I can [1670] blow this out of the park Fe so if it [1671] sounds like something you're into just [1673] respond to my proposal on upwork and [1674] we'll take it from there thank you for [1675] your time so this is all copy that I've [1678] used many times in order to make the [1679] $500,000 on upwork this is how I [1682] communicate with clients I always [1683] frontload and say my goal is to get you [1685] on some sort of recurring relationship [1686] everything I'm doing is in effort from [1688] that I'm 100% transparent at the very [1690] beginning of my relationship uh I find [1693] that if you just frontload with that you [1695] tend to perform a lot better and people [1697] are just I don't know they just tend to [1698] like you more because they're like huh [1699] the guy said he was going to do [1700] something then he did it they did like [1703] extra on top of that and then he pitched [1704] me the thing that he told me he was [1705] going to pitch me right they kind of [1707] know what to expect [1708] so this is the template I'm going to use [1711] why don't we move over to our second [1713] node here or our second workflow which [1714] is the generate Google doc proposal so [1716] if you think about it um what we're [1718] going to have to do is we're going to [1719] have to generate a bunch of variables so [1722] title of system brief explanation of [1723] system right specific part of their [1725] request step-by-step bullet points we're [1727] basically going to have to go and we're [1728] have to generate all these little tiny [1730] tiny bits here or there and then we're [1731] going to have to fit them in so there [1733] are a couple things that we're going to [1734] want to do the first is we're going to [1735] want to copy the Google Doc um you know [1738] first and foremost because we're not [1739] going to want to like do any edits on [1740] the main template we're going to [1741] obviously want to copy the template then [1743] do all the edits on there um the second [1745] thing we're going to need to do is we're [1746] going to need to find some sort of find [1747] and replace unfortunately in nadn as [1750] opposed to a lot of other tools um [1752] there's no like simple way just to like [1753] slap a bunch of text inside of a Google [1755] doc as I'm sure some of you guys are [1757] aware uh it's just pretty annoying to do [1759] you can technically do a workaround with [1760] the Google drive module but this this [1762] sort of fine and replace template [1763] feature this just eliminates a large [1765] portion of the issue it also allows you [1766] to do cool things like add template [1768] images in here so like you could totally [1770] imagine um a picture of you right over [1772] the a little bit about me right or [1774] something um I I much prefer this [1776] templated approach to basically [1778] everything else but let's start out [1779] simple let's start out with um copying [1781] the Google Doc okay and then we're going [1782] to generate a bunch of AI stuff and then [1784] we're going to squeeze it in that Google [1786] doc so first thing we're going to want [1787] to do is I'm just going to open up docs [1790] what I'm going to want is I'm going to [1791] want a sorry uh I lied the very first [1794] thing we're going to want to do is [1795] actually we have to copy it right so I'm [1796] going to go drive and then copy [1799] file now if you guys don't have a Google [1802] Drive credential it's kind of annoying [1803] to set up to be honest you have to go to [1806] um your Google Cloud console which is I [1809] believe it's console. cloud.google.com [1812] let me see if I have [1816] it let's go here console. Cloud [1819] google.com right over there you'll have [1822] to create an account after you create an [1823] account you'll get a page that looks [1825] something like this um then you have to [1826] go down to apis and [1828] Services scroll super far find the [1831] Google Drive API it's right over here [1833] then you're going to want to have to [1834] you're going to want to go to [1835] credentials um and then just copy over [1837] um all of these fields client ID and [1840] client secret you'll find them on the [1842] credentials page which I'm not going to [1843] show you for um security purposes and [1845] just because I don't want have to like [1846] recreate my key it's pretty funny how [1849] many times people say stuff like hey [1850] Nick um you just exposed everything in [1852] the last video just FYI and I'm like oh [1854] you're right I should probably go back [1856] and fix that um anyway once you're done [1858] with that it'll ask you to sign in once [1859] you've signed in you'll have um you'll [1860] have the credentials just make sure to [1862] click that little sign in with Google [1863] button the resource we're going to be [1865] using is file operation is going to be [1866] copy if you think about it we're [1867] obviously going to have to have this [1868] template so make sure to save that over [1870] to your account after you've done so you [1872] should have it accessible inside of your [1873] Google Drive so I'm going to go [1876] Google [1879] doc um proposal template right up workk [1883] proposal template this one right here [1884] okay great now we have file name [1886] actually we're going to need to generate [1887] a file name now that I'm think about it [1888] so this actually isn't going to work but [1891] uh it's going to work it's just not [1892] going to be ideal I'm just going to test [1894] this [1895] now and then we're going to get as [1897] output a Google Drive ID which is great [1901] the next thing I'm going to want to do [1902] just because I know how Google Drive [1903] works is we're going to want to share [1905] this so if you've ever had a situation [1907] where you create a file or create a [1909] resource or copy something but then you [1910] can't share it with anybody nobody can [1912] see it and then end you can solve that [1913] just by going Google Drive and then [1915] share file again you're going to have to [1917] connect to your Google drive and then [1918] what you want is you want to select the [1920] specific file ID that you just copied so [1921] don't actually use from list use by ID [1924] then copy over this so it's Dynamic [1927] right it's the IDE of the file we just [1929] copied over a second ago in terms of [1931] permissions I always just go reader then [1933] go anyone that way anyone can read but [1935] not everyone can write okay great so I'm [1937] just going to test [1938] this um we now have this uh document [1941] which should now be publicly accessible [1943] just to double check I'm actually going [1944] to go back here and the unfortunate [1946] thing is NAD doesn't give you a URL that [1948] you can access easy what you have to do [1949] is you have to grab the ID and you have [1950] to paste the ID in between the SL d [1952] slash and the sledit and this is now our [1955] new document okay and you know that [1957] because it's called example in the top [1958] left hand corner as opposed to you know [1960] Google Docs upwork proposal template so [1962] it looks like everything on the copying [1963] front was good if I just um if I grab [1965] this and I go into an incognito tab I [1967] can still see this right okay perfect so [1968] now I've just verified that the sharing [1970] settings are fine you can even see that [1971] there are other people on this that [1972] means that our client's going to be able [1973] to see uh fantastic the next thing that [1976] we're going to have to do is we're going [1977] to have to go and if you think about it [1980] we just added in um example as the title [1983] that's not really good enough I actually [1984] want to like have the whole like I I [1986] want the whole package to be clean I [1988] want the title of the Google Doc to like [1990] say the specific system or a paraphrase [1992] version of the system I want everything [1993] to be you know above board so the way [1995] that we're going to do that is we [1996] actually have to [1997] go um and we have to generate using [2000] artificial intelligence a bunch of stuff [2002] so to make your lives easier just head [2004] back to the previous [2006] node um the previous workflow I should [2008] say and copy the llm node the open AI [2010] message model and just paste it in over [2012] here because we've already done a lot of [2014] the hard work in building the foundation [2016] so all we're going to have to do is edit [2017] a few of these [2019] sections so here you are helpful [2023] intelligent proposal [2026] writer and as you can see we're going to [2028] provide the exact same context as before [2031] so before you know we had I'm an [2033] automation specialist doing X Y and Z [2036] then we had high performing proposals [2037] are typically templated as follows then [2039] output your results in Json using this [2041] format along with some rules right we're [2042] actually going to follow a very similar [2044] structure um just again so I don't have [2046] to like go and write all this from [2047] scratch and prompt engineering is as I [2049] mentioned one of the highest Ry parts of [2050] the business so it's you know if it [2052] takes a lot of time it's not necessarily [2053] a bad thing um but just to avoid that [2055] from happening uh I'm going to copy in [2058] my previous one and then I'll just walk [2059] through what it looks [2061] like okay beautiful so oh you know I [2065] think I copied it from the wrong one [2068] yeah I did nope that's not the one must [2071] be this one [2072] here okay [2074] perfect so I'm pasting that in you'll [2076] see it's a little longer what I'm saying [2078] is hey I'm an automation specialist [2081] applying to jobs on freelance platforms [2083] your task is to take as input an upwork [2085] job description and return as output [2087] JavaScript object notation for a [2089] customized proposal which I'll upload to [2090] Google Docs do you guys see how much [2092] context I'm providing it I'm actually [2093] giving it a bunch of information on [2095] exactly what I want to do just in case [2097] there's something I hadn't thought about [2099] that it'll be able to format in the [2100] response AI as of the time of this video [2103] has extraordinarily broad understanding [2105] of basically everything might not have [2106] the deepest understanding if we're [2108] calling GPT 40 but it's so broad that it [2110] can typically find a lot of weird kind [2111] of one-off edge cases for you so I do [2113] stuff like this I tell it exactly what [2115] it is that I want it to do anyway then [2117] it says High performing proposals are [2119] typically templated as follows and [2120] notice how I'm actually giving it I'm [2122] giving it everything right I'm saying in [2125] markdown title of system markdown [2127] explanation of system hi as mentioned [2130] I'm so confident that I'm the right fit [2131] for this that I went ahead and created a [2132] proposal for you including a stepbystep [2134] of how I do it I've done the below many [2136] times and working with specific part of [2137] their request it's a variable will fill [2139] in it's actually one of my favorite [2140] things to do Talk about serendipity [2142] anyway here is how we'll build all of [2144] this stuff so basically left to right [2146] flow with arrows a little bit about me [2148] about me bullet points to be up front [2150] blah blah blah and then I have the rest [2151] of my copy here the thing that'll be [2153] relevant for you is output your results [2154] in JavaScript object notation using this [2156] format basically what we've done is [2159] we've gone through and we've gotten all [2161] of these headings and we just replaced [2163] them with variables [2165] right so title of system I should [2168] actually just make this one for one if [2169] I'm going to use that it's going to be a [2170] lot easier to access so title of system [2172] right check brief explanation of system [2174] that's right over here check specific [2176] part of their request that's right over [2178] here check paraphrase [2181] system I don't know if I have paraphrase [2183] system I feel like I might have removed [2185] it anyway let's just get rid of that [2187] step by step bullet points check left to [2190] right flow with arrows check a little [2194] bit about me about me bullet points [2195] check and then you'll notice that after [2198] I provide it the example of the Json [2200] format that I want I also give it some [2202] rules hey I want you to write in a [2203] casual Spartan tone of voice hey don't [2205] use emojis or flowery language hey if [2206] there's a name included somewhere in the [2208] upward job description this is kind of [2209] cool um add it for personalization [2211] purposes instead of it being like hey [2212] it's like hey Peter right if Peter is a [2215] small little throwaway line at the very [2216] bottom of like a three 00 uh you know [2219] 3,000 word u request for proposal Peter [2222] is going to feel like you really [2223] understood him right return stepbystep [2225] bullet points about me bullet points is [2227] strings delimit each bullet point with a [2229] back sln and make sure it includes a um [2232] hyphen in about me bullet points prefer [2234] not to mention social proof that [2235] includes money and numbers for left to [2237] right flow with errors write a [2238] simplified left to right Flow delimited [2240] by these delimited just means um kind of [2242] broken up by for instance and then I [2244] give it an example then use first-person [2247] language like I I'd streamline I do blah [2249] blah blah then we have some facts about [2251] me for the personalization down here um [2253] and I'm again going to provide this for [2256] you uh now that I'm thinking about it [2257] like there's no need for us to repeat [2259] this over and over and over again we [2260] could just draw from like one data [2261] source but just to keep this as modular [2264] as possible I'm going to have all of [2267] these about me stored [2270] separately this should now be about me [2272] wonderful now we go over here we should [2274] obviously get Jason slab okay doab me [2279] perfect and then down here at the bottom [2280] the job description is execute workflow [2282] trigger that's the very first node um [2284] then item. json. query so if we want to [2287] test this again right what we need to do [2289] is we need to go and we need to paste in [2290] the whole upward job description now [2292] I've already done that in a previous um [2294] node right so I'm going to go back here [2297] I'm going to grab this whole [2299] query actually I can just grab this [2301] whole [2302] Json I'm going to go over here and then [2304] just paste that [2306] in looks good to me aside from some [2308] weird [2313] formatting I don't really like that [2315] whatever I'll just leave it as is I'm [2317] going to save this if we go to Jason it [2319] should be formatted right for me okay [2320] yeah it is [2321] perfect um we're now going to test this [2324] because I want to make sure that [2325] everything here Works awesome now this [2327] open AI node is going to write [2330] right so um it's looking like it's not [2332] finding this for some reason not [2333] entirely sure why so I'm just going to [2335] go and I'm going to drag this in [2336] manually cuz I know that that node is [2338] there it's saying undefined this might [2341] just be one of those n8n oneoff errors [2343] so we'll leave it at that I'll click [2344] test and then we'll see if um we [2346] actually getting [2351] it this is now going to return a bunch [2353] of Json basically JavaScript object [2355] notation cool looks like it did [2358] automated Outreach [2359] system [2361] cool [2363] cool very neat I'm curious what uh was [2366] fed in here though with this execute [2368] workflow trigger supposedly not [2370] working so just for uh posterity I'm [2374] going to repeat this and just make sure [2375] that that is not going to result in some [2377] weird error that I'm not expecting later [2379] on so this is looking good so let me [2381] rerun that one more [2382] time um I always like [2386] uh yeah I always like um just double [2389] checking it might take me yeah okay so [2391] there was something wrong with the [2392] previous node for whatever reason it [2393] wasn't finding the um the variable that [2395] I was looking for but now we're [2396] generating the specific variables that [2398] we want like title system specific part [2400] of the request blah blah blah cool so [2402] now if you think about it what happens [2404] next is we generated title right so what [2407] we can do is actually we can just drag [2409] that in file name so now the file name [2412] of the copy that we're creating is going [2413] to be Gmail to Google driver seat and [2415] invoice automation fantastic okay great [2417] and then we're sharing the file let's [2419] actually just test this now um all the [2420] way up to the [2422] SharePoint just from start to finish and [2424] let's see if you know in isolation these [2427] subflows work anytime you're developing [2429] an AI agent just go in isolation and [2431] test the subflow from start to finish [2433] using a query uh key or query object if [2436] you are using maybe some other naming [2438] convention then you can use that but the [2440] point is just try and mimic exactly the [2441] input that it's going to be receiving [2443] from the a agent and then make sure that [2445] that works and then connect it to the a [2446] agent okay great so we have an output [2448] here from the share file looks like we [2450] now have shared said file I'm just going [2452] to quadruple check this I'm going to go [2454] over to this and paste [2457] didn't perfect looks like we got [2459] everything that we need we can now [2460] actually go through and do the [2461] customizing of this thing so now that [2464] it's shared we can actually go Google [2467] Docs what we want is we want update a [2469] document okay the doc ID or URL we're [2472] going to get from the Google [2474] drive because that's the one that we [2476] just copied and then what we're going to [2478] want is the object is going to be text [2480] the action is going to be find and [2481] replace and now what we have to do is we [2483] basically have to go through and map [2485] those curly brace variables that I was [2487] using his placeholders and replace them [2489] with the output from the open AI node so [2491] if we just go back here what are those [2493] curly brace variables title of system [2495] brief explanation of system right [2497] specific part of the request I'm going [2498] to build this alongside with you so I'm [2500] just going to paste that in and then for [2503] Simplicity sake I'm just going to add a [2504] bunch of actions I don't know how many [2506] there are but I just want to do this [2507] quickly so this is typically what you do [2508] when you want to do things quickly you [2510] just bulk um add because your mouse [2512] doesn't have to move around you don't [2513] have to look a lot awesome so now we [2516] have a bunch of finder tol text and now [2517] I'm just going to go and grab all of [2521] these let's paste that in over actually [2524] yeah right over there um then I'm going [2525] to do specific part of their request [2527] right over there just alt tabbing back [2530] and forth to save myself a little bit of [2532] time step-by-step bullet points pasting [2535] that in left to right with [2538] arrows pasting that [2541] in about me bullet [2544] points pasting that in and was there [2546] anything else no I think that's it so we [2548] can actually get rid of the rest of [2549] these okay and then if you think about [2550] it we also have to add the new text [2552] right so the new text for title of [2553] system is just going to be this variable [2555] that we already created called title ass [2556] system new text for brief explanation [2558] ass system just going to be there the [2561] new text for specific parts of the [2562] request is going to be there [2563] step-by-step bullet points [2566] there left to right flow with arrows [2568] there and about me bullet points there [2572] okay so now if we just kind of take a [2574] step back and think through it logically [2575] we've mapped all of the variables that [2577] we just generated using AI we've pumped [2580] them all into this Google Docs find and [2581] replace feature and we have our document [2584] right over here so what should happen [2587] when we run this well it should go [2588] through and it should update it with all [2590] of this so I'm just going to click test [2592] step and we're going to see we're going [2594] to check it out for ourselves basically [2596] and voila we've now replaced the title [2598] we replaced the subheading we replaced [2601] this section down here we've added in a [2603] bunch of personalized info and now we [2605] have a little bit about me as well which [2606] is pretty pretty cool cool so we [2609] verified that this works the last thing [2610] that we have to do is we just need to [2611] send this back to the AI agent right so [2614] how are we going to send this back to [2615] the a agent well it's going to be the [2616] same thing that we did in the previous [2617] uh workflow which is basically where we [2619] use an edit Fields variable or set [2621] variable field or whatever you want to [2622] call it um to have a response it's just [2625] this time I'm going to call it a URL I'm [2626] actually going to map a Google Docs URL [2629] um so that you know the AI agent gets [2631] the URL sort of in its hand and then it [2633] can um use that to format out the uh the [2635] rest of the propos or applic [2637] so the way you do that is you just go [2638] edit [2640] fields and then what I'm going to do is [2642] I'll manual mapping the name here is [2645] just going to be the URL of proposal [2648] okay and then going to grab this [2650] document ID but if you think about it [2652] this isn't enough right it's just a [2653] document ID so what we actually do is we [2654] have to map it the exact same as [2657] this so I'm going to grab this URL here [2660] which is just a Google Docs URL this is [2661] how they they work I'm going to paste it [2663] in then what I want to do is I want to [2665] replace this old id here [2668] with this mapped ID [2671] here and now as we see um we have [2675] docs.google.com [2678] dodid edit well for sanity why don't we [2681] go and we test this just make sure we're [2682] looking at the same dock okay we are [2684] looking at the same doc fantastic so now [2686] that we have that uh URL of proposal [2687] string I can test this and now we're [2690] seeing that we're outputting this which [2693] means that when we do [2695] our uh you can just click known and then [2697] press P to unpin by the way when we do [2699] our AI agent Connection in a second [2700] we're going to be drawing from URL of [2702] proposal awesome okay so that was the [2704] first one let's now go and add another [2707] tool we'll call it this nadn workflow [2710] tool I'm going to scroll down and select [2713] generate Google doc proposal and the [2714] field I want is URL of proposal I'm [2717] going to call this generate Google doc [2721] proposal I'm going to use their nameing [2723] convention here to say call this tool to [2724] generate a Google do [2728] proposal for an upwork [2732] job the input should be a [2736] string of an [2738] upwork job [2742] post and the output will be a URL let's [2748] say a proposal URL that you can use to [2751] fill in [2753] templates paste that in there wonderful [2756] now that we've verify that that second [2758] flow Works in isolation let's actually [2760] go and let's make sure it works in [2761] reality so what I'm going to do now is [2764] go back to my um chat window here you [2767] see how I generated me all this right [2768] well I'm actually just going to um use [2770] its intelligence and I'll say can you [2772] generate me a Google doc now and now [2776] what it's going to do is it's going to [2777] pull from the window buffer it's going [2779] to grab the old memory and then it's [2782] going to make a decision on what to do [2783] next cuz it's doing a couple of API [2785] calls under the hood one once it's [2787] decided it's going to look and see if [2789] there is any nadn workflow tool [2792] available that has a title kind of like [2794] you know Google doc proposal and stuff [2796] so ideally that's what it's doing right [2798] now cool so it's calling the nadn [2800] workflow [2803] tool now the ID and workflow tool is [2805] going through everything that we talked [2807] about before so it's actually generating [2809] the response it looks like we return [2811] this response node and it looks like [2814] it's generated the Google Doc [2815] description now cool [2817] and let me just double check that this [2818] makes [2819] sense and it does make sense perfect we [2822] have the whole proposal looks very [2823] custom and very high quality looks like [2825] you know we spend a lot of time and [2826] energy generating this cool but um [2829] that's not enough let's go one step [2830] further now and let's generate a super [2833] high quality or perceived high quality [2835] mermaid uh dock or mermaid flowchart [2838] essentially so that the people on the [2839] other end think that not only did we [2841] write all the stuff ourselves we [2842] actually went through and used some sort [2843] of workflow tool to to put it all [2845] together this is how you can send at [2847] very high volumes without having to [2848] spend a lot of time per individual one [2850] that you are sending so let me just [2853] rename this now that we're done with [2855] it say generate Google doc proposal and [2858] now the last thing we need to do is [2860] obviously our mermaid code now for those [2862] of you that are unfamiliar [2864] mermaid is a mythical creature no [2868] mermaid is a diagramming and charting [2869] tool it's JavaScript based basically it [2872] allows you to generate pretty [2874] good-looking things and it's really [2875] stupid that they do not have a an [2877] example of uh a mermaid flowchart on [2881] their website but essentially you can [2883] generate stuff like this really easily [2885] and you know they have like their little [2886] programming convention and you just [2888] generate something in mermaid code and [2889] then you just paste it in a visualizer [2891] and it's just standard it's all parsed [2892] right so if you've ever used a workflow [2894] tool like Whimsical before it's [2896] basically the same thing as whimsicle [2898] right you press s you press a button and [2899] then voila you now have another thing [2901] you can do other stuff as well you can [2902] make mind [2903] maps you know a variety of things you [2905] can do um but the really cool thing is [2907] mermaid is just sort of like universally [2908] understood Now by a lot of these [2910] diagramming tools so you could take it [2911] and you can paste it into any one of [2913] these tools then just have it like you [2914] know take the code and use it to like [2916] generate a very sexy looking workflow [2918] chart now I should note that you could [2920] totally extend this further and you [2921] could just have it generate a workflow [2922] chart for you automatically without [2923] actually having to go through all this [2924] rium roll it just requires a fair amount [2926] of server setup U because what you have [2928] to do is you have to render the [2930] generated mermaid code on uh a website [2934] which you might do through some internal [2935] web hook and then you have to take a [2936] screenshot of that website and this is [2938] just way too much work um I'm focusing [2940] on the 8020 here if we can eliminate 90% [2942] of the work in an application and [2943] improve the perceived quality 3x then [2945] obviously we're going to do that uh but [2947] just know that you can take this you [2948] know arbitrarily far if you want so yeah [2951] let's actually go through and let's [2952] let's do the generation what does it [2953] what does it look like well it's pretty [2955] simple actually you just talk to an llm [2956] and you say hey can you generate me me [2958] some mermaid code so to prove it I'm [2961] going to create an open a uh let's [2963] actually just copy it from the previous [2964] one that'll always be easier always copy [2967] uh from a previous flow if if possible [2969] because it'll save you a lot of time [2978] mermaid.jpg job description return as [2983] output Jason that includes mermaid JS [2987] code okay so um just for the purpose of [2991] this [2993] demonstration generate mermaid .js code [2997] for the following [2999] flow and I'm going to say receive email [3003] from Facebook lead ads I'll say two add [3007] to CRM and three send customized sms [3012] okay so that is now what our what our [3015] whole prompt is and I'm just going to [3015] leave it at that just to show you guys [3017] what it looks like I'm then going to [3018] test step we're saying epic content is [3021] Jason but essentially what we get is [3022] here we get this graph TD a receive [3025] email from Facebook lead ads B add to [3027] CRM uh B to C send customized SMS this [3030] is basically just like a relationship [3031] diagram in their coding language and [3033] this is all that open AI is going to be [3035] generating for us then we're just going [3036] to take it and paste it in somewhere um [3038] so that's pretty cool uh let me show you [3040] guys the actual prompt that I was using [3041] in order to make this done um make this [3044] happen if I copy this puppy I go back to [3048] here and then I paste it in you can see [3051] that what I said was your task is to [3052] take as input an upward job description [3054] and return as output and mermaid diagram [3055] that I can visualize these using a [3056] subsequent [3057] mermaid.jpg [3063] the mermaid diagram code here's an [3066] example what your output should look [3068] like rules you only output flowcharts [3070] nothing else no sequence diagrams no [3072] Gant charts only flowcharts that's [3074] because Mermaid has a variety of [3075] different ways that they could show uh [3077] data they could do sequence flowcharts [3078] sequence diagrams Gant charts and stuff [3080] like that we just want flowcharts which [3082] I believe is just this graph do not [3084] output any accessory formatting [3086] information like backtick mermaid [3088] sometimes it does this and I don't like [3089] it and your first character should be G [3091] I'm just really trying to constrain it [3092] so that it only outputs this graph TD [3095] thing okay great so now that that's done [3098] I mean to be honest that's basically it [3099] right we just need to test this on some [3100] actual code so I'm going to um now write [3104] my own query the same way that I did [3107] before using this data so I'm going to [3110] copy this over I'm going to paste this [3112] in now save it we've pinned this and now [3116] I'm just going to feed this [3118] in voila we have the user prompt right [3121] here and we're going to untick Output [3124] content is Jason we're now going to test [3126] the step we're going to see if we get [3128] workable or usable mermaid [3131] code now this is a very long job [3133] description in hindsight wish I would [3135] have gotten a slightly shorter one just [3136] because of how much longer it's making [3138] the video take but Sal of V I guess the [3140] ideaas I could show you guys that it [3141] works on basically anything okay great [3144] and so now now we have all this code [3145] right fantastic very cool [3147] I should note that I think we have a [3148] bunch of like new lines in here which [3149] kind of sucks um we need to replace [3151] these new lines otherwise I don't know [3152] if it'll I don't know if it'll work if I [3154] past it in yeah basically um this is [3157] outputting with a bunch of new lines uh [3159] but when you return it back to the AI [3162] agent those new lines will automatically [3163] be filled in so I think in this case um [3165] it's clear that it did generate me some [3166] mermaid code I'm just going to go and [3168] connect this now to open AI uh to the [3171] the first agent sorry um last thing I [3174] need to do in order to make that happen [3175] is just edit fields and then going to [3178] say mermaid code I'm going to grab this [3180] content paste it in let's just test that [3183] step that is now the output wonderful [3186] I'm going to unpin this node and I'm [3188] going to go back to our agent and let's [3189] add one final tool and let me just copy [3191] this because we can template at most [3194] again drag that puppy in there we got to [3197] stop saying that puppy man generate [3199] mermaid diagram and then over here we'll [3202] say call this tool to generate a mermaid [3205] doj [3207] generate [3210] mermaid.jpg job description the output [3212] will [3213] be the mermaid diagram code what we want [3218] is we want the field to be called [3219] mermaid code let me just double check [3221] that I'm feeling a little crazy right [3223] now yeah it's mermaid [3226] code beautiful let's leave it at that [3229] and then I will go back and I'll say can [3232] you generate me some mermaid.jpg [3236] it will access the window buffer memory [3239] just like it did before so first it'll [3241] add to it then it'll go open aat model [3243] it's going to choose what to do which in [3245] our case is now memor uh generate the [3246] mermaid code looks like there was an [3248] issue interesting so it's going to get [3250] back to us with said [3252] issue um it did not return an item with [3255] the property mermaid code interesting so [3257] I must have did I unfortunately name [3260] this wrong or [3261] something mermaid code is here yeah so [3264] it looks like there was some issue [3268] oh sorry I was calling the wrong one my [3269] bad we got to go generate mermaid code [3272] well that was an unfortunately easy [3275] bug try again so this AI agent is now [3279] trying to do it on its own um I don't [3280] want the AI agent to try doing this on [3282] its own because if you think about it in [3284] the chat thread it has like 500 examples [3286] of different things and if you're [3288] talking with the agent sort of in one [3289] session you're getting it to generate [3291] you some some code or something for [3292] another job we don't want it to get [3294] confused we want it to be very clear and [3296] blunt hey all you're doing is you're [3298] generating mermaid code for the input [3299] that I gave you and that's really the [3301] value in tools just constraining you [3303] know the the space of all possible [3305] responses okay great so it looks like we [3307] did generate some code and it's right [3310] over here so that's nice if I just now [3313] copy you can see that it's even telling [3315] us we can use this in the mermaid live [3316] editor but that's okay I'm just going to [3318] use this in Whimsical and voila we now [3321] have a big workflow diagram where [3323] basically I'm showing people what I'm [3324] doing so we're going to have a manual [3325] mode with a Google Google Sheets [3326] interface with manual data entry and a [3328] button to trigger automation they have [3329] an automated vat mode automated email to [3331] bookkeeper and accountant so on and so [3333] on and so forth where I'm basically [3334] walking through the scope of the project [3336] so you know that'd be pretty it'd be [3338] pretty cool to like take this generate [3340] an image of it and then I don't know can [3343] I just put the image in right over [3344] here actually I should probably put it [3346] right over here instead you know you [3349] receive something like this and you [3350] think wow that guy really spent his time [3353] putting that puppy together right there [3355] I go again [3357] awesome so that is more or less what [3359] that looks like but I'm not going to [3361] stop there because I don't just want [3362] this to be an assistant really I mean [3364] like just for time purposes what I [3365] actually wanted to do is I wanted to do [3366] all three so I basically want it like [3368] just def by default when you um paste in [3371] an upwork job application just goes and [3372] it generates all three and I'm just [3374] doing that for now uh like in the future [3377] you know as you can imagine let's say [3378] you start adding a bunch of other tools [3379] so we have an upwork HTTP request tool [3383] that like calls the upwork back end [3385] retrieves you a list of jobs [3386] right that that's really cool and you [3388] can totally do that once you have that [3390] well now you have a list of all these [3391] upwork jobs you can have another one [3392] that maybe gets a specific job well [3394] great now you have something that can [3395] independently list jobs grab a specific [3398] job maybe you have a way to filter the [3400] jobs now so now you have something that [3402] gets all jobs um filters jobs gets the [3405] specific subset of jobs that you request [3407] pulls the descriptions of those [3408] automatically feeds it into this and [3410] then you know sort of does a lot of the [3411] work for you that way um but uh yeah you [3415] know you can go arbitrarily deep with us [3417] at our specific purposes we've um added [3421] these three and just functionally [3422] speaking most people are probably going [3424] to want to do all of them when they [3426] paste in a description so they're going [3428] to generate mermaid generate Google doc [3429] proposal generate application copy so [3431] I'm just going to go over here and I'm [3432] going to tell it [3435] to so I will [3437] say when you receive an upwork job [3442] description you must [3444] generate a mermaid diagram a Google doc [3448] and an upwork application you must then [3453] replace the um dollar sign dollar sign [3456] dollar sign with the Google Doc proposal [3462] link cool so now we've changed the code [3466] sorry we've changed the prompt which I [3467] guess you can conceptualize this code [3469] I'm now going to refresh this from start [3470] and I'm just going to delete the [3473] input so now we can just have a fresh [3475] conver ation with it I'm going to head [3477] over to our super crazy long prompt I'm [3480] going to paste it all in [3485] okay and now it should go through see [3488] the chat model with the prompt on it [3490] that says hey I'm going to want you to [3491] do all three of these [3493] things it's going to uh make the [3496] determination to access the specific [3498] tool set that we asked it to it's going [3500] to be reading through that system prompt [3501] and it's going to be going damn this guy [3502] wants me to do all three of these things [3505] what a lazy piece of cra [3507] crap okay it's now generating all three [3509] already finished the application copy [3511] mermaid JS codee's done and the Google [3514] Doc proposal understandably since it's [3515] doing more is going to take an [3517] additional second but boy is it really [3519] gratifying when all these things turn [3521] green huh when these are done they feed [3523] the output back in the chat model and [3525] then it comes and it um basically [3527] phrases it in the way that we want so [3529] then I go to the chat we see we have [3531] everything that we need here so the [3535] mermaid.jpg whatever tool we want and [3537] you know it's going to generate [3538] different things every time [3540] right then after that we have uh Google [3545] doc proposal which we can click over [3546] here to view and again it's going to [3548] generate slightly different things every [3550] time and then we have the outwork [3552] application copy so um I should not it's [3554] looking it's looking like it's [3555] attempting to embed this and I don't [3557] know on upwork uh they don't allow you [3560] to do that so we should probably add a [3563] line in here that just says output the [3564] link in plain text [3568] Google doc proposal Link in plain [3575] text okay and that should um that should [3579] uh make it output it in plain text as [3580] opposed to you know like this view [3582] Google doc thing which you um you can't [3585] actually like insert an upwork anyway [3587] here it is you just copy that paste that [3590] into the job when you're ready to submit [3592] it just right over here yeah you see [3595] that how it says view Google doc I [3597] wonder if you just paste it in plain [3598] text no you can't paste it in plain text [3600] so um you're going to have to drag grab [3604] that specific Link in this case and then [3608] grab the rest of [3610] this and then paste it in [3614] here and then paste it in right over [3617] here but after you make um the [3620] appropriate edits you will have [3623] essentially a link that looks like this [3625] that the person will then be able to [3627] open which nice that looks pretty clean [3630] and easy and then obviously we have um [3633] the workflow diagram that you can embed [3635] inside or make whatever changes you want [3637] to this as well so I've been a couple of [3640] videos and upwork in the past typically [3641] what ends up happening is I make a video [3643] and then everybody starts doing the [3644] thing that I just showed them how to do [3646] and then the approach loses a little bit [3647] of viability because obviously we're you [3650] know only a certain number of people [3651] that watch videos like mine um and then [3655] those people tend to dominate the market [3656] share and take you know 80 90% of all [3658] available jobs and that sort of stuff I [3660] also think that epor is um very is [3663] starting to get a lot more up to- dat [3664] with the approaches and they're trying [3665] to make sure that you know obviously [3666] you're not automating every aspect of [3668] the job application process although I [3669] do maintain that your ability to [3670] automate the job application process if [3672] you are a systems person or an automator [3675] is basically example a for why the [3677] person should hire you in the first [3678] place but anyway because of this I don't [3681] recommend that you use the exact [3682] templates that I'm providing here like I [3684] I recommend that you go through you [3685] actually switch it up a little bit [3686] change the wording right change the [3688] change the specific tactics uh tactics [3691] and strategy will change um tactics and [3693] strategy will lose Effectiveness uh but [3696] the kind of like deeper understanding [3699] sorry tactics will lose Effectiveness [3701] but strategy and the deeper [3702] understanding of exactly what I'm doing [3704] here and what the idea behind it is um [3706] will remain with you forever so try and [3708] you know understand the latter not [3710] necessarily the former so switch up you [3712] know the exact approach a little bit you [3714] can add some other assets in there drag [3715] can drop a picture of yourself waving or [3717] you riding a kangaroo I don't know if [3719] you could ride kangaroos sorry Aussies [3720] that watch me and uh you know once you [3723] have that that uh your own flavor to it [3725] then you can start applying and stuff [3726] like that on mass hopefully you guys [3728] appreciated the video I had a lot of fun [3730] putting that system together as per [3731] usual if you guys want to check out that [3734] template then please do um go down [3736] there'll be a link in the description [3737] it's the first time that I'm going to be [3738] charging for any one of these templates [3740] but I want you to know that you can get [3741]

Title: 9 Years of Business Advice in 63 Minutes (Copy These Steps)
[0] I started my first business in college 9 [1] years ago I was dead broke last month I [3] cleared [4] $128,000 so my aim in this video is to [7] hopefully distill 9 years of business [9] advice and give it to you guys in a [10] simple yet comprehensible format that'll [12] enable you guys to not make the same [14] mistakes that I did then hopefully [15] achieve your goals a lot faster so we're [17] going to do this whiteboard style the [19] very first point I'm going to give you [21] is no matter what happens in your [22] company or your business it's always [24] your fault okay I know this is sort of [27] like a like like a trivial statement to [29] make for for a lot of people but I just [30] want you to consider it when you have a [33] staff member that just like completely [35] craps the bed on a client project and it [39] results in your company just going [40] through the tubes or whatever you losing [41] a big deal it's not the staff member's [43] fault it is your fault because you were [46] responsible for hiring the staff member [48] that ended up doing the thing that you [50] don't want them to do at some level up [52] in the big Domino chain okay this is [55] just a bunch of dominoes laid on a table [57] that very first Domino you tipped over [60] that's totally not going to hit the [61] thing that very first Domino you're [63] responsible for tipping over you are [65] responsible for putting your intention [66] out in the world that resulted in you [68] having a business to begin with that [70] resulted in you having these hiring [71] practices that resulted in that person [73] you know maybe taking advantage of you [74] or you know just not doing a very good [76] job likewise if you have a poor client [78] relationship it's because of you it's [80] not the client's fault that they're [82] taking advantage of you or you know [83] they're asking for a ton of revisions [85] with no compensation it's your fault [87] because you are responsible for enabling [88] that behavior you're responsible for [90] saying yes to that client to begin with [91] you're responsible for not having good [92] policies or procedures right if you get [95] in the habit of internalizing this and [97] you blame yourself for the losses um [100] you'll grow and you'll learn a lot [102] faster but believe it or not that's [104] actually not enough because it's not [105] enough just to blame yourself for your [106] losses what you also need to do is you [108] need to attribute to yourself your [111] wins now this left half I understood [114] pretty intuitively I want to say most of [116] my business life and so I picked all [117] that up very quickly this right half [119] here where the good things in my [121] business are also my fault um this is [123] something that I'm only I'm only [124] starting to figure out now and the [126] difference that it makes in my [127] resilience my adaptability my ability to [129] continue doing what I want to do is [131] crazy so you know if I could give this [133] to you guys as a shortcut celebrate the [135] wins when something great happens in [136] your business know that it was because [137] of you you were the one that hired the [139] person that did the project that did the [140] whatever that ended up in the good [141] positive situation that you're in you [143] were the one that like created the [144] agency or the business or the e-commerce [146] product or whatever like it it was you [148] putting your will into to the world that [150] made this stuff happen and you know the [152] coraly is when something bad happens in [154] your business just know that it was [155] something that you could have done [156] better um to maybe uh decrease the [158] likelihood of that that occurring so [161] it's your fault it's always your fault [163] no matter what lightning bolt hits your [165] factory or something it's on you um the [168] second that you start getting in the in [169] the habit of doing this your life just [171] begins to improve immeasurably the [173] second thing I want to talk about is [175] this idea of inputs over [177] outputs so everybody kind of has their [180] panties in a Twist over this whole this [182] whole output idea okay what I mean is [184] right we we get in the habit of setting [186] goals and having these Big Dreams and [188] desires we want to make this much money [189] we want to have this sort of car we want [191] to have this sort of family the reality [193] is anytime that you focus on outputs [196] let's say that this is my output this [197] sort of like a treasure map okay and I [199] start right over here the reality is if [201] you focus on [202] outputs you'll only really ever get this [205] far but if you focus on inputs if you [208] have some goal to make a ton of money [209] and every day you just I don't know cold [211] call 10 people or something what'll [213] happen is you'll [216] start and what you'll quickly find is [219] you won't just hit that output goal you [221] will massively overshoot it and the same [224] period of time you'll do like 3x what [226] you thought was even possible because [228] most people vastly overestimate what [229] they can do in a day or a week or a [231] month but they underestimate what they [232] can do in a year if they just focus on [234] outputs so like this is maybe what an [236] input uh sorry an output looks like if [239] you focus on outputs this is what an [240] input looks like anytime in my life I've [242] ever focused on inputs I've just crushed [244] it and believe it or not inputs are [246] actually a lot simpler to conceptualize [248] than you probably think inputs aren't [249] something amazing or crazy or super [251] complicated they are literally things [253] like send 10 job applications a day on [255] your favorite freelance platform they're [257] send 50 cold emails a day they're record [259] three custom videos they uh I don't know [262] tell your wife that you love her every [263] day or something I'm not a relationship [265] guy but I hope you guys understand kind [267] of the point that I'm making if you just [269] get in the habit of focusing on the [271] small daily actions that you need to [272] take in order to win um you will vastly [274] overshoot the vast majority of your [276] goals I started a Blog forever ago in [278] another life it was called nick.com and [280] I definitely don't have it up still and [281] you definitely shouldn't subscribe to [283] the newsletter but uh what I did is I [285] had a challenge for myself I said I was [287] going to write one blog post every [288] single day because I wanted to be a [289] blogger that's what bloggers did so I [292] wrote a blog post every single day for a [295] whole month 31 days and very similar to [297] what I've actually done on my YouTube [298] Believe It or Not although I've since [299] changed my my uh approach to that every [302] single day by the end of the 31 days I [304] had something like three uh subscribers [307] to my new utter or three subscribers to [309] my blog I should say that was 31 days [312] and it Ned three results I was [315] devastated I was heartbroken my goal of [317] being this independent blogger who could [319] work from his laptop anywhere in the [321] world and have a fantastic lifestyle was [322] very quickly crushed I looked back on [325] that just a few months ago and because [328] of the 31 blog posts that I wrote at the [330] time looking back I'm now on the first [333] page of Google for God knows how many [334] Search terms this is a few years ago the [337] point that I'm making is if you focus on [339] the inputs if IID continued to do what I [340] was doing back then and I just never [342] stopped writing these blog posts which [343] to be honest they took me like 45 [345] minutes a day they're pretty easy I'd [346] probably be the biggest blogger on [348] planet Earth by now the vast majority of [351] people on planet Earth they struggle [353] with consistency and the ability to [355] apply directed inputs over and over and [357] over and over and over again if you get [358] in the habit of just becoming an input [360] person and just really having ironcloud [361] habits um you'll you'll Crush I mean [363] like basically anybody that I've ever [365] known that just has their inputs right [368] inevitably makes a ton of money they [370] have super successful life think of it [372] like going to the gym [373] right okay on that note the third point [376] that I'm going to make is don't ask [379] yourself how I can do X ask yourself how [384] do I structure my [388] life in a way that I can do the thing I [391] want to [394] do that's pretty long I should have [397] shortened [398] this my wrist [400] hurts do the things I want to [403] do every [406] day for a [409] year [410] okay we are definitely shortening these [413] truisms but um don't ask yourself hey [416] how can I send 50 blog uh write 10 blog [419] posts today ask yourself hey what [422] actions do I need to take right [424] now that allow me to structure my life [427] in such a way that I'll be able to write [428] one blog post every day for the next [430] year that I'll be able to make one video [431] every day for the next year that I'll be [433] able to write uh 10 cold emails every [435] day for the next year what changes do I [437] need to make at the high level to my [439] life to enable me to do that do I need [441] to rearrange my desk do I need to change [443] the people that I'm hanging out with the [445] point that I'm making is if this is sort [447] of like the ground floor of the the [449] result that you're getting there are [451] many levels up that contribute to this [455] okay you know if this is your ability to [458] do I don't know let's say five DMS a [463] day then this is your work [466] environment okay this is your [468] desk and then this is your [473] relationships okay and then this is your [476] diet if you go up the chain of the out [480] of the thing that you are tracking right [482] the the the result the 5 DMS a day your [484] ability to do 5 DMS a day what you'll [486] find is there are a bunch of these [487] things that are really getting in your [488] way every day if you can find a way to [491] restructure those in such a way that [493] just enable you to do the thing that you [494] want to do every single day for a very [495] long period of time AK if you can find a [497] way to make it very low friction then it [500] is so much easier for you to [502] succeed let me give you a quick example [504] I um you know I record YouTube videos [506] right one of the reasons why I was able [507] to grow so quickly on YouTube was just [508] because I was bble to create a [510] substantially larger volume of content [512] much quicker than most other people and [514] the reason why is because when I would [516] record a video I would just click the [517] camera button and I would record and I [519] would just talk for an hour what I mean [521] is my recording time to finish product [523] time was basically 1: one right so the [526] amount of work that I put in had very [528] very large um like a very large result [530] uh in correlation what most people do is [533] they'll record a video for like I don't [534] know an hour and then they'll get like [535] five minutes of usable content I got [537] like 10 to 15 times that realistically [539] so the way that I constructed my life [543] was I constructed it in such a way that [545] I got to record content just while I was [547] doing the stuff that I was normally [548] doing anyway if I had a cool client [550] project that I would have had to do [552] anyway I just turned my camera on and I [554] talked about it while I was doing the [555] client project and sure it was a little [557] bit less efficient than me just doing [558] the client project but I constructed my [560] life in such a way that enabled me to do [562] this thing as sort of more documenting [564] than creating essentially which enabled [565] me to um you know do the thing that I [567] wanted to do every day for a very very [569] long period of time so yeah don't just [572] ask yourself I guess if I could [573] summarize don't just ask yourself hey [575] how can I do this one thing ask yourself [577] hey I want to become the person that [578] does this sort of thing consistently how [580] can I structure my life in such a way [581] that I can do this every day for the [582] next year and if you get in the habit of [584] doing that sort of thing you'll find [585] inevitably that you're going to grow [586] substantially more successful than if [588] you just were to figure out how to do [589] that thing okay great so let's um sorry [593] I have a little tab here I need to look [594] at let's uh move on to the next one [597] which is obviously the fact that if you [599] want to win business you kind of have to [602] do this okay you kind of have to spend [604] money to save [607] time so I wish I knew this earlier I [610] came from a pretty poor um Family [613] background um and I don't mean that in [615] any disrespectful way just that the [616] first few years of my parents life in [618] this country in in Canada where we're [619] from that was very very difficult well [621] where I'm from anyway it was very [622] difficult for them uh because they were [624] you know escaping communism at one of [626] the uh one of the most unstable periods [628] I would say and so as a result you know [630] we obviously grew up very frugal and [632] everything was very penny pinching it [633] was very difficult for me to ever really [634] justify an investment one big thing that [637] I've unfortunately come to realize is [639] that you know we we all think that we [642] have more time but really we we don't [645] the graveyard in life okay these are [648] really crappy [649] tombstones graveyards are filled with [652] people that over their entire life just [656] thought I have more time [659] Believe It or Not time is actually not [663] the renewable resource money is the [664] renewable resource time is the finite [666] dwindling resource and so if you can [669] spend [670] money to save [673] time you should do it basically and any [676] at almost any opportunity obviously you [678] know we can get more complex here [680] there's like the the internal hourly [681] rate if your hourly rate is I don't know [683] like $50 an hour and if you could save [686] something that's $60 an hour then [688] obviously you should pay um 50 sorry you [691] if you could pay $50 to save an hour and [693] your hourly rate is $60 an hour you [694] should obviously pay $50 where you can [696] but really um even in those instances [699] where whatever you are buying is [701] actually less cost efficient I want to [704] say than the money that you would spend [706] to acquire it my honest take on things [709] now that you know I've come into uh [711] substantially more money and you know [713] I've sort of like unscrewed a large [715] portion of my thinking is that you [716] should actually debias even further and [718] you should do something like you know if [719] I I could spend uh $50 to save myself [722] $30 of time than I should because time [725] is just so it's so precious it's so [728] unbelievably Priceless there there's [730] almost no way that you can really qu [732] qualify or quantify that um that it just [734] makes sense to save time times basically [737] whenever humanly possible so I say I [740] spend money to save time all the time [741] one big thing that a lot of people ask [742] me you know I teach a lot of automation [744] these days is um naden is this um no [747] code or low code platform and you have [749] the ability to like host any on your own [751] computer as opposed to or or a server as [754] opposed to like you know pay their big [756] service fee in order to do it um I pay [757] their big service fee in order to do it [759] because if it saves them even like five [761] minutes a month it's worth it you know [762] if I don't have to go through this big [763] rigoll of like setting up my own NAD [766] instance and then like doing all these [767] crazy app connections and if there are [769] even a few moments of friction that that [771] saves me from then it's it's worth my [773] time there are obviously a variety of [775] other things that you can do but just to [776] give you guys some ideas I guess just [778] debias you know [782] debias your [785] favor of [787] time of money over [789] time because yeah money compounds right [792] over time time tends to be the exact [795] opposite every year that you live feel [798] shorter and shorter and shorter and [800] shorter so money every dollar you have [802] grows bigger and bigger and bigger and [804] bigger you should always essentially be [806] willing to spend money to save time um [808] so long as the equation so ridiculous [809] that you would be making a silly [811] decision okay great the fifth thing I [813] want to talk about is do it [816] yourself now a lot of people are going [818] to look at this and they're look at what [820] I just wrote above and they're going to [821] say Nick what the hell why are you lying [823] to us man you're going to talk about [825] spending money to save time presumably [826] to delegate work now you're going to [828] tell us to do stuff yourself doesn't [829] that defeat the purpose well if you're [831] going to delegate something just make [833] sure you've done it yourself anytime in [836] my business that I've ever delicated [837] something to somebody that I haven't [838] done before um you know this has been 9 [841] years of consistent probably like once [842] every month or two every time I've ever [844] delegated something I haven't done [846] before the outcomes have been absolute [848] trash so what I do now as a rule is I [851] will always do the thing that I want the [852] guy to do guy or girl to do for me at [854] least once it doesn't matter if I suck [856] at it I will do it at least once because [858] this will do two things for you one this [861] will allow you to gain an appreciation [863] for what the thing that you are asking [864] the person to do actually involves and [866] then two this allow you to delegate a [868] lot better [870] So you you're going to get to appreciate [872] you know assuming that they actually do [873] hard work you're going to get to [874] appreciate the quality of that hard work [875] then two you're also just going to be [876] able to delegate better you're going to [877] know more about the thing that you are [879] rating if you are working with somebody [881] that maybe isn't very good you'll know [882] because you'll have actually gone [883] through the process right and most of [885] the time if you're the sort of person [886] that starts a business yeah you're not [887] going to be amazing at everything but [888] you're going to be more capable than the [889] vast majority of people business owners [891] wear many hats and you know you hiring a [893] marketing guy to do some marketing for [894] you or something well you you kind of [896] already know how to do marketing you [897] should know how to do marketing because [899] big chunk of businesses marketing you'll [900] be able to intuitively understand what [902] they are doing will this take you more [904] time yes absolutely it's going to take [906] you substantially more time whereas you [908] know before you just say hey do this for [909] me here's money goodbye now you're going [911] to have to say okay you know let me sit [912] down for couple of hours and try and [914] figure this thing out and then do it but [916] um on the back end you're going to save [918] a ton of money and my honest opinion is [920] that you're also going to save a lot of [921] time because you can delegate better to [922] begin with so uh I would highly [925] recommend whatever you are going to [927] delegate in your life at least do it [929] once like you don't have to do it all [930] the time but at least do it [932] once okay the next point is what got you [937] here won't get you [941] there now I think you probably [945] understand what I mean by this but there [948] is a very different set of strategies [952] this is like our little graph of [953] progression there's a very different set [955] of strategies that enable you to make it [958] let's say here here this is zero and [960] this is one and this is 100 [963] versus here okay the path the distance [967] from 0 to one is going to require a ton [970] of different strategies that you're [971] throwing at the wall approaches that [973] you're doing different types of lead gen [974] different types of marketing different [976] understanding consistency relationships [979] whatever so what got you from 0 to one [982] isn't necessarily going to get you from [984] one to 100 if you just do the same thing [986] right it's not going to allow you to [989] make progress It's like different sort [990] of ground almost right like if you're [992] starting over here and they I don't know [994] just a bunch of lava rocks or something [995] you're obviously going to have to like [996] have a different approach to getting [998] over those lava rocks than if they're [999] just a bunch of crazy spikes all over [1000] the ground right the point that I'm [1002] making is that the business terrain just [1004] silly video games examples man uh the [1007] terrain that you are going to be [1008] navigating at different parts of your [1009] business Journey will necessitate [1010] different strategies so you know if you [1012] do the same things at like if we make [1015] this concrete to business if you do the [1016] same thing at um that you did to get [1018] from Z to 5K a [1020] month it will not work if you want to go [1022] to let's say 100K a month I mean you [1025] know it'll work to some capacity but it [1027] is not the most optimal and most [1029] effective way to do it what you need to [1031] do instead is you need some different [1033] wonderful cool Blue [1035] strategy um and you need to constantly [1038] be recalibrating um your approach [1040] depending on you know the current income [1042] level that you're at because income [1043] levels tend to correlate with um you [1045] know problems and so on and so [1047] forth okay another point I want to make [1049] that's related to a few of the other [1051] ones that I made earlier is you should [1053] be patient with [1057] results but impatient with [1062] actions what do I mean by this remember [1065] earlier I was talking to you guys about [1067] my blog and how I did 31 blog [1072] posts and I basically got nothing this [1075] is basically what it looked like these [1077] are the number of blog posts that I post [1078] posted these are the number of views so [1081] I did like 31 in a row and I got like [1082] nothing right well the reason why I [1086] didn't continue with that is because I [1088] was way too impatient with results and I [1090] was nowhere [1091] near as impatient as I should have been [1094] with action if I just zoomed out a [1096] little bit okay what actually ended up [1099] happening is after I stopped I grew like [1103] this but because I was so hyperfocused [1106] and so zoomed in on this little of the [1109] graph I failed to see that that was even [1112] possible now if you just zoom out a [1114] little bit if you become a little bit [1115] more patient with results what you [1117] quickly realize is that basically [1119] everything in your life that you've ever [1120] wanted always takes a little bit longer [1123] than you thought almost always is a rule [1126] and even if it doesn't take more time [1128] than you thought then anticipating that [1130] it will leads to substantially better [1133] outcomes because now you're focus on the [1134] inputs which allow you to overshoot [1135] those goals so be patient with results [1138] note that anytime that you're talking to [1140] the market there's always a little lag [1142] okay if you ever played any video games [1144] like competitive video games and I [1145] brought this up before but there's [1146] always a lag no matter what you do [1148] you'll you'll press the right um Mouse [1150] button and then your character will make [1151] a little action but it'll take like 50 [1153] to 100 milliseconds depending on you're [1154] paying your lats or whatever like life [1156] is basically the exact same it takes a [1159] little bit of time between the action or [1161] the input that you provide and then the [1162] output and you're better off just [1165] pretending you have a little bit longer [1167] of a lag a little bit longer of a ping [1169] if that makes sense now on the flip side [1172] you should be extraordinarily impatient [1174] with action most people are very patient [1177] with action they say I always have time [1179] to do this tomorrow why don't I think [1181] through this a little bit more why don't [1182] I try and figure this stuff out right [1185] what happens to those people well if you [1187] all remember that happens to those [1190] people okay the reality is Graveyard is [1194] filled with people that thought that [1195] they had more time you don't you have no [1198] idea what's going to happen with [1199] whatever you want to do in business or [1201] in life reality is you should just do [1204] the thing and you should figure out for [1205] yourself as opposed to just spend all [1207] day speculating so if you wanted to do [1209] something whatever it is man start a [1211] business uh go on a hot date with your [1213] cooworker whatever it is like do do it [1216] now be extraordinarily impatient you [1218] don't have tomorrow you really don't you [1219] have no idea how long this opportunity [1221] is going to last and it's probably going [1223] to last a shorter amount of time than [1224] you realize and it's going to take you [1226] more time than you think in order to [1227] acquire the thing you want acquire so [1229] both sides are sort of fighting against [1231] you [1232] okay any the next thing I want to cover [1236] is that done is better than [1240] perfect as you guys could tell a big [1242] part of the philosophy that I think I've [1245] had to um unlearn over the course of the [1248] last nine years so I've started my [1249] business is is this idea of perfection [1252] you don't need to make everything [1253] perfect to go all you need is you just [1255] need to make sure that it's like 80% of [1257] the way there so so my goal always with [1260] whatever product it is is I get to 80% [1262] when I launched my content writing [1264] company it was really the first time [1265] that i' ever actually like figured this [1266] out when I launched my content writing [1268] company I I settled for 80% I was not [1271] confident with many many things and I [1273] was very than I'm very thankful that I [1274] had a business partner at the time that [1276] said something along the lines of listen [1277] it doesn't actually need to be perfect [1279] why don't we just give it a try and just [1280] see where we land if he hadn't said that [1282] to me then I probably wouldn't be [1284] anywhere near as successful as I am [1286] today because it was us trying this new [1288] hiring approach us trying this new [1290] pricing approach that ultimately led to [1292] us being able to explore the problem [1294] space and then see how you know we could [1298] ultimately [1300] get the best result which is this one [1302] here but you're never going to know [1304] until you actually go in and make that [1305] leap right so done is always better um [1308] it it's how you play the game in 2025 [1310] and 2026 and 2027 and Beyond you can't [1313] focus on building it and then having [1315] them come you basically do need to just [1317] constantly be um spitting out something [1320] acting and and reacting in the real [1322] world and then allowing the market to [1323] sort of make some decisions and [1325] determinations for [1326] you okay number nine is businesses like [1330] the gym if there's one big thing that [1333] I've really [1335] realized um about like Fitness it's that [1340] like it takes it takes a lot of time in [1341] order to see any sort of results I'm [1342] sure we all know right now I'm not like [1344] the most Jack guy on the planet uh but I [1346] do have a 12-pack no I um you know I'm [1350] not like the craziest gym rat on the [1351] planet but one thing you learn pretty [1353] quick in the gym is that like you know [1355] if you had two possible universes okay [1357] in the first you do 10,000 bicep curls [1360] today and then the second you do 30 [1362] bicep curls okay every single day or [1365] every two days for the next year or [1367] something like in which Universe do you [1370] think you're going to be fitter well [1372] obviously the one in which you do a [1373] little bit every couple of days as [1375] opposed to like a ton on one day now the [1378] reason why is cuz your body obviously [1379] requires some time in order to like you [1381] know upsert the freaking myonuclei or [1384] whatever right it's a little bit beyond [1385] me at this point but um you know your [1387] your muscles need time to build believe [1390] it or not business is the exact same [1392] thing there are a lot of processes that [1393] are outside of our conscious awareness [1395] or control that need to occur in the [1397] background in order for you to see a [1398] result in the thing that you're looking [1399] for when you send out that Outreach or [1402] when you hire those people or when you [1404] work with new clients that you never [1406] thought you you'd be able to when you [1407] create that content there's so many [1409] background processes that are going to [1410] be occurring completely unbeknownst to [1412] you that need to occur and they require [1414] time to really mature and and flavor um [1418] before you get any sort of result from [1419] that so if you are you know I don't know [1422] if you lack the ability to really sit [1425] down and allow that to happen then [1427] you're not really going to get anywhere [1429] you can't wait until the last second and [1430] then just do 10,000 bicep curls you want [1432] to grow really massive arms like me um [1435] you need to do a consistent amount of [1437] work every day for a very long period of [1440] time so the next point I'm going to make [1443] is hyper relevant if you've been [1445] watching my AI [1447] content and that's that business is like [1449] the gym no the it's beware of shiny [1452] objects looks like my monitor was so [1454] shiny I was just repeating the same [1456] thing it's beware of shiny objects I [1459] know we talk about this a lot you've [1460] probably seen a million in one videos [1462] about shiny objects but the truth is [1464] there are a lot of opportunities in life [1465] especially the second you start seeing [1466] success and it's actually more powerful [1470] to say no than it is to say yes like [1473] have you guys ever watched that movie [1474] Yes Man from way back in the day um way [1478] back in the day oh geez how is that [1479] actor's name not coming to me insane one [1481] of my favorites anyway um the premise of [1485] it is it's a man that just starts saying [1486] yes to everything and his life ends up [1488] improving and changing and getting [1489] really wacky and really exciting because [1491] before he was the sort of person that [1492] said no well the reality is you should [1495] probably be more of like a no man or a [1497] no person to to generalize [1499] because I can't tell you the number of [1501] amazing opportunities that have landed [1503] on my desk just over the course of the [1505] last like 6 months or so um as I've [1507] taken off with with this info product [1508] business that had I said yes to any one [1510] of them I probably wouldn't have [1512] achieved like half of what I've been [1513] able to achieve today there's so many [1515] time syncs there's so many opportunities [1518] to just be misled you live in this [1520] Minefield of shiny objects really [1522] especially if you're in like the AI and [1524] automation space or any sort of [1526] Technology the reality is it's the it's [1528] the dull looking boring things I mean [1532] this doesn't look boring it kind of [1533] looks like a cool sexy Sapphire I don't [1535] know it's this ugly Rock thing okay that [1538] you need to be focusing 90% of your [1539] effort on because these shiny objects [1541] are just that they're just shiny okay [1543] they're all like pite or whatever the [1545] heck it's called these things don't [1546] actually yield any sort of result for [1548] you or if they do the reality is it [1550] takes too much time and energy to start [1553] up whatever process is necessary to make [1555] money with these things such that if you [1557] go ahead and actually do uh you know you [1560] lose time that you could have otherwise [1562] focused on building the thing that you [1563] knew actually worked okay this is called [1565] opportunity cost and I attempted to draw [1568] a coffin here um but I hopefully you [1570] guys see that the idea is beware of [1572] shiny objects there's a ton of [1574] opportunity costs associated with [1575] putting time and energy focusing on [1576] things that are not the main thing that [1577] actually makes you money if you find [1579] something that makes you money okay for [1581] instance you're at the I don't know [1583] you're at the casino this is an example [1584] I provide in maker school you're at the [1586] casino okay and you're playing [1588] uh slots and you know there's this [1591] little thing that you you pull right you [1592] pull this little lever when you pull it [1595] then you hit a 777 and then you make $1 [1599] okay now every time you pull this lever [1601] you start realizing this thing's broken [1603] man I just made a dollar okay now I made [1604] another dollar now I made another dollar [1606] that may not seem like the craziest find [1608] in the whole wide world to you but let [1610] me be clear the people that are rich in [1611] life they just find levers like this [1613] that pay them a a middling sum of money [1615] and then all they do is they just pull [1617] that dang all day long you're not going [1620] to have some amazing shiny Zero to Hero [1623] thing overnight in reality you're going [1624] to have some boring little lever that [1626] pays you some pittance and your job as [1628] somebody that's going into business is [1629] just finding a way to pull that lever as [1631] often and as effectively as possible so [1633] look for the boring things right uh [1636] boring but big the the the the the [1638] boring monotonous super underlooked [1642] businesses are usually some of the [1643] highest performers I mean I started all [1645] of my first businesses in the service [1646] space right no longer um predominantly [1649] in the service space now I'm sort of in [1651] like the education and the coaching [1652] space and I guess just like the the [1654] videography and production space but [1656] when I started I mean I went I was going [1657] door to-door selling local marketing [1658] Services I was going uh I don't know was [1661] buying leads off of various lead [1662] aggregators to sell wedding videography [1664] services like everything that I was [1666] doing was just like a boring company I [1668] wasn't doing like AI techn crat BS I [1671] wasn't trying to revolutionize uh public [1674] transportation no it was just like small [1676] little winds acrw over time where it's [1677] like m okay this thing makes me a dollar [1680] oh is that another lever over there that [1681] makes me $150 I I should probably focus [1682] on that oh no way that's another one [1684] that makes me [1685] $2.50 and over and over and over and [1687] over again so beware of shiny objects [1689] you need to be able to restrict your [1691] focus if you want to win today in 2025 [1694] 2026 and 2020x and Beyond um because [1697] they're just so many and the rate of [1699] change especially in regards to [1700] artificial intelligence is just going to [1702] continue increasing so if you don't [1704] cultivate that skill today you will [1705] never have the opportunity to cultivate [1707] that skill [1709] all right I have a little bit more [1711] pointed of a tip here but if you sell [1716] small [1718] ticket then agreements don't [1721] matter what do I mean by [1723] this well generally speaking if you're [1726] selling something that's like I don't [1728] know let's say it's like less than 1,000 [1730] bucks you selling something that's like [1732] less than a th000 bucks like you don't [1733] need to sign an agreement some people [1735] are going to want an agreement but don't [1737] get caught down the legally [1738] any situation I've ever had where I had [1740] an agreement that was for something [1742] maybe even more maybe under $5,000 [1744] realistically and the person did not [1746] fulfill their end of the bargain it did [1747] not make sense for me to go after them [1749] it did not make sense for me to spend [1750] the time and energy on this silly legal [1753] process when realistically I could have [1755] just been focusing on acquiring more [1756] customers [1757] instead I know that when somebody wrongs [1759] you in business and it'll certainly [1761] happen the tendency is to go after them [1764] with everything that you can not just [1765] for ego preservation purposes but [1767] because you know we all believe at some [1769] deep level in like karmic balancing of [1770] the universe I'm sure right we want the [1772] scales to be even but the reality is all [1775] the time and energy that you are facing [1777] that you are factoring in and giving to [1779] this person that may or may not have [1781] wronged you on a small ticket deal worth [1782] $1 [1783] 1,355 all this time and energy is [1785] delivering you a subpar Roi relative to [1787] just like acquiring new business so I [1790] had to learn this myself the hard way [1791] I've worked with a number of businesses [1792] that have hundreds of thousands of [1793] dollars outstanding every minute that we [1795] spent attempting to acquire you first of [1798] all your business should never be [1799] hundred thousands of dollars outstanding [1801] there's obviously systemic problems with [1802] these businesses so I'm not telling you [1803] guys to be in that situation or or that [1805] that sort of situation is okay but in [1808] all of the situations in which we [1809] attempted to claw back that money it [1811] ended up just always being a complete an [1812] utter crap shoot complete an utter waste [1814] of our time if instead of you know [1817] looking for that big jackpot okay if [1820] instead of doing that we focused more on [1822] just like the small little Dependable [1824] lever like I was talking about before [1826] that you could just pull all day long [1828] over and over and over and over again to [1829] make money then you know if you break it [1831] down per unit time right if we spent a [1833] 100 hours trying to acquire I don't know [1835] let's just say $10,000 in missed [1837] contracts like this is only $100 an hour [1840] if the business itself um values itself [1843] at more than $100 an hour and maybe you [1845] could make like $125 an hour pulling [1847] this [1848] puppy then you should have just been [1849] doing this all along right so be very [1852] wary of I guess the opportunity cost [1853] more generally um and yeah I wouldn't [1856] really worry about agreements like just [1857] work with people that you trust work [1858] with people that you like sure you can [1860] stick like an agreement area down there [1862] but don't expect it to be legally [1864] enforcable don't worry too much about [1866] hiring lawyers to do all that fancy [1868] stuff for you in practice it doesn't [1869] matter and let me just like cap this off [1871] with of course I'm not a lawyer and this [1872] is not legal advice so uh if you don't [1874] use an agreement or something and then [1876] you end up having to claw out $500 or [1878] $1,000 because some person perceived [1880] that you know you did something that you [1882] cannot legally defend against fine but [1885] just understand at the end of the day [1886] that this is all small fry stuff okay [1889] it's all very small fry stuff and if you [1890] catch yourself in like small claims [1892] court or something for a few hundred or [1894] or thousand dollars odds are that time [1896] would have been much better spent just [1897] going straight to the big [1900] leagues okay on that [1903] note everybody is a [1907] salesperson this is something that I had [1909] to learn the hard way many [1912] times because I was I was a salesperson [1915] and I thought that sales people were [1918] necessarily like me when I started one [1920] of my first businesses we were door too [1923] and I was doing you know 50 to 80 [1925] businesses a day knocking on their doors [1926] and so I had a very stereotypical idea [1927] of what like a salesperson looked like [1929] they were presumably some young man with [1931] a little folio uh with mismatching suit [1935] jacket and pants that uh you know would [1938] stroll into a business with a fair [1939] amount of Candor and try pitching them [1941] on some giving them their little [1943] elevator pitch and having them sign on [1944] some dott line the reality is that's [1946] that's not what modern sales people look [1948] like modern salese look kind of like [1950] this video that you're watching right [1951] now where I'm delivering a tremendous [1953] amount of value to you in exchange for [1954] basically nothing with the idea that you [1956] know I'm buying Goodwill that I will [1958] eventually monetize later modern [1960] salespeople are I don't know they're [1963] people on uh the the girls on Instagram [1966] teaching you how to do makeup because in [1967] reality what they're doing is they're [1969] teaching you how to do makeup so that [1970] they can approve the probability that [1971] you're going to buy one of their [1972] products later if you are uh student or [1976] something like that you are still A [1978] salesperson every time that you write a [1980] paper and you give that paper to your [1981] professor you are selling them on the [1983] idea of you being worthy of that a if [1985] you are in a relationship and you know [1987] obviously people like to avoid this [1989] whole relationship um side of of of uh I [1993] guess this concept because we all have I [1996] I don't want to say not pragmatic views [1998] on relationships but I think you know we [1999] all have the sort of idealic view the [2001] reality is the person that you're with [2002] you are in some way selling them on your [2004] character um every day you know when you [2006] show up and you you do your best and you [2007] make them very happy and so on and so [2009] forth like everybody in life is a [2011] salesperson it doesn't matter where you [2013] are your business career if you are a [2015] student you're a [2017] salesperson if you are um I don't know [2021] if you are like a teacher you're a [2023] salesperson you're selling your students [2025] on the idea of Education if you are like [2028] a Instagram Channel you're a salesperson [2031] you're selling people on why they should [2033] go and subscribe to your Instagram if [2035] you are a I don't know consultant you're [2038] a salesperson you are selling them on [2040] the idea of you as this knowledge if you [2043] are doing personal branding okay any [2045] sort of inbound you are a salesperson [2047] your content is selling them it may not [2049] be you on a phone being like hey how's [2050] it going why won't you buy from me today [2052] and all this stuff you're a salesperson [2054] and then you know obviously there's [2055] still like that actual salesperson [2057] person who uh does like sales calls and [2059] stuff and they're obviously a [2060] salesperson too they're just the most [2062] visible of the bunch so everybody's a [2064] salesperson like everything is a sales [2066] pitch how you conduct yourself in public [2067] as a sales pitch how you conduct [2068] yourself in private it's a sales pitch [2070] um your reputation behind closed doors [2072] all this stuff is just another [2073] opportunity to to sell um so in business [2076] treat it treat it as such you know have [2078] Ironclad reputations and so on and so [2081] forth okay the next thing I'm going to [2084] say is competition is [2087] good you know like all the movies that [2089] we presumably grew up [2092] watching it was always about like you [2094] know anything with to do with business [2096] it was always about finding some cool [2097] business model with no competition some [2099] new comp some some new business this [2101] blue ocean idea well the reality is [2103] unless you're hellbent on building the [2105] next Uber okay and you want to build [2107] Uber 2.0 just with a different name and [2109] maybe like a big unicorn broad or [2112] something if you want to build um the [2114] next Uber yeah competition matters [2116] because you you you're talking about you [2118] know going like multi-billion dollar [2120] okay but the vast majority of the people [2122] that are watching this the vast majority [2123] of people in general they're probably [2125] not going to make like a multi-billion [2127] Dollar business [2128] and even if they could they wouldn't [2130] want to cuz you know what the hell goes [2131] into these things I mean these lunatics [2133] are working 24/7 they have no families [2136] no fun no nothing uh most of us don't [2138] want that okay I mean I'm saying us [2140] Loosely here but most people don't want [2142] this in reality what you're probably [2146] doing is you want a business that maybe [2149] you know swaps one of these by several [2152] thousands maybe you want something that [2153] makes like a million dollars a year or [2154] maybe even maybe even last 15 or $20,000 [2156] a month okay [2158] and when you're operating at the scale [2160] to be abundantly clear this is your [2163] market and [2166] this is that tiny little [2170] sliver at the $155,000 a month or [2173] whatever whatever you want to make it [2176] doesn't matter what everybody else is [2177] doing here because there's always room [2179] there there's there's almost always [2181] going to be some sort of room in this [2183] massive pie chart okay this is like a I [2186] don't know like a 200 Mill ion dollar a [2188] year opportunity or market and most [2190] markets are way way bigger than this by [2192] the way I'm talking like pretty Niche [2193] here on all Hy your little $155,000 a [2195] month business is not going to to [2197] realistically change anything so you [2199] don't actually have to worry about the [2200] competition if anything you know what [2201] you should do is you should look for [2203] places there are a lot of competition [2205] then you should actually go in and [2206] insert yourself in there because odds [2208] are if a business has a lot of [2210] competition it's because that business [2213] is simple straightforward and produces a [2215] definable [2216] Roi so if anything competition should [2219] not be avoided competition should be [2221] embraced going draw a really silly [2224] thumbs up signal here but competition [2227] should be embraced that's my thumbs up [2229] kind of looks like a little bunny rabbit [2231] if if you can find Opportunities where [2232] there are a lot of people flocking into [2234] a market you shouldn't think and and I [2236] know this goes against so much investing [2237] advice right like sell at the top not at [2240] the bottom or sorry buy um at the bottom [2242] not the top and so on and so forth but [2244] if you see opportunities for stuff like [2246] this like that means that there's a lot [2248] of opportunity in this market of course [2250] be reasonable about it some things are [2251] hype Bubbles and you know not uh [2253] everything that has a bunch of people [2254] flooding towards it is actually good [2256] fundamentally but most of us have the [2258] ability to like discern the difference [2260] right if you are I don't know [2262] considering starting an HVAC company or [2264] something and you're like oh there's so [2265] many HVAC people in my space in my city [2267] it's like yeah there are a lot of HVAC [2268] people in your space in your city [2269] because they make money you know they [2271] they're coming in because there's a [2271] demand for it they wouldn't have [2273] prevalidated this demand if there wasn't [2275] so don't take competition as a negative [2277] signal [2278] um especially if you don't want to do [2279] anything more than like a couple million [2280] dollars a year the only space in which [2282] you actually start need need to do start [2284] needing to do that like crazy market [2285] research and stuff that's like when [2287] you're you know venturing into like the [2289] the be territory and certain concern [2291] yourself with making billions of dollars [2292] opposed to just us as humble [2295] Millions the next big point I want to [2297] make and I've kind of already said this [2299] but it's just say no more often than [2303] yes like don't don't say yes to things [2307] that your way I receive however many [2309] sponsorship deals a day um opportunities [2312] and they pick $10,000 for a video $5,000 [2314] for a video I could say yes to all these [2316] things right if if I had I would have I [2318] might have made a little bit more money [2319] in month one um but I would not have [2321] made more month more money than I'm [2322] making right now by you know securing [2324] the Goodwill of the audience and stuff [2326] like that so um in business you're going [2328] to have a lot of opportunities to like [2330] make this but don't focus on that what [2332] you want to focus on is you want to [2334] focus on this you want to focus on like [2336] the slow but steady growth that [2338] compounds over time and when you find [2340] something that works just do a lot of it [2342] so um this is especially relevant as you [2345] grow and as things start demanding your [2347] attention as people start asking you if [2349] they you know if you could do a project [2350] with them or you know this amazing [2352] opportunity with this big private Equity [2355] Firm or you know we want to buy your [2356] business to do X Y and Z if you believe [2358] in what you have and you're strong about [2360] the fundamentals and you know your [2361] strong willed I should say about the [2362] fundamentals um you don't need to just [2365] keep doing what you're doing um and if [2366] you believe strongly enough in the thing [2368] then um you will make way more money and [2370] it'll also allow you to clear your head [2372] and just focus on pulling that lever as [2373] quickly as [2375] possible okay the next [2377] thing is um decide with about 70% of [2383] information so don't don't wait until [2385] you get to 100% in order to make a [2387] decision you know my old um my old [2390] business partner the guy that used to go [2391] door to door with name grinder he uh [2393] once said a man who can't make a [2394] decision in a minute is not a man to be [2396] re uh [2398] anyway a man who can't make a decision [2399] in a minute is not the sort of man you [2400] want on your team or something like that [2402] uh the whole idea being that you know it [2406] can take a lot more time than a minute [2407] to get the information necessary for a [2408] decision but you still need to be able [2409] to make a decision so in reality what's [2411] going to happen is you're never going to [2412] have you know the full [2415] 100% battery bar of information you know [2419] in order to make the decision in reality [2421] all you're basically ever going to have [2423] is you're going to have some some subset [2424] of that you're going to have like 70% or [2427] something [2428] Max and you're going to convince [2430] yourself oh well I'm just going to learn [2431] a little bit more and I'm going to kind [2432] of make up this Gap right no after a [2434] while all information just becomes uh [2437] majority of information that you're [2438] learning just gives subpar um sort of [2440] diminishing returns like when you learn [2442] about something new like the first like [2444] I don't know one quarter or one/ third [2446] let's say is responsible for 90% of the [2448] information you'll learn about that [2449] thing you know if you could spend [2451] another third and you learn like five [2453] and you could spend another third you [2454] learn like 1% or something crazy so what [2456] you want to do is you you want to become [2457] comfortable deciding with about 70% of [2459] your info and then sort of like front [2461] loading with your gut um yeah 40 to 70% [2464] I believe was called by uh was stated by [2467] this guy Colin Powell but somewhere [2469] about somewhere around 70% is usually [2472] fine the next point I'm going to make is [2475] to hire last this is something that I've [2478] harped on quite a bit um but this is [2480] especially relevant now with you know AI [2482] agents taking the fold and a bunch of [2484] technological changes on the on the on [2485] the Forefront [2487] so hiring is super expensive like the [2490] average person that hires they might [2492] spend like three months of a salary like [2494] let's say I don't know you want to pay [2495] $3,500 for a salary the average person [2498] that hires somebody when you when you [2499] get somebody in month one you're not [2501] actually just paying $3,500 [2503] okay you're paying substantially more [2505] than that because like first of all they [2508] don't know how to do the job most likely [2509] on month one so now you're you're [2511] actually paying extra in training you're [2514] taking time from you you're taking time [2516] from other people [2518] you are paying for mistakes and you're [2521] paying for like even if it's good it's [2523] still subpar work most [2525] likely and then on top of that what [2527] you're also doing is you're paying for [2529] regulations you know a lot of states and [2532] cities and countries around the world um [2533] especially the EU which is unfortunate [2536] they they just have so much [ __ ] to [2537] be frank um around the hiring process [2540] you know you're paying for for PTO [2542] you're paying for some sort of mandatory [2543] leave you're paying for a certain number [2544] of sick days you're pay you're paying [2545] for all this stuff now obviously I'm [2547] being very specific here I'm talking [2548] about the employment situation but even [2550] if you're not hiring like an employee [2552] and I don't know you're hiring some sort [2553] of contractor or [2555] something and I don't know you are still [2557] paying them 3.5k a month but you know [2559] they supposedly get to dictate their own [2561] hours and stuff you're still getting [2562] most of these right and you know there [2565] there also is going to be some [2566] regulatory risk so um it's it's way more [2569] expensive if you think it's 3,500 bucks [2571] a month first month in terms of [2572] opportunity cost you're probably [2573] spending like $10,000 or more and what [2575] if something goes wrong well well now [2577] you just paid this person a whole month [2579] of salary okay and now you got to hire [2581] another one at another $3,500 a [2585] month and now you also have to pay you [2588] know interview time like your own [2590] interview [2591] time you have to H you know look through [2594] a bunch of other people that aren't that [2595] person to make that decision it's crazy [2597] it's crazy to be to be blunt with you [2599] guys hiring is like the hardest and most [2601] difficult and most annoying part of [2602] business and if you can get away from [2603] hiring you're going to want to get away [2605] from hiring so I know everybody says [2607] delegate delegate delegate right and um [2609] they say the second that you're doing [2610] something and like you don't know how to [2612] do it hand it to somebody but obviously [2614] my my Approach is very different I I [2616] would almost never recommend you hire um [2619] for a role for a long-term role today [2624] because we also have so many [2625] technological changes that are just [2626] invalidating the need of a hire like why [2628] would you hire somebody um that you have [2630] to train that makes these mistakes that [2631] give subpar work that you have to do [2633] regulatory issues with you got to pay [2634] Severance you got to do all this stuff [2636] when you could just pay a model [2637] you know a few hundred bucks and then [2638] take an additional 30 seconds of your [2640] time to like do outputs like like it's [2642] really not it's really not a big deal [2643] that's with today's level of Technology [2644] try you know three or four years from [2646] now so don't hire um first always hire [2649] last try and build systems out that [2650] enable you to do the thing that you're [2652] hiring for my recommendation for you is [2654] to list out all of the job duties sort [2655] of like a sort of like a table like if [2658] this is uh I don't know like the role [2661] these are the duties like actually go [2663] and like like list out um I don't know [2665] maybe you're hiring a cleaner oh well [2666] cleaner is not a good example sorry [2668] maybe an editor that's what I meant to [2669] say um you're hiring an editor right [2671] what does the editor do the editor takes [2672] this input like a draft and then turns [2674] it into like a like a finished [2677] product okay what else does the editor [2679] do the editor uh I don't know messages [2682] people when things are [2685] overdue right when you start doing this [2687] you'll very quickly realize if we just [2688] like take the person out of it that all [2690] these things or most of these things are [2691] actually just doable with technology or [2693] at least partially doable with [2694] technology and if you end up hiring an [2696] editor any anyway well at least now [2698] you're going to know all of the work [2699] that goes into it and you'll be able to [2700] like productize and line item everything [2702] and build systems that help them do more [2703] work and less time so hire last don't [2706] ever hire [2707] first okay the next big point I want to [2710] make is that Revenue doesn't matter at [2712] all so revenue is Vanity and then profit [2715] is sanity I have a feeling some of you [2718] have heard of this [2719] before but it's why you know it's why [2723] there's so much like distrust in the [2724] info product and coaching space as well [2726] everybody always talks about Revenue [2727] they're like I made 8 million bil [2728] jillion dollars today it's like well how [2731] much of that do you actually like like [2732] take home right so revenue is Vanity you [2735] could you could have I actually reminded [2737] this one time that I was um living with [2739] uh my roommate at the time jonno and he [2742] uh he was working with I think he was [2744] selling a speaker or something he was [2745] selling a speaker to this guy that [2748] um uh he ran like a cleaning company and [2751] it was a pretty big cleaning company [2752] because they did like $2 million a year [2754] so when the guy came over to our place [2755] you know me and J we were both like [2757] aspiring young business guys both um [2759] doing very similar business models at [2760] the time selling to weddings actually [2762] and uh you know uh he was like Hey like [2766] I hear you do business what kind of [2767] business do you do the guy's like oh [2768] yeah I run like a cleaning business is [2770] $2 million a year it's like holy crap [2772] this guy runs a like it's like a seven [2775] figer business $2 million right like I [2777] was pulling like three grand a month at [2779] the time and that was pretty [2780] inconsistent I think Jon was doing [2782] something pretty similar so you know [2784] we're like looking at this like what the [2785] hell man that's crazy [2787] and then we started talking a little bit [2790] more and I believe it was J that asked [2792] him this question I don't really [2793] remember to be honest but it was [2795] something like he's like how much are [2796] you making on this and boy was that a [2798] good question because I'm pretty sure [2801] the guy was like 8% or something 10% 8% [2804] and I was like what you're making $2 [2807] million a year Topline which sounds huge [2809] and incredible and successful and this [2811] puts you so far ahead and you we're like [2814] you know prostrating ourselves in front [2815] of this guy and then I was like we [2817] actually make a pretty similar amount of [2818] money yet you know mine's 90 whatever [2820] percent margin granted we were working [2822] for ourselves at the time and and his [2823] was you know eight so I guess what I'm [2826] trying to say is like the the the [2827] revenue figures are just total vanity [2828] they don't actually matter like if you [2829] have a choice between a business that [2831] does like $2 million a year [2833] okay and there are many businesses that [2835] do $2 million year easily okay and then [2837] there's a business Ser uh at let's do [2840] 10% then there's a business here that [2843] does $250,000 [2847] at 80% okay like like do the math on [2851] these these both do the same thing this [2854] is 200k right in in net this is also [2858] 200k in net so what are you going to [2860] choose I mean most people would probably [2861] still choose this because there's some I [2863] don't know Revenue multiples maybe it's [2864] a bigger business they could sell it I [2865] mean I I would choose this I would [2867] definitely choose this I mean I the [2868] small lean equation for sure as few [2871] people assumingly boss but don't to do [2872] with the hiring stuff that I was talking [2873] about earlier um so yeah you know like [2876] like Revenue was vanity profit is sity [2877] profit is the only thing that matters [2879] net profit um you know obviously like [2881] like I guess there going to be some tax [2883] implications tax depends on where you [2885] live in the world like how you're [2886] structuring your business and stuff like [2887] that um but definitely like definitely [2890] iida if you guys don't [2892] know that just stands for um [2897] earnings [2899] before interest it's kind of an [2902] accounting term [2905] um uh [2907] depreciation I always say depreciation [2910] taxes and [2914] amortization I think the t is actually [2916] supposed to be a bit [2917] duh yes that's probably supposed to go [2921] down here because depreciation [2922] amortization similar Concepts but [2923] essentially um you know definitely look [2925] into your ABA just you know Google [2926] search a You' never heard of before [2928] essentially just like that's that's the [2929] thing that matters your AA not your not [2931] your Topline Revenue you're not going to [2932] see any of that money anyway it's all [2934] just like you fluffing yourself to be [2937] honest so screw that man focus on profit [2939] profit is uh always [2941] sanity the next big point I'm going to [2943] make is whatever you should do whatever [2947] you do you should always under promise [2949] and then overd deliver okay no matter [2952] what this is like the easiest simplest [2954] hack anytime you get any client or [2955] contract you just say you're going to do [2957] X and then do X plus two okay just [2959] deliver a little bit more than you told [2960] them that you were going to deliver and [2961] they're going to they're going to love [2962] you for it because nobody does this [2964] everybody's so concerned about their [2965] margins and they want to save money and [2967] cut Corners here or there what they [2968] don't realize is when you do that you [2970] are massively reducing your retention [2973] massively when you just deliver what you [2975] what what you say you're going to do [2976] retention is like it'll be a few percent [2978] if you under promise and overd deliver [2980] you're probably going to like three to [2982] 4X your retention and you know what for [2985] digital business models that sell a [2987] recurring service retention is where all [2988] the money is in anyway let me give you [2990] an example let's say you do some sort of [2992] one-time offer for [2993] $2,000 this is one time okay [2997] you sell uh I don't know five of these [3000] okay that means you make $10,000 [3004] right but let's say you're smart and so [3006] now you offer recurring service in [3008] addition to this now the thing is you [3010] use this as your as your um intro offer [3013] as your Gateway in to your business so [3015] not everybody that does this obviously [3016] goes to your your recurring offer but [3018] let's just say one in five people do [3021] okay actually let's say even less one in [3023] 10 people do okay what that means is um [3026] you know [3027] uh I mean like mathematic anyway let's [3028] say you have a $5,000 a [3032] month [3035] recurring what that means is basically [3037] every person that gets in your business [3039] that buys this thing is mathematically [3042] going to give you an [3044] additional on10th of this $500 a month [3047] mathematically I mean you know you just [3049] kind of do the math on it 10% conversion [3050] rate you got five people come in they're [3052] going to be making on10th of of of this [3055] so let's hypothetically say right now [3057] it's a 10% if you start offering your [3059] package and you tell people hey I'm [3061] going to give you this package is going [3062] to be amazing but then when you do this [3064] $200 one time you go above and beyond [3067] and you offer some additional thing and [3068] you give it to them totally for free you [3069] say hey here's your deliverable and then [3071] here's a bunch of free [ __ ] on top of [3072] that that you didn't even ask for that I [3074] just thought you'd really like because I [3075] like you you're going to take this from [3077] 1 to 10 to something like 3 to 10 okay [3080] you're basically going to Triple this [3081] puppy you're going to go uh I don't know [3083] what's that like 1.5 out of those five [3084] people like in addition you're going to [3086] make [3087] $7,500 a month and let's say your turn [3089] is 6 months you will have effectively [3091] given yourself um I don't know an [3093] additional [3095] 45k of [3098] Revenue you know if you just um add it [3100] up future contract value and stuff on [3102] top of the [3104] $10,000 like basically you just you just [3106] took your net earnings from 15K be [3110] clear over to uh what's that 55k I think [3114] my math is correct just overd delivering [3117] now I know you're like okay Nick like [3118] what the hell is this overd delivering [3119] like isn't it going to cost me a lot of [3120] money it's like yeah but is it going to [3121] cost you [3122] $40,000 to fulfill no it's probably [3124] going to cost you like an additional uh [3127] $1,000 right it's going to cost you [3129] $1,000 and like you getting more [3130] materials or you having somebody else [3132] look over it or you paying a little bit [3133] more in margin so your your net really [3136] is kind of like you know it's 15K versus [3141] 54k what are you going to do you're [3142] going to pick this all all day long [3144] right winner winner chicken dinner so so [3147] no matter what always always overd [3148] deliver especially in some sort of like [3149] digital recurring business model um [3152] because it just massively improves [3153] client Lifetime and uh yeah you know [3155] that's really what you should be [3156] optimizing for anytime you're selling [3158] like an agency service or something [3159] where people are going to be coming back [3160] or something you have the opportunity to [3161] upsell now it's a little bit different [3163] if you are selling like a totally [3164] one-off service I don't know junk [3166] removal or something where like the [3167] likelihood of you actually having [3168] somebody that like you know can hire you [3170] again and again and again is is a lot [3172] lower but still something you should [3174] definitely consider all right next thing [3177] that I'm going to pitch you on is to C [3180] cultivate an audience [3183] asset now I can't say that I actually [3186] wish I did this [3187] earlier because I have this this [3189] approach with these audience assets so [3191] like first of all what is an audience [3192] asset when I say audience asset I'm [3194] referring to something like what I have [3195] like like a YouTube channel or like a [3197] mailing list or like a LinkedIn [3198] following or like an Instagram following [3199] or something like that now now what you [3202] should what you should really do is you [3203] should you should understand there's a [3204] ton of Leverage here and like when you [3206] have an audience asset and they like you [3207] for you and they get a lot of value from [3209] you and you're consistent about the [3210] posting and stuff like that like you [3211] have this this almost like transferable [3213] resource that you could take from one [3215] business model to the next you could [3216] very quickly and easily validate offers [3218] you could very quickly and easily sell [3220] stuff um and it's very powerful but you [3223] can't actually just go ahead and like [3224] cultivate the audience asset right away [3225] if you're a total beginner what I see a [3227] lot of people do is they'll be like oh I [3229] know I need to be posting on Facebook I [3230] know I need to be posting on Instagram [3232] so what I'm going to do is I'm going to [3233] start posting even though I haven't made [3234] any money then they end up spending all [3236] their time posting and then they haven't [3237] actually made any money so the reality [3239] is all these social media platforms are [3241] so God dang saturated that you can't [3243] just start posting if you have nothing [3245] interesting about you or no unique angle [3247] or no crazy accomplishment that you've [3249] done nobody's really going to give a [3250] crap so you have to do instead is you [3252] have to achieve something and it can be [3254] pretty marginal you can make 51 $15,000 [3256] a month in some industry where people [3257] don't routinely make that much money and [3259] then you use that to start your audience [3261] asset and then if you if you time it [3263] right you maximize return on investment [3265] because now you've done the impressive [3266] thing and now you're also growing an [3268] asset that uh likes you because you're [3270] talking about how to do the thing and [3272] then you're lighting fire on basically [3273] the entire markets ass at the same time [3275] which just improves the standard fores [3277] said Market um and you know if you do it [3279] right you're predominantly giving more [3280] so than receiving uh yeah you can you [3282] can make a ton of money I mean just look [3283] at me and look at a bunch of other [3284] people that started around the same time [3286] as me doing similar things so my [3288] recommendation for you guys is [3289] definitely cultivate an audience asset [3292] um I was doing a lot of outbound before [3294] now what I find is outbound just doesn't [3296] SC as well so like when I do like cold [3298] email and stuff like this is basically I [3300] don't know [3301] volume I don't know maybe volume and [3304] work let's just say like volume and work [3307] this is the amount of emails that I was [3308] sending that's the amount of work that [3309] it was taking and this is like the [3310] results It's Kind it's kind of linear [3312] right but you know what I'm finding [3314] um basically uh like like my audience [3318] stuff has just been has just been crazy [3320] um well I mean I guess it's just been [3323] like this the volume in work has stayed [3325] the exact exct same um I just do the [3327] same thing that I was doing and then the [3329] results just like grow so maybe it's not [3331] actually like this maybe it's like this [3334] realistically right if this is the [3335] volume and work that I put in then that [3338] is the result and the reason why is [3341] because it just takes you know very a [3342] very similar fixed amount of time to [3343] produce the content and then the content [3345] just gets seen by a lot of people um the [3347] value is you know if you've done what [3349] I've said before and you've constructed [3351] your lifestyle in such a way that [3352] enables you to produce a large amount of [3353] content or do the sorts of things you [3355] want to do like content production [3356] easily and it slots into your day-to-day [3359] then you can do all of this while you [3361] are still building the thing first but [3363] yeah generally what you want is you want [3365] results [3366] first and then after that you want some [3369] sort of [3370] audience and the audience will help you [3372] get more results I get tons of like [3374] leads from my YouTube asking me to build [3375] systems for them which enables me to use [3377] that as social proof and a bunch of [3378] other things which enables me to get on [3379] this like basically like business [3381] flywheel okay that's my business [3384] flywheel looks kind of like a happy [3385] birthday cake [3387] so yeah uh th that's my main [3389] recommendation for you on that front [3390] there obviously a variety of other [3391] things that you can do in order to build [3393] the audience asset but um I won't go [3394] into the specifics implementation there [3396] if you guys find any of that interesting [3397] just head over to a Nix arve daily [3398] updates it's my other channel where I [3400] discuss basically what I'm doing to grow [3401] my own personal brand just because I [3403] know there's slightly different [3404] audiences here versus there so yeah if [3406] you want to listen to me ypp on all day [3407] about my Instagram strategy that's [3408] that's the place to do [3410] so okay the next big thing this is [3413] especially relevant in the 2020x Years [3416] is um you know [3419] distribution over [3425] product so you know the whole [3428] idea of build it and they will come [3432] right the idea is you build this amazing [3434] product and it's this super cool product [3437] that everybody likes and it's amazing [3439] then a bunch of people just come to [3442] it well I hate to break it to you that [3445] doesn't exist in 20 25 what you [3447] basically do is you build a bunch of [3449] people that come to it and then after [3452] you say hey what kind of product do you [3455] want hey do you like this sort of [3457] product that sort of product hey if I [3460] were to sell you this how much money [3461] would you pay then after you get to [3464] build the most amazing product ever for [3467] all of them but you have to focus on the [3469] distribution first before the actual [3471] product if you want this to happen and [3473] the reason why is just because there are [3474] so many products out there nowadays [3477] and the market sophistication is just [3478] getting so unbelievably nuanced that you [3481] basically need to be able to cater to [3483] the wants and the needs I'm a much [3484] better artist than I thought you [3486] basically need to be able to cater to [3487] the wants and the needs of exactly the [3489] audience and exactly the group of people [3492] um that you're that you're selling to [3493] and if you build a product before you [3495] know exactly what those things are just [3497] off your gut feeling the likelihood that [3499] it'll succeed is very very low there's a [3501] very very low chance okay it's probably [3503] not going to [3505] happen um um you know this is sort of [3507] like the uh I don't know I don't want to [3510] say no it's not like the scientific [3511] approach this is like the artist [3512] approach where it's like I feel it in my [3514] it's like the Steve Jobs thing I Feel It [3516] In My Bones like the people want this [3517] right reality is you don't really know [3519] that people want this it's much better [3520] to be a scientist than it is an [3523] artist the way that the scientist does [3526] things is they'll take more time to see [3528] results than the artist will on the [3530] cases where it works but generally it's [3531] like [3533] this right they make they make May uh [3536] start at the same spot or maybe even [3538] lower but then they'll get a little bit [3539] better with the product and then get a [3541] little bit better and get a little bit [3542] better and then because they have the [3543] distribution they can do this so focus [3545] on the distribution first that allow you [3547] to become a scientist as opposed to an [3549] artist it'll allow you to actually like [3550] build things that the market wants and [3552] then it'll also just allow you to like [3553] be a lot faster and um you know I want [3556] to say a lot more iterative and and and [3559] incremental and consistent in your [3561] approach okay the next thing I want to [3563] talk about [3566] is your reputation and why odds are [3570] you're probably not doing enough to [3572] protect it so you know how earlier I [3575] talked about how money compounds and [3577] therefore it's not uh it's a it's a [3579] nonre renewable resource or sorry it is [3581] a renewable resource it grows with time [3583] whereas time tends to like inverse [3584] compound I want you to think about [3586] reputation in a very similar way as [3588] money not in that you should trade it [3590] but that it grows if you have X [3592] reputation today you'll have like you [3595] know x squared reput reputation and then [3597] you'll have X Cube reputation and then [3598] you'll have x to the four x to the 5 x [3601] to the 6 if you can hold on to your [3604] reputation um it'll grow much faster [3606] basically outpace you so uh the benefit [3609] to this is in you know the 2020 years [3613] reputation and authenticity are [3615] basically at a premium it is so unlikely [3617] that the people that you work with will [3619] have a reputation because we've all just [3620] been scammed to death we've all been [3621] sold a bunch of [ __ ] in the past uh [3624] you know based off false premises and [3625] stuff like that that like as a result [3627] you know the supply of reputable people [3630] has gone way the hell down meaning the [3632] demand for this has gone way up so if [3635] you if you have reputation you get to [3637] take advantage of this like crazy demand [3638] for it and then you also get to grow it [3639] really really quickly if you could build [3641] a solid ironcloud reputation today in [3643] like five years you know um that [3645] reputation will be worth 100x what it is [3647] now and you'll have been in demand the [3649] entire time which will help a ton so um [3652] definitely protect your reputation this [3654] has been pretty Cornerstone to like the [3656] that I've done business um just because [3658] I know how important or I can see how [3660] important it'll be to be authentic [3661] especially in an age of like hyper [3662] accelerated AI media everywhere uh but [3665] yeah those are more or less my thoughts [3667] I wish that I had known all of this [3668] stuff when I was starting my business uh [3670] my very first one my event management [3672] company um you know to make a long story [3674] short I basically started an event [3675] management company in college [3676] specifically because I really liked [3678] going to parties and I thought that I [3680] could just throw parties and get paid [3681] for it the first couple parties that we [3683] threw were like not at all legal and [3684] they did not at all go very very well [3686] financially but eventually we actually [3687] got sanctioned by the school and that [3689] enabled us to pick things up and make a [3690] little bit more and a little bit more if [3692] I had known even a fraction of what I [3694] knew back then I probably would have [3695] been able to run not just the most [3696] successful party company at the [3697] University like we did but probably the [3699] most successful party company in like [3700] the entirety of the province that I was [3702] living in in Canada maybe I mean a big [3704] portion of the country to be honest [3706] these are those those gems that may not [3707] necessarily be easy to internalize like [3710] they're easy to understand at surface [3711] level but they're very easy to like take [3713] they're very difficult to like take deep [3714] within yourself and really yet until [3716] you've had a failure which is why I've [3717] tried to so viscerally show them to you [3719] guys illustrate them and document them [3721] like I have so I really hope that this [3723] helps I really hope that you know you [3724] guys got at least a fraction of the [3726] value that that I did [3728] um I think that there are a lot of [3729] different ways to go with business and I [3731] should make the caveat that this was [3733] just mine and this probably applies [3736] better to me than it does to everybody [3739] but that doesn't mean that the [3740] information here is not useful at all to [3742] you obviously interpret it through the [3743] lens of your experiences your past and [3745] your beliefs and take it and use it to [3748] build a fantastic business I really [3750] appreciate everybody's time if you have [3751] any questions about anything that I've [3752] talked about here just drop it down [3754] below more than happy to answer and I'm [3755] also more than happy to do a video based [3757] off your suggestions otherwise if you [3759] guys could do me a big solid just like [3760] subscribe do all that fun YouTube stuff [3762] to get me to the top of the algo and [3763] I'll catch you on the next video cheers

Title: How To Set Up N8N Self Hosting In 3 Minutes (6 Ways)
[0] hey in this video I'm going to show you [1] how to set up naden self-hosting in just [3] 3 minutes and then I'm going to show you [4] five other ways to do so as well this [6] works if you are an nadn beginner an [8] naden Pro or anywhere in between I'm [10] going to walk you through the process [11] and even sign up and pay for the [13] services so that you guys can get this [14] unadulterated view of how all this works [16] as possible that sounds good to you [18] let's get into [20] it the first and simplest way to [22] self-host is using render for those of [24] you that are unfamiliar they call [25] themselves the fastest path to [27] production for a reason now I'm not [29] affiliated with them but I'll show you [30] how you can get up and running with [31] render in just a couple of minutes this [33] is easily the simplest way to go ahead [35] and do so so first things first just [37] create an account over here now I [38] already have an account so I'm just [39] going to put in a fake one here fake [41] email address and the fake password [44] we're going to click create account [45] they're going to ask you to verify your [46] email next now since I've already gone [48] through and done all of the signup I can [50] then go and then sign in so I'm going to [53] sign in with my account after you are [56] done verifying your email you'll be [57] taken to a screen that looks like this [59] it'll say deploy a service static site [60] postgress database or explore all [62] service types now unlike a lot of the [64] other videos here I'm actually signed up [65] to the service I'm actually going to be [66] paying when I need to but I want to let [68] you guys know that like you know the [70] these videos tend to be invalidated [71] pretty quickly because all of the [73] platforms that we are signing up for [74] self-hosting on they all tend to have [75] different uis and uxs and they change [77] the way that their dashboards look and [79] stuff so instead of paying attention to [80] the very specific buttons I'm clicking [82] and stuff like that just try to [83] understand um what what I'm doing more [85] generally so what you're going to want [87] to do is you're going to want to find an [88] area in the page that says deploy a [90] service and then go down to where it [91] says existing image what you're going to [93] need to do is you're just going to paste [94] this in verbatim so NN has a deployment [98] method called Docker Docker is just a [101] very simple and easy way to grab like an [103] image of the nadn install off of the [106] internet so if you just Google you know [108] n8n Docker like I'm doing here you'll [111] get a page that looks something like [112] this on the docker Hub and if you just [114] scroll down you'll find a URL that looks [116] something like this docker.io n/ [120] in this is just what you copy then you [122] go back to render and just paste it in [124] where it says image URL up here then you [127] click connect I'm going to leave [129] everything else as blank and I'm going [131] to click on free for hobby projects in [134] reality what you're probably going to [135] want to do is you're going to want to [136] launch a starter a standard or Pro Plan [138] depending on your usage if you are doing [140] thousands of requests a minute Pro is [142] probably uh sufficient for you if you're [144] just getting up and running and maybe [146] have like two or three clients or two or [148] three um you know systems that you're [150] you're maintaining that send workflows [151] every few minutes starter is sufficient [152] for you if you do free just note that [154] they'll automatically spin down the [156] service this can be kind of a pain in [157] the butt but I'll just leave it at that [160] once you're done it's going to go [161] through it's actually going to spin up [162] the docker image and you're going to set [164] up your server so let me cut in a second [166] by the way it was on this website that I [168] first found what NN actually means it [170] was written by the Creator himself and [173] he says that it means node mation and it [175] is pronounced as [176] n8n apparently the reason why was he [179] just didn't really like typing a ton of [180] characters so he said n8n node mation [183] good enough okay and then after a couple [184] minutes you're going to get a message [185] that looks something like this with [187] editor being accessible in this Local [188] Host all you need to do is go up here to [190] the link give it a click and then you'll [192] have the ability to set up your owner [194] account so that's what I'm going to do [198] here and once I'm done going to click [201] next this will then send a verification [204] email using my server actually which is [207] interesting do some fun little [208] onboarding [210] heard about yall through Google then we [213] actually have the ability um and this [214] may not necessarily be the case when you [216] guys are watching but as of the time [217] this recording we have the ability to [218] get a bunch of paid features for free [219] with a license key so I've already done [221] this on a bunch of other ones I'm going [222] to skip it but yeah now naden is here we [225] could start any workflow we want from [226] scratch this is running entirely in our [228] own server you'll see that because it's [230] a free server it's going to be a little [231] bit slower than usual um but all hot [234] Keys everything you could possibly want [235] works and because you're using a Docker [237] image it's going to be up toate so this [239] is by far the simplest and easiest way [240] to get up and running with this I should [242] note that um if you want to like this [244] isn't the only way to set up NAD end on [246] render and we've also glossed over a [249] fair number of like the configuration [250] options that you have if you want to [252] check out some of those configuration [253] options feel free to check um the nend [256] docker page there are variety that allow [257] you to like switch the database that [259] you're using by modifying environment [260] variables and changing basically a bunch [263] of things related to encrypting and so [265] on and so forth if you also look at the [267] nadn community environment variables and [269] just pump that into Google you'll find a [271] bunch of different settings that people [272] use to optimize their an and installs um [274] but that's just beyond the course of [275] this video the second simplest way to [277] set up naden in a self-hosted [279] environment is using Railway now for [281] those of you that don't know Railway is [282] very similar to render and that allows [284] you to very quickly and easily spin up [286] servers and spin up um databases for [289] those servers but ours our signup here [291] is going to be a little bit different to [292] what we're were doing before we're [293] actually going have to continue with [294] GitHub for those of you that are unaware [296] GitHub is a way to host your code or [299] Repository that you've worked on make a [301] long story short all you need to do to [302] make sure that this method works is spin [304] up a GitHub profile and I believe you [305] have to add some authentication so [307] github.com we just open this in an [310] incognito tab you guys can see what it [312] would look like when you do not have an [314] account then click sign up over here add [316] your credentials as necessary in order [318] to get that account up and [325] running then all you have to do is go [327] back and authorize your rail Railway app [330] this will give you $5 in free trial [331] credits as of the time of this recording [333] and now we have an account here that I [335] just have to accept a bunch of terms for [338] then move on to deploy a template the [340] one you're going to want to click is [341] nadn with workers it's currently the [342] most popular one um on the platform then [345] just type in deploy and basically what's [347] going on now is we're using our $5 in [348] free trial credit to spin up and N an [351] instance with uh workers which are just [353] a little addition and I believe it's a [355] post CR database with Reedus Rus I don't [358] really know how you pronounce that [360] but the specifics of the implementation [361] aren't super under aren't necessary to [363] know or understand until you actually [365] get up and running with n so the purpose [366] of this is just to make sure that you [368] you have an NN self-hosted instance we [370] can actually access it using a public [372] URL so let's que up some Jeopardy music [375] and let's see how things go at a certain [376] point you'll get a page that looks [377] something like this all of these will [379] turn green this is the actual deployment [380] process and it'll say it's applying a [382] bunch of changes you'll get updates on [383] the right hand column here that show you [385] that various deployments were done so in [387] my case it started with Reedus then it [389] went to postres and it's kind of working [390] its way backwards over to the primary in [393] add an instance before finishing off [394] with the worker eventually all of these [396] nodes will have green little check marks [397] associated with them and all I have to [399] do is go back to primary then give this [401] URL a click it'll open up your nadn [404] instance same as we had before and I can [406] go through and I can add all of the [408] information that I want and because it's [411] a new instance obviously it's asking me [412] to go through the onboarding um again [415] and so this is going to happen every [416] time that you set up a new instance it's [418] going to offer to give me paid features [419] for free forever um and then voila you [421] know we're basically good to go again we [423] have our nadn instance up and running [425] the third simplest way to get nadn up [426] and running in a self-hosted environment [428] is using digital ocean they have a [430] oneclick nadn install template very [432] simple easy and straightforward you just [434] type in digital ocean into Google and [436] this will be one of the first hits I'm [438] going to sign up to an account here from [439] scratch show you guys what it looks [443] like so just pumping in my email address [445] and my password I like digital oceans [448] design very nice [450] it's now going to do some bot [452] verification just to make sure that I'm [453] a real human [455] being and once we are in digital ocean [457] we're going to have to go through our [460] confirmation [462] sequence and we have some onboarding [464] that I'm very quickly going to get up [465] and [468] running and then once we're here you do [471] have to enter in uh some payment details [473] so in my case I'm going to enter some [474] payment details just to secure the [476] account I'm going to do that off screen [477] of course okay great and now we are [478] registered in digital ocean and in order [481] to get all this stuff up and running [482] it's very very easy all I'm going to [484] want to do is go over to the digital [485] ocean um I believe it's called their [487] Marketplace or their store [490] so go back over [492] here let me go I think it's Marketplace [495] there we go what we want to do is we [496] want to click on or search for [500] n8n be a oneclick install all we're [503] going to do is create an nadn droplet [505] it's now going to connect back to our [506] account we can select the specific [509] server error we want um just select [511] whatever is closest to you it should [512] automatically do this and then it should [515] automatically select an Ubuntu version [516] in my case it's [527] [Music] [533] 22.041 cents an hour I should [535] say now you're going to have to create a [537] root password so I'm going to do this [540] here looks like it needs to be a little [543] bit [546] longer H uh one uppercase letter o man [549] this is [551] tough oh geez uh why don't we just go [554] [Music] [557] you okay that's rough so I'm totally [560] going to forget that so [564] YouTu three that sounds good face that [567] puppy in there I'm going to very [569] securely on YouTube where everybody [572] could see it and then we're going to [574] create the [576] droplet now this is going to do the [578] whole deploy procedure similar to like [580] how we you know what we've seen before [582] very same idea it's just going to [584] obfuscate or obscure some of that data [585] from you digital ocean I find is just a [587] little bit less I don't know they put [589] that stuff a little less front and [590] center um it's also an older platform [592] versus something like Railway or render [594] which is focused a lot more on uh [596] obviously you know user experience and [598] being modern and stuff like that so [599] we're going to give it a few minutes and [601] let it finish okay and then your droplet [602] should be up and running the issue in [605] digital Ocean and the reason why this is [606] like third instead of first is because [609] you can't just access it via the ipv4 [611] the IP address paste it in you'll have [613] some some issue it refuse to connect so [615] what you have to do instead is you have [616] to actually add this to a domain um [619] using DNS what I'll show you guys how to [621] do here is on my own left click. I go to [624] Advanced DNS here then add an a record [628] the host is going to be NAD then the IP [630] address is going to be this and I'm just [631] going to try and do this as quickly as [632] possible so click 1 minute what this is [634] going to do is it's going to provide me [636] a publicly accessible URL at n8n doy [640] domain name. a that routes to this [644] address here so if you don't have this [647] um you're going to have an error every [649] time you try and access the IB the ipv4 [653] which is the IP address so I'm going to [655] give it a minute and then I'm going to [656] access n. left click. after that all we [658] need to do is go to console here give [660] that a click it'll open up this window [662] which looks pretty scary and make you [663] feel like a computer hacker all I have [665] to do is press enter enter in the domain [667] name enter in whatever the email address [670] you want to use for their encryption [671] protocol is and then um I'm just going [674] to not set up a time zone it's actually [676] going to go through and run some [677] additional configuration options for us [679] so here it is it's now building this out [682] once you're done it'll say installation [684] complete access your new idend server on [686] a browser to continue at this address so [688] I'm going to copy that over [690] go back here open up a new tab and as [693] you can see we now have the owner [694] account screen same as we had [698] before we can set it up it's going to [700] ask us some onboarding [703] info [705] and um voila you can now go in and then [708] you know muck around on your canvas [709] again the fourth way to set up nadn in a [712] self-hosted environment is using Heroku [714] now if you just Google Heroku spelled h [716] e r o KU you get to a website like this [719] this Heroku is definitely a lot older of [720] a platform you can see they have some [722] updates that are coming so maybe that [723] has Chang as of the time of this [724] recording but we will type in naden [726] Heroku what you want is you want this [728] GitHub repo here or GitHub repo that [731] looks something like it now GitHub [733] actually is a native deploy to Heroku [735] button so what you can actually do is [736] you just click this button and then [737] it'll deploy it to Heroku they've done [739] some updates over the course of the last [740] three months I should note that every [741] time we're doing this we're getting [742] slightly different versions of nadn and [744] stuff but if you click on that button [745] you'll then be taken to Heroku where you [747] can log into to an account which I have [749] yet to do so so I'm actually sign up to [751] an [754] account that's what I'm doing here uh no [757] company so enter your email [759] again and I am in the United States [764] let's say [766] Delaware now creating my account so [769] we're going to check my email like I did [770] a moment ago okay now we have to add a [773] bunch more info um and it looks like you [775] have to make your password super [777] long okay now we have to enter some uh [780] two-factor [782] authentication I don't really know what [783] I want to do here um onetime [785] authenticator yeah that's probably what [787] I'm going to do and then have to go and [791] download an app called authenticator [793] from the um Google Play store or the [797] Apple Store the way that this works is [799] it'll basically just generate a code [800] based off of the current date and time [803] multiplied by some secret key thing that [805] uh Heroku has installed then what it [808] allow you to do is you're actually going [809] to be able to scan it using um something [812] that looks just like this and basically [814] you put in your little QR code in that [817] in that Center area here which is what [818] I'm [820] doing and it's just giv me a [822] verification code that I can now pump in [824] which will be [827] this there are multiple different [829] authenticator apps you could use [830] whichever one floats your boat I like [832] using the Google Authenticator one just [833] simpler and easier for [837] me okay now we have some more onboarding [839] questions just to go [841] through when this puppy finally loads [843] that is am I domiciled in Italy no [846] awesome okay great so now once we're [848] signed in we can go back to that n8n [850] Heroku GitHub install click deploy to [853] Heroku and it'll actually just do that [854] one click deploy for [856] us going to call this n8n Nick common [860] runtime and I'm going to dismiss this [864] and then the only things that we have to [865] do is are we have to change the [867] encryption key so we have to change it [868] to what ever the heck we want I'm going [869] to do [871] um I don't know Nick is super awesome [876] and jacked all [878] true um and then the app name is going [880] to be the Heroku application name which [881] is naden Nick so nn- Nick cool and we [886] click deploy [888] beautiful as this is a one-click deploy [891] all of the configuration settings are [892] just up on their own so as you can see [894] there's some config vars here these are [896] the same things as the environment [897] variables and render um and then Railway [898] that we you saw earlier but I'm just [900] going to let it play and we'll see what [902] happens great you're going to get a [902] bunch of green check marks as per usual [904] and then we're just going to go view now [906] because we don't have um like https [910] installed basically and Heroku is is a [912] little bit behind all the stuff you're [913] probably going to get a dangerous site [914] where you're going to want to do is [915] you're going to want to go visit this [917] unsafe site down here it'll actually [919] take you to the page and as you can see [920] there's no real difference in the uh [922] that's okay there's no real difference [924] in um any of the the safety here um it's [927] just like it's your own website they're [929] just lacking the protocol that we'd be [930] interested [931] in so yeah um voila we are now on our [935] website we're going to go software [937] business owner myself um less than 20 [940] people and then Google as per usual and [943] we got some paid features and then blah [945] we can now start from scratch all over [946] again with our naden install self host [949] number four the next way to self host [951] naden is actually just do it on your own [952] computer using Docker uh you can do so [954] on like your laptop or maybe have some [957] server Rack or something like that I [958] don't necessarily recommend this unless [960] you know what you are doing but I'm [961] putting it in here just for completeness [962] sake what you're going to want to do is [964] just head over to doer. it'll allow you [966] to download the docker desktop version [969] now I have an apple silicon Mac so I'm [970] going to give this a [971] click this is then going to go through [974] the download process once I'm done with [976] that I have my Docker DMG image again [978] this is going to be different if you're [979] running a um I don't know like a Mac or [981] a PC or something make sure to download [983] the right one for your version in my [985] case I'm copying this over to the [986] applications folder which takes its [988] sweet ass time [994] then after that you can just search for [996] Docker whatever way that you are [998] currently interacting with your [999] filefinder that's how I do [1002] mine it'll verify the package yes I want [1005] to open the package that is why I double [1007] clicked you and then uh you can accept [1010] and then use these advanced settings my [1014] case I need to enter my password to do [1016] so okay great so um you can sign in you [1019] know through go through the whole rig [1021] rule if you want to like creating an [1022] account and stuff I'm just going to skip [1023] all this and what you want is up up here [1026] where it says search you're just going [1027] on paste in not that um just look for [1031] nadn so nadn IO nadn is right over here [1036] so what you're going to want to do is [1037] you're going to want to click pull [1039] that'll go through um setting this up on [1041] your own uh computer basically and once [1044] you've pulled it you're going to want to [1045] run it now I should note that you can do [1048] this through terminal as well you don't [1050] need to necessarily do this just through [1051] like the docker desktop Docker desktop [1053] is just a much easier way of of getting [1054] up and running with this and then you're [1056] actually going to want to instantiate [1057] this by clicking run and when you do so [1059] It'll ask you for some optional settings [1062] I'm going to do 5 6 78 right over here [1065] volumes host path environment variables [1067] I'm just going to leave that as is and [1069] I'll just do nn- Nick going to give that [1071] a run and you'll see that you know my [1073] computer is a lot faster than a lot of [1074] the other ones we've been using so it's [1076] already done with the deploy if you [1077] click 567 78 you'll now be at localhost [1079] 5678 setup which is again my own server [1082] and now I'm actually running nadn [1084] directly on my computer so because I [1087] have way more server resources than you [1089] know most of those ones that I could [1090] rent out realistically I bought like one [1091] of the swankier MacBooks um you know [1093] everything here is going to run way way [1095] faster than you know if I were to do so [1097] using some sort of cloud instance you [1099] also need to keep in mind I'm not um I [1101] don't have to send and receive data it's [1102] actually just all locally here I could [1104] see this making sense for people that [1106] want to play around with like higher end [1107] applications I'm just keep in mind that [1109] this does complicate the process quite a [1111] bit because now you know you your web [1112] hook URLs are all local now if you want [1114] to um find a way to expose right if I go [1117] back here if I take web web hook but [1120] you'll see that we can't currently [1122] access this so if you want to I'm [1123] actually going to go back to my Docker [1124] container I'll stop it if I click Start [1128] here sorry if I click delete here so [1130] we're going to want to find the nadn io [1132] latest again um sorry n n iio this one [1135] uh we can pull it if we want but in my [1136] case I'm going to click run what I want [1138] I want to set the web [1140] hook uncore URL to this and then the [1144] host Port I'm just going to leave at [1145] 5678 we'll call this nn- Nick again so [1149] now when I run this after it uh gets up [1152] and running I'll have access to my local [1153] host setup again so let me just go [1155] through the riger roll of the [1158] signup and now if [1161] I I need to find a way to automate this [1165] just given how many times I'm signing up [1166] to all these no thank you now if if I [1168] start from scratch and I add a web hook [1171] URL what you'll see here is it [1173] automatically puts in um this address [1175] now this still isn't enough to make it [1177] accessible what we need to do is we need [1178] to find a way to pass in uh basically um [1181] requests from nn- nick. left click. to [1185] our local ENT instance and that specific [1188] thing is beyond the purpose of this [1190] tutorial essentially what you're going [1191] to have to do is you're going to have to [1192] set up ngg NX which is a basically an [1195] HTTP web server that makes it so that [1197] when you send a request over to that [1199] address um it'll automatically forward [1201] it over to your local host on your [1203] machine but there's a ton of great [1204] documentation written on all this stuff [1206] on naden um feel free to check out [1208] configuration environment variables and [1211] then if you just type naden engins right [1213] over here it'll show you guys well there [1215] variety of like answers direct from the [1217] founder of naden himself that walk you [1219] guys through what that process looks [1220] like the last way I'm going to show you [1222] on how to set up an in a self-hosted [1223] environment easily and quickly is using [1225] hostinger for those of you that are [1227] unfamiliar hostinger is very similar to [1229] the other tools that I mentioned here um [1230] they just kind of hold your hand through [1232] the process a little bit more so if you [1233] just type in n8n and then hostinger up [1235] here it'll take you to this page there's [1238] a one-click VPS template which will get [1239] you up and running quickly um these are [1241] the prices on a 24-month term but when [1243] you click on it you'll actually be able [1244] to select a uh a smaller term if you [1246] want so period 24 months let's go down [1247] to one month here I'm going to click on [1250] continue it's obviously then going to [1252] ask me to create an account and do all [1253] my pricing information and stuff but [1255] let's do this one okay good to go we're [1258] now going to click get started that's [1259] going to take us to our H panel H panel [1263] is just like the hostinger panel and we [1265] have a guided setup here I'm going to [1267] choose just the the default options [1269] because they walk you through it fair [1270] amount the template that I'm looking for [1273] is n8n so that's the one that you're [1274] going to want to do it will launch um it [1277] will ask you to set up some malware [1278] scanning BS I never do that and then you [1281] do have to set up a root password of [1283] some kind it'll be the same sort of idea [1284] as [1287] before well looks pretty good to me oh [1290] 12 to 50 characters can I just double [1292] this up yes I can we have the VPS host [1296] name we have an SSH key which I don't [1298] really need just going to save all the [1300] stuff all this looks good to me I'm [1302] going to click finish setup and it's [1303] going to run through the process now of [1305] setting up my VPS after that you'll get [1307] a message saying the VPS is ready we'll [1309] click manage VPS here um it's going to [1311] obviously ask us some fun stuff thank [1313] you for the onboarding then we have to [1315] do is head to panel access click on [1316] login URL [1318] and this will take us to our lovely [1321] hopefully familiar at this point um nadn [1323] signup [1324] page and then from there you can proceed [1327] through the onboarding as I've done five [1330] times already click get started skip the [1332] paid features trial and then you are now [1335] good to go we are in the canvas I hope [1337] you guys [1338] appreciated I hope you guys enjoyed this [1340] video showing you how to set up [1342] self-hosting in both 3 minutes and then [1344] using progressively longer and more [1346] complicated methods I guess hostinger is [1348] probably less comp complicated than [1349] self-hosting actually but we'll see um [1351] if you guys have any questions about the [1352] self-hosting setup or how any of the [1354] stuff works just drop them down below [1356] and if you guys have any questions or [1358] suggestions for future videos that you [1360] guys want me to do then please add that [1362] as well I get most of my video ideas and [1364] requests at this point for my audience [1366] so means a lot every time one of you [1367] guys chimes in aside from that please [1369] like subscribe do all that fun YouTube [1370] stuff check out my communities maker [1372] school and make money with make if you [1373] want to make money with Automation and [1374] I'll catch you on the next video

Title: STOP Building Automations From Start to Finish (Do THIS Instead)
[0] hey today I'm going to show you how to [1] build better automations these are [3] foundational principles that work in any [5] automation tool whether it's make or [7] zapier or na10 and they also apply to [9] code as well these are proven ideas I [11] made over 128k in profit last month [14] building and teaching them to others and [16] you don't need any technical knowledge [17] in order to get up and running with them [19] all you need is an open mind and a [20] willingness to learn ready to go let's [22] get started now the first principle is [25] probably the most important and it's [27] also the simplest one to do it's start [30] at the end so anytime you're building a [33] system don't start at the beginning and [35] then logically try working your way from [37] node or module one to not or module two [39] to three to four to five ask yourself [42] what is it exactly that I'm trying to do [44] here what is the end result of this [46] automation what is the last node or [49] module that I'm going to need to add to [51] this in order to make it work try and [53] answer those those questions and then [55] just skip all the way to the end and [57] then build the thing that you want to do [60] at the end assuming you have all the [61] information from previous steps and [64] confirm that that works before wasting [66] your time getting all the way up there [67] only to realize that it doesn't now I've [69] built hundreds of automations at this [71] point both for myself and for others and [73] this is one of the highest Roi [75] approaches that you could use to [77] building any system if you zoom out a [79] little bit this same approach doesn't [82] just work in coding it works in [85] basically everything it's just called [86] reverse [87] engineering so you look at what you want [90] okay this is the start and then this is [92] the end you look at what you want which [94] is over here and then you just say okay [97] now I have what I want what's the second [100] last thing that I'm going to need to do [101] before I get the last thing okay I'm [103] going to have to do [105] this all right great once I'm done with [107] that you know how do I how do I generate [109] the information I need to do that well I [111] got to do this okay great now in order [113] to do that what do I have to do n minus [115] 3 and so on and so on and so forth you [118] basically just start at the last chain [120] and you just work your way back [121] progressively filling in the blanks as [123] necessary until you get to the thing [125] that you need in order to like trigger [126] your flow for instance if you take this [128] approach to building automations not [129] only are you going to save so much [131] wasted time and energy in exploring dead [133] ends that don't lead anywhere but you're [135] also going to build a lot tighter of a [137] flow because kind of like the way to [139] think about automations really is like [141] if you're at the beginning you can build [144] so many different ways to do the same [145] thing okay I'm just going to pretend [147] that I don't know Pretend This is like a [149] tree or something [150] and I don't know I think I locked [152] something here pretend that this is like [155] a like a tree or something okay [157] essentially what you're going to want to [158] do is um you know okay if this is the [163] start you start here your [166] path may be like this to get to the end [169] but you could also do [172] this you could also do [175] this and you could also do this the [179] point that I'm making is when you're at [180] the start line looking forward there's [182] like a million billion things that you [183] can do okay but if you're at the end [186] looking backwards you only ever see this [190] one trailing path to get back there do [192] do you know what I mean because we're [194] assuming the system's already been built [196] and the benefit to this as well is you [198] can typically eliminate a lot of these [199] weird sort of I don't know detours that [202] you might take along the way so [203] realistically what you see looking [205] backwards is you see a much straighter [207] line path from end to start and I know [209] that this is all theoretical I'll make [210] it a little more Concrete in a second [213] but this typically means uh fewer [214] modules or nodes in your flow it means [216] fewer operations or executions it means [219] less wastage and ultimately it just [220] leads to a much better and easier [222] building experience because I think of [224] systems in this way I'm typically able [226] to build systems that other people might [227] take you know 5 10 15 hours to do in [230] like 30 minutes because I always just [232] ask myself what are we doing here what's [234] the end result how do we go from the end [236] result to the second last result how do [238] we go from the second last result to the [239] Third last result and so on and so on [241] and so forth so I'll give you guys a [244] quick example here with my um probably [246] the most recent build that I did in NN [248] anyway on my channel and you know if [250] you're a follower of this channel you'll [252] probably recognize this but essentially [253] what I did was I used appify to scrape [256] new Instagram reels let me just get my [259] little drawing tool over here one second [262] I used appify to get a bunch of [265] Instagram reels okay so these are IG [269] reels [270] then once I had my Instagram reels i d [273] duplicated them using a Google [276] sheet basically just wanted to see if [278] I'd already had them and then I added [279] them to a Google sheet if they were new [282] I then downloaded the video okay I then [284] transcribed it using whisper I then [286] generated a bunch of suggestions for [288] better content I then searched [289] perplexity then at the very very end of [291] this I wrote a new script basically of [293] that Instagram reel and then I added it [295] to a database now I'm going through this [297] step by step just to show you guys that [299] it looks pretty simple when we you know [301] we have the finished product or finished [303] system in front of us right because we [304] just go well of course you're going to [305] do this before you're going to do that [307] right and that just makes sense but when [309] you're building something and you're [310] looking forward and you you don't know [313] like literally anything except for this [317] right like this is all I knew at the [318] beginning everything on the left hand [320] side of this when when you're over here [322] in la la land right you have no idea I [325] mean this could go 50 million different [327] ways so let me show you my roach to [330] building this system basically if I were [333] rebuilding this or if I were building [334] this today or building a similar one [336] anyway the very first thing that I would [338] do is I would Zoom way in over here to [341] the update entries the last Google sheet [343] and you don't even need to know what the [344] system does just kind of pay attention [346] to the shape of this I know at the end [348] I'm going to have to do some sort of [349] database update right so logically what [351] do I need in order to make that happen [353] well I need a database so I'd go and I'd [355] make the database first right so now I [356] have this database okay great what do I [358] fill it with okay well I want to fill it [360] with the script so I need to make sure I [362] could write the script so what do I do [363] next well I'd actually go ahead and I'd [365] try writing a script with a prompt I'd [367] insert my own test data there you know [369] i' i' i' prompt engineer all day long i' [372] do training runs and give it contexts [374] and all that stuff I'd basically make [375] sure hey in a perfect world if I [377] provided at all the best information [379] could I write a banger script and if the [381] answer to that question is yes then I [383] move on one step back and I say okay [386] well great let me think what information [388] or how could I get the information that [390] I need to provide to the model in order [391] to have it write me a good script okay I [393] need to search perplexity H how do I get [396] information in such a format that I can [398] search perplexity okay well I need to [400] use this other step and I just work my [402] way step by step backwards um until I [405] make it basically to the very very [406] beginning of this flow which is the [407] schedule trigger so that's a quick [410] example in n8n in make.com this is a [413] quick flow that I built a while ago that [415] essentially just scrapes YouTube videos [416] from my channel and then it creates a [418] Google drive folder and adds them to a [420] clickup pipeline that I built the idea [422] behind this clickup pipeline was just to [424] make my life a little bit easier um [426] essentially I I was creating short form [428] content for my long form videos over [430] here and then I had you know bunch of [432] content over here with like a [434] pre-generated frame.io folder it's not [436] super relevant or important so let me [438] just run you through what the flow [439] itself looks like we are watching actor [442] runs and then we're getting some data [443] set items this is just fancy terminology [445] for basically um you know getting like [448] getting the actual data where then [449] creating a Google Drive for every new [451] video and then we are creating a clickup [453] task and then at the very end I sleep [456] just because I had some API stuff so if [458] I were building the system right now [460] where would I start well I'd actually [461] start with the clickup node or module I [463] would actually go and I'd create a task [465] in Click up and I'd verify that I could [467] fill all of the fields that I want in my [469] space and once I've done that that's [471] easy as hell now I just work backwards [473] okay well one of the fields is going to [474] have to be a Google Drive Right [476] fantastic I'm going to create a Google [477] drive folder okay well obviously I'm [479] going to need the name of the video in [481] order to do that so what do I have to do [482] I have to scrape the data set items this [485] is just a long and roundabout way of me [486] really driving home that point but [489] essentially you should always just be [490] starting at the end and then working [492] your way back from the end to the very [494] beginning if you do that you'll be able [495] to build your systems I want to say at [497] least twice as fast and more importantly [499] you're going to be doing so in a [500] directed way that doesn't like you know [503] uh have you result in dead end after [505] dead end after dead end that makes you [507] want to tug your freaking hair out as [508] I'm sure we're all familiar with with [510] okay the second major point is test [513] driven development when you are building [516] a flow or an automation test every [518] module one by one don't go ahead of [521] yourself and add 10 modules or nodes and [524] then click test and then try and see the [526] output but actually just do it one [528] module or node at a time the value here [531] is if you test things one node or module [533] at a time the second that there's an [535] error you will know exactly where that [538] error comes from [540] sounds simple right hypothetically if I [543] were tdd test driven development if I [546] were testing a flow and I'm just going [549] to build this out in you know me drawing [552] because I've actually gotten pretty good [553] at drawing here I like to think so [554] anyway maybe people that disagree can [556] tell me this is step one if this is step [559] two if this is step three okay what you [564] do is all of these work we verified [567] we've got the expected outputs at every [569] step right well what happens when we add [572] step four and then it doesn't [575] work where is the error logically well [579] the error is obviously right over [582] here there's some issue with the data [585] that you are putting from 3 2 or 1 into [589] four right it's that simple you don't [592] have to jump around to every single node [593] in your flow you don't have to wonder uh [596] if you know you don't have to jump from [599] one scenario workflow to another [600] scenario workflow you know exactly where [602] this error occurred it occurred [603] somewhere right around here [605] realistically so you then just check out [607] the data that came out of um node 3 and [610] you say is this expected data is this [612] what I wanted then you check the data [614] that goes into node 4 and you say is [615] this expected data is this what I wanted [617] and ultimately you find that it is not [619] there will be some issue there whether a [620] syntax there or maybe some data field is [622] empty or whatever you'll know exactly [625] how to convert this from something that [627] doesn't work into something that works [630] and then you can just continue right [632] then you do number [633] five right that [636] works then all of a sudden you do number [639] six but for some weird reason when you [641] do number six there's an error well [644] where's the problem it's probably [645] somewhere right over here right [647] logically now obviously there's some [648] Nuance here data at six can access data [651] back at 5 4 3 2 or 1 and basically any [654] automation tool but the point that I'm [656] making is you will know that that is the [658] node or the work flow or the module that [660] you need to be spending your time on [662] fixing the biggest issue that I find [666] when people design workflows is they [667] will get ahead of themselves and then [669] they'll assume things they'll say oh [671] well this makes sense that's logical I [672] get it of course that makes you know I [674] totally got this I'm going to add this [676] node then that node then that node then [678] that node they add five or 10 of them in [680] a row and then something breaks and then [682] when something breaks they freak the [683] hell out because it could be anywhere so [687] essentially um what debugging is is [690] debugging is just a giant massive um [693] like search tree [695] okay [696] basically you [698] have so many different options here so [703] many different places that your [705] automation could [707] break and trust me this is going to get [712] somewhere you have you know out of uh I [715] don't know how many nodes are we down [717] now like uh uh you know if this is node [720] one there's an input and then an output [722] this is node two there's an input and [724] output this goes to node three input [725] output there's like I don't I don't know [727] combinator here there's 15 separate [729] areas where you could make a mistake [731] instead of looking over all of these 15 [735] areas what you want to [737] do is you want to cut your time down and [740] you only want to look at the one that [742] you know is the problem if you do it [744] this way you will save yourself uh 1516 [748] of your time okay it's obviously not one [752] for one I'm just modeling this and [753] trying to give you guys an example but [755] you will save the overwhelming majority [757] of all of the time that you are spending [758] doing all of this flowing and debugging [760] and and banging your head against the [762] wall and tearing your hair out if you do [765] test driven [766] development now the main retort to this [770] is Nick I don't really like testing [771] every node or module because it just [773] takes me a little bit more time but just [775] keep in mind that this is a fixed time [776] sync you know this is 30 seconds here in [779] order to test this is another 30 seconds [782] this is another 30 seconds you know how [785] much time it's going to [786] take and it's fairly fixed to do the [788] testing this right over here this is a [791] completely unknown amount of time this [793] could take you 5 hours to comb through [796] so you might as well restrict your [798] search to the node that probably matters [800] the most which is you know that last one [802] the last major principle that I use and [805] that I teach to people both in my [807] communities and that I consult with [808] outside of my communities is don't solve [812] every Edge case unless you know that you [815] have [815] to now I'm bringing this up because a [819] lot of people that get into no code they [821] do so from a programmer's mentality they [824] do so because they went to Computer [828] Science [830] school and their teacher said hey when [834] you design a system or create an [836] algorithm that system or algorithm has [839] to solve everything in the whole wide [841] world and if it doesn't it's not correct [845] okay the thing is automations aren't an [849] academic exercise the purpose of an [851] automation is usually to drive some sort [854] of business value in the real world and [856] the real world in theory two very big [858] different things so when you're working [861] in the real world you can design a [863] system that even if your system doesn't [866] work on all of the data types or all the [869] situations or all of the possible [871] hypothetical pieces of input and output [873] that come into it it doesn't actually [876] matter because it's still driving a [878] return on investment an Roi and what [881] you'll find is that's basically all [884] business owners care about they want a [887] system where you put in X [889] dollar they could could not give less of [893] a crap about what goes on inside of here [895] and then what they want is they just [897] want some system that produc produces [899] some constant times the money that they [902] put in C just being some number 3 4 10 [905] 500 so what they want is they want a [907] system where they put $1 [909] inside and then it becomes $5 okay [914] whatever the hell's going on over here [916] they they they couldn't care about if [918] your system isn't perfect they don't [921] care the only thing that they care about [923] is does this decision the in order to [925] get Nick to build it for me or um in [928] order for me to pay my staff member to [929] do this or or whatever is this decision [931] making me more money than it's costing [933] me so if you can dial back all of the [935] complexity for a customer or client and [938] if you can build a system in five [941] minutes okay that does 90% of the job [945] and then if you could theoretically [947] solve the other 10% but it would take [949] you 100 hours then just do what you have [951] to do in 5 minutes test it out see how [954] it goes see how it works in your [956] business or see how it works for the [958] customer's business [959] and then and only then if there's some [962] sort of issue you can work on improving [964] it or reinvesting some of those funds to [967] make the system even better so don't try [969] solving for all edge cases you probably [972] don't need to okay great I hope you guys [975] appreciated and enjoyed this video I [976] know this one was definitely on the [977] shorter side but just testing out a new [979] recording setup and seeing how things go [981] if you have any questions about what I [983] talked about today feel free to drop me [985] down a comment we're than happy to help [986] I Source a lot of my video ideas [988] directly from from my lovely audience at [990] this point so please really I could do a [992] video on what you comment like tomorrow [994] if you give me something good and juicy [996] otherwise if you give me a big solid [998] like subscribe do all the fun YouTube [1000] stuff that bumps me to the top of the [1001] algo and I'll catch you on the next [1002] video thanks so much

Title: The N8N Instagram Parasite System (10K Followers In 15 Days)
[0] hey Nick here today I'm going to show [1] you how to build an endtoend Instagram [3] parasite scraper in n8n that subscribes [5] to channels that you're interested in [7] watches them for new reels takes those [9] reels and downloads them exports the [12] transcript takes that information pumps [14] it into chat GPT and perplexity to tell [17] you new angles and twists you can make [19] on that content before finally rewriting [21] a script that you can use to record your [23] own videos in a tenth of the time I just [26] use this exact approach to scale my [27] Instagram channel from 0 to 10,000 th000 [30] followers in 15 days and I just wanted [32] to give you guys the sauce show you the [34] behind the scenes and let you build it [35] for yourself so if that sounds like [37] something you're interested in stay [38] tuned let's get into the video so just [40] before I get into the video I want to be [41] clear I haven't actually built the [42] system yet it is a system I was planning [44] on building and I figured I'd just [45] record a video while I did it and [47] narrate my thoughts out loud um but [48] because I haven't built it yet I'm going [50] to keep in the circuitous sort of [52] detours that I take while doing the [54] building I'm going to leave in any dead [55] ends that I come across because to me [56] it's very important for people that [58] watch videos like this to see the live [61] build process not just some glamorized [63] super pristine sexy version of it but [66] like how somebody that works in nen [68] actually goes through step by-step [69] debugging problems and that sort of [71] stuff because otherwise it's like if I [73] were to give you a picture of I don't [76] know the bur Khalifa or something and [78] say hey pretty building right okay great [79] now you go and build it it's like you [81] know picture only tells you so much [83] right looking at things from the outside [84] in only only gives you so much of the [86] whole story so anyway let's back up a [88] little bit let's talk about content text [90] and then I'm actually going to go [90] through the building um CU you know I [92] know you guys just want to see that [93] beautiful anaden canvas uh but [95] essentially I have an Instagram channel [97] it's called Nick Sur launched it about a [99] week and a half ago no two weeks ago [101] maybe something like that maybe a little [103] bit longer and essentially we just do AI [105] news so we're subscribed to tons of AI [108] newsletters uh you know AI research [110] papers AI research labs and the second [113] that this new accessible technology [115] comes out you know I record a video [118] using a little teleprompter that I just [119] set up actually which is very handy um [122] although you know given how much I Yap [124] I'm definitely not going to be using it [125] for these sorts of videos and then you [127] know I I I take these scripts I record [129] them and then voila you know we're [130] basically one of the first people on the [132] scene with this and uh people love it [133] right like check out some of the reals [135] they've you know this one just got [136] 43,000 today uh this is 160k right this [140] one's almost 400k so this is obviously [142] like a very profitable area for me to be [144] in and you know the bottleneck for me is [146] like producing this content getting [148] access to this news so one thing thing [150] that me and the team were thinking about [152] is okay well if we're subscribe to all [153] these newsletters why don't we go one [155] step further and why don't we get other [156] creators in our Niche maybe smaller [158] maybe bigger that are talking about [160] related topics they might not [162] necessarily be me an AI Channel but it [164] might be like an Art and Design Channel [166] talking about new Art and Design things [168] for instance or I don't know some [170] programming Channel talking about [171] programming things and essentially why [173] don't we watch those channels see the [175] new outputs that come like U like track [177] their reels scrape them on a daily basis [180] and then if these things have new [181] technologies that are related to [182] artificial intelligence well great we're [184] going to take them we're going to add [185] them to a database then we're actually [186] going to use AI to rewrite the AI [189] portion of the script of their reals and [191] then we're going to add a couple of [192] additional layers to it so that it gets [194] even better and you know more geared [196] towards an AI audience this is what I'd [198] call like quality content repurposing [200] quality um I don't know if you want to [202] call it parasite or whatever there's [204] probably a ton of different terms for it [206] but essentially this just solves a big [207] bottleneck in my business so that's the [209] idea behind this okay we're going to be [210] taking like other people's Instagram [212] posts [214] basically so um scrape Instagram posts [218] and I'm just going to get a giant list [219] of like the best people in their [221] respective Fields maybe they'll be like [222] art I don't know design I do like [227] programming I'll probably do um like [230] business you know as we know these [233] purpose built AI models for all of these [235] niches like these Niche specific ones [237] are coming out every day I mean it's so [238] hard to keep track of them so I'm going [240] to I'm going to like get people that are [241] number one in all of these fields and [244] then I'm going to scrape their IG [246] reels and I might do YouTube and [248] newsletters and stuff like that as well [250] and then once I've scraped these IG [251] reels I'm just going to check if it [254] exists in a [256] database this is what I'm thinking [258] anyway now when I say database don't get [260] freaked out a database is just a Google [262] sheet you know it's a Google sheet it's [263] an Excel uh file right there's nothing [265] fancy about a database database is just [267] the way the programmers try and make [269] themselves feel good but it's just it's [270] just like a table okay with some sort of [273] heading and then some sort of value and [275] then usually some sort of like index or [278] something right so we're all we're all [279] used to this we've all been using this [281] we've grown up using this sort of stuff [282] so basically I'm just going to check to [283] see hey does this real already exist in [285] my data base if so I don't need to do [287] anything and then we kind of have like [288] two two options right the first [291] option is uh yes it exists so if it does [296] exist we do nothing why because there's [298] just no use running all this [299] infrastructure like twice but if it [301] doesn't exist if it's new basically then [305] we go through um the next step and I [307] don't really know what the next step's [308] going to be yet but it's probably going [309] to be like transcribing the real [313] realistically um I don't know how we're [315] going to do it there are bunch of tools [316] that like enable us to grab files and [317] then do transcriptions and stuff but I'm [319] going to I'm going to play around with [319] it live and show you guys what the build [321] process looks like when you don't know [322] what tool you're going to use and then [323] once I've transcribed The Reel I'm going [325] to um you know probably use AI to do [328] some filtering just make sure like it's [330] something that I'm actually interested [331] in right I'm probably going to be doing [333] some top level stuff like determine if [334] it has the term AI in the transcript or [337] little stuff like that before I do this [338] and then finally I'm going to run [341] through chat GPT basically that's not [344] how you spell chat GPT Gat [348] GPT uh run through chat GPT and we're [351] going to identify angles or I don't know [356] added value let's just leave it at that [358] added value value ways to make the [360] content better and you know like I have [362] a feeling that my content is going to be [363] better anyway um simply inherently due [366] to like the quality of the presentation [368] and probably the editing because you [369] know I just started working with a [370] really good editor and all that stuff so [372] I have a feeling that literally if I if [373] I weren to do anything my content would [374] still be better um this might just be me [377] slapping my dick on the table being like [378] I'm awesome and and hopefully it doesn't [379] come across that way but I don't just [381] want to do that I actually want it to be [382] even higher quality I wanted to like I [384] want I want to do some research with [386] perplexity or uh something before this [388] step and then once I'm done that I'm [390] going to [392] rewrite as a new [396] script and then I can just like upload [398] it to a teleprompter or something [399] whatever I mean that's that's just me [400] and my my flow so um this is what the [403] flow is going to look like logically [405] let's actually go and turn it into an [407] n8n thing so how the hell are we going [409] to scrape Instagram reals first and [410] foremost now if you've never done any [412] sort of Instagram scraping before the [414] number one tool that people use for this [415] purpose is called apify if you're new to [418] my channel might be the first time [419] you've heard of if you're not you're [420] probably sick uh bored to death of it by [423] now I uh I unfortunately can no longer [425] say that I'm not affiliated with appify [427] because I've talked about how great [429] their service is so much they've just [430] given me and all of my audience members [431] a 30% discount for uh three months so if [434] you guys want to sign up to fi feel free [436] but anyway basically what it is is it's [438] like um it's like a like a marketplace [441] where you can get any scraper that you [442] want for basically any service so you [444] know you can scrape websites Instagram [446] Google Maps contact details Tik Tok [448] Facebook cheerio web scraper Puppeteer [451] Apollo LinkedIn right we obviously want [454] Instagram but in to make a long story [456] short I don't just want Instagram I want [457] Instagram reals so I'm going to go [458] Instagram reals over here okay now we [461] got a ton of different options we could [462] download them using this service we [464] could uh scrape this in profiles easily [467] I don't know I I typically gravitate to [469] the one that's made by appify so if it [470] has a little appify logo here you know [472] odds are they maintain it it's probably [474] pretty good so what I'm going to do [476] first is I'm just going to check to see [477] if I could do what I want to do inside [478] of um apify then assuming that I can do [481] it inside of appify then I'm going to [482] think okay great now that we've like [484] accomplished this Mission uh you know [486] how do we bring it into n and actually [487] like proceed with it how do we actually [489] take it into our no code tool because [491] right now it's on the appify website [492] right so first things first it gives you [494] a bunch of prompts and information here [495] what is your Instagram username um I've [497] already typed in Nick sarf maximum reels [500] per profile I set it to five just now I [502] don't really know if like five is enough [504] um like logically just thinking out loud [506] do people really post more than five [508] Instagram reels a day probably not I'm [510] sure the algorithm would punish you or [512] something so yeah let's just not do that [515] um what I'm going to do instead I'm just [516] going to run it so right now it's [518] actually starting a crawler in the [519] bottom left hand corner of my screen you [521] see memory just went up to 1 Gigabyte [523] that's like um you know this is like a [524] paid service in my case uh I don't know [526] it's $2 per thousand reels I scrape so [528] probably spending like 10 cents a day or [530] something but uh we're actually like [532] renting out a server somewhere in order [534] to do this and great you know we just [537] did this in 14 seconds we scraped five [538] entries that's making good time you know [540] if I follow 10 people it'll probably [542] take like I don't know like like a [544] minute and a half or something uh and we [546] have all the data so I have one of my [547] Instagram reals here how to get infinite [549] content ideas use a YouTube comment [551] scraper um how I made a million dollars [554] with [555] automation take my community programs [558] and okay I'm not just going to make this [559] an ad um yeah so I have all the data [562] that I need here what do I do with it [563] well uh I mean we need to find a way to [565] stick it into nadn right so the good [568] news is [569] appify has a bunch of very good [572] documentation so I'm going to go appify [574] synchronous actor run I think that's [576] what it's called and we're going to want [578] to do this uh basically what this allows [580] us to do is it allows us to run an actor [584] an appify server called an actor when [586] you trigger it but we can run one of [587] their actors just using naden doing an [590] API call so that's what I'm going to do [592] um I'm just going to check to see if I [593] still have this pasted no I don't so I [596] need to go grab my API key the cool [598] thing about apify is you just make your [599] own API key for whatever purpose then [601] you can just like delete or or [603] retroactively um uh like take it out and [607] it makes it really really easy to get up [608] and running with their API so what I'm [611] going to do is I'm going to paste in my [612] Bearer token um and then it's going to [614] ask me in their API docs on the right [616] hand side they have this sort of like [617] request Builder which is really handy uh [620] you know what exactly am I going to feed [622] in as an actor ID well usually what [624] happens if I just go back here usually [627] the actor ID is just whatever's up um in [629] the URL so I don't know for sure but [632] we're just going to give it a go I'm [633] going to paste that [635] in and looks like we need some some [638] Fields honestly um I don't know exactly [641] what we're going to provide as a [643] field okay so obviously we need actor ID [645] fine we need body body is just an object [648] yeah crap I don't really I don't really [649] know what I'm going to feed in there not [652] really sure um I think I need to grab [654] the input right [655] so what we're going to have to do is go [657] here go Jason okay here we go and then [660] this is going to be the input so I'm [661] just going to copy this over and I'm [663] going to go back to their API [664] documentation and I'm just going to feed [666] in this and is you know as you see if I [669] send this API request let's see if [671] there's an error or [673] something as you know we just probably [675] started something right I think so this [678] may be running I'm just going to go back [680] here and check yeah yeah yeah okay so [682] this actually worked okay perfect so um [684] I just verified that it worked using [685] appi's own little like API Explorer [688] thing where you put in your API token [690] you put in the actor ID you put in the [692] um input Json and then voila so now that [694] I have that what I'm actually going to [695] do is I'm just going to copy all of the [697] curl just using the little copy button [699] go back to n8n and I'm going to go HTTP [703] request and I'm going to import curl and [705] just paste in all of this code okay so [709] as we see here what we've done is we've [711] just reconstructed the curl request curl [714] being um just a library that people [715] typically use to send request just in [717] their terminal we've taken all that that [719] data and we've just copy and paste it [721] and built our own request here the only [723] thing that we're going to need [724] is like we we're hardcoding an actor ID [727] and and that's fine but the only thing [728] we're going to need is we're going to [729] need our API token so I'm just going to [731] go back to the account I'm going to copy [733] my API token come back here and then [735] paste it beautiful and we should now be [738] able to run everything inside of NAD um [742] let me just wait to see if that other [744] actor is now completed good because I [745] don't want to double up on it I'm going [747] to go back and then [749] give this a quick [751] test so crossing our fingers apis are [755] always fun to work with but if there are [758] any bugs then they'll actually be kind [761] of exciting because then we get to work [762] with them together like [764] friends anyway uh let's go back to [767] appify before somebody calls me a loser [769] steals my lunch money cool it looks like [771] it worked awesome [774] succeeded awesome and it looks like uh [777] looks like it succeeded but we didn't [778] get any anything which is kind of weird [781] so I don't actually like this I would [782] prefer to get some data back right so [786] let me take a quick Peak here [788] um just want to make 100% sure that [791] there's [792] nothing weird going [795] on because like we should get some sort [797] of response right like we should get [798] some data I don't really know why we're [800] not looks like we had a 2011 400 or [804] 408 okay actually that's kind of [805] annoying um I guess we don't actually [807] get the do we not get the data [810] oh you know what I'm using the wrong [811] endpoint okay I take that back don't [813] don't do it like me actually do this [815] this was actually going to return all of [816] a data for you for whatever reason I [818] guess they have two endpoints one called [819] run actor synchronously the other run [821] actor synchronously and get data set [823] items how the heck was I supposed to [825] know okay so I'm just going to copy this [826] over and um I'm just going to [829] paste this in and then grab the ID and [833] then we're going to redo [836] it okay let's see if that works or see [838] if I need to de feed in some stuff that [839] I haven't already [841] done I think that everything is the same [844] here so if I go back yeah okay cool [845] we're running it now so let's see if we [847] can actually get the data inside of [848] apify let this be a lesson to always [851] check the API request or the endpoint [853] that you are sending to um sometimes [855] certain endpoints are better than other [857] endpoints in this case this will combine [859] a two-step process and turn it into a [860] one-step process for me instead of just [862] firing off the actor and having it run [864] and then having to pull it later to see [866] if it's done um I'm going to be able to [868] do it two in one basically going to be [869] running it and then there's some [871] built-in trigger flow or whatever where [873] after you're done running it it'll send [874] the results back to [876] me that's the idea [878] anyway okay so it's five of six pages [881] now beautiful we should be getting close [884] awesome and it worked beautiful we got [886] all the data inside of NN fantastic [888] that's cool look at that okay so what [890] I'm going to do is I'm just going to pin [891] this so this is now pinned inside of [893] nadn that just means I don't have to [895] request the data in order to do [896] something with it um for now now we're [899] just going to do the when clicking test [900] workflow uh for organizational purposes [902] I'm just going to rename this to uh just [905] run actor [907] synchronously just so I kind of know [909] what's going on from a glance and then [910] if you think about it what do we do next [912] well we just have to build our database [913] and we have to like cross reference [914] against it so um I have a little Google [916] sheet over here that I was just putting [918] together before I was like oh man I [919] should probably record a video on this [920] I'm doing this anyway it's called [922] Instagram real database right pretty [923] straightforward pretty simple U what I'm [925] going to do is I'm just going to get all [926] the header fields that I want put them [928] in here and then once I have them um we [930] can actually go through and and do [931] something with this so what header [933] Fields do I want input URL do I need [935] that no I don't really need that let go [937] Jason ID I definitely need an ID so this [939] is how we're going to cross reference [940] and check to see whether or not like the [942] data that we are sending is already in [943] the database type video do I need that [946] really if I'm scraping reals I probably [949] don't right short code I don't know what [951] short code is might be some other ID so [953] I'm GNA put that in there caption for [954] sure I'm gonna want the caption hashtags [957] um yeah sure why don't we just like get [959] the whole let's just combine all of the [961] hashtags and then um we'll put like a [963] comma and then um that way like instead [965] of it being an array we're just going to [966] have one mentions I'm not going to do [968] mentions URL that's good comments count [972] that's good first comment I like that uh [976] latest comments this looks really big I [977] don't really want this so no get the [980] hell out of here height and width do I [982] really care about this no display URL [984] probably I think that's like the [985] thumbnail leave that in there video URL [987] for sure this is probably where going [989] what we're going to use to generate the [990] transcript alt likes count [993] definitely uh video view count so 57,000 [998] oo video play count wait what's the [1000] difference between video views and video [1002] plays H that's weird um time stamp you [1005] know what we should do now that I'm [1006] thinking about it we should probably [1007] organize these based off time [1010] stamp yeah like how how re recently they [1013] came in would be good what's weird is [1015] this isn't actually a time stamp like [1016] that's not what you call a time stamp [1017] time stamp is usually a [1019] um like a Unix timestamp and that's [1022] usually this so they're apparently just [1025] putting in a date and calling it a [1027] amp okay whatever um owner full name so [1030] owner username so I'll probably grab [1031] like username sure that's fine um [1034] product type Clips video duration that [1035] that seems like it might be interesting [1036] video duration 36.7 seconds cool is [1040] sponsored false yeah I'm probably just [1041] going to filter out everything well if [1043] I'm going to filter everything that's a [1044] sponsored then I don't really need it do [1045] I music info do I really need that no [1049] okay great so honestly we have [1050] everything that we need for our database [1051] now just going to that is our database [1053] this beautiful lovely Google sheet um [1055] what I'm going to do is I was just like [1056] to like have the header be a different [1058] color so I'm going to make this this [1059] nice pastel blue and the text will be [1062] dark blue perfect and then I'm going to [1064] change the font to enter because I'm [1066] just a giant slot for enter okay um [1070] perfect we now have everything that we [1071] need in order to like add data to it oh [1073] why don't I just change the name from [1074] sheet one to reals or [1076] something um that'll be easier so if you [1079] think about it um okay so if you think [1081] about it we should also actually add a [1083] transcript and then on top of that uh [1085] maybe we do scraped trans [1087] transcript on top of that we're going to [1089] do like a new transcript yeah that's [1093] going to be like mine new [1095] transcript and then we can stick that [1098] all together beautiful so okay now we [1100] have basically everything we need right [1101] fantastic um we can move on to the next [1104] step which is verifying whether or not [1106] this data exists in the database so [1109] logically I kind of just like in order [1110] to test this I need to dump a few [1112] records into the database that's what [1113] we're going to do first then once we've [1114] dumped the records into the database I'm [1115] going to delete a couple and then I'm [1117] going to see if we can like incorporate [1118] the logic that um sorts them out so the [1120] first thing I'm going to do is I go [1121] sheets just going to go add [1123] rows so a pendro I guess um I've already [1127] done this connection if you haven't you [1129] basically have to sign in with Google if [1131] you have a cloud end account like I do [1133] or you have to go through like [1134] connecting uh I don't think you have to [1135] do a service account but you have to go [1137] through like adding ooth which is you [1138] have to go into your um Google Cloud [1141] console [1143] account I think it's back here [1146] probably and then you have to sign in of [1150] course because my organization wants to [1151] make sure it's really [1153] me um you know it's not just a robot [1156] pretending to be me like so many people [1158] on YouTube apparently think and what you [1159] want to do is uh just go to like your [1161] homepage here on the left hand side go [1163] to apis and services go down to Sheets [1166] right over here from Google Sheets uh [1168] there'll be a credentials Tab and this [1170] credentials tab will um allow you to [1172] create an ooth 2.0 client so you [1174] actually to create credentials go [1175] through the rig Ro of creating an ooth [1177] client ID it's just going to ask you [1178] some simple questions just call like an [1179] in end project or something and then um [1181] you're going to have a client ID client [1184] date you'll be able to generate client [1185] secrets and stuff like that you can copy [1187] and paste the new ones anyway and then [1188] you can put all that put all that [1189] information in there but yeah for our [1191] purposes we don't need any of that cuz [1193] I've already done the connection [1194] multiple times and I'm on cloud so I [1196] just need to click that one button now [1197] what I want to do is the resource I'm [1199] going to be targeting is a sheet within [1200] a document operation of pendo what I [1202] want is I want that Instagram real [1204] database and it looks like the newest [1205] file just pops up at the top which is [1207] great the sheet that I want is I just [1208] want [1209] reals okay great so now I have the [1211] ability to uh map each column manually [1214] so I can map each call I guess what I [1216] can do also though like if you think [1217] about it is I've already gone through [1219] all of the work um naming it the same [1221] thing here [1222] right so can I do this hashtags and [1226] array you know what I screw it I might [1227] as well try it the thing is though I [1229] don't like that there are all five items [1230] here so what I'm going to do is I'm just [1231] going to add a limiter the limit is just [1233] going to take it so that I can only feed [1235] in one item at a time and this is going [1236] to do a couple things number one with [1238] n8n unfortunately the Google Sheets um [1241] query is the Google Sheets query is [1242] typically array limited pretty fast so [1244] they just have really crappy like rate [1246] limiting or they're making a lot of [1247] requests or whatever the hell's going on [1248] I don't know but uh we're just going to [1250] fix that so we're going to make it a lot [1253] slower of a request or an engine I [1255] should say and we're only going to do [1256] one at a time during testing just so [1257] that I don't like ramp up my API usage [1261] okay let's do test step and let's see [1262] what [1263] happens just ran test step it's [1266] executing okay great seems like it added [1269] so let's go back [1271] here and did we add [1275] everything I think we added most things [1277] yeah hashtags is an array so there's [1279] that but that's okay I'll just leave it [1281] as an array it'll be easier to do work [1283] with it later uh you know what it's just [1285] it's adding too much data I don't really [1287] want all this extra data man [1289] I do not want the extra data man all [1291] right you know I'm just going to map it [1292] manually screw it not worth I don't want [1295] an ugly database I want it beautiful and [1298] young and [1299] fresh okay so uh we're gonna we're just [1302] going to map this so ID is just going to [1304] be here right so I'm just going to grag [1305] it drop it voila you can just map [1307] directly from the Json I'm a big fan of [1309] Json [1311] obviously uh okay we need the time stamp [1313] so where the hell is that time stamp [1315] let's go back here [1319] timestamp come to me time stamp short [1324] code uh [1326] caption we got to do the hashtags as [1328] well the cool thing is since I'm doing [1330] the hashtags I can now like join the [1333] Hashtags with a comma and then a space [1337] right so that'll kind of get it in this [1338] format do I need [1341] to no I don't really think I need to [1344] honestly uh might be a little bit [1346] prettier but does that really matter no [1348] okay the URL just going to pop that in [1350] there comments count right that's over [1352] here first comment I I don't know I just [1355] like the first comment because you know [1357] that there's going to be like a man Nick [1359] really fell off for his comment [1361] soon as these are wants to do uh video [1364] URL likes count where is likes count [1368] video view count you know the biggest [1370] quality of life upgrade to n and end [1372] would be if they didn't make their uh [1374] drag and drop thing hide the subsequent [1376] field like it does here because it just [1378] hides the subsequent field like they [1379] should they should pop down this like an [1381] extra inch or something so I don't cover [1383] my own the thing I'm trying to do next [1385] logically [1387] right but what are you going to do um [1390] just get a bunch of big brain Geniuses [1392] together they don't really care about [1393] stuff like [1395] this okay so scrape transcript new [1397] transcript yeah that's it uh and then [1398] I'm just going to delete all the rest of [1400] these so they don't dump in uh no no and [1403] then just get rid of all these and then [1407] yeah okay we should be good did I delete [1408] everything yeah I did okay let's test [1409] this again so now I'm adding them in we [1412] should just [1413] blast every row here except for scraped [1416] and new transcript now because that I'm [1418] going to widen this a little bit this [1420] looks good I don't like the wrapping [1423] thing so I'm actually just going to turn [1424] off [1425] wrapping [1428] um yeah no no wrapping and then I'm just [1431] going to make all these way [1433] smaller I'm just going to grab this and [1435] then go like that make mebe make it a [1438] little bit bigger that way um when I add [1440] a new row it's just all going to be on [1442] one line instead of like a 100 I just [1444] don't really like the 100 line thing [1446] hashtags obvious ID okay time stamp so [1449] we're going to we're going to sort [1450] probably by timestamp and then like [1452] we're probably going to use this as the [1453] primary key URL of the post is here [1457] comment count fine okay display URL uh [1460] this is really long I don't like that [1462] let's make that way shorter it's [1464] important to me to be able to see [1465] everything while I'm doing testing so [1467] this one step that might you might think [1469] that I'm just being weird and [1472] unnecessarily I don't know what you want [1474] to call it OCD about this [1476] or like detail oriented or missing the [1479] big picture but it makes a big picture [1481] makes a big picture makes a big [1482] difference when you actually go through [1483] and you do the [1484] testing uh okay so this is this is [1486] pretty good obviously we're just going [1488] to make this a little bit smaller so I [1489] can see the scrape transcript coming [1490] when it does so now now we basically [1492] have the database right so if you think [1494] about it I've just added one entry to [1495] the [1495] database so what I want now is I want [1498] want logic I'm going to pass two through [1499] the limiter and then I want logic to see [1502] hey is this already present if this is [1503] already in the database then you know I [1505] don't want to add it but if it's not [1507] then I then I do want to add it so how [1508] do you do that logic and edit end you [1510] know it's interesting a lot of people um [1512] you know I kind of come from like a [1513] make.com background right it's a similar [1514] no code tool but um a lot of people [1516] don't really know how to do this logic [1518] in N which is interesting because to me [1520] it's just like the foundational logic [1521] behind everything so I'm just going to [1524] change Max items to two so now we can [1526] pass an extra entry through so we could [1528] like like check to see whether or not um [1530] more than one is in and if you think [1531] about it I just just want to add it in [1532] right what I want to do is I want to do [1534] something that looks up in my database [1535] to see whether or not that entry exists [1538] I'm going to go get rows and Sheet I'm [1540] going to connect to my other credential [1542] and I'm going to connect to the database [1544] which was Instagram [1547] real and then sheet again was just reals [1550] and now I need to add a filter so this [1552] is a part that I think a lot of people [1553] Miss but essentially what you can do is [1555] you can add a filter that searches to [1556] see if one of your columns is equal to [1558] something so if you think about it what [1560] I want to check I want to check to see [1560] if ID is equal to the ID of the entry [1563] that's coming in right if it is equal [1566] then I'm going to find an entry [1569] basically then if it's not equal then [1571] I'm not going to find the entry so [1573] that's pretty cool [1575] right uh I have a bunch of options here [1577] data location on sheet output formatting [1579] return only first matching okay so I'm [1581] just going to leave it there and then [1582] basically what I want is if if I don't [1584] find anything I'm going to have it [1586] output the data regardless this is very [1588] important if you miss this step it's our [1590] logic isn't going to work then what I [1591] want is I kind of want like an if and [1592] then [1593] right and then I want to say like I have [1595] to execute the previous node but but [1597] logically what I want is you know if uh [1601] if this ends up being empty then I'll [1603] proceed down the true route and then if [1604] it doesn't end up being empty if there [1606] is an entry I'll just stop right here [1608] and like there's a do nothing operation [1611] which is just kind of Handy to logically [1612] see what you're what you're doing so in [1614] my case I'm doing nothing and I'm just [1615] going to like leave the do nothing no [1617] down here just so it's blatantly obvious [1618] that like okay well we're just stopping [1620] um if we don't find anything so this is [1622] where we're at right now um we are going [1624] to have to add a little bit more [1625] complexity to this when I run this at [1626] scale um simply because as I mentioned [1628] earlier um naden a lot of the time [1630] struggles with like doing these bulk um [1632] API requests to Google Sheets and like [1634] you can technically increase your um [1636] your quota limit and stuff like that uh [1638] I just I personally haven't done it and [1639] I think the vast majority of people just [1641] don't ever do it so um just to make our [1643] lives a little bit easier we are going [1644] to be passing this through what's called [1645] like um a loop the loop is basically [1648] going to slowly do it one at a time [1650] instead of you know try and do 100 [1652] entries at once like idn likes to do but [1654] yeah anyway we're at this Google sheet [1655] step let's see what happens um we're [1657] feeding in two entries logically right [1660] the first is already in the database the [1661] second is not in the database so let's [1663] see what happens I'm going to feed in [1664] two and we're going to see um what the [1666] output is on both of these runs so test [1668] step it's [1671] finding and it only ran uh once or [1674] rather it ran twice once for each input [1677] item but it only found one entry here [1681] okay so we're returning that one entry [1684] and uh we're only going to be proceeding [1686] with that that one entry I guess so we [1688] found one item basically we fed in two [1691] items we got [1693] one so um yeah so now that we have this [1697] one item what we're going to be doing is [1699] we're going to be [1699] checking sorry it sorry it found the [1702] item that was in my database that's what [1704] I meant to say so now that we found the [1706] item that's in the database uh there are [1708] a variety of ways that we could do this [1709] like what I could do is I could [1712] take ID and I could say you know I [1715] believe I could say exists or is empty [1718] or something actually let me just go [1720] Jason if Jason [1723] exists then I don't want to proceed with [1726] the flow logically right let's just run [1729] this [1730] through so Jason does exist which is [1733] true so what we want is we want doesn't [1736] exist [1738] Jason doesn't exist which is false then [1740] it'll end right here you can just give [1742] this a little test step a run even [1744] though it does nothing [1746] awesome okay great so now what we need [1748] to do is we need to somehow sort out the [1749] true Branch Okay then if it's true then [1752] we need to append the new record to the [1754] database so just thinking I'm not seeing [1758] I'm not actually under fully [1760] understanding why it's not running um [1761] this should [1763] run uh twice should have this return to [1767] row [1769] one should be found and then the other [1772] should not be found cuz this is running [1775] twice so let me [1780] see okay you know what I'm going to do [1782] instead I'm going to do some pretty [1783] interesting merge logic merge logic is [1786] going to solve this problem and also [1787] just make it easier for us [1790] um we're going to grab the input and [1793] then we're going to [1794] create an output the output is going to [1797] be [1800] the elements that are new so let's go [1803] here I'm going to go [1805] merge and what I want is I want combine [1810] fields to match I want IDs and then I [1812] want [1813] to keep non-m [1815] matches so what I'm have to do is I'm [1817] going to feed in a merge and if you're [1819] unfamiliar with how this works then [1820] don't sweat show you how this works in a [1824] moment let's just do this so it's kind [1826] of visible [1829] basically what I'm going to do is I'm [1830] going to feed in this Google Sheets [1831] output and I'm going to feed in the [1833] original input and it's going to remove [1835] the element in the original input that [1836] was found inside of the Google sheet and [1838] that way the output of the merge node is [1840] only going to be the data that I want to [1841] add so let's run this let's see we have [1844] one item the item is this ID 356 38 let [1848] me just check my Google sheet that is a [1850] different ID beautiful it's comment [1852] speech not comment roses right we feed [1854] in comment roses we get comment speech [1856] beautiful um now as an [1859] output I don't believe I actually need [1862] this I lied and we can just go directly [1863] down the Google Sheets and we can [1864] actually grab the data from the merge [1866] node instead which should just be the [1868] same honestly and now we should be good [1871] and I think I've avoided that if then [1873] logic which is nice because if then [1874] logic can just be kind of [1876] annoying so let's give this a try [1878] now what should happen start to finish [1881] so we should do get the five and then we [1884] should only add one yeah there you go so [1885] we only added one right so as a sanity [1887] check [1888] right what I want to do now is I want to [1890] run this one more time with both of the [1892] elements then in my database as well as [1894] the same elements here because I just [1896] want to double check that this is going [1897] this is going to work um expected [1899] behavior is we're going to get two items [1901] to come in from the limit right we're [1903] going to read the Google sheet and we're [1905] going to get zero items coming out those [1907] zero items and these two items uh sorry [1910] we're going to get two items coming out [1911] the two items and the two items are both [1913] going to subtract and we're going to be [1914] at zero that's my expected behavior [1915] let's see what happens [1917] perfect that's what happened we got two [1919] items here two items here nothing [1920] carried forward so our system is now [1922] sort of like self annealing basically a [1924] fancy word for saying it's just like [1925] regulates itself you know it's uh [1929] elegant at least more elegant than what [1930] I was trying to do [1932] before all right so now that we have [1934] that uh what we need to do is we need to [1936] add the new entries as we've already [1937] done once we've added the new entries [1939] you kind of think of it like okay great [1941] so we have all of the front part of the [1943] flow done what we need to do now is we [1945] need to actually go through and find a [1946] way to download this thing and then turn [1947] that into a transcript uh once we have [1949] the transcript then we can do all that [1950] fun AI stuff so where we are right now [1953] is we're right over here we just figured [1955] out how to do this stuff so if I just [1958] get nice and [1959] green sorry we did this let's go here we [1962] did this we did this we did this we did [1965] this now basically we just have to [1967] figure out how we're going to transcribe [1968] the [1969] real so um I think there variety of ways [1972] what I'm going to do first is I'm just [1973] going to see if I can get the data like [1975] I probably should have done this [1976] initially but I'm going to see if I can [1977] get the video and like play it hey [1980] there's a complete oh my God I'm loud [1982] okay thanks [1984] man uh okay great so I mean we can [1986] obviously get the video that's cool so [1989] could I just feed I could probably just [1990] feed this in a whisper couldn't I I [1992] think I could uh whisper might need an [1994] MP3 whisper for those of you that don't [1996] know is just open AI um open ai's model [2000] which allows you to basically just like [2001] transcribe any text could we do MP4 [2004] could we do whisper MP4 let me check [2009] M we might be able to demux the audio [2012] the mp4 [2013] file [2015] okay interesting [2018] interesting well let's let's just give [2020] this a try first so I'm going to go open [2022] AI first because I'm familiar with open [2024] a and I know how it works that's kind of [2026] what's going here um transcribe a [2029] recording uh limits the size of the [2031] audio file to 25 megabytes let me see [2033] how [2034] big the audio file or this file hey [2036] there's a completely new a all right [2039] relax let's download this see just how [2042] chunky it is 2.1 megabytes so the MP4 is [2044] 2.1 megab I'm probably going to be fine [2047] so let me grab my YouTube credential the [2049] resource is going to be audio I'm going [2051] to transcribe recording the input field [2053] name is data so it needs to be a binary [2054] file okay so I basically just need to [2056] download that [2057] file turn it into a binary [2060] file um [2063] so well I guess I guess we have to [2065] download right can I just convert [2067] adjacent data to Binary data is that [2068] going to work I don't actually know I [2071] don't remember how to download a file [2073] and aen let me take a quick peek HTTP [2076] request to download file okay yeah we're [2078] just going to give it a [2079] download response format is going to be [2081] Tex so first of all we're just going [2084] to download [2086] this so what I what I basically need to [2088] feed in here if you think about it uh we [2091] don't have data accessible from our [2092] previous node during this test [2093] unfortunately it's really annoying so we [2095] actually need to execute them all again [2096] why don't I go back here and just delete [2097] one of these okay let's just execute all [2102] of the previous nodes all the way up [2104] until [2106] here apparently we're not getting [2108] anything which is annoying I'm not [2110] really sure why we are feeding in two uh [2113] is it the pinned output [2116] here [2118] H I think realistically what we should [2122] do is I should test this again step by [2125] step and then pin all the respon uh pin [2127] all the results they'll make it easier [2129] for me that way I just don't have to do [2132] all these dang API requests to um Google [2134] Sheets which I don't really like doing [2136] okay we're going to pin that output [2138] Let's uh run this we should get one now [2141] cool we got one pin Google Sheets now we [2144] can test this we're going to get one [2147] output here because we just ran [2149] it thank you okay great so now that we [2152] have this we can actually do the HP [2153] request to that data right so the URL is [2155] going to be video URL and and get [2158] authentication no um can I just do like [2160] a file [2162] format [2164] here or I do need do do I need to pass a [2166] header that says download a [2168] file I don't know let's just test this [2170] stab and see what happens we're calling [2172] the [2173] page okay we got data looks like it was [2175] a video to mp4 file so now I'm going to [2179] pin this as well uh I guess I can't do [2182] that with binary data H that's [2186] annoying contains a binary file to be [2189] processed uh well this says it's an mp4 [2191] I don't actually know if this is [2192] technically binary let's see what [2193] happens if I run this who knows we might [2195] get lucky oh okay great yeah no we don't [2199] we don't actually need to do anything [2200] fantastic that's way easier than I [2201] thought it would be we just downloaded [2203] the file and we passed it through the [2205] open AI whisper node and it looks like [2207] it doesn't only work off audio it also [2208] works off MP4 probably has a built-in [2210] API end point to get the file name get [2212] the file extension and then if it's a [2214] video or MP4 it automatically does like [2216] the demox which is awesome okay great so [2220] yeah um we we have the script right here [2222] which is nice what I'm going to do is [2224] let's just uh well we can't pin that but [2226] I think we should be able to pin this [2227] right cool let's pin this so now we have [2229] the [2230] transcription what we basically want to [2232] do is you know if we go back to our [2236] little drawing here um this is now done [2238] right so this is now good what we [2242] basically want to do is we want to we [2243] want to filter this so I'm going to [2245] write a really quick AI prompt that AI [2247] prompt job is going to be to go through [2249] grab the contents of the real and then I [2252] mean you know in my case it's obviously [2253] AI so but I'm going to make sure like [2256] hey is this an AI you know is this an AI [2258] development is this something about AI [2259] or or technology or automation maybe [2262] I'll go a little bit broader I'll say [2264] like hey you know is this a [2268] tool a tool a [2272] technology or Ai and then if the answer [2275] to that any one of these questions is [2276] yes then proceed with the flow if not [2279] we'll just drop it off and stop okay uh [2282] yeah that that probably makes the most [2283] sense and then um after that what we're [2287] going to do is we're going to go through [2288] and we're going to grab the tool and [2292] technology and then maybe we could [2295] figure out how to use the tool and [2296] Technology to do something cool maybe we [2298] get like a step by step on how to use [2300] this for some automation agency purpose [2302] or something I don't know I haven't [2303] really thought it out that far but maybe [2305] we'll just kind of do it organically as [2306] I'm putting things together [2308] all right so we've come a long way um [2310] one small step for Nick but one giant [2313] step for YouTube kind here I'm just [2315] going to save this really quickly and [2317] now I'm just going to take this over to [2319] an open Ai call again we're going to do [2321] message a model which is where I just [2323] talk to artificial [2324] intelligence um candidly I'll use the [2327] YouTube Feb for credential if you don't [2329] know how to connect with this you do [2330] have to go through some rig roll of like [2332] getting your API key which you can do so [2334] just by clicking more info down there [2336] what I'm going to want to use as a model [2338] is I'll probably use GPT 40 just because [2340] I think it's the smartest one for the [2342] lowest cost right now and I'm always [2343] going to add um at minimum like three [2345] prompts I'm going to add a system prompt [2347] then I'm going to add a user prompt and [2348] then I'm going to add another user [2349] prompt but I usually add more because I [2351] want to give it an example um but let me [2353] run you through this assistant prompt is [2354] just how it identifies you are a helpful [2357] intelligent I'm going to say admin [2358] assistant because I wanted to make some [2360] administrative decisions then under user [2363] um we're actually going to write our [2364] prompt now you know it's hard for me to [2366] like dictate what I'm thinking when I'm [2367] writing these prompts but generally [2368] speaking like some some overarching [2370] rules of thumb um to write as simply as [2372] possible don't use unnecessary verbiage [2374] if you don't have to keep in mind that [2375] the models are smarter with fewer tokens [2377] and simpler instructions give uh as few [2380] conflicting pieces of data as possible [2382] uh generally just like pretend that it's [2383] a staff member and and just talk to it [2385] and give it instructions um that you [2387] would give a staff member so like you [2388] know the way that I like to talk with [2389] staff members just like hey what what is [2391] it that you're doing why is it important [2393] um what are some examples of like a good [2395] job done and a bad job done so uh let me [2398] just run through this and kind of see [2400] so your task so we [2404] are an AI and [2407] automation maybe I'll say [2409] I Ai and automation Instagram Channel [2415] I'm looking through News archives to [2419] find mentions of tools that I can [2424] repurpose for content [2427] purpose into content for my channel that [2429] seems pretty reasonable that's that's [2431] who I am let's now um give it some [2433] instructions and maybe some [2435] context [2436] so your task is to take as input a [2446] transcription of a news [2451] archive and then determine if [2454] it if the transcription [2458] is about a [2460] tool a technology or AI if so [2466] you'll um let me think you'll identify [2469] the [2471] tools that's a good thing to [2475] do write a list of stepbystep [2478] instructions to use the [2481] tool identify the tools then write a [2485] list of step-by-step instructions use [2486] the tool [2490] and then output everything uh let's not [2493] do [2494] that what do I want out of this I wanted [2496] to identify the tools used because I'm [2498] going to use it probably to do some [2499] searches later I also wanted to write [2501] list of step-by-step instructions to use [2503] the tool [2504] easily ideally for free or for low [2510] cost and then once I do this I'm I'm [2513] going to do the generation later [2520] and one suggestion on how to make the [2523] content more [2528] palatable on exactly how to make this [2530] content more palatable to an AI [2533] automation audience let's do that that [2534] sounds pretty interesting return your [2538] output in Json using this format now I'm [2541] going to give it a [2542] format the very first um element I want [2545] is I want [2549] tools and I just want like a do I want [2553] an array of tools no I don't I mean an [2555] array would be the best logically [2559] but I don't think I'm going to ah maybe [2562] I [2563] will [2565] list of [2569] tools let's do list of tools or [2573] resources [2575] okay and then [2577] why don't we [2579] do step by step we can't do that with [2582] Jason so step by [2584] step [2586] instructions detailed instructions on [2589] how to use the [2590] tools that looks [2592] good and then why don't we go [2599] suggestion Fair [2602] comprehensive let's go comprehensive [2605] in-depth so suggestions on how to make [2608] this content more interesting and [2612] palatable to my [2614] audience AI automation that sounds [2617] pretty [2618] cool okay let's give that a go um this [2621] looks pretty good to me we have [2622] basically everything we need um now if [2625] you did want to make this a little bit [2626] better you know obviously what you'd [2628] have to do is you'd have to give it [2629] examples so I may I may do this with a [2631] couple of reels um if I do I'm not going [2632] to do it on like the video I'm just [2634] going to really quickly whip it up and [2635] then show you guys after um if not you [2637] know we're going to see how it goes so [2638] I've written my first US my system [2640] prompt now my first user prompt I'm [2641] going to write my second user prompt and [2642] my second user prompt you think about it [2643] logically like I'm just going to feed [2644] this in so I'm going to say [2652] transcript and just make sure the the [2654] words are the exact same because I I [2655] want this to be as simple as possible [2657] for this model to [2659] understand [2662] um sorry I guess first we should [2664] determine [2668] um [2670] verdict true or [2677] false then I'm going to say if verdict [2680] is false and we're just going to do it [2681] in a string format which may be a little [2683] bit confusing to you if you're if you're [2684] used to it in Boolean um but we're just [2686] going to say verdict is false leave the [2688] rest of the fields empty just for [2690] Simplicity okay great so transcript [2692] we're going to put the text right over [2693] here nice and then we're outputting it [2695] as Jason awesome any fields here [2697] anything I'm going to do no I don't [2698] think so let's test it let's run [2703] it now obviously our verdict should be [2705] true because I'm feeding in my own data [2706] which is all about you know some AI text [2709] speech generator [2711] right cool the verdict is true if I turn [2713] this into [2715] schema um I have ai oh well that's not [2718] what I [2719] want [2721] H I guess I'm not actually saying the [2724] name of the freaking thing right that's [2727] interesting I'm not even saying the name [2729] of the tool it's just a text to speech [2732] generator uh man that's wild um can I [2734] like just edit [2736] this and can I just go back to my real [2738] and see what tool I was using because [2741] I I think it was Speech MO is it speech [2745] Mo yeah I think it was Speech Mo [2748] okay when don't I go it's called uh [2754] Speech Ma and it allows you okay [2758] great okay um that looks pretty good so [2761] now it's going to say it's called Speech [2762] Mouse so now when I actually run this we [2763] should extract the tool it's fine I [2765] didn't actually mention the tool name in [2766] my real maybe at some level I was like [2770] hm I wonder if anybody else is going to [2771] scrape me okay great now we have the [2773] step by step visit the speech mod [2774] website enter your P paste or your text [2776] in the Brad text box foreign voices cool [2778] this looks pretty [2783] good voice comparison test using speech [2786] mod versus other proper tool that's a [2787] great [2789] idea yeah yeah very cool okay I think [2791] this is great um awesome so right over [2794] here I'm just going to rename this to [2796] transcribe make it really simple over [2799] here I'm going to say [2801] filter content [2803] and generate suggestions uh it's a [2806] little [2807] long let's say [2810] filter and generate suggestions that [2812] looks cool um anything else I have to do [2813] here just to make my life a little bit [2814] easier so run actor synchronously limit [2817] um let's just [2818] do search for [2822] entries going to [2826] say drop duplicates over here we're [2829] going to do add entries um here we're [2833] going to download [2836] video then we're going to transcribe [2840] video then we're going to filter and [2842] generate suggestions awesome um I'm now [2843] going to pin this output thank goodness [2845] for the ability to pin out puts man blow [2847] my mind um how so many no code other no [2850] code tools don't have this and now once [2852] I've done filtering and generating the [2853] suggestions I'm going to use one of my [2855] script [2856] templates or maybe I should [2860] H maybe you know what I should probably [2862] do I should check out perplexity is [2863] perplexity in here no maybe what I'm [2866] going to do is do an a perplexity HTTP [2868] call look up the service and then I'm [2871] going to have it scrape the website of [2873] the [2874] service and then tell me something [2877] really interesting about the service [2880] that is not in the thing and then I can [2883] I'm going to add that to the script [2885] genius that's cool and then I get to [2887] show up perplexity too what a win Okay [2889] cool so check this out right so [2891] perplexity is right over here I'm going [2892] to do um what do you want to know [2895] uh [2897] like what is one interesting thing about [2900] speech Ma what are three interesting [2904] peculiar things about speech Ma [2907] the AI text to speech [2915] tool I mean this is pretty cool right [2917] three interesting features of speech mod [2919] Okay cool so uh you know what I'm going [2921] to do now is I'm going to go to [2922] perplexity I think I have it over here [2924] right no I don't I should be signed into [2926] perplexity honestly not really sure why [2929] I'm not so let me log in again [2931] perplexity is a tool that allows you to [2933] um not only do a search and talk with AI [2936] but can actually get data from Google [2940] basically I mean like it's kind of like [2942] Google um I'm just going to copy the [2943] link and move it back here just in case [2945] there's an issue with the authentication [2946] sign in link is oh no I'm signed in man [2948] I don't need that okay great um where do [2951] I get no I don't want to download this I [2953] want to get my API stuff do I have any [2955] money on this account I do I have $263 [2958] so I'm going to copy over this API key [2960] and I just need to figure out how to [2961] actually do an API request to perplexity [2963] right so let's go to Docs [2967] let's quick [2968] start I have a payment so that's [2972] fine can I just run this be really cool [2975] if I could run this okay make your API [2977] call perplexity model sonar Pro System [2979] be precise and good size how many stars [2981] there in a g I mean yeah that looks [2982] pretty good so I'm going to go over here [2985] um make another HTTP call this is going [2988] to be my [2991] perplexity search [2994] perplexity then I'm going to go over [2996] here double click this import curl paste [2999] in this new [3000] request then I'm going to have to feed [3002] in the API key that I just copied right [3004] so let's go back here copy this API key [3007] go back paste it [3008] in how many stars are there in our [3011] galaxy right now I'm going to test this [3012] sample API request um it looks like it's [3015] an invalid model maybe because there's a [3016] space there I'm going to get rid of that [3019] they should probably fix that in their [3020] API docs they haven't [3023] already Milky Way galaxy Okay cool so I [3025] have the content um so now what I'm [3027] going to do is what did I just ask [3029] perplexity a second ago I asked it tell [3032] me three interesting things peculiar [3036] things about speech ma the AI text to [3039] speech [3043] tool free resarch vast Library vers okay [3046] I mean like you know reasonable um [3047] obviously it's going to be different [3048] every time but let me just run this [3050] query now through AI so I'll say tell me [3054] three interesting things about speech ma [3056] let's give this a test let's see if it [3057] can do it first of [3067] all very cool very cool okay sweet so [3070] now we have a perplexity output and the [3073] cool thing is this is going to combine [3075] with the generate suggestions now for us [3076] to rewrite our our thing so let's pin [3079] the outputs there um by the way you can [3081] pin just by uh mousing over and then [3083] pressing P I've been doing it sort of [3084] the long way all around just cuz I want [3085] to show you guys but that's that easy um [3087] and [3088] then now let's go and feed this into [3091] another Ai call so I'm just going to [3093] copy and paste this then drag this puppy [3096] in instead of filter and generate [3098] suggestions now it's going to be rewrite [3100] script or maybe like write [3103] real um WR new script let's do that [3107] we're going to feed in the generated [3109] suggestions with the perplexity data and [3111] we're going to put stick all that stuff [3113] just in one like prompt and then we're [3115] going to train it and give it two or [3116] examples and we're ultimately going to [3118] have it um write me a script which then [3119] I can add down scrape transcript and [3122] then new transcript and we're going to [3123] take new transcript and then that's what [3125] I'm going to pump through my little um [3127] yeah that's what I'm going to pump [3127] through my teleprompter how cool so uh [3131] you're helpful intelligent let's do [3132] writing assistant now let's not do [3135] script writing I don't want it to get [3136] confused but you're a helpful [3137] intelligent [3140] assistant now I'm going to say I run an [3142] AI and automation Instagram Channel I'm [3144] looking to through news archives so I've [3145] already done that [3152] my editors would like to make a new [3157] video they've got Source data a [3161] stepbystep [3163] guide they found Source they found um an [3169] interesting tool or technology compiled [3172] a step-by-step guide on how to use it [3177] done some searching on the [3179] internet about what's interesting about [3183] it to find what's interesting about it [3186] um some interesting things about [3188] it and also um written suggestions for [3194] how to [3195] make the content [3200] better [3203] okay ready script about it ready let's [3206] say rough draft on it about it and we [3210] also had our edit our chief editor write [3214] suggestions concrete suggestions for how [3216] to make the content better your task is [3218] to take us input all of these [3223] things and then write a new highquality [3229] script for us to say tonight for us [3234] to feature tonight let's let's do that I [3237] mean you know none of this really [3238] matters so maybe I'll remove that I want [3239] to confuse it tonight are you a news [3241] channel okay great return your [3247] output okay return your output in Json [3249] using this format um what I'm going to [3251] do so I'm just going to call this [3253] script your script goes here and then if [3257] I just go back what's the length of the [3259] thing that I just [3262] made I go over here and I just go to [3264] word counter and then I just paste this [3266] in it's about 100 words right so what [3269] I'm going to do is I'll just [3272] say script goes here let's go around 100 [3277] words then for [3279] rules I'll [3281] say be concise uh use a casual Spartan [3285] tone of voice No [3289] Frills say [3293] follow the provided examples as close CL [3296] ly as [3298] possible follow provide examples closely [3302] as possible in tone of voice or [3305] um in tone of voice and subject matter [3309] and then I'll [3311] say end the script with a [3315] call [3317] Action like [3319] want the [3326] want [3327] thing just [3329] comment [3331] keyword and I'll send it straight to [3333] your DMs perfect man it'd be so cool if [3336] we could fully automate Instagram in so [3338] cool all right so listen why don't we [3341] just start by providing it all of the [3342] information and then just seeing how it [3344] performs on like a on on one run and [3346] then after that we'll um we'll go [3347] through and we'll um actually like give [3349] it some training examples of stuff so if [3351] you think about it uh we're going to [3353] need perplexity output [3356] I'm going to feed in [3359] this and then I actually just want this [3362] to look pretty so I'm going to go to [3363] Json formatter and then I'm going to pop [3365] this [3366] in so I'm just going to do that and then [3370] in addition to perplexity output I also [3374] want or uh let's do rough draft [3378] script actually let's do rough draft [3380] script first maximize the quality of [3383] this rough draft script then perplexity [3385] output [3390] then okay maybe we'll actually go tool [3395] name rough draft [3397] script perplexity [3399] output step by step [3404] guide then suggestions for [3410] improvement so now I'm just going to map [3412] these variables so suggestion is going [3414] to go here step by step guide is going [3417] to go [3419] here tool names uh I think I should just [3423] go tools. [3426] jooin so I guess if there's only one [3428] element we're just going to feed in [3430] thing but what if there's more you know [3433] why don't I just [3435] go [3438] join yeah I'm just going to use join [3440] that's probably the simplest way to do [3441] it uh rough draft script is going to be [3443] the output of the transcription node [3445] right [3446] Okay cool so now if you think about it [3449] we have everything we need to actually [3450] generate Json and then scrape it so I'm [3452] just going to see how it works on like [3454] this completely Bare Bones uh sample [3457] input and then we're going to give it a [3459] go um I'm look let's look look it looks [3461] like I'm having an issue with item why [3463] is [3464] that transcribe video item Jason [3468] text I think the reason [3473] is um I can't figure out the matching [3476] item it's because open air return [3478] incorrect matching information okay well [3480] I'm just going to go first because it's [3481] just one here right it's always just [3483] going to be the same one [3485] no strange uh we should get that [3488] data me [3493] see let me delete this we'll go again [3497] and then what I want is I want um [3499] transcribe [3502] video then I want item [3507] first right or is it dot [3514] first um oh [3517] boy [3519] all DOT [3522] first do json. [3526] text should be good I'm going now to [3530] test [3532] this we should be feeding in the rough [3534] draft script correctly I hope so [3540] I don't like the I really don't like the [3542] script here guys check out speea it's [3545] kind of boring so we're definitely going [3547] to have to train it we're going to have [3548] to like show it our tone of voice the [3549] good news is um we have a database that [3552] uh you know is going to be pretty simple [3554] for me to use so why don't I give that a [3556] quick look I don't actually remember [3558] exactly where that [3560] is [3563] scripts voicemail scripts no [3566] [Music] [3575] hm this right over here okay yeah this [3578] is it okay um these look [3582] reasonable [3587] right let's do some my new [3593] ones so now what I'm going to do is I'm [3595] actually going to give it some examples [3596] so what I have to do is I have to come [3597] up with all this for like some example [3599] tools so uh let's add a couple of [3601] messages cuz I'm going to do two I'm [3603] going to do one [3604] example once I'm done with the [3606] example I'm going to give it [3609] an assistant so this will be the output [3613] here me copy all [3618] this I don't like why the formatting is [3621] like this it's very [3622] annoying we should be good here oh you [3626] know what no that's not what I want I [3629] just want one object oh I hope I didn't [3631] just delete a bunch of stuff I think I [3633] did yeah okay let's do this uh [3641] user um why am I having a stroke right [3645] now tool names down here okay so no we [3649] want this last [3650] one to be the expression with the actual [3654] data we want this to be an assistant [3657] prompt which will contain a single item [3660] called [3663] Script and then this will be an example [3667] so I'm actually just going to go over [3668] here and I'm going to strip all this and [3669] I'm going to have to write my own [3670] example um so that should be reasonable [3674] um not going to be too big of a deal but [3675] yeah anyway Let's uh let's feed it this [3679] as an [3680] example and let's just replace all new [3683] lines with actual new lines [3686] new Lin above with characters just have [3689] ai do it really [3691] quickly thank you thank you o wonderful [3695] single new lines really I don't know [3697] about that man might need some doubles [3699] there okay we're going to copy [3701] it um I'm then going to generate [3705] this I'll leave it as [3708] fixed um for [3711] now oh we doubled up on the quotes let's [3714] just remove that looks like we use some [3716] weird quote character too so that looks [3718] pretty good um cool so I basically now [3721] need an example of 11 Labs so I need an [3725] example of a shitty script that we turn [3726] into a good script or like a subpar [3729] script that we turn into a good script [3731] so I'm going to go to this expression [3732] editor and then tool name we'll call [3735] this [3738] speech cuz you know we didn't we didn't [3741] actually do it for this right so I need [3742] to just come up with [3744] this which is kind of annoying but um [3746] anyway tool names it'll just be speech [3748] ma rough draft script uh I guess what I [3752] could [3753] do so I could say rewrite this but make [3756] it [3765] worse that's actually pretty [3769] funny get long in [3773] Circus and Bland [3784] remove the 60 languages and the no [3786] restrictions [3793] part so that way um you know it's [3797] hopefully going to pattern match the [3799] fact that I want it to add more [3803] details um and you know maybe The Source [3806] content is GNA be really long and [3807] annoying okay so oh sorry sorry that's [3812] not what I want I wanted [3813] um rough draft script to be that right [3816] so I got to go back here and I just got [3817] to copy all of this in rough draft [3820] script is going to be [3834] this it didn't really do [3841] that it has a lot of [3845] voices and the best part is you don't [3849] need to sign up for an account okay the [3851] process is [3855] simple go to the [3858] site and type whatever you want [3860] converted [3865] there are lots of [3883] voices cool so that's going to be a [3885] rough draft [3889] script um perplexity output will [3892] say what it actually said [3896] which is here are three interesting [3898] things about speech [3900] ma uh wait yes stepbystep [3904] guide will then just [3910] be this step bystep [3913] guide then we're going to have to you [3914] know feed it like a different data [3918] basically no sorry just going to want to [3920] hard code this in suggestions for [3923] improvement uh okay [3927] feed that in Okay Okay cool so we now [3929] have if you think about [3930] it that was a lot uh we now have an [3933] example of an input that we're going to [3935] provide then we have an example of an [3937] output which is a tight script which you [3938] know I actually like we we created [3940] before so I'm just feeding in something [3941] like I've actually said before and then [3944] we're going to feed in the actual data [3945] and then we're going to try and have it [3946] do something similar make sense I sure [3949] hope so so the unfortunate thing is [3952] because I'm pinning all this data we're [3954] actually going to have to go and we're [3955] going to have to um redo it uh so why [3957] don't I just change the limit so that [3958] the max item is one but then we're [3960] getting the last items then I can just [3962] work my way through this whole thing so [3965] let's test the step it's okay we can [3967] overwrite the pin data cool so this is a [3969] different one humanizer prompt very [3973] cool test the [3975] step no put data returned because there [3977] are no entries in the sheet that have [3979] that we can out test the [3982] step now is going to add to our Google [3984] sheet if you think about it [3986] so I'm just going to go check out the [3987] Google sheet as it gets added very cool [3991] this one looks pretty short at all [3992] things considered we're then going to [3993] download the Json video [3997] URL cool um we're then going to go to [4000] transcribe video test this puppy it's [4003] going to pump that through whisper [4004] whisper is then going to generate a [4006] transcript just like I did before [4008] beautiful o very [4009] cool uh it doesn't look like it got chat [4011] GPT though then we're going to filter [4014] and generate the suggestions that's okay [4015] you can unpin and test this is going to [4018] take a little bit longer because we're [4019] feeding you know fair amount of text and [4020] it's not just like what we were doing [4022] before chat [4024] PT chat PT doesn't know what chat GPT is [4028] it is not self-aware yet then um we will [4031] test this step on [4034] perplexity I'm I love doing this one by [4036] one because if you do all of this one by [4037] one you eliminate the possibility for [4039] many errors you basically hone in on [4042] where the error is if there does end up [4043] being an error okay great and now we [4045] have [4048] uh why is this still oh I think I hard [4050] cuted this in didn't [4052] I oh uh [4056] yeah let's [4058] do oh that's actually going to kind of [4060] suck man chat gbt humanizer [4062] prompt ah man this is such a shitty [4065] crappy example Sor I'm trying not to [4066] swear why don't I just like um pin this [4069] output and pretended something else okay [4074] um chat [4079] GPT chat uh no no no no chat [4085] GPT and what I'm going to say is um [4090] fool [4098] humanizer okay um the tool is just going [4102] to be called humanizer [4108] then we need to provide some context [4110] actually when I filter and generate [4111] suggestions we need to do one more [4117] thing search [4120] term a short search [4123] term we use to look [4127] up search prompt a short search prompt [4131] we'll use to look up [4133] the look up the the service write it [4138] like [4140] um [4141] tool [4146] name [4155] the type of [4157] tool okay I mean that's not perfect but [4160] now when we test this we're going to [4161] overwrite the output but it's also going [4163] to have a tool a search prompt parameter [4166] which I should be able just to slot into [4170] perplexity chaty chaty that's so funny [4174] that sucks man it's not supposed to be [4176] chaty [4180] PT anyway humanizer [4182] [Music] [4185] AI [4190] um Cutting Edge series of prompts that [4193] improves [4195] let's see Cutting Edge series of prompts [4196] that improves [4199] um AI output generation okay cool now [4202] I'm going to save and pin this awesome [4204] so I shouldn't be able to search [4206] perplexity using if you think about [4210] it [4211] this so I can go [4214] expression tell me three interesting or [4216] peculiar things about search [4219] prompt which is going to say humanize a [4223] cutting at series of prompts that [4224] improves that improve AI output [4225] generation cool we're now going to [4228] search [4230] perplexity they can't find anything [4232] it'll just say I'm sorry I can't find [4233] anything so we've sort of like built [4235] that in [4238] right meta prompting techniques very [4240] cool very cool awesome and then now [4242] we're going to write a new script on [4243] this with all of the stuff we had before [4246] including the [4247] example oh man I just hate that it's [4249] chat [4250] PT that sucks it really undermines my [4253] example here uh I should change it from [4257] chat GPT to chat chat GPT chat GPT chat [4263] GPT chat GPT cool there you [4267] go now when I search this uh I don't [4270] actually think I need to do I now I'm [4272] going to search [4275] this oh geez did I feed it in as an [4277] input like way back here filter and [4280] generate [4281] suggestions tools with chat gbt [4288] this look pretty [4290] good from what I remember [4293] anyway if we pin this now and we write [4295] the new script is it really going like [4297] where is it going to get the chat chat [4299] CH PT from if I go to filter and [4303] generate suggestions [4305] okay tool names rough draft [4308] script perplexity output stepbystep [4311] guide I think it's probably stepbystep [4312] guide right [4315] no I don't think [4320] so anyway I don't know where the chat [4322] she PT is coming from it's saying that [4324] I'm feing in chaty PT so instead of me [4328] yeah like I'm not going to worry too [4329] much about it looks like it's um hey [4331] tired of hey are you tired of chat GPT [4333] sounding like a robot you can transform [4335] it into a conversational champ with this [4337] humanizer prompt it's just 16 lines add [4339] it before any prompt and watch your [4340] attacks go from dull to Dynamic here's a [4342] quick example before using it and then [4343] after huge difference right this prom [4345] can at storytelling sprinkle in some [4346] humor and make your content truly shine [4348] want to try it out just comment chat GPT [4350] and I'll send it straight to your [4352] DMs the CH chpt is obviously the error [4356] here um I don't like I really don't like [4359] the way that it's laid out [4362] so we need to add some new lines so I'm [4364] just going to have [4370] rule um add new lines as back sln [4376] between [4384] sentences let's take this out and the [4386] script called action no FRS bre [4389] straightforward and [4392] serious maybe not serious be [4396] straightforward and don't [4399] use [4403] um what would you call convers ational [4406] champ just don't use poetic language [4408] let's say then over here I wanted [4414] to reduce the output Randomness to [4419] 0.7 let's see if chat [4422] chpt tired of chat GPT sounding like a [4424] robot try this 16 line humanizer prompt [4427] just paste it before any prompt and [4428] watch your content transform into [4429] something more natural and engaging [4431] that's pretty good yeah that sounds a [4432] lot more reasonable cool all right so [4434] the last thing that we need if you think [4436] about it so we just have to update the [4439] record so how am I going to update the [4441] record easy for all of the entries that [4443] come in right which in our case is just [4445] going to be one item this time um I'm [4447] just going to go add entries and then [4449] instead of a [4450] pendro we're going to want to update the [4453] row the column that we're going to match [4455] is going to be ID and then if you think [4457] about it we got to go back and we have [4459] to find the data that we just added so [4462] the data that we added is going to be [4464] under add entries right so I'm going to [4466] go here go ID awesome so now for all the [4471] other information we don't actually want [4472] to update it so let's get rid of all [4474] this stuff the only thing we want to [4477] update is we want to update um scraped [4481] transcript and then new transcript which [4485] was over here scraped [4489] transcript is going to [4493] be um [4496] right over here uh nope sorry right over [4499] here then new [4502] transcript which I just deleted because [4504] I'm a silly [4507] man is going to be all the way up here [4511] and it's going to be this script right [4512] here okay all right let's give this a [4516] test beautiful if I go back here voila [4521] we now have the scraped and the new [4522] transcript beautiful [4525] Okay cool so now if you think about it [4527] logically all I have to do is I just [4529] have to go and I have to find a bunch of [4530] people in various domains and niches add [4532] them to the input at the very beginning [4535] of my flow which is all the way over [4538] here um feed them in over here under [4541] username then the results limit I'm [4543] probably just going to make it five per [4544] person and then in terms of how I'm [4546] going to do this the last thing I'm [4547] going to do is I'm just going to change [4548] a trigger and I'll just do um on a [4551] schedule so I'm just going to do once [4553] per day I'm going to trigger it at just [4555] do 6 a.m. feed that in as my input then [4559] obviously I need to like unpin [4560] everything and so on and so forth so [4562] that looks pretty good to me yeah I'm [4563] going to save this for you guys so if [4565] you guys want to try this out on your [4566] own if you guys want to try doing the [4568] exact same thing with me for instance [4569] feel free um but this is more or less uh [4572] this is more or less exactly the system [4574] that I wanted to build we ran into a [4576] couple stumbling blocks but I I think we [4577] figured it out and yeah I also hope that [4579] you guys appreciated seeing what some of [4581] these detours and dead ends look like [4582] what some of my thought processes behind [4584] building nadn work flows look like um [4586] and so on and so forth so just to make [4588] sure this works we're just going to [4589] unpin right you know you don't want to [4591] be using pin data to actually run it um [4594] and then what I'm going to do is I'm [4595] actually just going to I'm going to run [4596] this whole thing including getting um [4598] actors getting actor information [4601] rather go two Max [4604] items go back here and then I'm just [4607] going to delete all of this so it can [4609] actually run a [4610] new and then once this is done I will [4614] download set blue print oh let's just [4616] change this so it says update entries I [4618] will download said blueprint and I will [4620] give it to all of [4623] you so first step is we need to [4626] obviously run the actor synchronously [4627] that's what's going on here we are [4629] pulling apify as we were before it's now [4632] starting a crawler as we see last time [4635] it took us about 20 seconds or so to get [4637] the information so it'll probably be [4638] taking someone similar post scraper [4641] finished so looks like we got the data [4645] it's now adding the entries to the sheet [4646] so we just added two for each we're [4648] downloading [4649] them for each we're also transcribing [4651] the [4653] video we are [4656] now filtering and generating [4659] suggestions now we're going to do two [4661] API calls to [4663] perplexity then we're going to do [4665] another two API calls to open AI where [4668] we're going to rewrite the [4670] scripts and then finally the last thing [4672] we're going to do is we're going to [4673] update the entries in our database if I [4675] go back here you'll see that we've now [4676] added two new [4678] rows we have both of the scraped [4682] transcripts and we have the new [4684] transcript up the top check out this new [4685] aex speech generator it's just as good [4687] as 11 last but it's free blah and we [4689] also have this down here um now make.com [4692] it's saying make.com for me just because [4694] I said hey I used make.com make.com is [4696] awesome so obviously when you feed in [4698] your own data source in your own [4700] specifications you know because it's not [4701] going to just be an automation guy [4703] talking about automation stuff it's [4704] gonna be this new painting tool is [4706] enabled us to make amazing art or [4708] something or this new video AI tool is [4710] what we're using as part of our editing [4711] workflow right um we can combine all of [4713] that funnel it into my AI automation [4715] agency Channel um and then I'll have [4718] basically like non-stop content which [4719] I'm pretty excited about so hope you [4722] guys enjoyed and saw what the real build [4723] process behind systems like this look [4725] like um I'm not selling this particular [4727] system although I want you guys to know [4728] that you totally could as you see it [4730] took me less than an hour and a half to [4731] set this up start to finish um I think I [4734] you know I'm going to do like one cut in [4735] this video it's going to be like 30 [4737] seconds while I figure out a prompt or [4738] something so realistically it you know [4741] it legitimately uh we put it together in [4743] under an hour and 20 minutes uh this is [4745] something you could absolutely sell for [4747] a fair amount of money to any quickly [4748] growing Channel I don't know exactly how [4749] much and I don't really know what sort [4750] of maintenance fee but I would certainly [4753] uh have been willing assuming that I'm [4754] not as technically competent as I am to [4755] probably pay three four $5,000 just to [4758] have this problem solved for me never [4759] have to worry about it again um there [4761] might be some people out there that are [4762] willing to pay more honestly so wherever [4764] you are using this for yourself using [4766] this for a client considering building [4767] it and productizing and selling it as a [4769] service uh I hope that you have [4771] everything you need now to make it work [4773] please leave comments down below with [4774] suggestions for future videos I Source a [4776] lot of these ideas from you guys at this [4777] point and I really like making anend [4779] content that you know cils to your guys' [4781] interest and if you could do me a big [4783] solid like subscribe do all that fun [4784] stuff that bumps up to the top of the [4785] algo I'll catch you on the next video [4787] see you

Title: The 9 Best Ways to Scrape Any Website in N8N
[0] hey Nick here today I'm going to show [1] you the nine best ways to scrape any [3] website in nadn you're going to be able [5] to scrape static sites Dynamic sites [7] JavaScript social media whatever the [9] heck you want by the end of the video [10] you'll know how to do it I scaled my [12] automation agency to 72k a month using [14] no code tools like make and nadn and [16] scraping was a big part of that so this [18] video is just going to give you all the [18] sauce you're going to learn everything [19] you need to scrape websites like that on [21] your own let's get into it all right I'm [23] going to jump into NN in a minute and [24] actually build these alongside you and [25] one other thing I'm going to do is I'm [26] actually going to sign up to all the [27] services in front of you walk you [29] through the Authentication and the [30] onboarding flows and get your API keys [32] and stuff like that but just before I do [34] want to explain very quickly the [36] difference between a static site and [38] then a dynamic site because if you don't [40] know this um scraping just gets a lot [42] harder and so we're just going to cover [43] this in like 30 seconds and we can move [45] on so basically um if this is you okay [47] you're just this wonderful smiley person [50] and you want to access a static website [52] what you're doing is you're sending a [54] request over basically to just like some [56] document you know think about this as [58] just like a piece of paper on a cupboard [59] and there's a bunch of text on this [61] piece of paper and what you do is you [62] say hey can I have this piece of paper [64] and then the piece of paper just comes [66] back to you with all of the information [67] inside of the piece of paper okay this [69] is a very simplified version of what's [71] actually going on but static sites are [73] by far the easiest thing to scrape and [75] so um this is where you know a lot of [77] people think all websites are are at and [80] then they kind of confuse it with this [81] next step which is dynamic a dynamic [83] site essentially is not like that at all [86] basically what you're doing is you're [87] sending a request to a piece of paper [90] but the piece of paper has nothing on it [92] okay what happens is this piece of paper [94] then sends a request to some other dude [96] which I guess in this case is just a [97] server really who will then he has a [100] trusty pen in his hand and he'll [101] actually write all of the stuff on said [104] piece of paper and then you'll get the [106] piece of paper back so um there's [108] actually that intermediate step okay [110] where basically you are pinging some [111] sort of uh you know domain name or [113] whatever then that domain name shoots [115] some code over forces a server to [117] generate all of the contents on that [118] domain and then you get it [120] this is obviously kind of a two-step [122] process and then this is a three-step [124] process so if you just understand that [128] um you know when you scrape a dynamic [129] resource what you're really doing is [130] you're sending a request to a page which [132] sends a request back to another server [134] which then fills your thing this element [136] eliminates 99% of the confusion because [138] most of the time like scraping issues [139] are hey I just ping this page but I got [141] nothing back you know the HTTP request [143] or or or whatever I I sent you know it [146] was fine but for some weird reason [147] there's nothing on this page of of any [149] substance well if that was the case for [151] you it was most likely um because this [152] was empty before you sent it over um [155] whereas you know simple scraped static [157] resources tend to just like give you [158] what you want really quickly and it's [159] really easy all right so hopefully we at [162] least understand that there's that [163] difference between static and dynamic [164] sites here um I'm not going to go into [166] it more than that we're actually just [167] going to dive in with both feet start [169] doing a little bit of scraping and then [170] we'll kind of see where we land I find [171] the best way to do this stuff is just by [173] example and and you know being practical [174] about it so the first major way to [177] scrape websites in NN is using direct h [179] HTTP requests this is also what I like [182] to think of as the Magic in scraping [185] itself what we're going to do is we're [187] going to use a node called the HTTP [188] request node to send a get request to [190] the website we want this is going to [192] work with static websites and non [194] JavaScript resources so let me give you [196] guys a website that I'm going to be [197] scraping here this is my own site it's [199] called left click I'm about to do a [200] redesign um but this is a static [202] resource I know this because I built the [204] site you know I I did it in code and [206] basically all this is is just a document [207] somewhere on my or on on a server some [209] more so what I'm going to want to do is [211] and I'm just going to pretend that I [212] haven't done any of this so uh we're [214] just going to go HTTP [217] request HTTP request node looks like [219] this we have a method field a URL field [222] authentication field query parameters [224] headers body and then some options down [226] here as well all I'm going to do is I'm [228] just going to paste in the website that [230] I want to visit okay then I'm just going [232] to test the step it's that easy now the [235] response from this on the right hand [236] side see all this code over here this is [239] what's called HTML if you're unfamiliar [241] and HTML is basically just the like it's [244] it's the code behind the site so if I [247] were to zoom in over here you see where [249] it says I don't know let's let's go to [250] my website let's just find a little bit [251] of little bit of texture build hands off [254] growth systems okay if I just command F [257] and paste this in we actually have that [259] text buried somewhere in this big long [261] HTML string right so all that this HTML [265] is is this is the code that is sent to [268] my browser which is Google Chrome in [270] this case then my browser takes the code [272] and it just renders it into this [274] beautiful looking thing well beautiful [275] is a subjective State I would say but [278] this uh wonderful looking thing in front [279] of us which is this website with like [281] sizing and the tabs and the divs and all [284] that fun stuff okay so basically what [287] I'm trying to say is everything over [288] here on the right hand side this is the [290] entire site we can do anything we want [292] with this information um and we can [294] carry this information forward to to do [296] any one of our any one of many flows so [299] in my case right looking at a bunch of [300] code isn't really very pretty so one big [302] thing that you'll find in the vast [303] majority of modern um scraping [305] applications is you'll find that they'll [306] take that HTML which we saw earlier and [308] they'll convert it to something called [309] markdown okay so um this is a markdown [313] node we have a mode of HTML to markdown [316] and all I'm going to do is I'm going to [318] grab that data and I'm going stick it in [320] the HTML section of the HTML to markdown [322] converter what do you think is going to [324] happen when I test this well we're going [325] to convert this from this big long ugly [327] super dense uh thing with a much these [330] like greater than and less than symbols [331] and we're just going to convert it into [333] something a little bit shorter a little [334] bit simpler This Is Us just manipulating [336] file formats by the way and I find that [338] manipulating file formats is a big part [339] of what makes a good scraper a good [341] scraper so now we have something in [343] what's called markdown format what's the [345] value there well markdown format does [346] two things for us one it's much easier [348] to parse parse just means we can extract [350] different sections of the text we want [352] we can structure it in some sort of [354] other data format um and then in my case [356] because I love using AI for everything [358] it's much easier and shorter for us to [360] use with AI so I'm going to give you [361] guys a very simple example where we take [363] this text from the static resource and [365] then we just use um AI to tell us [368] something about it so I'll go down to [369] open Ai and then what I'm going to do is [371] I'll do the message a model just have to [374] connect my credential here I'm assuming [376] that you've already connected a [376] credential if not you're going to have [378] to go to opena website when you do the [380] connection um and grab your API key and [382] paste it in there's some instructions [384] that allow you to do so right over [386] here uh what I'm going to do is I'm [388] going to grab the G PT 40 Mini model [391] that's just the uh I want to say most [393] cost effective one as of the time of [394] this recording and then what I'm going [396] to do is I'm going to add three prompt [397] I'm going to add a system prompt first [399] I'll say you are a helpful intelligent [402] web scraping [403] assistant then I'm going to add a user [406] prompt and I'll say your task is to take [408] the [409] raw [411] markdown of a website and convert it [414] into structured data use the following [417] format and then I'm going to give it an [419] example of what I want in what's called [420] Json JavaScript object notation format [422] so the very first thing I'm going to do [424] is I'm going to have it just pull out [425] all the links on the website because I [427] find that that's a very common scraping [428] application so I go links and then I'm [430] just going to show an example of un [433] array of we'll go absolute URLs this is [439] very important that they're absolute [440] URLs any thing that we're going to build [442] after this is going to be making use of [443] the absolute URLs not the relative URLs [445] if you're unfamiliar with what that [446] means if we Zoom way in here you see how [448] there's this B uh SL left click log.png [451] this is what's called a relative URL if [453] you were to copy this and paste this [455] into here this wouldn't actually do [457] anything for us right uh what we what we [459] want is we want this instead we want [461] left click aka the root of the domain [463] and then um left click _ logogram and [466] that's how we get to the actual file [467] asset so uh if we go back over [470] here so if we go back over here um yeah [473] you know basically we want a link array [476] of absolute URLs and then I'm just going [478] to want main text website copy this is [482] going to be a long string containing all [485] of the website [486] copy containing just the text of the [489] site no [491] formatting and then why don't we do one [493] more thing why don't we have like a [496] summarized or summary let's do one line [499] summary just to show you guys you can [501] also use AI to do other cool stuff you [503] could take this oneline summary and feed [505] it into some big sequence you could have [506] ai write an icebreaker for an email you [509] could do a things with this but I'll say [510] on line summary um brief summarization [514] of what the site is and [517] how what the site is about let's do that [522] okay so this is our example I'm going to [525] say your website URL [528] is left click URL for the relative to [533] Absolute [534] conversions is left click. and then the [536] final thing is I'm going to add one more [538] user prompt I'm just going to draw drag [539] all of that markdown data in here then [541] I'm going to click output content as [543] Json I'm going to test the step I'm [546] going to take a sip of my coffee while [547] this puppy processes and we now have our [549] output on the right hand side if we go [551] to schema view what you can see is we've [554] now [555] generated basically an array of links on [557] the rightand side which contains every [559] link on this website very cool looks [561] like the vast majority of these are type [563] form links for some reason don't really [564] know what's about that oh right it's [566] because that's basically the only thing [567] on my website it's just a one P with a [569] bunch of different links to time for [571] that's funny um anyway you could [573] obviously just get it to Output one link [575] or tell it like make sure all the links [576] are unique or something um and then we [578] have a big chunk of plain text website [580] copy right then we have a oneline [581] summary of the site so this is a very [584] simple example of scraping we're [586] scraping a static resource obviously but [588] when I build scrapers for clients or for [590] my own business this is always my first [592] pass I will always just make a basic [594] HTTP request to the resource that I'm [596] looking at because if I can make that [598] http request work whether it's a get [600] request or whatever the the the rest of [603] my life building scraper building the [605] scraper is so easy I just take the data [608] I process it usually using AI or some [609] very cheap Tok cheap per token thing and [612] then voila you know like we've basically [614] built out a scraper in this case and [615] it's only taken us what three nodes [617] right so that's number one the second [619] way to scrape websites in NN is using a [621] third party service called fir crawl and [622] making an HTTP request to it I'm using [625] something called their extract endpoint [627] but just to make a long story short fire [629] craw is a very simple but High uh [632] bandwidth service that turns websites [635] into large language model ready data and [637] basically you know how earlier we had to [638] do HTTP request and then we had to [640] convert all that stuff into markdown and [641] then we had to you know manipulate that [643] markdown what this does is it just does [645] a lot of that stuff for you it'll [646] actually allow you to go scrape and then [648] it will automatically convert text into [649] markdown for you um so that you can do [652] whatever the heck you want they turn it [653] into structure data using Ai and and so [654] on and so on and so forth so if I were [656] to do the same thing that I just did [658] earlier [659] with my own [660] website then I were to you know run an [662] example of this what it would go do is [665] it would basically spin up a server for [667] me and that would actually go and [668] generate markdown of the same format um [670] the only difference here is it's [671] actually generated new lines between [673] sections of text how beautiful um and [675] then now you know we have basically the [677] same thing you also get it in Json which [679] is pretty cool um and you know you can [680] slot this into any workflow this is [682] basically like the simple and easy way [683] of getting started um what we're going [686] to be showing you today is the extract [688] endpoint which allows you to extract [690] data just using a natural language [692] prompt which is pretty cool and from [694] here we're going to be able to take any [695] URL and just turn it into structure data [697] but we're not actually going to have to [697] know how to parse we're not going to [698] have to know any code we're not going to [699] have to know any of that stuff so let me [701] actually run through the signup process [702] with you guys go to fire. Dev here just [707] going to open this up in an incognito to [708] show you guys what this looks like all [709] you do is you just go sign up I'm going [713] to add a password we're then going to [715] have to validate this one [718] oh guess these guys are Mega [721] secure so now I'm going to go back to my [723] email [724] address I'm going to count this up and [729] we have a call back here I just need to [730] paste this URL and put it in here that's [732] just because I you know I'm doing this [734] in an incognito tab normally when you do [736] this you're not going to have that step [737] okay great now we're inside a fir craw [740] they give you I think something like 500 [742] um free credits something of that nature [744] anyway so what I'm going to do is I'm [746] going to go through and just like give [748] give this extracting point just a basic [750] natural language query so um let's go [754] from the homepage at left [757] click. I want to [760] extract a oneline summary of the website [765] let's do all of the text on the [770] website all of the copy on the website [773] in plain text let's do a oneline summary [776] of the website a oneline Icebreaker I [778] can use as the first line of of an of a [781] cold email to the [785] owner and uh the company name and a list [791] of the services they provide let's do [794] that this is a lot of requests we're [797] asking it to do like seven or eight [799] things but all I need to do in order to [801] make this work is I click generate [802] parameters it's going to basically now [804] generate me a big object with a bunch of [806] things so copy summary Icebreaker [808] company name and now I can actually go [810] and I can run this okay this is the URL [813] it just parsed as well let's give it a [815] run what it's doing now is it's scraping [818] the pages using their high throughput [819] server I just love this thing like I'm [822] not sponsored by fire crawl or anything [823] like that but I love their uh I don't [825] know I just love the design I love this [827] little like burning Ember or whatever [829] the heck you want to call it I love how [831] simple they've tried to make everything [832] it's it's great honestly okay awesome [835] and now you guys see we have basically a [837] big array with a bunch of sub objects we [840] have a summary like I asked for a list [842] of services looks like we even have [844] links to the specific places oh okay [846] links from the resource we have an [848] icebreaker and then we have the company [850] name as well so we can do a lot with [851] this right but right now this is just um [853] this is just on on a website how do we [854] actually bring this in naden uh well [856] it's pretty simple as you see there's an [857] integrate Now button you can either get [859] code or you can use it in zap here [861] basically what we're going to want to do [862] is we're going to want to run a request [864] to um their endpoint and then we're [866] going to want to turn that into [869] basically our HTTP request let me show [870] you what that looks like I'm just going [873] to do all of this stuff in curl so if we [875] go to curl as you can see what we need [878] to do is we need to format a request [880] that looks something like this but we [881] need to make sure it's using the extract [883] endpoint okay so I'm going to go down to [885] extract and then now I have this big [887] long beautiful string what I'm going to [890] do is I'm going to copy [891] this I'm going to go back to my NN [895] instance which is right over here and [896] then what I need to do is just open up [898] an HTTP request module and then click [899] import curl just paste all the stuff [901] inside now this is an example request [903] but that's okay we can actually use that [904] example request to very quickly and [905] easily format our our real request okay [908] so we're sending a bunch of headers this [909] is the endpoint that we're calling api. [911] fire. dv1 extract so basically what [914] we're doing now is we're like we're [915] sending a request to fir craw which will [916] then send a request to the website right [918] so kind of a kind of a middleman and [920] then all I'm going to do so if I go back [922] to my example we have an API key here [924] which we're going to need so I'm going [925] to go here and then paste in an API key [928] so that's how that work works right [929] authorization is going to be the name [930] value is going to be bear with a capital [932] b space and then the API key and then we [935] also have a body that we need to uh [937] adjust or edit and this body is where [939] we're going to put the links that we [940] want to actually have scraped with the [941] extract end point so what I'm going to [944] do is I'm going to delete most of these [946] I'll go back to my left click. a just [948] like this the prompts um because you [950] know I was just using their playground [951] before we're actually going to need to [952] convert this into a request for my [956] service so I'm just going to paste The [957] Prompt in here voila [959] and now we need to put together what's [960] called a schema where we have the [962] objects that we asked for so in my case [964] we asked for copy right so I'm going to [966] go Copy Type string then summary so [969] we're going to go summary type string [972] then Icebreaker it's going to be [974] Icebreaker type string then guess what [976] we have last but not least company name [978] which is going to be type string we're [981] also going to want to make these fields [982] required like uh you know you can set it [984] up so they're not actually required when [985] you do a request a fire call I'm I'm [987] going to make it so they're required so [988] I'll go copy [989] summary Icebreaker and then company name [992] actually you know what maybe I'll leave [994] company name as unrequired if you think [996] about it logically maybe not all the [998] websites we're going to be scraping [999] using this service are going to have the [1000] company names visible on the website I [1002] don't know but maybe so maybe I'll [1004] actually leave that as off okay great so [1006] now we have the API request formatted [1008] correctly um all we need to do at this [1010] point is just click test step it looks [1012] like we're getting a Json breaking um [1015] error and I think that's because I have [1016] this last comma and I'm just going to [1018] check to see if there are any commas in [1019] Jason you can't actually have the last [1020] element in an array have a comma on it [1023] so I think that's okay let me test it [1025] again all right so as you can see we [1026] just received an ID we've got a success [1028] and then we have a URL Trace array which [1030] is empty um if you think about this [1032] logically we don't actually get all the [1034] data that we send immediately because we [1036] need fir crawl to whip up the scraper [1038] you know do things to the data we could [1040] be feeding in 50 URLs here right so [1042] instead of just having the data [1043] available to us right now immediately [1045] what we need to do is we need to [1045] basically wait a little while wait until [1047] it's done and we need to Ping it and the [1049] reason why they've given us this ID [1051] parameter so that we could do the [1052] pinging so the way that you do this is [1054] you'd have to send a second HTTP [1056] request using this [1058] structure so the good news is we could [1061] just copy this [1062] over and then we can [1065] add a second um HTTP request I don't [1069] know where that went but I guess I'm [1070] just going to create it over here I'm [1073] going to import the curl to this request [1075] just like [1076] that then keep in mind that we just need [1078] to add our API key again because the [1080] previous node had it but this one [1081] doesn't so just going to go over here [1083] I'm going to copy this [1085] puppy go back over here I'm going to [1088] paste this in now technically what this [1090] is called is this is called polling um [1092] polling uh is where you know you're [1095] you're you're attempting to request a [1097] resource that you don't know whether or [1098] not is ready and there's a fair amount [1100] of logic that I'd recommend like putting [1102] into a polling flow where like when you [1104] try it and if it doesn't work basically [1105] you wait a certain amount of time and [1106] you retry again for the purpose of this [1108] video I'm not going to put all that [1109] stuff inside but um what I'm going to do [1111] is just set up this request I'm going to [1113] give this puppy a test let's just feed [1116] that in on the back end we got to put [1117] the extract ID right right over here [1120] where it said extract ID then I'm just [1121] going to give this a test uh looks like [1124] I've issued a malformed request we just [1126] have to make sure that everything here [1128] is okay specify body let me just make [1130] sure there's nothing else in here it was [1131] a get request this is a get cool we're [1134] not going to send a body [1136] then awesome and now we have all of the [1138] data available to us automate your [1141] business in the copy field summary field [1142] left clicks an ad performance [1144] optimization agency Icebreaker hi Nick I [1146] came across left click I'm impressed by [1147] you help B2B Founders scale their [1148] business automation keep in mind I never [1151] gave it my name it went it found my name [1152] on the website uh and then company name [1154] left click so quick and easy way uh [1157] you're going to have access to this [1158] template obviously without my API key in [1159] it um and feel free to you know use fir [1161] craw go nuts check out their [1162] documentation build out as complex a [1164] scraping flow as need be the third way [1165] to scrape websites in nadn is using [1168] rapid API for those of you that are [1169] unfamiliar rapid API is basically a [1171] giant Marketplace of third party [1173] scrapers similar to appify which I'll [1174] cover in a moment but instead of looking [1176] for um you know building out your own [1178] scraper for a resource let's say you're [1180] wanting to scrape Instagram or something [1181] that's not a simple static site what you [1183] can do is you could just get a scraper [1184] that somebody's already developed that [1186] does specifically that using proxies and [1188] all that tough stuff that I tend to [1190] abstract away um and then you just [1192] request uh to Rapid API which [1195] automatically handles the API request to [1196] the other thing that they want and then [1197] they format it and send it all back to [1199] and then you know you have beautiful um [1201] data that you could use for basically [1202] anything so this is what rapid API looks [1204] like it's basically a big Marketplace I [1205] just pumped in a search for website over [1208] here and we see 2,97 results to give you [1211] guys some context you can do everything [1212] from you know scraping social data like [1215] emails phone numbers and stuff like that [1217] from a website you could ping the ah [1219] refs SEO API you could find uh I don't [1223] know like unofficial medium data that [1225] they don't necessarily allow people to [1226] do so this is just a quick and easy way [1228] to I guess do a first pass after you've [1231] run through fir crawl maybe that doesn't [1232] work after you've run through HTTP [1233] request that doesn't work um just do a [1235] first pass look for something that [1236] scrapes the exact resource you're [1237] looking for and then take it from there [1239] so obviously for the purpose of this I'm [1240] just going to use the website to scraper [1241] API which is sort of just like a wrapper [1244] around what we're doing right now in [1245] nadn um but this website scraper API [1248] allows you to scrape some more Dynamic [1249] data um now I'm not signed up to this so [1251] I'm going to have to go through the [1252] signup process and I'm going to show you [1253] guys what that looks like um but yeah [1255] we're going to we're going to run [1255] through an API request to Rapid API [1257] which is going to make this a lot easier [1260] just going to put in all of my [1262] information [1264] here and then I'm going to do the [1267] classic email verification okay just [1271] copy this puppy over no thank you rise I [1273] use a time management app called rise [1276] and every time I go on my Gmail I set my [1278] Gmail up as like a definitely do [1282] not uh do during your workday let's just [1285] call it personal projects they don't ask [1286] me all these questions my goal today is [1288] to browse available apis awesome so [1291] that's their onboarding I think we're [1292] going to have to like pay a little bit [1293] of money or something like that which [1294] I'll sort out in a moment um but the [1296] scraper that I want is I just want the [1297] website one right so I'm going to type [1298] website in [1299] here uh I'm going to look [1302] for wherever it was earlier website [1304] scraper API and now check this out what [1307] we have is we have the app which is the [1309] name of the specific API that we're [1311] requesting we have an x-raid api-key and [1315] this is the API key we're going to use [1316] to make the request then we have the [1318] request URL which is basically what [1320] we're pinging and what we can do here is [1321] we can feed in the parameters okay what [1323] website we want to we want to scrape and [1325] then we can actually just like give it [1326] give it a run so I'm going to have to [1328] subscribe to this in order to test it uh [1330] I'm just going to go to the um basic [1332] plan and I'm going to pay money per [1334] month that probably seems the simplest [1335] way to do so okay and I just ran through [1337] the payment let's actually head over [1338] here and let's just run a test using my [1340] website URL we're going to test this [1342] endpoint now and now this actually going [1344] to go through Rapid API it's going to [1345] spin up the server and then it's going [1347] to send it and what we see here is we [1349] have multiple fields that Rapid apis or [1351] this particular scraper gives us let me [1352] just make this easier for you all to see [1354] we have a text content field with all of [1355] the content of the website which is cool [1357] this is basically what I did earlier um [1359] but instead of me having to formulate [1360] this request try and parse it and try [1362] and use AI tokens what I did is I sent [1363] the request to uh rapid API and did it [1365] all for me then we also have an HTML [1367] content [1368] field I think we have one more here [1371] scroll all the way down to the bottom as [1373] you can see there is a ton of HTML um [1375] and then we also have a list of all of [1376] the images on the website which is very [1378] very cool and easily formatted again [1380] something that I tried to do manually [1381] using AI but now you know we have [1383] everything in that nice absolute URL [1384] format um and then if they find any [1386] social media links I don't believe um [1389] there were more than Twitter but um if [1391] they find anything that's at their [1392] Twitter Instagram whatever then we have [1394] the link right over here it looks like [1395] they even give you the scraping time and [1397] if they scrape emails or phone numbers [1398] um they'll be there as well so I mean [1400] rapid AP is obviously fantastic this is [1401] a high throughput sort of thing and why [1403] don't we actually run through what this [1405] would look like if we were to run a curl [1406] request you see how it's automatically [1409] just formatting it as curl well that [1410] just means we just jump back here [1412] connect this to my HTTP request module [1415] click import curl paste it in like this [1418] import and it's actually going to go [1419] through and it's going to automatically [1421] map all these fields for me right query [1423] parameter URL left click. beautiful um [1425] API key x-raid API host here's the host [1429] here's the name of the API key here's [1431] everything we need well I can actually [1432] just recreate this request now inside of [1434] NN as opposed to being on rapid API and [1437] then I have all the data accessible to [1438] me here how cool is that so we can do [1441] this for any any major website really um [1443] you know there are a lot of specific [1446] bespoke scrapers obviously which um I [1447] don't know if you wanted to scrape uh [1449] let's go back to Discovery if you wanted [1451] to scrape like Instagram or something [1454] you could scrape um Instagram uh you [1456] could do like Facebook scraping you [1458] could scrape these large giants that are [1460] quite difficult to do So Meta ad Library [1462] Facebook ad scraper and depending on the [1464] plan that you're at it might be more [1465] cost- effective for you to sign up to [1467] some sort of monthly recurring thing [1468] rather than just pay two cents every [1469] single time you make one of these [1470] requests you just kind of got to do that [1472] determination yourself right like if [1473] you're scraping uh I don't know 50 every [1476] day or 100 every day or something might [1478] be a dollar or two a day which is [1479] reasonable but maybe if you want to [1481] scrape like 5,000 doing it the way that [1482] I was doing it a moment ago might might [1483] be infusible the next way to scrape [1485] websites in nadn is using the web [1487] scraper Chrome extension and then tying [1489] that to a cloud service that delivers [1491] the data that you just created using [1493] their no code tool um in nicely bundled [1495] formats it's called Cloud sync as of the [1497] time of this recording I think they [1498] changed the name a couple of times but [1500] um that's where we're at here is the [1502] name of the service web scraper here is [1505] their website essentially what happens [1507] is you install a little Chrome plugin [1508] which I'll show you guys how to do then [1510] you select the fields that you want [1511] scraped in various data formats and then [1514] what you do is it handles JavaScript [1516] sites Dynamic sites all that fun stuff [1519] and then you can um export that [1522] data as a cloud run to then send back [1528] sorry big sneeze to then send back to [1531] some API or some service um and then [1533] automatically do parsing and stuff like [1534] that so very cool I'm going to show you [1536] guys what that looks like um this is [1537] sort of a more customized way to build [1538] the stuff but I've seen a lot of people [1540] do this with naden um so we're going to [1542] run through what it looks like so first [1543] thing I'm going to want to do is I'm [1545] going to want to let's just go Cloud [1547] login or sorry um start free 7-Day trial [1551] as you can see you know there's a free [1552] browser extension here if you wanted to [1554] do uh I don't know like highs scale [1556] stuff you'd choose probably their [1558] project um endpoint where we Sorry [1561] project plan where we have 5,000 URL [1563] credits we can run a bunch of tasks in [1565] parallel we could scrape Dynamic sites [1567] JavaScript sites we have a bunch of [1568] different export options then we can [1569] also just connect it directly to all of [1571] these um what I'm going to do just [1572] because I want this to kind of work as a [1574] first go is I'm just going to sign up to [1575] a free Tri here beautiful just created [1577] my account just go left click give it a [1581] phone number we'll go left click. a [1584] we're going to go I don't know academic [1586] records needed per month we'll go 0 to [1588] th000 length of the project uh I don't [1590] know let's go two to 3 [1591] months okay great so now we can import [1594] and run our own site map or we can use a [1596] premade Community sit map um what I'm [1598] going to do is I'm just going to import [1599] this we're then going to get the Chrome [1601] extension web [1603] scraper let me add that extension and [1605] it's going to download it do all that [1607] fun stuff beautiful so now we have it [1610] right over here I'm just going to pin it [1612] to my browser to make my life easier go [1614] to left click. a open up this puppy now [1617] there's a bunch of like tutorials and [1618] how to use this stuff um that's not that [1619] big of a deal but basically the thing [1621] you need is you need to hold command [1623] plus option plus I to open up your [1624] developer tools and you'll just find it [1625] on the in my case the far right so [1627] command option I that'll open up Dev [1630] tools you see all the way on the right [1631] hand side here I have a couple other [1632] things like make and and cookie editor [1634] but all the way on the right hand side [1635] here we have this web scraper thing um [1638] so we got what you're going to want to [1639] do first you're going to want to create [1640] a site map for the resource that you're [1641] going to want to scrape I'm just going [1642] to call it left click and I just want to [1644] scrape left click. okay once we have our [1647] sitemap if I just give a quick little [1648] click I can then add a new selector and [1650] the really cool thing about this web [1652] scraper is um if I just zoom out a [1654] little bit here uh what you can do is [1655] you can you can select the elements on [1657] the website that you want scraped so for [1659] instance it's a very quick and easy way [1660] to do this if you think about it is like [1662] just to show you guys an example [1663] structure data is uh sort of like an [1665] e-commerce application let's say you [1666] have like the title of a product and you [1667] have like I don't know the the [1669] description of a product so on my [1670] website really quick and easy way to do [1671] this is let's just call this [1673] products and it's a type text what I'm [1676] going to do is I'm going to click select [1678] then I'll just click on this I'll click [1681] on this as well and as you see it'll [1683] automatically find all of the headings [1686] that I'm looking for so that's products [1689] we are going to then click data I'm [1690] going to click done selecting data [1692] preview as you can see it only selected [1694] one of them the very first so what we're [1695] going to want to do is go multiple and [1697] now if I data preview we get all of the [1699] headings which is very cool so now we [1701] have a basically like a list of headings [1703] um from here I'm going to save this [1705] selector I'm add a new one let's go [1707] product [1708] descriptions and then going to select [1711] this this it'll select all of them I'll [1714] go multiple data preview just to make [1716] sure that it looks good I'm getting no [1717] data extracted here oh sorry I didn't [1719] actually select the um didn't actually [1721] finish it now we're getting product [1722] descriptions that's pretty cool um this [1724] is me doing this sort of like one at a [1726] time you can also um group The selectors [1729] there you go it's actually um offered to [1731] group it for me so we can uh group this [1734] into one object with products and then [1736] product descriptions so it's automatic [1738] group it now we have wrapper for [1739] products and products descriptions then [1741] we have products and product [1742] descriptions buried underneath we could [1744] go as far as we want with this but [1745] basically what I'm what I'm trying to [1746] show you guys is very simple and easy [1748] just drag your mouse over the specific [1750] thing you want if you select more than [1752] one it'll automatically find all of them [1753] on the website which is really cool okay [1755] great once we have this um what I can do [1757] is I can actually go export sitemap so [1760] now I have all of the code on the [1761] website that actually goes and finds it [1763] for me then I can paste this in here [1766] I'll just call this left click scraper [1768] and I'm going to import this to my cloud [1771] scraper uh I think I'm running into oh [1774] sorry I don't think we can do a space [1776] there my bad just call it left click and [1778] now what we can do is we can actually [1779] just like run a server instance that [1781] goes out and then scrapes this for us [1782] okay so I'm going to click scrape it [1785] looks like I need to verify my email so [1787] just make sure you do that before you [1788] try and get ahead of yourself like I [1792] was okay looks like we just verified the [1794] email let's head back over here refresh [1797] then scrape we've now scheduled a [1799] scraping job for this sitemap scheduling [1802] you know in their lingo just means that [1803] it's now part of their big long queue of [1805] thousands of other things that they're [1806] probably scraping through their server [1807] and that's fine okay I just gave this a [1809] refresh and as we see we have now [1810] finished said scraping job we have all [1812] of the data available to us using their [1814] UI but now that we've gone through this [1816] process of you know building out this [1818] this thing um how do we actually take [1820] that and then use it in our nadn flows [1822] so variety of ways um if you wanted to [1824] connect this let's say to specific [1825] service like Dropbox um Google [1828] you know dump anow or something Google [1830] Drive I'd recommend just doing it [1831] directly through their integration it's [1832] just a lot easier to get the data there [1834] and then you can just connect it to n [1836] and watch the data as it comes in or [1837] something you can also use the web [1839] scraper API uh this is pretty neat [1842] because you can you know that's what [1843] we're going to end up using it was [1845] pretty neat because you can uh like [1847] schedule jobs you can send jobs you can [1848] do basically everything just through the [1850] NN interface and then we can just [1852] retrieve the data afterwards which is [1853] pretty neat um this is basically what [1855] you end up getting you end up with [1857] scraping job ID status sitemap all this [1859] fun stuff and then we can set like a web [1862] hook URL where we we receive the request [1865] so um let me check we need a scraping [1867] for testing you need a scraping job that [1869] has already been finished I think our [1870] scraping job has already been finished [1872] I'm just going to go htps uh back to my [1875] n8n flow I'm actually going to build an [1878] n8n web hook give that a click I'm not [1882] going to have any authentication let me [1884] just turn all this off basically what we [1886] want is we we want to use this as our [1887] test [1889] event we're going to go back to the [1892] API paste this in [1895] save and I'm just going to want to give [1896] it a test endpoint here so [1899] test looks like um the push notification [1902] was failed the reason why is because [1904] it's saying this web Hook is not [1905] registered for post request did you mean [1907] to make a get request beautiful thank [1908] you naden we absolutely did so I'm going [1910] to stop listening change your HTTP HTTP [1913] method here to post there's basically [1914] two ways to call a website and this is [1915] one of them I'm going to listen for test [1917] events go back here and then [1919] retest awesome looks like we've now [1921] triggered the beginning of our workflow [1923] using this data let's see what sort of [1925] information was in [1926] it okay great we have the scraping job [1929] ID the status execution [1931] mode okay great so we basically have [1933] everything we need now to set up a flow [1936] where we can schedule something in this [1937] web scraper service that maybe monitors [1939] some I don't know list of e-commerce [1941] product or something every 12 hours and [1943] then we can set up a web hook in NN that [1944] will catch the notification get the [1947] update now we can do is we can ping um [1950] we can ping the web scraping API which [1952] I'll show you to set up in a second to [1954] request the data from that particular [1955] scraping run and from here we can take [1958] that data do whatever the heck we want [1959] with it but obviously let me show you an [1961] example of what the the actual data [1962] looks like so we just got the data from [1964] web hook let's set up an HTTP request to [1968] their API now where we basically get the [1970] ID of the thing and then we can call uh [1973] we can call that back so got my API [1975] token over here I'm going head over to [1976] their API documentation first okay and [1979] then what we want to do is download [1980] these scrape data in CSV format at least [1983] in my case I imagine most of you guys [1984] are going to add this to a spreadsheet [1985] or whatever um you can very easily do [1988] whatever you want there's also a Json [1989] format endpoint here um but let's just [1992] do CSV for Simplicity so I've already [1994] gone ahead and I've gotten the method [1996] which was a get request so I've added [1998] that up here the URL was this over here [2001] with the scraping job ID and then your [2003] API token there so what I've done is [2005] I've grabbed the API token and the [2007] scraping job ID I mean I hardcoded it in [2008] here just while I was doing the testing [2010] let's actually make this Dynamic now [2013] drag the scraping job ID right over here [2016] voila and then the API token if you guys [2018] remember back here on the API page you [2021] have your access to API token so just [2022] copy that [2023] over uh great and now if I run this I'm [2027] actually selecting that specific job [2029] then from here we have all the data that [2030] we just scraped as you can see there's [2031] like a uh the way that CSV Works [2034] actually let me just copy this over here [2035] I just wanted to give this to you guys [2036] as an example of a different data type [2038] but maybe some people here aren't really [2040] familiar with it basically the way that [2041] it works is if I just paste this into [2042] like a Google sheet you see how it looks [2044] like this what what you can do is if you [2045] just um split the text to columns you [2048] kind of see [2049] how kind of see how there's like these [2051] four pettings there's web scraper order [2053] web scraper startup products and product [2055] descriptions right I'm imagine scraping [2057] this for some lead genen applica sorry [2059] some some e-commerce application list of [2061] products here product descriptions maybe [2063] product prices maybe product whatever [2064] the heck you want um so yeah you can you [2067] can put in like a number of formats and [2069] I just wanted to give you guys an [2069] example what that looks like the next [2071] way to scrape websites in naden is using [2073] appify if you guys are no strangers to [2075] this channel you know that I do appify [2077] all the time and I talk about them all [2078] the time because I think that they're [2079] just a great service um they've now [2081] given me a 30% discount where anybody [2084] can use it for I was initially under the [2086] impression it was lifetime I think it's [2087] three months so you probably get 30% off [2088] your first three months just check the [2090] um description if you want that but Cent [2092] how appify is is it is a Marketplace [2094] very similar to Rapid API um although [2096] extraordinarily well Main ained and they [2098] also have a ton of guides set up to help [2100] you get you know up and running with [2102] scraping any sort of application so just [2105] as we had earlier we have Instagram [2106] scrapers we have Tik Tok scrapers we [2109] have email scrapers we have map scrapers [2112] Google Maps we could do I don't know [2115] Twitter [2115] scrapers uh medium scrapers right [2118] basically any any service out there that [2122] has this Dynamic aspect to it that's not [2124] a simple HTTP request you can make you [2125] could scrape it using ampify and then [2127] obviously you you have things too like [2128] just like basic website crawlers you can [2130] generate screenshots of sites I mean [2132] there's just there's so many things let [2133] me walk you guys through what it looks [2135] like now in my case I'm not actually [2137] going to sign up to appify because I [2138] have like 400 accounts but trust me when [2140] I say it is a very easy and simple [2141] process you go to app ay.com you go get [2145] started you put in your email and your [2147] password they'll give you $5 in free [2150] platform credit you don't need any [2151] credit card and you can just get up and [2153] running and start using this for [2154] yourself super easily then the second [2156] that you have all that you'll be Creed [2157] with this screen it is a console screen [2160] don't be concerned when you see this um [2163] you know this is super simple and and [2165] easy and and not a big deal this is one [2166] of my free accounts um so I just wanted [2168] to show you guys what you can do with a [2169] free account uh but from here what you [2172] do is you go to the store and as you can [2173] see I'm just dark mode all this is the [2175] same thing we were just looking at [2176] before and then um we're just going to [2177] run a test on the thing that we want to [2179] scrape okay so what I'm going to want to [2181] do is for the purposes of this I'm now [2183] going to do something different from [2185] what I was doing before like which was [2186] just left click over and over and over I [2187] think that kind of gets boring what I'm [2189] going to do is I'm going to scrape [2190] Instagram posts okay so what I'm going [2192] to do is I'm going to feed in a name [2194] nickf this is just my um [2198] Instagram uh which almost hit 10K in God [2201] like 15 days or something like that but [2202] I'm going to feed in my Instagram here [2204] and then I'm just going to grab like I [2205] don't know the last 10 posts okay save [2208] and start this is now going to run an [2209] actor actor is just their term for [2211] scraper which will go out it'll extract [2214] data from my Nick surve Instagram and as [2217] you can see will get a ton of fields [2218] caption owner full name owner Instagram [2220] URL comments count first comment likes [2222] count timestamp query tag we get [2225] everything from these guys which is [2226] really cool this might take you know 30 [2228] 40 50 seconds we are spinning up a [2230] server in real time every time you do [2232] this as you see in bottom left hand [2233] corner there's a little memory tab which [2234] shows that we are legitimately running a [2236] server with one gigabyte of memory right [2238] now so generally my recommendation when [2239] you use appify is not to use it for [2241] oneoff requests like this feed in 5 to [2243] 10 15 20 Instagram Pages uh but you know [2246] I just got the back and voila we we have [2248] it it's right in front of us we have all [2249] of the data of that person's Instagram [2252] profile so you can see it's quite [2253] scalable in that way um so the question [2255] is obviously how do you get this in NN [2257] well appify has a really easy to use um [2259] API which I like [2260] doing all you have is if we wanted to [2264] get the uh let's see get data set items [2267] okay all I'm going to do is I'm just [2269] going to copy [2270] this go back here and then connect this [2273] to an HTTP request [2275] module as you could see we have this big [2278] long field here with my API appify API [2281] token and this specific data set that [2283] I'm looking for I'll show you how to get [2284] it dynamically but I just wanted to like [2286] allow you to see how to get data in [2287] naden really quickly now if we go to the [2290] schem of view we can see we legitimately [2292] we we already have all of the data that [2293] we we had from appify a second ago okay [2296] super easy and quick and simple to get [2297] up and running um we have the input URL [2299] field the ID field the type the short [2301] code caption now this is Instagram um [2305] every looks like we have some comments I [2307] don't have any style how do I create my [2309] man you just got to fake it till you [2311] make it I don't have any style either [2313] just some nerd in my mom's basement uh [2316] yeah so you you can scrape any resource [2318] you want here um obviously I was [2320] scraping an Instagram resource but like [2321] if you were scraping something else [2323] there'd be no change to this at all no [2325] change whatsoever now uh basically what [2327] we need in order to make this Dynamic [2329] basically make us able to run something [2331] in appify and then get it in NN so we [2334] need to set up an integration so just [2335] head over to this tab set up integration [2337] and then all you want to do is you just [2339] want to do web hook send an HTTP post [2342] web Hook when a specific actor event [2343] happens the actor event that we're going [2345] to want is basically when the run is [2347] succeeded the URL we're going to want to [2349] send this to if you think about it we [2351] just actually make another web hook [2353] request here web [2355] hook the URL we're going to want to send [2357] it to is going to be this test URL over [2361] here now I'm just going to delete all [2362] the header off stuff here because um it [2364] just uh complicates it especially for [2366] beginners um but we're going to copy [2368] this over head back over here paste in [2370] this URL and then let me see this is a [2372] post request I think I don't actually [2374] remember so we're going to have to [2375] double check I think it's a post [2377] request yeah and then what I'm going to [2379] do is I'm going to listen for a test [2380] event run the test web [2383] hook so we're listening we're making a [2385] get request okay so the fact that it [2387] hasn't connected yet probably tells me [2388] it's a post request so let's move over [2390] here move this down to post now let's [2392] listen to a test event let's run this [2395] puppy one more time so we just [2397] dispatched it and yeah the post request [2399] succeeded and what did we get we got [2400] tons of information we got a body with a [2402] user ID created at event data joke right [2405] looks like when you test something out [2406] they just send you a joke about how [2408] Chuck nurse can sketi a cow in two [2410] minutes have you ever heard of the word [2411] sketi before this moment I haven't I [2413] want to be known for my ability to sketi [2416] we'll go Instagram website [2419] scraper okay and now if we go back here [2422] right we're now listening for a test [2424] event so I'm going to listen for this [2426] test event I'm going to run the same [2427] scraper again maybe we'll make it five [2428] posts per profile just to make it a [2429] little [2430] faster and um once this is done what [2433] it's going to do is it's going to send a [2435] record of all the information we need to [2437] get the data over to Ann we're going to [2440] catch that information and then we're [2442] going to use it to query the the the [2444] database basically that it created for [2445] that particular Instagram run which will [2448] then enable us to do whatever the heck [2449] we want with it so it's now starting to [2451] crawl as we see here we had five [2453] requests so it should be able to do this [2454] in like the next 5 seconds or so okay [2456] and once that's done we now have an [2457] actor succeeded event um and then we [2460] have uh let me see the data that we want [2464] would be the default data set ID down [2466] over here so if we just go to that next [2468] HTTP request node what I can do is I can [2471] feed that in as a variable right [2474] here let going to a default data set [2478] ID drag that in between these two little [2483] lines and now we can test that step with [2485] actual live data now we have everything [2486] that we need [2487] so I don't know maybe now you want to [2489] feed this into Ai and you want to have [2490] ai tell you something about the last [2492] five posts tell you wow those last five [2494] posts were amazing Nick I loved the [2497] specifically the one on Korea and I just [2499] wanted to send you over some quick [2500] assets to help you out right you can now [2502] do super Dynamic and structured Outreach [2506] you could take that data and use it to [2508] like draft up your own post I mean the [2510] options are ultimately unlimited that's [2512] why I love appify so much the sixth way [2514] to scrape websites with NN is data for [2517] Co this is another thirdparty service [2519] but it's a very high quality one that's [2520] specifically geared towards search [2522] engine optimization requests you guys [2524] haven't seen data for SEO before it's [2526] basically this big API stack that allows [2528] you to do things like automatically [2530] query a service maybe some e-commerce [2532] website or some content website and then [2534] like extract things in nicely structured [2536] formatting um again specifically for SEO [2539] purposes tons of apis here as well I [2541] mean a lot of these services are now [2542] going towards like more Marketplace [2544] style stuff but just to give you guys an [2546] example you could like Google really [2548] quickly to scrape a big list of Google [2550] search results for a term and then you [2551] could like feed that into one of any of [2553] the other scrapers that we set up here [2554] to get data on stuff you could go Google [2556] Images Google Maps you could do Bing BYO [2559] YouTube Google's uh their own data set [2561] feature I don't really know what that is [2562] but I imagine it's pretty cool uh and [2564] then you can you can take this data and [2565] do really fun stuff with it so I'm just [2567] going to click try for free over here in [2568] the top right hand corner show you guys [2570] what that looks [2572] like and as you see here um I signed in [2575] to data for SEO to my own account looks [2577] like I have 38 million bajillion [2580] dollars um but obviously you'd have to [2583] go through the rig Rolla creating your [2584] own account so why don't actually just [2586] do that with you and then I'll just use [2587] that account that is 38 million [2588] bajillion dollars we'll click try for [2591] free we'll go Nikki [2595] Wiki uh let's use a different email I [2597] need a business email huh that's [2601] unfortunate okay I do agree to the terms [2603] of use [2605] absolutely uh bicycle [2608] is that a bicycle that's not a [2612] bicycle what does it mean when I can't [2615] answer these does it mean that I'm a [2618] robot if you look at some of my posts [2620] some of my comments people would [2622] absolutely say yes it means that that [2625] you're a robot um I don't know why [2627] people keep saying stuff like dude Nick [2629] nice AI Avatar bro but I'm it's not an [2632] AI Avatar it's not an AI Avatar at all [2635] it's actually just me okay anyway so I [2637] need to activate my account doesn't look [2639] like it allows you to feed in the code [2641] here so I'm just going to feed it in [2642] myself uh it's obviously you're getting [2644] a lot of spammers hence [2645] this um bicycle stuff I don't know why [2649] the code isn't working here let me just [2652] copy this link address paste it in here [2655] instead there you go okay great so now [2657] you can sign [2659] in and once you're in you got also um [2663] they're actually really big on on [2664] bicycles they're training um a model to [2666] convert all ads on planet Earth into [2668] bicycles they'll actually give you a [2669] dollar worth of API access uh credits [2672] which is pretty cool um I'm not going to [2674] do that I'm just going to go over to [2675] mine which is$ 38 million bajillion [2676] dollars with 99,999 estimated days to go [2680] um and yeah let's actually run through [2681] this the first thing that I recommend [2682] you do is go over to playground on the [2683] Le hand side there's all of their [2685] different API endpoints that you can [2687] call um what I'm going to do is I'll [2688] just go to serp for now just to show you [2690] that you could scrape Google with this [2691] pretty easily so maybe I'm in the UK and [2694] I want to scrape um let me see [2698] a keyword ni arrive okay then I'm going [2701] to send a request to this [2703] API there's there's a bunch of other [2705] terms here that are going to make more [2706] sense if you're a SEO person um but now [2709] we receive as output a structured object [2712] with a ton of stuff right we have um the [2715] first result here it's like an organic [2716] one with some big URL a bunch of chips [2720] um I'm I have like a Knowledge Graph [2722] profile which is cool apparently it [2723] finds it says I'm a freelance writer um [2727] you know we have a bun bunch of data [2728] here bunch of data you know you can use [2730] this to get URLs of specific things and [2732] then with the URLs you can then feed [2734] that into scrapers um that do more like [2736] I talked about earlier maybe appify or [2738] maybe rap API maybe fir crawl so a lot [2742] of options here to like create your own [2743] very complex [2745] flows you can do other stuff as well um [2748] you grab a bunch of keyword data so [2750] maybe you wanted to find a keyword and [2753] maybe again it's Nicks or location you [2755] want let's do United States that'll [2757] probably be [2758] better language um I'm just not going to [2761] select an language and then I'll do a [2763] request so now it's going to find us um [2766] a bunch of search volume related stuff [2768] so I don't actually know how many people [2770] are searching for me in 2025 apparently [2773] 390 is this per month H wonder if it's [2776] per month per day that's interesting uh [2780] I don't really know why they break it [2781] down by like the month date yeah looks [2784] like it's 390 per month so to the 390 [2786] people that are Googling me who are you [2788] and what do you want I'm just kidding um [2791] you can do things like you could find [2792] back links so you could find links um [2795] for I believe you feed in a website URL [2798] and then it finds back links to that [2800] website so this is you technically now [2801] scraping a bunch of other websites [2803] looking for links to the specific [2805] resource that you have that's kind of [2809] neat it looks like that found it [2811] basically immediately which is really [2812] really [2814] cool and it looks like they're referring [2816] top level links that are Dooms BG bgs [2819] would be interesting I wonder where [2820] that's coming from um there's a Content [2823] generation API playground so you could [2825] you know feed in some text and then have [2827] it generate other stuff but I think [2828] we're kind of getting away from um the [2830] actual thing that matters which is the [2831] scraping of the uh scraping of the [2833] websites so yeah lots of stuff lots of [2836] stuff for sure now that's all good um [2838] but let's actually turn this into an API [2840] call if we head over to the API of do [2842] data for SEO so in my case docs. datafor [2844] seo.com V3 _ page SL contentor parsing [2850] live that's what I'm I'm curious about [2852] you'll see that we have a post request [2853] that we need to send to this URL um well [2856] I have a curl just like this which I can [2859] feed into um an API request that's what [2862] I'm going to do so I'm going to go back [2863] over here and I'm just going to import [2865] this curl [2867] import and it's going to go through and [2869] it's basically going to um parse out all [2872] these fields that I'm interested in with [2873] the URL which I'll go htps [2877] left click. AI um and then we have sort [2880] of like a gacha here that a lot of [2881] people don't understand this is the um [2883] authorization the authorization is a [2885] little bit different from most of the [2886] easy authorizations we've had so far we [2887] actually have to convert it um we have [2888] to go one one more step basically to [2890] make this work if I check out the let's [2895] see um [2897] authorization [2899] here what we need is we need to um get [2903] the login and then the P so this is your [2906] username and then your password then we [2908] have to Hash it or not hash it but we [2909] have to convert it into something called [2910] base 64 um this is just how they do [2913] their API key stuff I guess it's kind of [2915] annoying but it's just part and parcel [2917] of working with some apis you're just [2918] not always going to have it available to [2920] you really easily so I'm just going to [2922] go back to data for SEO and then I'm [2925] going to grab my credentials okay so [2927] what we need to do is we need to base 64 [2930] encode the username and the password um [2932] I'm just going to leave that at what [2933] I've done is I've actually gone through [2934] and done it in this edit Fields node um [2937] basically what you need to do is you [2938] need to have your username or your login [2942] so maybe this is me searching Nix or [2944] have Reddit uh Nick left click. so that [2947] might be my username and then my [2949] password is What's called the API [2950] password you can find that really [2951] quickly and easily just by going over [2953] here to API access and then API password [2956] if you just signed up it'll be visible [2957] right here if it's been more than 24 [2958] hours you actually have to send it by [2959] email but anyway so that's um that's [2961] where i' get the API password from uh [2964] and then once you feed it in over here [2966] where you're going to want to do is [2967] you're going to want to base 64 encode [2968] it like this they just require you to [2971] use these creds um or to operate with [2975] these creds as base 64 encoded versions [2976] Bas 64 is just a way to like translate [2978] into a slightly different number format [2980] so once you have that you would just [2981] feed in the variable right over [2983] here Ju Just as follows and then you can [2986] make a request to their API and receive [2987] data so uh it looks like I was doing [2990] their content parsing live you know what [2993] I wanted to do is I just wanted to [2995] call their endpoint which I think was [2998] their like instant [3002] Pages this one right over here so it's [3004] just V3 uh once you've sorted this out [3006] by the way the AP gets like [3007] extraordinarily easy to manage you just [3009] need to like figure out the [3009] authentication from there on out all [3011] you're literally doing is just swapping [3012] out the requests so you know if you [3014] wanted to do instant Pages all I'm doing [3016] is pumping that in there I just sent a [3019] request and now I receive a bunch of [3020] links with different headings and and so [3022] on and so forth that's easy the seventh [3024] way to scrape websites and Ed end is [3025] using a third party application called [3027] crawl Bas they're known for their [3029] rotating proxies which allow you to send [3031] very high volume um API requests so um [3033] it's very proxy driven this is their [3035] website so it's a scraping platform [3037] similar to Rapid API um and uh you know [3040] appify they support many of the major [3042] websites here and um the reason why [3044] they're so good at this is just because [3045] they you know as I mentioned they rotate [3047] the hell out of these proxies so we're [3049] just going to sign up to Tri it free [3051] I'll use my business email [3054] here and then continue with Emil [3057] email we got to add a phone number [3060] obviously we're going to do less than a [3061] thousand I'm a CTO I don't want to [3064] what's the animal right is that an [3066] animal yes it's an animal good God beep [3070] boop uh we're going to head over to my [3074] Gmail and receive this [3078] now so we need to confirm my account [3080] just going to copy this link address [3082] that I can do this in one [3083] page awesome we should be good to log in [3086] so that's what's [3087] happening we need to select the animal [3089] again just doesn't it doesn't believe [3091] really just doesn't [3094] believe okay great so now we have a [3096] crawling API smart proxy thing if you [3099] guys want to run like uh I don't know [3101] use in apps that have a proxy field [3103] specifically I'm just going to keep [3104] things simple we're doing this in n8n so [3106] we're going to go crawl base API we have [3107] a th000 free crawls remaining very first [3110] thing we're going to want to do is just [3111] click start crawling now just to get up [3112] and running with the [3114] API um and as you see here the these [3116] guys have probably one of the simplest [3117] apis possible all API URLs start with [3120] the folling base part click and then all [3122] you need to do in order to make an API [3124] call is run the following sort of line [3126] so this is a curl request obviously [3128] we're in n8n and one of the value [3131] valuable parts of NN is we can just [3132] import a COR request so well I'm going [3134] to import it as you can see here we have [3137] a token field then we just have the URL [3139] field of the place we want to crawl so [3141] I'm going to do left click. for now um I [3144] don't know if this token field was [3146] actually my real token I don't believe [3147] so maybe we'll give it a try maybe it's [3149] like a test token or [3151] something so I'm now running this and it [3154] looks like we just received a bunch of [3156] very spooky data I don't like the spooky [3158] data no spooky data for [3161] us um sometimes spooky data like [3167] this H this seems kind of weird to me [3169] actually just give me one second to make [3171] sure that's right we are receiving a [3173] data parameter back which is nice but [3176] yeah something about this is a little [3177] bit spooky um was it a get request or [3180] was it a post request no I guess it's a [3181] get request [3183] strange very very [3186] strange okay anyway they give you two [3189] types of tokens here um this is why I'm [3191] talking about it to begin with I'm also [3192] because I just used it before for a [3193] couple of applications and I found it [3195] very easy they give you a normal token [3196] and they give you a JavaScript um token [3199] as well so the reason why that's [3200] valuable is because if you're scraping [3202] one of these websites I talked about [3203] before where when you send a simple HTTP [3205] request nothing pops up like this is the [3207] this is the purpose of this you actually [3208] feed in a JavaScript token um when you [3211] use the JavaScript token it'll [3212] automatically launch a browser instance [3214] inside of um craw base for you so [3217] instead of you getting just like that [3219] empty thing back that I mentioned I'm [3220] you're actually going to get uh you're [3222] going to get like a JavaScript version [3224] of the website where somebody went on [3226] the website it loaded really briefly and [3228] then they grabbed the code [3230] afterwards so yeah we have some some API [3232] call stuff over here um this one's just [3234] using Amazon this is pretty interesting [3236] so I might actually give that a a go [3238] just to give you guys an example of said [3240] Amazon [3242] scrape uh let's just go [3249] www.amazon.com oh right Amazon might be [3251] JavaScript actually so maybe we give [3253] that a go no it looks like we um we got [3255] the data from from Amazon which is [3256] pretty cool if you feed that into the [3258] markdown converter like we had before [3260] it's going to feed in the HTML here pump [3263] it into a data [3264] key we've now converted this [3268] into uh this is very long let's go [3270] tabular we've now converted this into [3272] markdown which is cool and this is [3274] pretty long right obviously has all of [3276] the images and has all of the [3278] information on the site which is cool [3279] and then we can feed it into open AI [3281] like I did [3282] before where I message a model and I'm [3286] just going to copy um from my uh [3288] previous application here to make my [3289] life a little bit [3290] easier where the heck are you [3296] and then we're just going to feed in the [3298] code here and then because I didn't feed [3302] in this we should now run this we're [3306] going to grab data from the site and [3308] we're going to try and I mean you know [3309] we kind of all know what Amazon is and [3311] what it does right so I'm not expecting [3313] expecting anything spectacular but it's [3315] still going to go it's going to give me [3316] all of the text on this Amazon page and [3318] then I'm going to get a bunch of list of [3319] links basically absolute URLs ideally [3322] should play some Jeopardy [3325] music or going be able to play um Star [3328] Wars music that'd be kind of cool okay [3331] we now have a schema with all of the [3333] links on the page which is pretty cool [3334] we have the plain text website copy we [3337] have a on line summary uh you know plain [3339] text website copy is a lot longer than [3341] this obviously it's just shortening and [3342] truncating it for us but yeah very quick [3344] and easy way to use crawl base for this [3346] now the value in crawl base is not [3348] necessarily just to send them to static [3349] websites like I talked about it's to use [3351] like highly scalable scraping where [3355] you're scraping any applications [3358] consistently um as you see here the [3360] average API response time is between 4 [3362] to 10 seconds so you you will receive [3363] results back pretty quick if you wanted [3365] to just send one request or 20 requests [3368] every second think about it like 20 [3370] requests a second times 60 seconds a [3372] minute is 1,200 requests times 60 [3374] minutes and an hour 72,000 requests [3376] right um sorry just jumping around the [3378] place here you can send 72,000 requests [3380] basically an hour which is crazy um and [3383] you can do so as quickly and as easily [3384] as just like adding an API call like [3386] and then it'll automatically distinguish [3388] between like a a plain text thing or a [3390] JavaScript thing okay the eighth way to [3391] scrape data in nadn specifically website [3394] resources is octop parse octoparse is [3397] very similar to some of the other [3398] services that we've talked about um it [3400] is a web scraping tool that actually [3401] gives you quote unquote free web [3403] crawlers and I'm just a fan of their ux [3404] I think it's very clean I think the way [3406] that they have their signup flow and [3407] stuff's really easy so if you made it to [3409] this part of the uh tutorial and you [3410] have yet to sign up to one of these [3412] Services give octoparse um give [3414] octoparse your thoughts [3416] let's double [3418] check that I haven't actually created an [3420] account using this no I haven't [3421] fantastic so I should be able to jump [3423] through and show you guys what this [3425] looks like we have a verification code [3427] I'm going to paste in if you're not [3429] familiar with jumping around and stuff [3431] like this um or if you're wondering how [3433] I'm jumping around I'm just using a [3434] bunch of website [3439] hotkeys okay great account is now ready [3442] so we can start a free premium trial if [3444] you want I think you're going to have to [3445] add a card um I don't know if I have [3446] enough credits to actually do anything [3449] but if I'm not then I'll start that [3450] trial in a second what you're going to [3452] have to do in order to make this work is [3453] you're going to want to have to download [3454] you're going to want to download the [3456] octoparse desktop app so let's give it a [3459] quick and easy go just going to drag [3462] this puppy um if you are using something [3465] that is not Mac OS you will not have [3467] this strange drag and drop feature here [3470] once that is done you will have octo [3471] parse accessible just open that up yes I [3474] want to open this thank you [3477] and the cool thing about [3479] octoparse um kind of relative to what [3483] else you know like the other scraping [3485] applications I talked about is this is [3487] just running in a desktop app um like [3489] kind of in in your [3490] computer so like it's cool because it's [3493] just easy to get up and running with um [3494] and it's also local as opposed to a lot [3496] of these other ones which are not so I'm [3499] going to Auto log in on my desktop app [3501] remember my password beautiful the [3502] simplest and easiest way to scrape a s a [3504] service is just to pump in the the URL [3506] here then click Start and basically [3508] what'll happen is um it'll actually [3510] launch like an instance of your browser [3511] here with this little tool that allow [3513] you similarly the web scraping Chrome [3515] extension select the elements on the [3516] page you want scraped so I don't know [3519] maybe I want these logos scraped the [3521] second that I tapped one you'll see it [3522] automatically found six similar elements [3525] so now I'm actually like scraping all of [3527] this stuff okay now we have access to [3530] this sort of drag and drop or um [3532] selector thing similar to what we had [3535] before if you click on one of these [3536] you'll see it allow you to select all [3538] similar [3539] Elements which is pretty sweet and then [3542] um you can also do things like click [3544] elements and so on and so forth extract [3546] the text Data here um you can also tie [3549] that to other things right so as you see [3552] I'm now mapping each of these very [3553] similarly to how I was doing before [3555] between the first field which is the [3557] title of the product and then the second [3558] field which is like the field to uh so [3561] that's pretty sweet we could do the same [3562] thing with a number of things you could [3563] extract like the headings and then the [3565] values and so on and so on and so forth [3567] but I'll kind of leave it there um so [3569] once you're done selecting all the [3570] elements that you want all you do is you [3571] click run and you have a choice between [3573] running it on your device versus running [3575] it on the cloud so um on the cloud is [3578] API supported that's how you're going to [3579] get stuff in NM but I just want you guys [3580] to know that you can also just run it [3581] here you could run it here load up the [3583] URL scrape all the things that you want [3585] on the specific page you're feeding in [3586] and then you can be done with it so I [3588] just selected run in the cloud it's now [3589] going to open up said Cloud instances as [3591] we could see we have this little field [3593] where it's running and extracting the [3594] data we're now done so I can export this [3598] data locally um but I could also do a [3600] lot of other stuff which we'll show you [3601] in a second so um you can dump this [3603] automatically to Google Sheets you could [3605] do zapier to connect to Google Sheets do [3607] like some sort of web Hook connection [3608] export to cloud storage uh similar stuff [3610] to the the web scraping Chrome extension [3613] um but for now let's just export this as [3616] Json give ourselves a little ad Json [3619] file here thank [3621] you and yeah now we have it locally now [3623] in order to connect with the octop par [3624] CPI what you're going to have to do is [3626] first you get up to request an access [3628] token the way that you do this is you [3629] send a post request to this URL here and [3633] the way that you format it is you need [3634] to send your username your password and [3638] then have the grantor type as password [3640] okay now password obviously just put in [3642] whatever your password is don't store it [3644] in PL text like I'm doing um with my [3645] hypothetical password put it somewhere [3647] else and then grab that data and then [3649] use it um but the the output of this is [3651] we have this big long access token [3652] variable which is great after that if I [3655] just go back to their API here um once [3657] we're here we can actually extract the [3658] data that we need so basically the thing [3661] that you're going to want is you're [3662] going to want um get data by Offset you [3664] can also use get non-exported data which [3666] is interesting so I think this just like [3667] dumps all of the data as not exported um [3670] and then sends that over to you I [3672] believe but anyway you could also get [3674] the data by offset so if I go a get [3677] request to open api. octop course.com SL [3680] all and then I just send a header with [3681] the URL parameter this is a get request [3685] uh we're going to send a header with the [3687] token so [3689] authorization [3690] Bearer and then feed in the access token [3693] here just make sure that this is just [3695] one space no it's [3697] two if I feed this in um it's saying [3701] that it's a bad request let me just [3702] triple check why I think we need three [3706] Fields yeah I think we need three Fields [3709] actually my bad um we need uh this get [3713] request then we need the authorization [3716] header like I talked about then we need [3718] three Fields task ID yeah right [3720] obviously we need to feed in the task ID [3721] so you need task ID offset or size so um [3725] we'll feed this in as query parameters [3727] here so send query parameters the first [3730] value was task ID second one was [3734] offset and uh offset is no Capital the [3738] third was size offset's going to be zero [3740] size going to be I don't know let's just [3742] do 1,000 and what we need now is we need [3744] the task ID of the specific run that we [3746] just finished oh in order to get the [3747] task list you head over to task list top [3749] right hand corner here task ID API so we [3752] now have access to this so if we go back [3755] to our NN instance we could feed that in [3757] here by test the step you'll see that we [3760] now have all the data that we just asked [3762] for earlier so a variety of ways to do [3764] this um in practice like octop par [3765] allows you to schedule runs you could [3767] schedule them um using their you know [3769] whatever it is uh uh like cloud service [3772] you could use it to scrape I don't know [3774] Twitter uh they have a variety of like [3776] other scrapers um that you can check out [3778] just heading over [3780] to this new here uh if we just go sorry [3783] go down to templates um there's a [3785] variety of other ways to scrape Google [3786] job scraper glass door scraper super [3788] Pages scraper you could schedule these [3790] right and then what you can do in na is [3791] you can just query it once a day grab [3793] all the data like I showed you how to do [3794] a moment ago dump that into some sheet [3797] octoparse is pretty cool it's like more [3798] of like an industrial Enterprise level [3800] application um to be honest so there [3803] might be some gotas if you're not super [3804] familiar with working with like desktop [3807] apps and stuff but I I like the idea [3808] that you can also just scrape locally [3810] which is pretty sweet and the last of [3811] our nine best ways to scrape websites in [3813] nadn is browserless now browserless runs [3816] a headless Chrome instance in the cloud [3818] this stuff is great for dynamic or heavy [3820] JavaScript websites if you've never used [3822] browser list before the cool part about [3825] browser list is allows you to actually [3826] bypass captas which is a big issue that [3828] a lot of people have um so I'm going to [3830] click try it for free I'm going to enter [3832] my email address over here verify I need [3836] to submit a code so let's head back over [3838] here thank you thank you thank you thank [3842] you we have a ton of free trial signups [3847] obviously I don't have a promo code or [3849] anything don't have a company name I'm [3851] just going to enter a password I'm using [3853] this to get past uh to avoid setting up [3855] a puppeteer and playright server sure [3857] I'm going to click complete we're now [3859] going to have a th credits inside of [3861] browser list which is pretty sweet um [3863] and we'll get a we'll get a full plan [3865] eventually we now have an API token so I [3867] can figure out how all of the stuff [3868] works here I'm just going to dive right [3869] into the API I can figure out how all of [3871] the API stuff works using their API docs [3873] which are fantastic by the way um and we [3875] don't want to do any of this stuff we [3877] just want to do HTTP apis brow list API [3879] index okay great so here's where we're [3881] at um if you want to send and receive a [3882] request what you need to do is uh you [3886] send a request to one of these endpoints [3888] content unblock download function PDF [3893] screenshot scrape or performance [3896] what we want for the purpose of this is [3898] just uh let's do content okay this is [3901] the request right over here so I'm just [3903] going to paste my API token up here copy [3905] this [3906] request feed it into nadn in the HTTP [3909] request module as per [3911] usual nice quick and easy I'm going to [3914] grab my API token and where it says your [3916] API token here I'm going to feed that in [3919] what I want as a website is just left [3921] click. a I'm going to run test step we [3924] are now quering the pi and in seconds we [3927] have access to the data same thing that [3930] we had before but now we're using a pass [3933] through and browser list is a great pass [3935] through um because you know uh they they [3938] allow you to scrape things that go far [3940] beyond the usual static site thing so [3944] like honestly and I'm just leaving this [3946] as a secret and sort of a little I guess [3948] Easter egg for people that have made it [3949] this far in the video like my go-to when [3951] scraping websites is as I mentioned do [3954] that HTTP request trans forg that works [3955] then do something like fir C.D but if [3957] that doesn't work I I do something like [3959] browserless that has all of this stuff [3961] built in um and I especially use browser [3965] list anytime that there's some sort of [3967] you know application where I'm just [3968] going to save this so I can make all my [3970] HTP requests really easy um especially [3972] when you know there's issues with captas [3974] and and accessing resources and stuff [3976] check this out not only can you do um [3979] the actual scrape you can do a [3981] screenshot of the page as well and [3982] because I've entered my token up here [3984] the requests that I'm going to setting [3985] up are as simple as importing the [3988] curl then clicking test step so [3991] straightforward we now have a file which [3994] is the screenshot now I used example [3996] domain there let's go left [3999] click. run this test now you can see [4002] we've actually like received a [4003] screenshot of the of the website [4007] view very sexy and my website's pretty [4009] long so keep in [4011] mind um and yeah you know obviously a [4013] lot you could do with that you can [4014] download the site you can turn the site [4016] into a PDF so um that's pretty neat I [4019] don't think I've actually used this one [4020] before but for the purposes of this [4022] demonstration why don't we give it a try [4024] we'll go over here import the curl paste [4027] it in voila the website I'm going to do [4030] is left click. aai going to test this [4034] step so now there servers doing a couple [4036] things like I'm scraping the site then [4038] converting it all into PDF format um [4040] probably screenshotting a bunch of stuff [4041] too if I view this now we now have my my [4044] file looks like it didn't capture all of [4046] the color aspects um that might just be [4049] difficult or whatever but I still have [4050] like a PDF of the site which is pretty [4051] neat um and yeah let you guys kind of [4054] screw around with this on your own but [4055] there are a variety of cool applications [4056] you can use browless for all right I [4059] hope you guys appreciated the nine best [4060] ways to scrape websites in nadn as you [4062] guys could see it's a combination of on [4065] platform scraping using the HTTP request [4067] module a lot of like API documentation [4069] stuff like that if you want to get good [4071] at this I'm releasing a master class on [4072] API stuff um uh as part of my next na [4076] tutorial video uh and then you know [4078] navigating this and then and then taking [4080] the data from these services and using [4081] them to do something that you want to do [4083] like artificial intelligence to give you [4084] a summary of the site or generate ice [4087] breakers for you or do something else um [4089] whether you're using a local application [4091] like octop parse or maybe the web [4093] scraping CH uh Chrome extension or using [4096] something like firra browserless appify [4099] rapid API and so on and so forth um you [4101] now have everything that you need in [4102] order to scrape static sites Dynamic [4104] sites super Js heavy websites and even [4106] social media websites like Tik Tok [4108] Twitter and Instagram thanks so much for [4109] making it to this point in the video if [4111] you have any suggestions for future [4112] content drop them down below more than [4114] happy to take your idea and run with it [4116] assuming it's something that I haven't [4117] done before and then if you guys could [4119] do me a really big solid like subscribe [4121] do all that fun YouTube stuff and I'll [4122] catch you on the next video thank you [4123] very much

Title: How to Systematize Your Business in Four Weeks (My Process)
[0] hey I'm going to show you how to [1] systematize your business in 4 weeks [2] that is turn it from an unstructured and [4] unreliable mess into a simple scalable [7] and predictable source of income this is [8] a proven road map takes about 20 hours [10] to implement start to finish I followed [12] it myself it's now made me over $100,000 [14] per month in profit consistently for the [16] last 5 months and you don't need to be a [18] technology wizard you don't need to be a [19] programmer it works for any business and [21] I'm going to show you a bunch of options [22] that'll allow you to do it yourself for [24] less than $100 that sounds good to you [26] let's get into it all right first let me [29] explain what I mean by 4 weeks over here [30] and then 20 hours over here so I want to [33] be clear you can technically do [34] everything I'm about to show you in less [36] than 20 hours or so for many of you [38] particularly the more hardworking people [39] amongst you that means two maybe three [41] work days realistically but my [43] recommendation for you is that you don't [45] do not try and do it all at once the [48] reason why is because the economy has a [51] lot of built-in leg now if you've ever [54] played a video game before what happens [56] when you click a button especially like [57] these online video games is your [58] character doesn't actually move right [60] way right there's usually a little bit [62] of a gap and it's usually maybe 50 [63] milliseconds or so between when you [65] choose to do something on your end and [67] then when you see the output of the [69] character on the other end now the [71] market aka the economy aka the thing [73] that you are competing in it works the [75] exact same way so if you try and do [77] something now you're not going to see [80] the results from that action for at [82] least a little while in the future but [83] those results are necessary for you to [86] um see see the impact and then iterate [88] accordingly if you really wanted to see [90] the value of the changes that you're [91] going to be making my recommendation is [93] you wait a little while in between these [95] changes instead of frontloading [97] everything and then wiping your hands [98] clean after two or three days like I see [100] people do all the time follow the [102] four-week structure as I lay it out this [103] is going to be a feedback loop you're [105] going to make one change that change is [106] going to free up a little bit of your [107] bandwidth which is going to allow you to [109] see a little bit further um that added [111] distance is going to allow you to get [113] away from some of the problems that [114] you're you're you're currently facing [115] and maybe look more towards better [117] Revenue strategies um and this feedback [119] loop is going continue and continue [121] until eventually you have the [122] systematized business that I talked [123] about okay so that's my recommendation [126] take all that with a grain of salt here [127] are the four steps that we're going to [128] be following over the course of the next [130] four weeks the first is we're going to [131] productize the second is we're going to [133] validate the third is we're going to use [134] rainbow pen colors apparently and the [136] fourth is we're going to scale no [139] obviously that is automate it's probably [141] one of the most important parts of the [142] whole process but I'm going to run you [143] through all of this right now um I do it [145] uh I did it for my own business over a [147] thousand people that I'm currently [148] coaching and Consulting with this part [150] of my community offers do this all the [151] time as well so the very first week is [154] going to be all about productization if [156] you don't know what productization is it [158] is the process of turning what is [160] previously you know an unstructured [162] service skill or idea into a [164] standardized repeatable and scalable [167] offering the way you do this to make a [169] long story short is you add uh three [172] things you add a price you add a time [174] constraint then you also Define your [176] service in terms of deliverables so the [179] very first step in our four-week process [181] is going to be taking the service or [182] skill that you're already performing [183] because I'm assuming you already have a [184] business of some kind and then we're [186] going to turn it into a standardized [188] offer we're going to turn it from this [189] vague you know sort of like amorphous [191] shape and we're going to turn that into [194] something pretty simple a square [196] something that you could start stacking [197] right and growing and building a good [200] foundation of so uh what do these [203] standardized offers look like now I [205] could spend days and a lot of people do [206] I could spend days going through all the [208] theory here I could spend days walking [209] through it from like a bottom up [210] perspective but honestly I I find the [212] best way to just intuitively understand [214] what good productization is is just to [216] look at a ton of examples of it so here [218] are uh what's this four different [220] business models marketing and [221] advertising Consulting and strategy [223] designning creative services and [224] coaching and education I'm just throwing [226] a bunch of stuff at the wall here I just [228] want you guys to see in pattern match [229] what a product eyes service looks like [231] versus a service that maybe you're a [232] little bit more familiar with which like [233] a vague unstructured unreliable one so [236] under marketing and advertising um you [238] know the vast majority of people that do [240] marketing advertising if I ask them to [241] tell me about their business what they [243] say is oh I help people with [244] marketing now if you take that [246] description of what you do forward and [249] you try and give that to a customer you [252] are leaving so much money on the table [253] it's not even funny I'll help you with [255] marketing means nothing do you want to [257] know what means something something that [259] that actually um like a winning offer in [261] the market it is a four-week Facebook ad [264] campaign that will generate you a 100 [266] qualified leads for $4,875 [270] this over here on the left this is [272] unstructured this sucks okay this over [276] here on the right this is a structured [278] scalable and productized offer and this [281] is really what we should be going for as [283] often as humanly possible so that's just [285] a simple microcosm let's just go through [287] a bunch of examples here so that your [289] brain can just sort of figure this out [291] um I'll help you with SEO right no a [293] better offer is hey I'm going to give [295] you an SEO audit and keyword [296] optimization road map that'll improve [298] your s's ranking in six days or less for [301] $1,985 this is clear it's [303] extraordinarily exact it's easy for you [305] to build it's easy for the customer to [307] make the decision to buy and then be [309] happy with it because they know [310] everything that's going into it what's [312] another example I'll help you with email [314] marketing um well no why don't we offer [317] a five email sequence designed to [318] convert 20% more leads into paying [320] customers for [322] $2,530 okay so we we're only done three [325] here but I think you guys are already [326] starting to catch the drift if I open up [328] this Consulting and strategy tab you [330] know there are a lot of people out there [332] myself included that brand themselves as [333] consultants right but there are a lot of [335] people that also um they haven't really [337] figured out a good consulting or or [338] strategy offer they just brand [340] themselves as people that like help you [342] with your strategy which to be honest is [344] boring as hell so let's take a boring as [346] hell offer and let's turn it into [347] something that actually works how about [350] I'll give you a 90-day road map that [351] will double your Revenue through [353] targeted growth strategies and it'll [354] only cost you [355] $3,500 or maybe I'll help you with sales [358] no how about a two-e review and redesign [360] of your sales funnel to increase close [362] rates by 15% for [364] $2,510 I'll help you enter a new market [366] right Market entrance a market entry [368] blueprint to establish your presence and [370] secure 10 new clients within 6 months [372] for [373] $543 now now that I'm reading this out [375] loud $543 for any sort of like New [378] Market entrant you should probably add a [381] couple of zeros depending on the size of [383] your of your audience the type of [384] business but I'm hoping you guys are now [386] starting to see the point let's move on [387] to design and creative services are you [390] just a logo designer that designs logos [392] no you're somebody that offers a logo [394] design with three unique Concepts and [396] two rounds of revisions to Define your [397] brand that costs you [399] $1,200 okay do you just build websites [402] no you don't just build websites your [403] offer is a five-page WordPress website [405] built in two weeks that showcases your [407] brand and generates leads for $3,000 do [409] you create brand identities no you don't [411] what you do is you offer brand identity [413] packages including logo color palette [415] typography guidelines to position he was [416] a market leader and he charged 3,500 [419] bucks for that all right I hope you guys [421] are starting now to really get it let's [423] move on to the last section which is [426] coaching and education this is sort of [427] more or less like what I do this is part [429] of my offer with maker school and [430] makemoney withm make.com and my other [432] products so uh it's near and dear to my [434] heart how many people say stuff like I [436] will Coach you to improve your business [438] spoiler alert like all of them what they [440] should be saying is hey I'm offering a [442] four-week business coaching program to [444] implement three Key Systems and increase [446] efficiency by 30% for $2,000 now I [448] should note that this efficiency here [450] metric this only means something if uh [451] you know the customer is aware of what [453] it is generally want to stay away from [454] relative metrics unless it's very [455] abundantly obvious what that means so [457] maybe in this case you know if you are [458] some I don't know manufacturing coach [462] then that makes sense if you're not you [463] might want to stay away from language [464] like this I'll teach you sales [466] techniques no a six session sales [468] Mastery Program to help you close 10 New [470] Deals within the next quarter for $1,500 [473] I'll help you improve productivity no [474] I'm not going to do that what I'm going [475] to do is I'm goingon to offer you a [476] three-week productivity Workshop to cut [477] Wasted Time by 20% which you need to [479] Define ahead of time and free up 10 [481] hours a week for $10,000 or [484] $1,000 okay I hope you guys Now [487] understand the vibe behind [488] productization um as I uh you know as I [491] hope it's clear you could spend all day [493] trying to figure out exactly how to [495] build this for yourself or you can just [496] look at a bunch of examples and pattern [497] match what it means to be product ised [499] versus not the vast majority of [501] businesses that I consult with they [502] start here they start with stuff like [503] I'll help you with your strategy I'll [505] help you with your sales I'll help you [506] with your marketing by the end of my [508] programs and basically you know any any [510] consultant worth their salt um there'll [512] be somewhere over here hey I'm going to [513] give you something with a defined time [514] window defined deliverables defined [517] outcomes defined cost um and ideally it [519] would be like a defined uh a defined [521] timeline I'm going to give it to you [522] within 48 Hours 72 hours 3 weeks 5.5 [525] months before February the 19th [528] right so that's from a highle pattern [531] match view let me now that we understand [533] what that means go into the the process [535] or the step by- step that I want you to [537] implement this week in order to get your [538] business product ized so the very first [541] thing we need to do is we just need to [542] define whether our service is a one-time [544] business or it's an ongoing business now [547] is your service a one-time deliverable [549] like are you currently offering you know [551] a template a download or maybe an info [554] product or are you doing some sort of [556] ongoing engagement which might look like [557] a recurring service maybe some sort of [559] monthly call maybe some sort of weekly [561] ad campaign maybe some sort of like [563] monthly copywriting if it's one time [566] what you want to do is just follow all [567] of these steps once whereas if it's [568] ongoing I recommend you have some sort [570] of recurring interval like a weekly or a [572] monthly cycle where you just repeat this [574] process okay so this is number one [576] define whether your service is one time [578] or ongoing the second thing you need to [580] do is you need to identify your [582] deliverables now a lot of people sort of [584] misunderstand what a deliverable is so [586] let me make this abundantly clear a [587] deliverable is what your client can see [589] it's what they can touch it's what they [591] can experience it's it's a thing that [592] pops up in their email inbox it's the [594] CRM that they use every day it's [596] something that is tangible it's not some [598] system it's not some like if you think [601] about it if if you're selling some [602] strategy your deliverable is not [604] strategy your deliverable is a [605] three-page strategy document okay um [609] it's not the result you provide but it's [611] the tangible representation of your work [613] it's the thing that people get it's the [615] product here's some examples if you're a [617] lead gen agency your deliverable is not [619] just leads what your deliverable really [621] is is it's a daily email with leads in [623] it it's a weekly report with a list of [624] leads in it or maybe it's an update to [625] the client CRM which ideally you would [627] have worked and and built for them um [629] with a new record that says new lead How [631] about if you're an advertising agency [633] well your deliverable is not just ads [634] what it is is it's a weekly performance [636] report it's a campaign summary it's a [638] scheduled call to discuss progress right [640] it's screenshots of the advertisements [642] that you deliver if you're an automation [644] agency this is going to be pretty clear [646] and obvious for most of you that do [647] automation stuff because I talk about it [649] all the time but if you're an automator [651] your deliverable isn't just systems what [653] your system is is it's a zapier flow [655] some sort of blueprint a template in [657] nadn or make.com it's a walkthrough [660] video it's a monthly email with [662] performance it's a regular check-in call [664] it's uh you know as I mentioned the CRM [666] that you built for them it's the email [668] that they get with their updates right [669] these are all things that the customer [671] actually gets they they you know I mean [673] it's tough to say touch or feel or [675] experience when we're dealing with [676] virtual businesses like this but I want [678] you to think what is the closest analog [679] to like touching your feeling for most [682] most people it's like an asset or it's a [684] document okay so once you've identified [686] your deliverables you should now have a [687] little list in front of you the next [689] thing you need to do is you need to [690] break down the tasks required to create [692] those deliverables okay so what I always [695] preach is starting from the end and then [697] working our way backwards you don't [698] start here if this is my little Rainbow [701] start line and this is my little Rainbow [703] end line you don't start here and then [705] work your way U Back what you do in [707] business is you actually start with your [709] end result in mind and you work your way [711] backwards from that and by doing so you [713] get to progressively Define how it is [715] that you're going to create the business [717] that you want you've you've identified [718] your dream outcome and now we're just [719] working back and be like okay assuming [721] this is my dream outcome what do I [723] actually need in order to do it um so [725] assuming my dream outcome is not having [726] a rainbow every time I draw something [728] how do I do it I click that button up [730] there uh here's an example if you wanted [732] to deliver a weekly ad performance [733] report the first step is we're starting [735] at the end the weekly ad performance [736] report's in our hand so what did we do [738] before that well we needed to generate [739] the report so how do you generate the [741] report well you need some ad performance [743] data in order to generate the report [745] right okay well if I you know in a [747] hypothetical future I had some ad [748] performance data how did get it well [749] obviously I needed to run an ad campaign [751] okay well how do I run an ad campaign [753] Well I obviously need like the assets [754] necessary to create an ad campaign okay [756] so what's that keyword list ad copy [758] creative assets okay well how do I get [759] those well obviously I need to research [761] write and design okay well how do I do [763] research writing and design if I don't [764] know what I'm doing well I need to teach [766] researching I need to learn writing I [767] need to have some some guide that [769] teaches me the design principles uh and [771] so on and so on and so on and so forth [772] you can break this down as arbitrarily [774] deep as you want to I recommend going to [775] about there um get to maybe the employee [778] training level uh then stop once you're [780] at this point though you will have done [781] more work than 99% of businesses ever [783] have towards standardizing and [794] proceduralized above and you need to [796] determine the roles the job roles [798] required to execute on these tasks so [801] what do I mean by this well you know I [803] was just talking about um ad copy right [805] you know in order to create ad copy [806] ideally you'd have some sort of [807] copywriter or something this is a role [809] in your business now I'm not saying that [811] you need to hire people in order to do [812] this step in fact I hire very few people [815] I don't usually recommend hiring people [816] until you absolutely have to what I'm [818] saying here is we're doing this [819] hypothetical where if we were to hire [821] somebody how would we do it and this is [823] necessary for you to start thinking like [825] uh like like like a like a like a [827] process engineer as opposed to just [829] somebody that does a service so ideally [832] okay this is like the the ideal one [834] right over here ideally one role would [836] handle all the tasks because it makes [838] Staffing really easy all you do is you [840] get the total number of projects then [842] you get some threshold of you know when [844] I hit 10 projects a month well now I [845] just got to hire somebody else and [846] they'll take me to 20 they'll take me to [848] 30 40 and 50 but realistically what [851] you'll probably need is you'll probably [851] need some multiple roles if we go back [853] up to the ad creative example before um [856] sorry the ad uh you know the ad campaign [859] example before like you're probably [860] going to need like somebody to do the ad [862] design right you're probably going to [864] need a copywriter to write it I'm not [865] saying you have to you can certainly [866] hire a split designer and copywriter [869] but just be realistic as to the Quality [871] you'll be able to get if you do so and [874] how much money it might cost speaking of [876] money that takes us the next step which [877] is to estimate the cost to fulfill these [880] deliverables so in order to make this [881] work what you need to do is you need to [883] calculate the internal cost of producing [884] your deliverables by by considering [887] number one flat fees for freelance or [890] contract work to be abundantly clear [892] here if you wanted to um generate you [894] know an an ad copy or something you need [896] to pay somebody to do that if you're [898] going to hire them right so um you know [900] you could either pay somebody in one of [902] two ways you could either go freelance [904] rate which is per project or you could [906] go hourly which might be you know four [908] or five hours in order to do one they're [910] pros and cons to both if you go flat [911] fees and if you pay somebody like I [913] don't know let's say $100 per design [916] good God thank you rainbows I just [918] downloaded this um [920] app uh specifically because I wanted to [922] be able to annotate on these gamas CU I [924] thought they'd be a lot more interesting [925] and I just haven't really figured out to [926] stop the rainbows yet um so you could [928] either pay some $100 per design right or [931] think about it you could pay them $20 an [934] hour times maybe there's an average of [936] like 3.5 hours so that might be a little [939] bit cheaper right this is only 70 bucks [942] the difference is this is like this is [944] guaranteed so although you're paying a [946] little bit more money for flat work it's [948] always guaranteed within the project [949] budget usually guaranteed whereas this [951] it might be 70 bucks in most instances [953] but I don't know one out of every five [954] times you might have this be um I don't [956] know you just get a crappy designer your [957] designer is having a bad day or [958] something like that well maybe it takes [959] them seven hours and you know one out of [962] every X Y and Z designs is now 140 bucks [965] right so this is just a determination [966] you have to make yourself usually if you [968] work hourly usually if you um construct [970] a business that is hourly and then you [972] provide the person resources to help [974] them do their job better and easier you [975] can make a little bit of a multiple [977] because it's going to cost you less [978] money to get them to do the job because [980] you've also sunk time and energy into [981] creating resources and this isn't always [983] accurate but yeah just wanted to give [984] you guys some some some thought there so [986] you need to estimate the cost to fulfill [988] the deliverables right above we just [990] created this big deliverable list with [992] all of the stuff that we need basically [995] and then now what we need to do is just [996] go line item by line item and just say [998] okay this might cost me 200 bucks this [1000] might cost me 300 bucks this might cost [1002] me 400 bucks how do you actually go [1003] about doing doing this in practice my [1005] recommendation is just log on to upwork [1007] or Fiverr or one of these freelance [1008] platforms and just see what sorts of [1010] averages people are charging for the [1011] sorts of services that they're providing [1013] then multiply that by like 1.25 just so [1016] that you know you're never uh you're [1018] never lying to yourself odds are things [1020] are going to be a little bit more money [1021] than you expect this way you'll at least [1022] have a little bit of a buffer room in [1024] case they are and now we get to my [1026] favorite part which is where you [1028] actually calculate the internal cost of [1030] what your product is going to cost and [1032] then you know you price it so here's the [1034] really cool part of a product isation [1035] people typically don't don't um touch on [1038] because we are now standardizing the [1039] output you actually get to set your own [1042] margins so you get to set your own [1044] margins in business you don't have to be [1046] like hey man how much are your margins [1048] for your business and they're like oh I [1049] don't know it's like 25% it's like no my [1052] margins are exactly 75% because that's [1055] how I price my services and that's [1057] exactly how much money I know it's going [1058] to cost me law of large numbers if you [1060] average it out in order to fulfill it so [1063] never again are you going to have these [1065] Mickey Mouse situations where you go [1066] over budget or you have to pay your [1067] business back here's how to do it first [1070] you just need to add up all the costs to [1071] determine your big internal cost just go [1073] down that spreadsheet or wherever you're [1075] writing it down just add up all the [1076] deliverables per project and then just [1078] use this formula right here it's [1080] internal cost divided by and then in [1082] Brackets 1 minus the desired profit [1085] margin let me show you guys a quick [1087] example this isn't like a magical [1088] formula I'm just sort of logically doing [1089] this if your internal cost is a th000 [1092] bucks okay so let's write this [1096] $1,000 and you want a gross profit [1098] margin of 80% okay so I'm going to go [1101] divided by one minus in order to [1104] represent 80% as a number it's always [1106] 0.8 [1108] if you think about it what happens here [1111] 1 - 0.8 is [1113] 0.2 [1115] 1,000 divided by 0.2 well this is like [1118] 1/5 right so it's the same thing as just [1120] multiplying this by five so if you bring [1122] this out that means that your price for [1124] your service is going to be [1126] $55,000 now you know how much to price [1130] although my recommendation is don't ever [1131] price a flat $5,000 like this don't do [1134] 5,000 10,000 15,000 always varied a [1137] little bit um you know have [1139] I don't know call this [1142] $496 uh your conversion rate on all [1144] offers where you have like specific [1145] pricing like this will will always be [1147] higher almost always than if you just do [1148] like a flat price don't ask me why it's [1150] just human [1151] psychology okay and then for the last [1153] step you're just going to want to write [1155] a oneline sales pitch for the new [1157] product we just created so we have [1159] everything else you need sorry we have [1161] everything that we need in order now to [1163] to to build this productized business [1165] and to take us into the next step of [1167] systematization all you're going to do [1169] now is you're going to take that vague [1171] service that you do before and I want [1173] you to write it out like you did before [1174] and then after and then um change it [1176] into something extraordinarily [1179] specific add a um a recommended or [1183] estimated result here this is going to [1185] be your guarantee it's what you're going [1186] to use in order to sell your onetime [1187] offer um you know the most about your [1190] product or service so you'll be able to [1191] say you know like a like a timeline the [1194] specific elements of what it is that you [1196] are doing um and then you know obviously [1198] we just the math on cost you should have [1199] this so here's what you now have at the [1202] end of this lovely journey and we will [1204] go back to Rainbow because that's fun [1206] you'll have a clear deliverable it's [1207] easy to sell and fulfill you'll have a [1209] mapped out process for creating that [1210] deliverable you'll have defined roles [1212] and costs for delivery and you'll also [1214] have a profitable price point that [1216] supports your business goals this is how [1217] you do it this is how every major [1219] business that's just printing money [1221] right now has constructed their product [1223] not like a vague I'll help you with [1225] marketing I'll help add leads to your [1227] pipeline I'll help do this but as hey [1229] I'm gonna I'm gonna sell you a four-week [1231] Facebook ad campaign that's going to [1232] generate you 100 qualified leads it's [1234] going to cost you 4,965 [1237] bucks okay great now that we know this [1240] let's move on to the next step again I [1243] highly recommend you guys you guys can [1245] watch this video at once and that's fine [1246] but when you're actually following this [1248] process when you're rewatching in the [1249] future or something like that um take it [1251] one week at a time do week one after [1253] you're done go to your calendar set a [1255] 7-Day weight period before week two see [1259] how these changes to your business have [1260] gone see how it feels to pitch a new [1262] product eyes Service as opposed to one [1264] that might have been vague or something [1266] and then once you have that then and [1267] then alone uh do I recommend that you [1269] move on to this next step so week one [1272] was about productization week two is [1274] about validation now what validation is [1277] is in a nutshell now that you have this [1279] amazing product I service what we have [1280] to do is we have to find a scalable lead [1282] generation channel that consistently [1284] delivers Roi which to be honest in my [1287] case just more of more or less involves [1289] throwing tactics at the wall and seeing [1290] what sticks now people will [1292] unfortunately do this backwards they [1294] will commit to a leaden channel before [1296] they've proven that it's reliable or [1298] consistent for their product and then [1299] what they do is they they double triple [1301] quadruple down on this thing that just [1303] didn't really work to begin with and [1305] then it doesn't work so they get fed up [1306] when their marketing fails to produce [1308] good returns instead what I recommend [1310] what I've always done and what I preach [1312] is listen to your Market remember [1314] earlier how I said there's a little bit [1315] of lag in the market well this is why um [1317] I recommend you don't do all this once [1318] because you need that input or output [1321] you need that time to pass before you [1322] can see how your uh results impact the [1324] market you can get data back from it and [1326] then use it to actually make like a data [1328] driven informed condition so uh the [1331] markets are the most objective indicator [1332] of success don't rely on opinions don't [1334] rely on what you've heard about a [1335] marketing channel from your friends [1336] don't rely on current trends what you [1337] want to rely on to be a business owner [1339] is stuff like capital investment cost [1342] cost per meeting booked cost per [1344] acquisition these dry sorts of kpis [1346] these are the things that ultimately [1348] matter like even on a micro level you [1350] zoom out a bit me telling you all of [1351] this stuff is important don't get me [1353] wrong and you know I definitely provide [1355] more valuable content the majority of [1357] people on this platform I think at this [1358] point but I don't just want you to take [1361] all of this and take it as truth I want [1362] you to actually take the data I'm doing [1364] uh sorry take the recommendations I'm [1366] making go try them out for yourself and [1368] then see how the market reacts to that [1370] data before you actually continue and [1372] double down and triple down on stuff you [1374] you have to believe stuff for yourself [1375] really and you have to validate [1377] something before it makes sense you to [1378] go all in on it so how do you do with [1380] this in practice well it's actually a [1383] lot easier than most people think you [1384] don't need complex stats you just need a [1386] bit of patience um you need the [1387] willingness to put yourself out there [1388] obviously this is big you need to be [1390] brave and you need to have an openness [1391] to exploring approaches that you might [1393] not have considered viable you basically [1394] need like a certain amount of like non- [1395] judgmentalness to try different lead gen [1397] approaches like a good example is um [1400] upwork was one of the highest Roi lead [1401] gen approaches that I've ever tried [1403] especially for my automation business [1404] one thing for my writing business which [1405] we scaled to 92k a month but the um the [1408] the the leg gen um for my automation [1410] business was like crazy man the T the [1413] the cost per acquisition was like we're [1415] talking fraction 1100th or something [1417] like that of the amount of money that we [1418] would make but you know before I started [1421] upwork I thought upwork was freelance [1423] territory I thought it was like oh [1424] that's where the noobs go that's not a [1426] real business it's like well had I [1428] continued having that thought now I [1430] would be several million dollar poorer [1433] and I'd be looking over at that person [1435] that's all high and and hottie on their [1437] um pedestal of think that upw work sucks [1439] right their closed-mindedness um and you [1441] know obviously I'm a lot better off for [1442] it now I guess is what I'm trying to say [1444] so anyway very first thing I recommend [1446] you do is pick lead generation channels [1449] I recommend three over the course of the [1451] next week and I recommend you start them [1453] all at the same time in order to give [1454] yourself the best opportunity to extract [1455] data I recommend you run this for at [1456] least a week um like what I do in my [1458] program is I actually run this for a [1459] full month but I'm assuming that you [1461] just want to compress all this and [1463] obviously you know on YouTube people are [1464] looking for quick fixes and quick [1465] solutions to problems so uh feel free to [1467] do this for a week here are a few common [1470] Le gen channels to test the first is [1471] cold email cold email is awesome [1473] especially when you draw arrows under it [1474] U my recommendation for cold email is [1477] because you can start it technically for [1478] Z all you need to spend is your time you [1480] can just send out emails yourself [1481] without having to pay anything it's also [1482] especially valuable in B2B and if you're [1485] willing to spend a little bit more money [1486] like I recommend in my programs you can [1488] quickly validate your products plus [1489] however many offers you want um here's [1492] what you track you track open rates [1493] response rates booked calls and cost per [1495] lead so what I mean by this is you might [1497] sign up to a cold platform like [1499] instantly or something like smart lead [1501] inside of instantly and smart lead you [1502] have the opportunity to actually track [1503] all of the metrics that we're talking [1505] about right now so you send out your [1507] campaign and then what you do is you [1508] just look through on a daily basis um [1510] every time you send I don't know maybe [1512] 300 emails a day what were the open [1514] rates what were the response rates and [1516] then when you actually end up booking uh [1517] calls what you do is you break down the [1519] cost of instantly on a monthly basis the [1521] cost of the leads you scrape it on a [1522] monthly basis by the way if you guys [1523] want ways to scrape leads just check out [1525] the other videos on my channel I talk [1527] all about scraping and and and so on and [1528] so forth and then what you do is you [1530] just you just run the math and you just [1531] have some some rolling da daily total [1534] where you update this every 24 hours so [1537] that's uh lead gen channel number one [1539] lead genen channel number two which I'd [1540] recommend is paid ads paid ads um you [1543] know basically for those of us that [1545] don't know Google ads Facebook ads you [1548] can pay money to have your product or [1549] service shown to the people that you [1550] want my recommendation here is look for [1553] click-through rates conversion rates [1554] cost per lead ad spend Roi now I'm not a [1557] paid ads expert but I know that paid ads [1559] work I have a lot of people in my [1560] network that use paid ads they print [1561] money with it so this is definitely [1563] something you're going to want to look [1564] into you're going to want to compare it [1565] to cold email and the other approaches [1567] that I'm going to talk about in a second [1568] to make your decision the third is [1571] upwork and similar platforms and I was [1572] just talking about it but a lot of [1573] people scoff at these freelance [1575] platforms despite the fact that if [1577] played well you can crush it and print [1578] money on them um the benefit here is if [1580] you're at the start line you have [1581] clients that are actively looking for a [1583] service like yours they already know [1586] what their problem is which is very [1587] difficult [1589] I know what my problem is they know what [1591] their problem is they also know what [1592] their solution is because they're making [1594] a job post about it the only thing [1596] they're looking to to decide on is [1599] basically who they're going to pick for [1601] the product or service and so you don't [1603] actually have to do any work here you [1605] don't have to like tell them anything [1606] you don't have to do any work here the [1608] only thing you have to do is you [1609] basically have to make yourself Stand [1610] Out relative to that last person um I'm [1612] at the end so uh yeah you know my [1615] recommendation there is track proposal [1617] sent proposals accepted closed deals and [1619] then ultimately the cost of acquisition [1621] the last thing I'm going to touch on [1622] very quickly is basically what I'm doing [1624] right now which is organic brand [1625] building that just refers to like [1627] creating content on platforms like [1629] YouTube um blogs LinkedIn that sort of [1632] stuff and obviously this just attracts [1634] inbound leads over time the stuff that [1635] you track here is uh engagement so likes [1638] comments shares I look at this stuff [1639] every day I look at my likes I look at [1640] the engagement ratio I look at the down [1642] votes and that sort of stuff uh the [1643] amount of website traffic you're getting [1645] and then your inbound leads so you know [1648] keep in mind if you want to build a [1648] brand you're not going to be able to do [1649] in a week right I'm I'm just trying to [1651] give you guys some ideas here on various [1652] lead generation channels in reality [1654] there's like 10 times as many you could [1655] post in communities you could um do like [1657] ma direct mail-in ads you could um I [1660] don't know run some sort of brand [1661] awareness thing to a newsletter that [1662] then upsells people there are a variety [1664] of ways to generate you go door to door [1666] like I used to go door to door 50 to 100 [1668] Doors a day or 50 to 80 doors a day on [1669] average uh you do cold calls right the [1672] point I'm making is pick three that you [1674] think is going to work that you think [1675] are going to work and then just test [1676] them against each other and then yeah [1679] you know just to be abundantly clear [1680] here and it doesn't look like I um added [1682] new lines here but no channel is going [1683] to work perfectly out of the gate [1684] definitely adjust your approach like for [1686] cold email you know refine subject lines [1688] improve your targeting improve your [1689] audience for paid ads Test new creatives [1691] audiences platforms upwork optimize your [1694] proposals and pitch and then for organic [1695] you're going to want to double down on [1696] formats and topics that generate the [1697] most engagement you're also going to [1698] want to double down on how to draw a [1699] straight line by the end of this week um [1702] you should know or at least have more [1704] than like I don't know 30% uh choice [1708] um validity of which lead generation [1710] channel has the most potential to scale [1712] and which ones to drop when I did this [1714] for myself I ran this for a lot longer [1716] but I also tested substantially more [1718] channels like I tested something like 10 [1719] different lead generation channels for [1720] my own automation agency I probably did [1722] that over the course of like fiveish [1724] sixish months and I did not do it in [1726] anywhere near as a directed mechanism as [1728] I'm as I'm offering to you guys right [1729] now it wasn't until very recently that [1732] I've sort of taken the the mindset as [1734] like uh like I'm basically like a [1735] scientist okay I consider myself a [1737] scientist I have 10 different uh [1740] variables here I have Legion channel [1741] number 1 2 3 4 5 then I just compare [1743] them based off cost per Acquisitions I [1745] compare them based off of you know which [1747] one has the highest lifetime customer [1748] value and and so on and so forth so my [1751] recommendation for you guys would be to [1752] treat it the same okay so the second [1753] thing you're going to want to do is [1754] you're going to want to allocate [1755] resources obviously um what I mean by [1757] that is after picking these lead genen [1758] channels you're going to need to create [1760] a resource allocation plan so how much [1762] money are you going to spend money and [1763] time wise on each if one of your [1765] channels is cold email which I currently [1766] recommend for instance you might 1,000 [1768] emails per day for 7 days which is 7,000 [1770] emails total right make these [1772] determinations ahead of time they're not [1773] easy if you don't really know what [1774] you're doing but um experiment as [1776] quickly as possible if you wanted to do [1778] that you know we'd start at the end [1779] what's our end goal 1 th000 emails per [1781] day okay great how many is that going to [1782] be over seven days 7,000 okay so how [1784] many emails can I send a day per mailbox [1786] AK how many mailboxes do I need to buy [1788] maybe about 30 how much is it going to [1790] cost 90 bucks what are some services [1791] that maybe we can bring that down cheap [1792] inboxes then how much is the software [1794] for this cold email sending going to [1795] cost 90 bucks for instantly just just [1798] just start at the end and work your way [1799] backwards if you don't know anything [1800] about a lead genen Channel you are going [1801] to have to learn a sufficient amount to [1802] where you can execute a campaign on said [1804] platform you don't need to be great at [1805] it um you don't need to be an expert you [1807] just need to be good enough uh what I'll [1809] usually do is consult with tons of [1810] companies that throw together an email [1812] campaign and then I'll be like hey how [1813] long did it take you to do this they'll [1815] be like I don't know an hour and a half [1816] they run it for a month and then they [1817] make you know over 10K or something like [1819] that so the amount of time and energy it [1821] actually takes to get up and running [1822] with this super low um you just need to [1824] have defined cut offs for what [1826] constitutes enough right you need to [1827] know basically ahead of time how much am [1829] I going to be sending how many dollars [1831] am I going to be spending on ads and so [1832] on and so forth otherwise you'll just [1834] you know waste all of your money uh then [1836] obviously experiment quickly and then [1838] ultimately perform a retrospective [1840] retrospectives are my favorite part of [1842] my program it's basically where you get [1844] all of the results that we just you know [1847] spend all this time energy sweat blood [1848] tears and money compiling and then we [1850] just lay them all out in front of us and [1852] we just make a very objective [1853] determination okay based off these [1855] numbers which one here is actually the [1857] best let alone what I think is the best [1860] leave that alone what I care about is [1861] what is actually the best what do the [1862] numbers tell me um what should I be [1864] doubling down on logically if I want to [1865] make a ton of money so that's my [1868] Approach for validation and um I now [1871] validate every business that I work with [1873] I have them run tests like this in order [1875] to determine the highest Roi stuff and I [1877] never insert my own opinions into these [1879] things I never say you should do this [1881] because it's good I say you should try [1883] this and then compare it against other [1884] approaches because I'm a scientist right [1888] the third week now we're moving into [1891] practical applications of this Le gen [1894] funnel that we've set up as well as [1895] product or service line that we've you [1897] know just productized so this is sort of [1900] the the big thing that I think a lot of [1902] people are drawn to this this notion of [1903] automation but not where this is [1905] happening this is in the third week okay [1907] we just spent two full weeks getting to [1910] this point we just spent more than half [1911] of the entire uh task or half of the [1914] entire exercise before we even started [1916] thinking about automating so many people [1918] automate early I don't want that to be [1920] you guys there's no use spending time [1922] and energy building some sort of [1923] automation infrastructure until you know [1925] what it is that you're going to automate [1926] so anyway if you've [1928] productized that's kind of check and [1930] then you also have a reliable lead [1932] generation Channel now all that growth [1934] is is it's the amount of money that's [1936] coming [1937] in times your return on investment and [1941] then this [1942] cycle just plays out with some sort of [1945] lag right so you know money in time Roi [1949] equals money out okay good let's do that [1951] again maybe it takes us two weeks we put [1952] in double the amount of money we receive [1954] four times the result okay great let's [1955] go in now that's two another two weeks [1957] we eight times the amount of money right [1959] now once you have this system all you [1960] need is time so I'm at this point with [1963] my business all I need is time basically [1965] time and I just repeat the same thing [1966] over and over and over and over again I [1967] in my business just Grows Right This is [1969] what basically everybody that's that's [1971] made it big does and you know like [1973] whether your growth graph looks like [1975] this or maybe whether it kind of looks [1976] like more like this I mean this is more [1978] realistic obviously it's kind of like [1980] what everybody's growthcraft looks like [1982] um but whatever it is you just know that [1984] as long as you continue doing the same [1985] boring thing you'll eventually achieve [1987] some massive result that is if you can [1991] fulfill it so the cavate being is well I [1994] can grow infinitely in the front end [1996] right but what do I actually do once I [1998] get the client we obviously need to be [2001] able to fulfill them in some capacity we [2002] need to be able to do the thing that we [2004] promised to them and then that's what [2006] automate is is all about that's where [2008] automate comes in okay so what usually [2010] happens honestly is like companies will [2012] do this and then they'll be like oh crap [2014] we actually need to like fulfill the [2015] service that we told people we would and [2017] then people get really pissed off and [2019] they're like you suck and then they kind [2021] of go down like this so you know so far [2024] we've kind of made it halfway here right [2026] we made it to well I mean ideally we [2028] wouldn't have made it here we made it to [2030] like this part here so now the question [2032] is how do we just continue this growth [2034] trajectory up as opposed to you know [2035] kind of get stuck in that dead zone or [2037] that that plat [2038] so okay so what automation allows you to [2040] do is it just allows you to add more to [2042] your Revenue ceiling so that instead of [2043] it happening you know like over here [2047] right um maybe you start to have that [2049] Plateau a little bit later maybe a few [2051] weeks or months after so the actual [2054] process looks like this first you [2056] rigorously log your own work the reason [2058] why is because you are the business [2059] owner and if you are the business owner [2061] historically 99.9% of the time the [2063] bottleneck is you might not necessarily [2066] be you you like the number of phone [2068] calls you could do per day or something [2069] like that but but but it's still you I [2071] mean you're the person that has the [2072] authority and leverage in order to make [2074] business development decisions you're [2075] the person that you know ultimately [2077] hires and sets culture for your team [2079] you're the person that determines what [2081] is worthwhile to automate or not so at [2083] the end of the day you're the bottleneck [2084] what we need to do is we need to start [2085] by relieving pressure on you and by [2087] doing so we relieve pressure on the rest [2089] of the business and then let you grow so [2091] um I am a big fan of logging my [2093] recommendation for you and everybody [2095] that I coach and consult with is you do [2097] this the same process it's worked [2098] wonders for me it's worked wonders for a [2100] lot of other people too uh get a work [2102] Journal okay that can be physical that [2103] can be digital if it's physical that's [2105] like a little paper notebook if it's [2106] digital that's just a Google sheet if [2108] you're doing the ladder pin it to your [2109] browser like literally go and take turn [2113] off The annotation tool then pin this [2115] somewhere to your browser and just [2116] always have it open it's going to be [2118] necessary in order to continue with the [2119] process uh because you're you're always [2120] going to want to have it accessible then [2122] just set a timer and make that timer go [2125] off every 30 minutes I recommend going [2127] off every 30 minutes on the dot um just [2129] in case you guys have like calls or [2130] something like that that way you can [2132] wait for the timer to go up before you [2133] start said call um this is obviously a [2135] little bit intrusive like if you're in [2136] the middle of a call or some a process [2138] like me recording a video where you need [2140] uh not to have these interruptions [2141] obviously you take this with a grain of [2143] salt you don't necessar need to have [2144] this timer go off audibly you can have [2145] it vibrate in your pocket or whatever [2146] but the point that I'm making is just [2148] have something that goes off and what [2149] this is is this in the The Biz in the [2152] lingo this is called an intention [2155] trigger and what an intention trigger is [2158] is it just forces you to stop barreling [2160] down this torrential River that is your [2163] life and to actually just stop and say [2165] okay like where am I going what am I [2166] doing is this valuable so what you do is [2169] you log the previous 30 minutes of your [2171] time and you say hey I was just doing [2175] this so when your timer Rings you're [2177] going to log this into your work Journal [2179] you're going to do this several days for [2180] best results my recommendations do this [2182] for at least three days because you tend [2183] to have like different sorts of [2184] structures to your days if you [2186] anticipate that the days that you are [2187] doing it are not the days that you're [2188] the most busy wait until the days that [2190] you're the most busy um what you're [2192] going to want to do at the end of this [2193] process is you're basically going to [2194] have several days worth of a [2195] comprehensive list of tasks that you do [2197] on a daily basis right can have some big [2200] Google sheet or some big mle skin [2202] bounded notebook or something like that [2204] just going to have entry after entry [2205] after entry what you want to do is you [2206] want to take all of the unique entries [2208] here all the different things that you [2210] do and tabulate it and turn it into a [2212] big comprehensive list and this is like [2214] that is that's what Nick does that's [2216] Nick's role in the business whole thing [2218] like I don't know when he does it I [2219] don't know how he does it but that's [2220] just every one of these items this is [2222] what Nick does in order to keep this [2223] business running okay and this is really [2225] really important once you have this [2228] we're going to do a prioritization uh [2231] exercise now what we're going to do is [2233] we're going to take these these these [2234] tasks which you know might be this [2236] massive massive list and we're going to [2237] turn them into three categories okay the [2241] first category is going to be [2243] unnecessary so these are tasks you do [2246] not need to be doing AKA they are [2248] complete and utter waste of time the [2250] second category is necessary but [2252] automatable these are tasks that are [2253] necessary to do but probably don't [2255] require imun being or tasks that you [2256] think maybe you could use systems to [2258] take most of the the the stress off of [2260] then the last category is necessary and [2262] unomat now these are tasks that are [2264] necessary they're difficult they're very [2266] high leverage for you to do [2268] yourself okay so I know this sounds [2270] really easy in practice actually doing [2272] it can be a little bit tricky actually [2273] determining what is necessary and what [2274] isn't so my rule of thumb for you is the [2277] necessary but un automatable tasks they [2279] usually have to do with you directly [2281] producing Revenue this is usually stuff [2284] like especially between zero to maybe [2286] 50k a month or so sales calls this is [2289] stuff like responding to some emails [2291] personally yourself not with some [2292] autoresponder bought this is going to be [2295] stuff like um building out uh I don't [2298] know some like high leverage High Roi [2300] client projects or something clients [2301] that are paying you just a ton of money [2304] right these are things that they don't [2306] you can't really automate yourself [2308] and they're they're sort of necessary [2309] and ultimately they just add to what we [2312] care about here and why we're in [2313] business in the first place which is you [2314] know [2315] money so for all tasks labeled [2317] unnecessary okay these you're just going [2319] to want to block remove or delete [2321] permissive [2323] services so this is gone now we don't [2325] have any more of these unnecessary tasks [2327] okay we've just removed them from our [2328] life what I mean by um delete permissive [2331] Services I just mean like what you'll [2334] find when you do this consistently [2335] assuming you actually do and you don't [2336] lie to yourself like lot of people do is [2338] you'll have a big list of tasks that'll [2340] say work stuff this other work thing [2342] this other work thing 30 minutes [2344] browsing Facebook completely pointlessly [2346] other work thing other work thing um you [2349] know I paced around my room like a lion [2351] waiting for his prey for 45 minutes [2353] you're just going to have a bunch of [2354] stuff that just doesn't really add [2355] anything so what you want to do because [2357] these are unnecessary and we're removing [2358] them um especially if they're like [2360] social media platforms or something [2362] you're going to want to uh provide some [2364] sort of like blocker or you're going to [2365] want to like delete the the app or [2368] something basically provide yourself a [2369] little bit of friction so that like you [2370] just never feel tempted to do it again [2372] is there a TV in your office or [2373] something literally like lift the TV up [2375] and put it in another room now if you [2377] want to watch TV you at least have to [2378] get up move to the other room and do it [2380] is there you know I don't know is there [2382] like Foods or I don't know 15 20 30 [2384] minutes of the time that you would [2385] otherwise be spending working just you [2387] eating food or tortilla chips or [2389] something well get rid of those you know [2391] so these do nothing to your bottom line [2393] logically we should just get the hell we [2395] should get them out of here next up we [2397] have the necessary but automatable tasks [2400] in instances like this you're going to [2401] want to um list their steps so sort of [2404] like how we did the deliverable [2405] breakdown before you're going to want to [2407] list the steps of these necessary but [2408] automatable tasks and then just use [2410] Simple no code tools like maker zap here [2412] or NAD although naden could be a little [2414] bit trickier if you're not up and [2415] running with code already um to to start [2417] automating them so these are very simple [2419] no code platforms basically what I mean [2421] here is like let's say one of the [2423] necessary but automatable tasks is I [2425] don't know like categorizing your [2426] invoices this is pretty common one [2427] categorizing receipts categorizing [2429] invoices um you know typically you like [2431] sign on you'll have all these invoices [2432] all day and like your accountant will [2433] have told you oh you need to drag those [2435] into a folder for me or something well [2437] you can actually automate these right [2438] like you know most of the services [2439] you're working with most of the services [2440] you're working with when they deliver [2442] you receipt will say receipt in the [2443] subject line you could very easily just [2445] make an automation that just like every [2446] time a new email comes in with the term [2448] receipt in it or invoice in it you label [2450] it and then you give your accounted [2452] access to everything that's labeled [2453] right like that that part is in rocket [2455] science look for tasks like these okay [2457] ones that are mostly administrative in [2458] nature ones that don't really drive a [2460] lot of value and then just learn a [2461] little bit of make zap here or these [2462] other no code tools this will Empower [2464] you to solve not just this problem but [2465] every instance of future problems um if [2468] you always send out onboarding emails [2469] after client signs your proposal you can [2471] automate it in like 15 minutes if you [2473] have some sort of standardized flow for [2474] a lot of stuff and most of it is just [2475] like stuff that you do again and again [2477] and again and again without any changes [2479] um automate the hell out of it with this [2480] with these [2481] tasks from there for all tasks labeled [2484] necessary and una automatable you're [2486] going to want to build personal systems [2488] that enable you to do them as often as [2489] possible what do I mean by personal [2491] systems I mean habits Partners [2493] accountability groups stuff that allows [2496] you to do more of these things because [2498] these things are what ultimately drive [2500] your Revenue an example for me is make [2502] videos so I built habits Ironclad I [2504] should say Partners people that I check [2506] in with on a daily basis and then [2507] accountability groups people that I [2508] compare myself to constantly in order to [2511] improve the likel that I do the thing [2512] that I want to do that I know drives me [2514] Revenue the you know these are sort of [2516] like actual system systems up here like [2518] these are like um I don't know kind of [2519] think of these as [2521] automations right up here but these down [2525] here these are almost like I don't know [2527] these are like psychological [2531] mechanisms these are things that like I [2533] don't know it's it's you systematizing [2535] yourself basically and that's how I see [2537] it and that's how I've always operated [2539] um you know if you have a lever that [2540] gives you a little bit a little bit of [2542] additional money you're going to want to [2544] click that lever as often as human or [2545] pull that lever as often as humanly [2547] possible your only job as a business [2549] owner is just finding a way to do this [2551] over and over and over and over and over [2553] and over again um so that's ultimately [2555] what you know my recommendation is to [2557] you as well find a way to just do [2559] necessary and unom una automatable tasks [2562] eight hours a day and then you know do [2564] everything else like a minute a day okay [2567] and then after that what you're going to [2568] want to do is you're obviously going to [2569] want to automate your your actual [2570] product I service it's one thing when [2571] you are the the bottleneck in a business [2573] um and you know we just talked about how [2575] to automate the the bottleneck part [2577] um but now we need to actually automate [2579] the service delivery right that's going [2580] to help a lot up here this is going to [2581] help even more so once we've streamlined [2583] our own time it's just time to turn to [2585] automating the rest of our product eyes [2586] Services these May overlap with the [2588] former if you're doing a lot of client [2589] fulfillment AK if you have few or no [2590] staff my recommendation is I'd still [2592] recommend you go through this process in [2593] depth okay here's how to actually [2595] automate product IED Services a lot of [2597] people don't know this but um you can [2599] automate uh the vast majority of the the [2601] work that you do on a daily basis for [2603] client fulfillment you just have to be a [2604] little bit smart about it even if it's [2605] like more creative first you take all [2608] the step-by-step guides that we created [2610] before okay then you ask yourself can a [2613] machine do 80% or more of this if [2615] properly instructed if you're like most [2616] digital businesses the answer is yes let [2618] me give you an example using our ads if [2621] you were to try and you know sell this [2622] productized ad service you can actually [2624] automate the production of copy you can [2625] automate the production of headlines you [2627] can automate the production of body text [2628] you can automate the production of [2629] creatives you can do the same thing with [2631] backgrounds you do the same things with [2632] assets right it's just a matter of [2635] putting these pieces together into way [2637] that makes [2638] sense now you also might not be able to [2641] automate these steps fully that's fine [2643] and that's why we went for 80% instead [2645] of 100% you know like maybe instead of [2648] it being All or Nothing totally mutually [2650] exclusive what what a machine does is it [2652] doesn't do the whole thing it gets you [2653] 80% of the way there and then it just [2655] delivers you a draft for you to QA right [2657] or you know you have like instead of one [2659] add uh background or something the [2661] machine generates 10 and now your job [2663] isn't creating it now your job is just [2664] picking it look for little hacks like [2667] this this is super high leverage and ask [2669] yourself if you can template stuff [2671] because if you can you're going to go a [2672] lot farther and then lastly if a step is [2674] not automatable ask yourself how you [2675] might optimize it could you reconstruct [2677] your consultations for instance to take [2680] less time or prep work you know could [2682] you pre-record lectures or build a [2683] different way to do the same thing let [2685] me show you guys a very quick example I [2688] was looking for uh you know like some [2691] consulting services for tax there's this [2693] guy here his name is Christopher Herman [2695] I hope I'm not or Kristoff Herman I hope [2696] I'm not but your name bro but um [2698] essentially I was looking for somebody [2700] to talk to about this problem and there [2701] were a lot of very highp paying high [2704] leverage consultations right where [2705] people like Chris would answer all kinds [2707] of questions related to um you know [2710] immigration saving taxes uh you know [2713] minimizing government um involvement in [2715] my finances and stuff like that but you [2718] know if you think about it from his [2719] perspective you know he books a [2721] 90-minute consultation how much money [2722] can he make per 90 minutes I don't know [2723] maybe like a th000 bucks an hour I don't [2725] actually know his pricing maybe it's [2726] like a th000 bucks or something for the [2727] 90 minutes so how many 90-minute [2730] consultations you really do a day like [2732] five meaning Chris as much money as this [2734] is will never make more than $5,000 a [2737] day AKA $100,000 a month if he keeps [2739] doing this so what this guy did is he [2742] created a productized version of his [2744] Consulting offer with very well-defined [2748] constraints that he's calling messenger [2750] Consulting so even interested parties [2752] who can't afford a consultation can [2754] still pick up some professional tips [2755] from from Kristoff so he has a free [2757] package he has a multivoice message [2759] package for 500 then he has like a mega [2761] multivoice message package for 7008 uh [2765] 800 or a thousand and basically what [2767] happens is you just ask this guy a ton [2769] of questions in writing and then on his [2771] own time he goes and he just like [2773] answers them through like voice message [2775] so it's almost like he's leaving a [2776] voicemail now instead of being on a [2778] scheduled call why is this great for [2779] Chris well if you think about it like [2781] now he no longer needs to be at a [2782] specific place at a specific time in [2784] order to make money he can make money [2785] anywhere he is he can make money on a [2787] beach chair for Christ's sake there's no [2789] video component to it he can do so while [2791] he's I don't know crusty as hell early [2793] in the morning before he showered [2795] Kristoff's life has made has been made [2797] so much easier because he's no longer [2799] confined to sort of the Synchro [2801] synchronous sort of living not to [2802] mention this guy probably works people [2803] all over the world with like crazy ass [2805] time zones anyway so this this for [2807] instance is an example of a very good [2809] approach good job rainbow Chris um and [2811] it's something that you guys can do if [2813] you just think outside the box a little [2815] bit um for your own services [2818] so that's week three we've now made it [2820] 75% of the way over to our four uh step [2823] or four-week roadmap to systematizing [2825] your business the very last thing we [2827] need to do is now we have all of the [2829] elements of a successful and scalable [2831] business all we have to do now is scale [2833] it so um we now have a product I service [2837] we now have a profitable highi lead gen [2839] Channel we also have a streamline [2840] workflow personally and then a [2842] semi-automated or fully automated [2843] service and it's okay if it's um you [2845] know it's okay if it's semi-automated [2848] totally fine you know the vast majority [2849] of services are my service is still [2850] semi-automated for instance that's okay [2852] the goal ideally in a perfect role would [2854] be fully automated but we can't we can't [2856] get there um in most instances once you [2858] have all of this basically your your [2861] your job is you know if this is my [2864] little [2866] lever your job is just pulling this [2869] thing as fast as humanly possible it is [2871] pulling you know Taste the Rainbow Man [2874] pull it pull it pull it pull it pull it [2875] build systems build robots that enable [2877] you to pull this thing faster shift you [2879] know clock in and out with people that [2881] can pull it while you're resting or [2883] whatever all we really care about is [2885] scaling now now I can't overstate the [2888] importance of this because tons of [2889] people leave money on the table they'll [2891] find something that works but then [2893] because of the built-in human bias [2896] towards minimizing risk over maximizing [2899] upside they will leave so much of their [2902] money on the table it's crazy this risk [2905] minimization stuff is sort of like a [2907] byproduct of our survival whatever you [2909] want to call evolutionary Heritage or [2910] just like the way that human beings are [2913] um my recommendation for you is [2914] consciously debias this by investing [2917] large amounts of time or money into your [2919] now profitable lead generation Channel [2920] what I mean is let's say you're making a [2921] 2.5x y on all this stuff that's actually [2924] really good if your service is [2925] completely REM mostely automated take [2927] 80% of your profits in one month and [2929] just reinvest it directly back into the [2931] 2.5x ROI generator okay if you do that [2935] every single month you're going to be [2937] growing twice uh literally twice as fast [2940] if month one you're making $11,000 [2942] you'll make $2,000 then you'll make [2944] $4,000 you'll make $8,000 and apparently [2947] your bar lines will get fatter as well I [2949] mean like within six months you'll be at [2951] I don't know what's that two race the [2953] six or something like that my math ain't [2954] so good I know 1632 you'll be making [2956] you'll be making a ton of money I can't [2958] tell you how long I spent with [2960] extraordinarily profitable offers we're [2962] talking like like like 20x Roi offers [2965] not only on my time but on the money [2967] money where I had all of the elements of [2970] something that I could very easily have [2971] made over $10 million I don't know $100 [2974] million with but then I just let time [2977] pass week by week month by month not [2979] reinvesting most of my earnings into [2981] said business not really pouring [2983] gasoline on this amazing fire that I [2985] cultivated for reasons that I couldn't [2987] really explain and you know when you [2988] can't really explain something when you [2989] don't really know why something happens [2991] that's kind of a blind spot and [2992] generally speaking I you know my [2994] recommendation for people that are [2995] watching this video that have had [2996] similar sit ation is try and figure out [2998] what the hell exists in that blind spot [3000] most of the time it's not really you [3001] consciously or intentionally making a [3003] decision not to put money in your [3004] business it's you just going with the [3006] flow try not to go with the flow uh you [3008] know contrary to most people's opinion I [3010] don't like going with the flow this is [3012] my beautiful rainbow River or rainbow [3015] road baby it's Mario Kart um try to to [3017] like ask yourself hey am I going in the [3019] direction that I want right like if you [3021] think about it this River the super [3022] optimized River it might be really fast [3024] to go down okay and then maybe like I [3026] don't like the land on both sides isn't [3029] I really should have used blue but [3030] sometimes you're actually going to want [3031] to get off outside of the river and like [3034] walk to your location even if uh it [3037] takes you three or four times the amount [3039] of time right now because at least then [3040] you're going the place you want to go [3042] you're not just going where like the [3042] current of businesses is taking you okay [3045] so yeah anybody can do this just a [3047] matter of time and energy and um you [3049] know if you guys like the content check [3050] out maker school where I show people how [3052] to do this just in the context of an [3053] automation business and then if you [3054] already have a business that's making [3055] money and join maker makemoney withm [3057] make.com it's sort of my higher level [3058] Community where I talk specifically [3059] about how to do more of like the scaling [3061] productizing implementation and higher [3063] level stuff really really glad that you [3067] guys stuck with me for the full length [3068] of the video appreciate it if you have [3069] any questions or anything like that feel [3071] free to drop them below as I'm sure I've [3072] mentioned to you guys before I take most [3074] of my questions at this point from [3075] audience members especially the ones [3076] that stay at the end so just drop them [3078] down below video suggestions down below [3080] as well anything that you guys want to [3081] hear me talk more about I'm happy to um [3084] otherwise if you if you guys could do me [3085] a big Sol and just like subscribe do all [3087] the fun YouTube stuff that gets me to [3088] the top of the algorithm and I'll catch [3090] you on the next video thanks so much

Title: I Built A $2,485 AI Proposal Generator In N8N (Copy This)
[0] hey in this video we're going to be [1] building out a super useful endtoend AI [3] proposal generation system in nadn this [6] is by far one of the highest Roi systems [9] that I install in every business I work [10] with I also sell it myself for anywhere [12] between $1,500 to $5,000 I'm going to [15] walk you through everything from [16] creating the proposals themselves I'm [18] going to show you how to use artificial [19] intelligence to generate super templated [22] customized segments and then ultimately [24] I'm going to weave it all together with [25] n8n and show you how to generate them on [27] the fly every time you fill out a form [29] during a sales call so this is going to [30] be a practical test of our NN skills [32] let's get into the [34] system so from bird's eye view system is [38] going to look like this we're going to [40] start by filling out a form okay this is [44] going to be called our trigger obviously [46] I'm doing this just on a whiteboard here [48] because I want to be able to you know [50] kind of express my thoughts a little bit [51] better um play around with some ideas uh [53] I'm going to be building this with you [54] guys as if I was a builder not [56] necessarily a teacher so I'm going to be [57] showing you guys uh you know the various [60] tours that I might go down I'll show you [61] guys my own thought process as I put a [63] system like this together you know [64] really the emphasis of this channel it's [65] obviously learning by doing so that's [66] what I want to do here but we're going [68] to start with this form field trigger [70] from there we're going to use [73] AI to generate Json if you guys remember [77] Json stands for JavaScript object [80] notation um these Json fields are going [83] to be they're going to be a lot of these [84] Json Fields okay but just to give you [86] guys a quick example what this might [88] look like it might look like um you know [90] proposal [92] title okay and we'd obviously I'm use [95] this to fill in the proposal title [96] segment of our proposal template uh we [99] might have I don't know problem [103] statement you know I'm using camel case [105] here hence why the second word in a [107] variable name is always capitalized feel [109] free to call them whatever the hell you [110] want uh we'll do stuff like cost you [113] know we might need to do some really [114] quick formatting um AI is just a quick [116] and easy way to like add commas in the [118] right place dollar signs that sort of [119] stuff and then we might do things like [121] timeline and I'll show you kind of how [123] all this works in a moment but the the [125] the important thing that I'm putting [126] across from you is we're going to grab [128] data from a form but that's going to be [130] sort of a simple like a dumb form and [131] what we're going to do is it's AI That's [133] going to convert this simple dumb data [135] into the Super Hyper personalized stuff [137] that makes it seem as if you wrote it [139] yourself um you know and then sent it [141] within a few seconds so that's that's [143] really where the value is and that's [144] what I'm going to show you guys how to [145] do after that we're going to um do API [149] call or built-in [151] nodes you know whatever it ends up [154] being um and I'll show you how to do [157] this with slides to [158] start and then afterwards I'll show you [160] how to do so using a platform called [162] pandadoc which I like to use for [164] basically every business that I work [165] with it's the business platform the [167] business proposal platform that I [168] recommend anytime I start doing [169] consulting with a new company or [171] automation for a new company um and the [173] the value of me showing you how to do [174] this is I want to give everybody here a [175] free option to do this system but I also [177] want to show you guys if you guys just [178] you know pour gasoline on it uh what the [180] system can look like panad is great [182] because you can actually send like an [183] invoice alongside your document um which [186] is just super valuable you know you cut [187] down like three or four steps of [189] proposal agreement invoice right all of [192] that that bureaucratic jumble you can [194] cut down to just one where you send the [196] proposal which includes a built-in [197] agreement and includes a built-in [198] invoice and then finally um we're going [201] to weave it [203] together with [205] um you know naden and I mean I'm going [207] to be doing all the building in naden [208] here uh let me just you guys were at [211] right here I was just verifying that [212] some of these API endpoints connected [214] and worked but yeah let's uh let's get [215] started so I'm just going to call this [217] thing AI proposal generator system I've [220] done this build multiple times across [222] various no code platforms like I did the [224] same build in make.com for people here [226] that have been with me since the uh the [227] make.com days this is a super high [229] system but I want to impress upon you [231] right now that it's not necessarily like [232] a complicated system you know one big [234] Trend I see a lot of people do on [235] YouTube nowadays is they they'll put [237] together these [238] extraordinarily complex looking things [241] okay um you know like their system will [243] will kind of look like this there'll be [244] like some start node here and then maybe [246] they'll be like some AI agent node and [248] then there'll be like five million uh [251] you know sub agents and every one of [253] those sub agents will call like another [255] five million Sub sub agents and so on [258] and so on and so forth until a meteor [260] comes and and obliterates us for the [261] second time um these systems you know [264] they look really pretty but I'll be real [265] they don't actually most of the time [267] drive a business outcome because they're [269] a little too Flex ible most of the time [270] if you want to drive money using no code [272] platforms you have to be a little bit [273] more rigid and this is uh at least in my [276] experience the the perfect mixture of [278] the two okay so for now I'm just going [280] to add a manual trigger node and we're [282] just doing that because obviously we [283] want to be able to test this um I'm just [286] going to call this test and then so we [289] got a kind of of a couple options here [290] I'm going to start with the Google [291] Slides approach but um you know we'll [294] quickly segue into pandadoc let me give [295] you guys a quick example of what like a [298] good Google Slides template might be [300] this's this one over here just called um [302] your big idea made to stick so I'm just [304] going to take a quick peek at that and [306] basically what I'm going to do is I'm [307] just going to touch up a template like [308] this probably this exact one to be [310] honest make a make a few changes to it [312] and then what I'm going to do is I'm [312] going to replace this stuff with um [314] variables if we jump into good God I [317] have so many tabs all over the place if [319] we jump into Google sides there's this [321] one node called replace text in a [323] presentation so we're actually going to [324] use that to like replace the the various [326] text fields and so we want them to be [327] very unique I'm just going to wrap them [328] in these double quotes which we're all [330] used to for Json formatting for [331] convenience purposes and these are the [332] variables I'm going to be replacing with [334] text so yeah you know I I have the [336] proposal template over here let me touch [337] this up really quickly and then I'll [339] show you guys basically my my ID and [341] what this is going to look like okay [342] great just touch this up to give you [343] guys an example of what a proposal like [345] this might look like so you can see [346] they're pretty high quality they look [347] pretty sexy um I wrote one for my own [349] writing my own content writing company [350] one second copy so this is a [352] hypothetical proposal for Leen system [354] for one second copy um as you can see [356] we're going to customize the hell out of [357] it um all of this is going to be a [358] generator there's going to be nothing [359] here that's that's human written um [361] aside from just some templated bits show [363] you in a second but lead gen system for [364] 1 second copy a simple scalable lead [366] generation system built to help grow [367] your content efforts and connect you [368] with the right people the problem right [371] now one second copy is struggling with [372] an inability to generate qualified leads [374] the majority of your new clients are [375] referral based which while always nice [377] to have is not scalable nor is it [378] reliable building an alternative [380] strategy when that allows you to take [381] leads from cold to close is vital to the [383] health longevity the company it's what [384] we're going to help you with the [386] solution after thinking deeply on things [387] here's what we've come up with number [389] one cold outbound lead gen will put in [391] place a robust cold email based system [393] for you based on best [395] practices let me just change that for [397] you using best practices client [399] reactivation system will build a simple [401] but High Roi reactivation system will [402] let you extract value from pre-existing [404] clients best-in-class sales training [406] will train your team with worldclass [407] setting and closing mechanisms this is [408] pretty similar honestly to a proposal [411] that I would send when I'm selling cold [412] email um obviously I do it in padoc [414] because I can collect payment but yeah [415] you know I'm not I'm not going to touch [416] on everything for you just note that [418] there's a scope section where we discuss [420] specifically what the client's going to [421] get there's a timeline section over here [423] where they can actually see the progress [424] of the project this these are all going [426] to be a generated and there's even like [428] a little cost section over here um as [430] well as like a little thank you page and [432] you know next steps instructions [433] kickoffs and so on so forth so what if I [435] told you um by the end of this video [437] we'll be able to generate this whole [438] system in like 5 Seconds we'll fill out [440] a quick form form is going to include [442] you know maybe 30 seconds of questions a [443] couple bullet points then at the end of [445] it we're going to have this whole this [446] whole thing basically good to go the [448] value here is you could literally whip [449] up a proposal while you're on the phone [451] with somebody and before you're even [453] done the call you can send them the [455] proposal it'll look [456] extraordinarily smooth and sleek and [459] really high-end and this is just you [460] know it's it's a great closing mechanism [462] but moreover it's just a great way to to [463] learn an aen I'd say so this is what it [467] looks like actually instantiated um this [469] is what it looks like when we don't as [471] you see I've used a bunch of variables [472] here like proposal title description [474] name one paragraph problem summary [476] solution heading one solution heading 2 [478] solution heading 3 [480] short scope Title One short scope title [482] two short scope title three basically [484] what we're going to have to do is we're [485] going to have to replace all these okay [486] and I just realized this is 2024 I don't [489] know 2014 here I'm just going to go 2025 [491] for Simplicity um but you know we're [493] basically just going have to replace [494] everything within these um little you [496] know double brackets and I'm using [498] double brackets here because you know uh [501] these are these are pretty unique right [502] this is that Google Slides node from a [503] moment ago if we wanted to replace text [506] in one of these um you know like what's [508] the likelihood that we'd run into to [509] what's called a collision where we're [511] replacing texts in a variable that we [513] didn't want pretty dang low right okay [516] so here's the example proposal this is [517] what I'm going to be using it let me [518] just change the name to make it even [519] more immediately obvious let's call it [521] example proposal template and let me [524] just zoom out here and make sure we're [525] on the same page what I'm going to do is [527] I'm going to just call this replace text [531] and you can see it's already called [532] replace text but I personally like to do [534] this whenever I add a new module [536] whenever I'm actually doing a live build [538] because it reminds me okay like what is [539] is the flow what is the sequence here [541] otherwise I end up with 30 or 40 module [543] uh 30 or 40 nodes I should say that's [546] the terminology in NN um and then you [548] know like it's Google Slides one Google [550] Slides 2 Google Slides 3 it just gets [552] really annoying and complicated so the [554] first thing we got to do is we got to [555] connect our Google Slides account so I'm [556] going to head over to create new [557] credential it's going to open up ooth [559] redirect URL in my case because I'm [561] using um the cloud hosted offering ofn [564] but if you're unsure of how to do this [565] just open the docs they going to open a [566] page over here and then go down to [569] slides just command F finding it [572] basically what you have to do is you [574] have to create a Google Cloud console [576] account go to API and services library [578] and then you have to copy and paste like [580] a like a like a scope code or something [583] so I'm just going to go over [584] to uh my other email address over [588] here and basically in order to do this I [590] actually need to go and I need to create [591] a new project so I'm going to create a [592] new project here I'm going to call this [595] naden um let's just call it YouTube [598] we'll create [600] and as you can see I already have some [601] ooth 2 client IDs um for my for my new [604] project what I'm going to have to do is [605] I'm going have to create new credentials [607] going call this a web app I believe it's [609] a web application at least as of the [611] time of this writing call it NN for [614] YouTube where we're going to have to do [615] is you see where it says authorized [617] redirect Uris and stuff we're going to [618] have to fill that in with information [620] from nadn so you see it says ooth [622] redirect URL so we're going to go down [625] here and then I'll go authorized [626] redirect Ur I paste that in and then we [628] got to click on on that button okay [631] great so now we have ooth NN for YouTube [634] I should say so what do we have here we [635] have a client ID we have a client secret [637] so I'm going to copy this I'm going go [639] back and then paste it where it says [640] client ID then client secret I'm going [642] to copy that paste it where it says [644] client secret now it'll ask me to sign [646] in with Google so I'm just going to open [648] up a new little tab here we allow naden [652] to do all this fun [654] stuff and the window can now be closed [656] beautiful we are now connected I'm just [658] going to change this to YouTube so that [660] I know later when I'm building hey this [661] is a this is a YouTube credential and [664] voila we're now connected we're [665] basically good to go so the next step is [667] we need to feed in What's called the [668] presentation ID the presentation ID in [670] Google Slides is always just going to be [671] this long string after back slash d [674] slash and then before a slash edit so [676] I'm just going to double click on this [677] copy it then paste it in here okay now I [681] just want to test anytime I'm building a [683] new flow right just thinking out loud [686] here I always want to test and make sure [687] that the node that I am operating on [689] does what I expect it to do so I expect [691] this node to replace some text but why [693] don't I why don't I actually be sure [695] there's a match case button page names [697] or IDs button replace text button I [700] don't actually know how any of this [701] works hypothetically so why don't I just [702] try feeding in one of these variables [705] clicking on this button and then uh I [706] don't know replacing it with [708] something let's click test [711] step and it looks like something [712] happened if I go back to my example [714] proposal you did I change anything no it [716] doesn't look like it so uh you know what [719] what happened here basically well [721] clearly there's some sort of gap between [722] what I want to do and then what [723] ultimately ended up occurring so let me [726] refresh this puppy um I don't actually [730] know why that didn't happen so I'm [731] actually going to do a little bit of [732] debugging right now or this should just [734] say hey oh actually oh my bad I've [737] actually mixed these two up replace text [739] should go over here and then this should [741] be hey okay great let's test this step [744] said back over here oh okay well voila [746] looks like I figured out the problem [749] um as you guys could see you know [751] anybody that tries to build things in a [753] no code to will inevitably run into [755] issues what's important is that you uh I [757] don't know you you maintain a good [759] attitude so it seems pretty simple we [761] have like a pretty good pattern here all [763] I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be [764] pasting in the variables and then I'm [765] going to be replacing the text right [767] cool so I've sort of verified now that [768] the main function of my flow which is [770] the text replacement that works so in my [772] head now I'm like okay let's actually [774] work backward now that I've verified I [775] can do the thing at the end which is the [776] important thing I can like create a [778] template logically the next thing I do [780] working backwards is I have to generate [782] all of the AI stuff right so that's sort [784] of what I'm going to do in the middle [785] section so what I'm going to do first is [787] I'm going to look up uh open Ai and then [790] the specific node I'm going to want is [793] just the message a model under text [795] actions now under credential if you [797] haven't connected a credential before [798] you have to click create new credential [800] and then you have to go over to open [802] ai's um [804] API you need to create an account if you [806] haven't already done so but you're going [808] to have to go over to your your open AI [809] account create an account open your API [812] Keys page create a new secret key then [815] you're going to have to add two things [816] you're going to have to add what's [817] called a uh we're going to have to add a [820] name so I already have YouTube but I'm [822] just going to go YouTube NN and we'll [824] just go Feb 4 it's important for me to [826] show you guys how to actually create [827] these keys right and then we just copy [829] this we head over here back to API key [833] paste that in and you don't need to [834] paste in the organization ad anymore you [836] you used to have to but you no longer [837] have to going to call this YouTube Feb 4 [840] save [841] that and then voila we now have our [843] second Connection open a the resource [845] we're going to be asking for is text [847] operation is going to be message and [848] model the model we're going to have to [849] choose my recommendation for you is at [851] the time of this recording would be GPT [853] 40 um February the 4th 20125 this just [855] happens to be like the best combination [858] of cost Effectiveness and then quality [859] if you use something dumber than this I [861] find the quality the writing will not be [862] as anywhere near as good okay now let's [865] just kind of take a couple steps back [866] here um what I wanted to do is I wanted [868] to do basically this but obviously we're [871] going to have to like you know we're [872] going to have to feed it some [873] information to have it do this right so [876] keep in mind I haven't actually created [877] the form that I'm going to be filling [878] out yet but I want it to be able to [880] generate a bunch of this this text I [882] want it to do so with like my tone of [884] voice and so on and so forth so you know [886] logically the simplest way that I can [888] get it to produce the stuff that I want [889] it to is by giving it an example of me [892] producing exactly what it is that I [893] wanted to and because I had the [895] foresight to actually write out a full [897] proposal I actually have all of the data [898] that I want in order to train this model [900] or you know in context train it's called [903] um which is where you just provide a [904] bunch of examples to it okay so [906] basically what I'm going to do is I'm [907] going to use I'm going to have it output [909] stuff in Json I'm going to use this as [911] the variable name and then I'll just use [912] this as the value in a training run and [914] then I'll just ask it to do it again and [916] uh yeah we're going to build the prompt [917] that way pretty intelligently and then [919] at the end you know instead of it being [921] super variable and like I don't know [923] having its own opinions on stuff and [925] answering us with like I'd love to help [926] you it's not going to be like an agent [929] say what this model is going to be is [930] it's going to be almost like an API [932] endpoint that we call or some service [935] that we request and it's just going to [936] send us back a beautifully formatted [938] proposal or the data for a beautifully [939] formatted proposal so let me show you [942] guys how to actually do that in practice [943] um first thing we're going to want to do [944] is we're going to want to create a [945] system prompt so I'll say you are a [947] helpful intelligent writing assistant [949] this is just how the the model [950] identifies for the most part I'm going [952] to want to Output the content as Json [954] and click add message and next up we're [957] going to want to add a user prompt now [959] the user prompt is basically where you [960] just say hey here's what I want you to [961] do okay and that's all that the first [965] user prompt is what we do after is we [967] had a second user prompt where we [969] actually give it an example of one input [971] then we have an assistant prompt come [972] and give us an example of one output and [975] then finally we actually feed it in our [976] real live data and we actually ask it to [978] like create something for us so let me [981] show you guys what this looks like in [982] practice um I haven't pre-written this [984] or anything I'm just going to show you [985] exactly how I would write it if I were [987] in the situation the first thing I want [988] to do is I just want to give it the [989] instructions so your task is to generate [992] a [993] proposal using input data from a form [997] this proposal should be highly [1000] customized to the [1003] prospect considering we're going to be [1006] sending [1008] prospects we go highly customized [1011] specific and high quality considering [1014] we're going to be sending it immediately [1017] after you are done The Proposal template [1020] we're using has many fields you must [1023] return these fields in one Json [1027] object use this format okay now I'm [1030] going to give it a big list of all of [1032] the fields that I want so the first one [1034] is proposal title so let's go back here [1037] let's go proposal [1039] oops we'll go proposal [1042] title the next one up is going to be a [1045] description name so I'll go description [1048] name [1050] and again this is exactly what I would [1051] do if I were actually building this out [1052] the next would be one paragraph problem [1054] summary one paragraph [1057] problem summary solution heading two we [1059] go like this solution description two we [1061] go like this and we'll also do Milestone [1063] description one so also description one [1066] okay so we now have all of the fields in [1068] our Json template beautiful we've given [1071] it quite a lot so just to make my life a [1073] little bit simpler I'm just going to go [1074] over to Jason for.org paste this in [1077] format this this way is just going to be [1079] a lot easier for me to keep track of and [1081] then paste it like with this nice new [1082] line format here the value in this is [1085] now um I don't know it's just it's a lot [1086] simpler for me to see to glance it's a [1088] lot more maintainable um and yeah the [1091] next thing I'm always doing or I started [1093] always doing about six months ago is I [1095] started just providing it a list of [1096] rules so use a Spartan casual tone of [1100] voice I will say [1104] um yeah I mean that's pretty much it use [1107] a Spartan casual of voice be to the [1111] point point and professional but [1114] professional you're [1116] writing assume you're writing to a [1121] sophisticated audience there we go okay [1124] great so this is these are going to be [1126] my instructions your task is generate a [1127] proposal using input data from a form [1129] this proposal should be highly [1130] customized specific and high quality [1132] considering we're going to be sending it [1133] immediately after you're done proposal [1134] template we're using as many fields you [1136] must return these fields in one Js o n [1139] object use this format this looks very [1142] clean oh um you I'm finally going to say [1145] ensure that all fields are filled out do [1148] not miss a [1150] field or leave [1152] any variables empty cool so that is our [1157] main user prompt what we're going to do [1158] now is we're going to feed in an example [1159] of the form data and then feed in an [1161] example of the output so I'm actually [1163] lucky I already have an example of the [1165] output if you think about it the output [1168] is [1169] over [1172] here then I just need to go back in I [1174] need to copy and paste all the output [1176] from the real proposal so I'm just going [1178] to do that really quickly okay just gave [1180] it a quick example of all of the data [1182] from that finished product and now we [1184] just have to kind of think a little bit [1185] and figure out what sort of fields we [1187] want on our form uh because the way that [1189] this is going to work is we're going to [1191] trigger this based off of a form um [1193] input right I'm just going to use an NN [1195] form for now but you can use really any [1197] form that has a web hook but you think [1198] about it like in order to get this [1200] information in order to you know um and [1202] I'm always starting with the end result [1203] here I always start with the form and I [1204] figure out exactly what information [1205] sorry I always start with the proposal [1207] and I figure out what information I need [1209] I'm moving backwards from that because I [1211] care more about what the customer sees [1212] than anything else that's what a lot of [1213] people I think sort of mess up they [1216] start with like the data they think [1217] would be nice to have and they're like [1218] okay what can I do with this data it's [1220] like no no don't do that start with the [1222] end product the thing that like you know [1223] is going to make a customer want to buy [1225] from you and then work your way backward [1226] from that and then ask yourself okay [1227] what do I need to ask the customer [1229] so uh here's some things that here here [1231] are some things that I need to ask the [1232] customer obviously I need to know the [1232] company name right like duh so I'm going [1235] to go company [1238] name let me see what other what other [1240] information do we need uh we need like a [1242] project description but probably the [1245] simplest way to do it is with a [1247] problem and then a [1250] solution so what I'm actually going to [1252] do is I'm going to [1253] have um the form have like a problem [1256] statement where basically it's like hey [1257] so what's the problem there suffering [1259] from hey so what are the solutions [1260] you're going to pitch and then we'll [1261] just go bullet points cold email Legion [1263] Cent reactivation System Best in Class [1264] sales training [1266] easy okay like what sort of like line [1268] item scope are we [1273] talking and then um you know like how [1276] soon [1278] basically and then it's just going to [1280] take the date and then work this out and [1282] then we'll also have like a little cost [1284] and I'll just use cost as like a string [1286] for now um but you know feel free to do [1287] it as a number if you have some [1288] formatting [1289] requirements so this is the data that [1291] we're going to be feeding in with the [1292] format but okay so we're going to feed [1293] in the company name problem the solution [1295] the scope how soon and the cost so the [1298] example as we see is um let's just go [1301] deposit cost and we can just multiply [1303] the that by two to get the total cost [1305] we'll go [1307] 1,845 um that multipli by two is what [1309] 3,690 something like that how soon well [1312] let's see what did I put as my example [1314] here for my [1315] training uh February the 8th to Mar to [1317] April the 1st 202 so that's one so [1320] that's two months okay so we'll go two [1322] months and I'm going to write in [1325] lowercase and I'm not going to use [1326] formatting and it would be very dumb and [1327] simple because I want to mirror what I [1329] think I and the sales team that is going [1332] to be using this form is going to use [1334] what's the scope um I'll show you [1336] exactly how I do [1338] this 1K per day cold [1341] email [1344] infra 30k leads [1348] and then four [1351] weekly Zoom sessions for sales training [1354] that's what they're going to get so I'm [1356] sure you guys can imagine this is [1358] totally something that you could just [1359] really quickly scribble as notes during [1361] a call right Prospect says something [1363] you're like okay yeah we're going to get [1364] this done and you know I mean the how [1366] long this take to do this is like what [1368] 50 characters or something like that you [1369] could realistically type that in like 10 [1371] seconds while you're talking to the [1373] customer um from there let's think about [1375] the solution [1378] so solution uh cold email Legion [1383] system client reactivation [1386] system and best inclass sales training [1390] for closing and then the problem they [1392] suffer [1394] from they can't generate leads [1396] everything is referral based right now [1398] cool done so this is the input that I'm [1401] going to be feeding in the model and [1403] then I'm going to say hey if I were to [1405] feed you in an input like this I want [1406] you to feed me an output that looks kind [1408] of like this okay now that we have that [1410] relationship in place what that means is [1412] I can feed in an an actual like real um [1416] piece of data and I'll fill all these [1418] variables in later um but uh well I [1421] guess I'm going to fill them in right [1422] now I'll fill them in right now with [1423] like an example uh that's a little bit [1425] different so instead of they can't [1426] generate leads let's say they're [1429] struggling making YouTube videos [1432] everything is [1433] really time intensive right now mostly [1436] because they don't have scripts solution [1440] let's do like AI script [1443] system AI script writing system scrapes [1449] um competitor YouTube vids for ideas and [1452] rephrases best performing [1455] titles then writes [1458] outlines the scope um we're going to get [1461] a form you can fill out to [1465] generate form you can fill out with [1467] competitors that adds them to a [1471] DB once per day DB is [1474] scraped and you get um however many [1479] people are in the [1480] sheet times however many people posted [1485] videos worth of [1490] outlines Max let's just say Max uh 200 [1493] per [1496] month how soon let's say two weeks and [1499] let me make the deposit cost [1502] $3,525 okay so now I have everything [1505] that I need to actually test this out on [1507] my little example here and I'll you know [1509] I'm just using this as a training [1510] example but let's run this through and [1512] let's see what [1514] happens so this is pretty intensive you [1517] know we got a lot of variables here we [1518] want to make sure it doesn't screw up so [1519] it's going to take it sweet ass time for [1522] sure you could also do things like um [1525] add uh frequency penalties presence [1527] penalties and so on and so forth if you [1529] wanted to be a little clearer about [1530] what's going on but basically I'm going [1533] to take all the variables from here and [1534] I'm just going to feed them into our [1535] Google [1536] slide there's one more thing that I [1538] believe we're going to have to do if you [1539] think about it like this Google slide [1540] here when I um ran it the first time I [1543] replaced proposal title with the word [1545] hey right so we can't actually do that [1547] because this is like one proposal [1549] template so realistically before we do [1550] this we're actually going to have to [1551] generate a new proposal template every [1553] time um but that's uh probably pretty [1555] easy to do we're going to walk through [1556] it together okay great so we just got [1558] the execution let's jump through and [1559] let's see what's going on just going to [1561] move over to Json view because it's a [1562] lot easier for me just to make sure that [1564] we have everything formatted correctly [1566] looks good we do have all the variables [1568] YouTube content efficien efficiency [1570] boost for left click so one thing that [1571] I'm seeing here is just [1574] um yeah we're going to need to provide [1575] it some information that we are a system [1578] basically context we are an automation [1581] no code agency that [1585] develops uh that [1587] develops [1590] systems revolving around growth Revenue [1593] Ops UTC there you go that'll make it a [1595] little bit simpler and probably a little [1597] bit more accurate for [1598] me but okay cool this looks oh uh one [1601] more thing is we need to feed in the [1602] current date right because November the [1603] 20th 2023 that doesn't really [1606] matter okay so why don't we do that one [1607] more [1609] time we'll go over here and we'll say um [1613] current date there we go cuz you know [1616] how soon 2 months like that doesn't [1618] really provide any context on its own so [1621] I'm just going to go Feb 4 2025 then [1624] we'll go 2 months then over here we're [1628] same thing we're going to say current [1630] date 4 2025 how soon two weeks deposit [1633] cost 3,525 they should fix the Milestone [1636] stuff Let's test it out I hope you guys [1639] see the value in me doing this live um [1641] this is very much more similar to what [1642] your actual build process would be like [1644] like you're not going to get all this in [1646] one shot right it's not like you're [1647] going to know hm guess I'm going to have [1648] these fields you're going to map it out [1650] perfectly send it and see the results [1652] realistically you're going to have like [1653] back and forth where you you test the [1654] output and you're like that's kind of [1655] missing this context I don't really know [1657] about that um and then you know go go [1659] back and forth in that [1661] way okay great yeah it looks pretty [1663] solid to me um I'm not seeing any major [1665] issues here so uh you know I could just [1667] feed this forward like we could just pin [1668] this output and I could just feed this [1670] forward into the replace the text node [1672] right but if you think about it if I do [1675] that I'm actually going to be replacing [1675] this so I don't actually want to do that [1677] like I don't want to replace the main [1678] template what I want to do is I want to [1679] replace a copy of the template so [1681] logically we should copy this um I don't [1684] see I didn't I didn't see anything in [1686] Google Slides where we could just like [1688] generate a new one so I imagine we'll [1691] probably be able to do this with Google [1692] Drive instead yeah with a copy of file [1695] tool so I'm going to do the copy of file [1697] tool and I'm actually going to copy the [1699] proposal duplicate it and then I'm going [1700] to update the the the new copy instead [1703] of the old one so in order to connect to [1705] this you have to create a new credential [1707] then you're just going to have to go [1708] through the same flow that we did before [1709] where you go into your Google CL console [1710] cloud account you create a new account [1712] um you you add a credential for nadn you [1715] have a client ID client secret and you [1716] got to put in the redirect URL there I [1718] already have one so I'm just going to [1719] exit out of that and just use my own [1721] Google Drive account what I'm going to [1723] want to do is I'm going to want to um [1724] resource file operation copy and if you [1726] think about it what I want is I just [1727] want that I want that proposal template [1729] right so I could select it manually or I [1732] could just copy in the ID and that's [1734] what I prefer to do just a little bit [1736] easier [1738] okay great and then the file name um I'm [1739] just going to feed in The Proposal title [1741] as the file name and for now we'll just [1743] copy this in the same folder let me see [1745] if there are any cool um options copies [1748] copy requires writer [1750] permission that's pretty interesting uh [1753] I don't think I'm going to do that now I [1754] just want them to have all of it then [1755] I'm going to test this so we've just [1758] created a new system which looks like uh [1760] sorry a new proposal called automated [1761] YouTube script system for left click [1762] nice um so what I'm going to do here is [1764] I'm actually just going to pin this then [1766] I'm going to replace the text but I'm [1768] going to do so using the ID from that so [1772] that's my presentation ID now I should [1773] be replacing the new one and if you [1776] think about it um what we just did is [1777] now we have a new ID so I can actually [1779] go and this is going to be my main [1781] example proposal template right so let [1783] me just actually paste in the ID of the [1785] new one that we just generated and as [1787] you can see it's just a it's a duplicate [1788] of the same one the only difference is [1790] we have um automated YouTube script [1792] system for left click written up here [1794] okay so now I'm just going to go back [1796] here and all I have to do is I I [1797] basically just have to go through um and [1800] then enumerate across the variable names [1803] like this um and then replace them with [1805] the text from this open AI node so like [1807] a quick example what I'll be doing is [1809] I'll be going proposal title then I'll [1811] just be feeding in um you know proposal [1813] Title Here Right not exactly rocket [1816] science um but you know it's going to be [1817] a little bit annoying because we got to [1818] go through and do this a bunch of times [1820] okay and then for now I'm just going to [1821] feed in um cost and I'll just make it$ [1823] 18850 hypothetically because we've [1826] stored we've hardcoded some variables in [1828] there earlier um but yeah I just [1830] finished mapping all them we should be [1831] good to go I'm going click test step [1832] we're going to see what [1833] happens we have a bunch of occurrences [1835] changed one the only difference is this [1838] last one which is cost says two that [1840] seems reasonable to me uh and where [1842] would be we' be right over here okay so [1844] automated YouTube script system for left [1846] click streamline YouTube content [1848] production with AI powered script [1849] writing that looks reasonable I don't [1850] really like that this is all like [1851] Capital case though to be honest so [1853] probably going to tell the model not to [1854] do [1855] that that looks good um these are [1858] looking a little too long so I'm just [1859] going to uh like go in and I'll tell it [1862] that the description should be shorter [1863] so you know aim for like two lines or [1865] something actually hold on a second I [1868] think I might have did I change the size [1869] of these I feel like I changed the size [1871] of [1872] these you know I might have just use a [1874] slightly larger size for the template um [1877] to be for for this to be honest I don't [1879] know I'll have to double check um okay [1881] let's go back here let's see what's [1883] going on so this looks good this one [1885] looks a little long so I'm just G to [1886] have to make sure it wres shorter that's [1887] fine yeah was about two weeks total [1889] turnaround times 10 days right that's [1891] fine 1850 today 1850 when it's finished [1894] got the thank you okay awesome so of [1897] this whole thing the only two things I [1898] didn't really like now that I'm I'm [1899] testing this and seeing it are I'm down [1901] here bottom right hand corner and just [1903] had a bunch of capital case um words so [1906] streamline YouTube content production I [1908] don't want this to be a title I just [1909] want this to be like a description right [1911] and then over here is just a little bit [1912] too long uh there probably ways that we [1915] could like dynamically change this there [1916] might be like a way to like [1917] automatically resize the the thing like [1921] ourselves instead of um having [1923] this having to sort of like do it [1925] manually that's fine I don't really care [1927] too much about that we could also like [1928] reduce the size of all these elements [1930] and reduce the line height and stuff [1931] just for safety so you know I mean this [1933] is more proposal template stuff but I'm [1935] just going to do it um just in case when [1938] don't we go down to 10 here we'll go 10 [1941] here we'll go 10 [1943] here you I'm not like a designer or [1946] anything so I'm sure designer [1948] uh a designer would have yelled at me by [1950] now why would you change that to size 10 [1953] how dare you I think it still looks [1955] pretty good um and then I'm going to go [1957] back over to our model and then you know [1960] just as like an input I'm going to make [1961] it a little bit [1963] shorter rule I'll say if a field is a [1970] description field contains the [1973] term description it should be no more [1977] than two lines [1979] cool that looks uh well I mean how's it [1982] going to conceptualize a line right [1983] let's see how many words was [1985] this I'm going to go word [1990] counter this was 91 uh sorry 14 words so [1993] maybe we'll go [1995] like no more than 10 words if we go 10 [1998] words each [2000] then I guess if I make them smaller like [2003] that's fine maybe we'll go no more than [2006] 14 words that's quite the [2008] constraint okay cool uh so just because [2011] we've run this like we' we've copied the [2013] file but it's a different file now like [2015] I'm going to want to copy it again so [2016] I'm going to unpin this data I'm just [2017] going to test the step we're now going [2019] to copy it to a new duplicate now it's [2022] been copied over as a new duplicate um [2025] oh you know what there's one more thing [2026] I got to do right I got to change the uh [2028] scope so it doesn't include [2030] the um you know if it is a description [2036] name do not not use [2039] Capital uh do not use title [2042] case Okay cool so now that now that we [2045] have that uh we should be able to you [2047] know like assuming that we fixed that um [2050] we've now copied it we can pin this as [2051] an output we are going to be using the [2054] old opena output but that's okay we're [2057] mapping this now so I'm just going to [2059] copy this over use that to open up my [2062] second example which going to be right [2064] over [2065] here and then I'm going to to test this [2069] it's going to go in and and replace [2072] everything let me just see if it looks a [2074] little better with a smaller text it [2075] does beautiful so actually this is this [2077] is fine we actually didn't need to [2078] shorten it at all um now that the text [2080] is smaller which is good and yeah yeah [2082] we're basically good to go on that front [2084] um I'll leave it there for [2086] now uh so the question is you know where [2088] do we go from here well my [2089] recommendation to you guys is uh this is [2091] this is a free option so I'm going to [2092] show you guys how to basically do [2093] everything I just did except in panad do [2095] instead and include like a payment [2096] module but my recommendation at this [2098] point is if you guys want to stick with [2099] the free option then just send them an [2101] email and have a link over to the uh [2103] proposal and then you know in your email [2105] just ask them if they want to pay um or [2108] you know maybe even be prevent uh pre [2110] proactive actually send them an invoice [2112] along with the proposal if they have [2113] their thumbs up and they're ready to [2114] move forward then just send them an [2115] invoice on your invoice maybe you have [2117] some like little legal ease by uh paying [2120] this thing you accept our terms and [2121] conditions terms and conditions goes to [2122] some page in your website that just has [2124] like some very very basic stuff uh you [2126] know I've never really been super [2127] worried about agreements and so on and [2129] so forth so uh like personally I [2131] probably wouldn't and the best news is [2132] we can do that together so I'm actually [2133] going to show you what that would look [2134] like or how I would build it out if I [2136] were working for my own company or a [2138] client I just head over to the Gmail [2140] node um what I would do is you could [2142] send directly or you could draft like [2143] feel free to do either um I'm just going [2145] to send for Simplicity you're going to [2147] have to connect yourself a credential [2149] same idea as before I think Gmail is a [2151] little bit easier because you can just [2152] sign in um but yeah you just click sign [2154] in with Google if you're on the cloud [2155] console account that'll autom [2157] automatically just connect to you sorry [2159] I'm a little out of breath cuz I had to [2160] run downstairs in between cuts and grab [2162] my groceries I'm just going to use Gmail [2164] account 3 and then uh you know if you [2166] think about it like you also do need an [2167] email address in the form right so I'm [2170] going to assume that this form input [2171] that we put together has an email [2172] address and we can fix it all up later [2174] but for now I'm just going to go uh [2175] Nicholas [2177] gmail.com and then I'm just going to [2179] paste [2181] in repr proposal for then I'll just [2185] include the company name uh which I [2188] think was just going to be left click [2192] yes then I'll say Hey you know whatever [2194] the first name is so maybe we'll go Nick [2197] I don't like how this is not multi-line [2199] can I make this multi-line yes um hey [2204] Nick thanks for the great call [2207] earlier I had a moment after our chat to [2211] put together a detailed [2213] proposal for you please take a look at [2217] your earliest convenience and let me [2219] know your [2221] thoughts you can you'll find it here and [2224] then I can just put in like the link now [2226] if you think about it this link is [2228] always going to be formatted the same [2230] it's just going to be this right [2232] here and then we'll be feeding in the [2235] presentation ID right over here so what [2238] can we do we can Source the variable and [2239] I'll just go json. uh presentation ID [2243] now we'll be filling it in like this and [2245] then voila you know we have like the the [2246] link in the email there are better ways [2248] to do this of course we could do HTML if [2251] you have any questions let me [2254] know I've also sent over an invoice for [2257] the [2258] amount um just to keep things [2263] convenient thanks [2268] neck okay I think I'm just going to [2269] leave it at that um and then this is [2272] this is PL text right you can actually [2274] do HTML as well if you do HTML um you'll [2276] actually be able to like add it as a [2278] link link in the email I'm not going to [2279] do that um just for Simplicity but yeah [2282] okay let me just turn a pen and [2284] attribution off cuz you already know [2286] they're trying to sneak their marketing [2288] in [2289] here okay and I'm going to go over to my [2291] personal email here and I see a link [2293] right right there hey Nick thanks for [2295] the great call had a moment after I chat [2296] to put together detailed proposal for [2297] you please take a look at your [2298] convenience let me your thoughts you'll [2299] find it here if you have any questions [2300] let me know I've also sent over uh I [2303] guess I've said let me know twice if [2304] I'll send over an invoice for the amount [2306] just to keep things convenient um docs [2308] so let me just change the let me know [2310] invoice for the project just to keep [2312] things convenient can get started [2314] anytime that's sorted let's just go [2317] anytime that's sorted to make it [2318] abundantly clear you got to pay cool so [2321] you give it a click what do you get [2322] voila you get your customized proposal [2325] right very clear very clean not at all [2328] complicated um and you know although the [2331] fact you know despite the fact that it [2332] doesn't really have like a way to sign [2334] um like you usually sign proposals uh [2336] it's free 100% % free doesn't cost you a [2338] scent and uh you still get like a very [2339] high quality impression on the client [2341] end which is valuable so if I were just [2343] to run this whole thing from start to [2344] finish and just like kind of [2346] eliminate all of these pins just to show [2349] you guys how it would work imagine I [2350] just you know we just had a conversation [2352] or something um I just click test [2354] workflow and you know I'll fill out the [2357] form in a sec but now the open AI model [2359] is like generating a bunch of text then [2361] the Google Drive is going to be copying [2363] it we're going to be replacing it and [2364] then it's going to send over [2365] Gmail if I just back it up a [2369] bit and just refresh my inbox and [2371] actually just check these Walmart [2374] deliveries um voila we have the same [2376] sort of email seems reasonably [2378] customized and then as you see you know [2380] we have like the title we have like the [2381] nicely fitting um uh sections here same [2385] over here we got like the sexy timeline [2388] we got the cost uh and you know I click [2390] this in one button right pretty simple [2392] pretty straightforward and this is good [2394] verification that this doesn't just work [2395] on like old data this works on new data [2397] too [2398] okay great so let's just do let's do one [2399] thing before we move it over to padoc [2401] let's um let's add a form and then let's [2403] just replace all the data here with like [2404] actual live data with the form and then [2406] we're also just going to want like a [2407] couple more pieces of information we're [2408] going to need like an email address to [2409] send it to [2410] obviously uh and if there's anything [2411] else that comes up I I'll deal with it [2413] but yeah we're just going to want to [2414] delete this trigger and then what we're [2416] going to do is we're just going to go [2416] nadn form on new nadn form event we're [2419] going to trigger the flow so let me [2421] connect this what I want to do is um I [2424] want to actually go and I want to create [2426] um you know I want to create this whole [2428] thing so what I usually call this I call [2429] this like a discovery call logging form [2432] or like a sale let's just go sales call [2433] logging [2435] form and this call logs a or sorry this [2438] form logs a sales call and automatically [2442] generates a [2444] proposal and now we can actually go [2446] through and just ask a bunch of [2447] questions so um you know let's [2450] say [2453] Prospect first name we'll go last name [2457] this is just useful information to have [2459] company name website all useful [2462] information to have um and let's [2465] actually get into what we were [2466] generating right if you think about it [2468] we generated a problem we generated a [2469] solution these are both questions so [2472] problem [2474] solution uh cost and was there anything [2478] else let me check out the open AI node [2480] really quickly check out the prompt [2482] company name problem solution scope [2485] there was a scope question and then how [2488] soon okay so we're gonna go back here [2491] we'll go scope and then finally we'll go [2495] how [2497] soon I'm make them all required for [2500] Simplicity because I don't want anybody [2502] on my team or somebody else's team to um [2505] have the possibility not to fill this [2507] information out like you should get the [2508] first name and the last name the company [2510] name and the website um you know at [2512] minimum I don't see a URL text area [2516] thing here which is unfortunate that's [2517] okay though anyway and then we're going [2519] to respond when the form is submitted um [2521] and then let me just check if there any [2523] options we want I want to take off the [2524] an attribution obviously and then we [2527] should be good okay great so now if I [2529] click test step what's going to happen [2531] I'm actually going to go get a form that [2532] I can fill all this data out with so for [2535] the purposes of this I'm going to say uh [2537] Peter sarf left click um go left click I [2542] problem I'm just actually going to go [2544] I'm going to paste in the problem [2547] statement that I hardcoded over [2549] here so let's do this [2553] one where the hell is that form [2559] Actually I don't even [2561] know that's wild uh well it's somewhere [2564] around here all right paste in the [2566] problem it should probably be a text [2568] area now that I'm thinking about but [2569] it's okay paste in the problem past in [2572] the solution past in the cost of 3525 [2576] right [2579] um we should also paste in the scope and [2582] I should readjust where the scope is [2583] just so that it's like a little simpler [2585] then how soon I think it was two weeks [2587] right okay cool so now I'm going to fill [2588] this out we're now going to get all [2590] these events right so now we have access [2592] to this and now we can just go down the [2593] the list we could just you know replace [2595] these variables with um replace these [2598] this Json I should say with the [2600] variables so it was the company name [2601] right over [2602] here um problem statement was you know [2606] dollar sign Jason uh and it looks like [2609] we are now using brackets but you don't [2611] have to you could use uh whatever you [2613] want so the problem statement here was [2615] just [2616] problem and oh this is company name [2618] because we split it right we had a space [2619] in between that makes sense then we have [2624] solution we're going to have a [2629] scope we're going to have a current date [2631] that's just going to be automatically [2632] filled in with [2635] now um we should also format that now [2638] that I'm thinking about it let's just [2640] format it [2642] as uh for common formats to laal string [2646] may be easier we might just go like to [2648] loal string think we might have an eror [2649] function in here is that way no I have [2652] no idea why but anyway um now we get the [2654] current date same format how soon was [2658] jason. how soon wonderful and then the [2660] cost just going to be json. cost perfect [2666] cool so we've now mapped all the [2667] variables in right we have all the real [2668] variables like actual live variables [2670] coming in with data so now I can [2673] actually run a test step and it's it's [2674] going to go through it's going to [2675] generate all the data for me similarly [2677] was doing before but now it's being [2678] triggered off of a form input as opposed [2680] to just like my own whims and desires [2682] and as amazing as my whims and desires [2683] are ladies and gentlemen form outputs [2686] are way better okay cool this is already [2689] mapping a variable this is going to be [2691] fixed so that makes sense replacing this [2693] text this looks good to me it says [2696] there's some error fetching options from [2697] Google sides so that's just because the [2699] presentation ID isn't hardcoded then [2700] I'll have a Gmail let's just make sure [2702] this Gmail um actually uses the you know [2705] everything that I want it to use so let [2707] me actually just go through test [2708] everything up to and including [2711] this so it'll take the open a text and [2714] then map it in here I'm just going to [2715] pin this make my life a little bit [2717] easier and then over here in Gmail uh [2719] you know I can just go down to on form [2721] submission and I can just grab the I did [2723] not ask for the email address did I that [2725] is so funny [2727] okay so you're going to want to ask for [2728] the email address despite the fact I [2729] don't have an email address I could [2730] still technically map this I'm just [2733] going to go is item. json. mail I'll [2736] capitalize it as well and then even [2739] though I don't have this I know that [2740] it's going to work when I go over here [2741] and then I add a new field called you [2743] know email right because it's just you [2746] know it's just code we're mapping at the [2747] end of the [2748] day uh like you know it's it's not [2750] necessarily going to work work until we [2752] fill out the form with the same output [2754] but for now we can um [2758] just modify this with uh email I'm we go [2762] Nick uh let's go Nicholas [2766] gmail.com there you go I'm just going to [2768] save this make sure it's good Jason [2770] good we will pin that as well I just [2773] like when I pin stuff I like pinning [2775] everything sue me okay and we're not [2778] going to have access to this right now I [2779] don't [2780] believe uh if I test this what [2783] happens yeah we don't have access to [2785] this right now unfortunately [2787] even there's item. Json email on the for [2790] well maybe we do [2796] actually maybe we do no it doesn't look [2800] like we do I think we have to rerun the [2801] whole flow if we want it unfortunate but [2803] is what it is um cool I'm just going to [2806] rerun this one more time uh just on my [2808] end make sure that everything checks out [2809] but then from here on out we're just [2810] going to add the we're going to swap [2811] this over to pandadoc for anybody [2813] interested in like leveling this up even [2814] more and then we're going to call it a [2815] day and as you can see this is not [2817] complicated flow there's like 1 2 3 four [2820] five realistically maybe six if you [2822] count like the invoice step there like [2823] six elements to this um from start to [2826] finish this one is just duplicating a [2828] duplicate which should honestly have [2829] some functionality built in which it [2831] doesn't so five if you want to call it [2832] that um but you know it's it's something [2834] that's really high Roy something that [2835] you can actually slot into a real [2837] business as opposed to just like looking [2839] cool and not actually doing anything for [2840] you so yeah let's test out this puppy [2842] one more time okay looks good we're [2844] going to submit [2847] nice we got the data let me just see if [2850] the website field is a text area it is [2852] it's [2853] okay um well we should have just gotten [2856] the form cool we did we got the email [2858] address and everything [2860] awesome cool if I go over here now do we [2862] still have access this no I think I need [2863] to rerun all this stuff right oh we do [2870] apparently unpin replace text to execute [2874] um we're going to have to unpin the old [2877] data unfortunately so I'm just gonna [2879] unpin some of the old data here and I [2881] should unpin because we're just [2882] replacing the [2885] replacement and then we'll pin [2888] this go now we'll test it cool looks [2892] good we automatically got the email and [2893] then we have our you know proposal and [2895] so on and so forth you might want to [2897] decrease the line height if you just [2898] copy my template and verbatim but feel [2900] free to do whatever makes you happy from [2902] here on out you know we're going to [2903] shift gears instead of replacing text in [2905] a Google we're going to do in pandadoc [2907] for people that are unfamiliar pandadoc [2909] is a really cool platform that allows [2911] you to you know take care uh of a lot of [2913] stuff that otherwise you'd sort of have [2915] to do manually pandadoc open here [2917] pandadoc as you can see is a little bit [2919] more professional looking than slides [2920] and so far there's a lot of stuff that [2922] we can add we can add you know text [2923] blocks video blocks image tables uh [2926] quotes uh page breaks table of content [2928] stuff like that this is just an example [2930] a proposal that I generated for a [2932] fictional company that I put together [2934] during my maker school training if you [2935] guys want to see how I put this together [2937] um you can find it all under maker [2938] School in classroom I do it all in month [2940] one but basically there's like a a big [2943] proposal template that I do um this [2945] proposal template uh you know like I I I [2948] run through the entire building process [2950] for people that might be interested [2952] anyway this is my proposal template uh [2953] as you can see here very similar idea [2955] anything in yellow is just a variable so [2957] uh what I'm doing is I'm like weaving in [2958] my own procedural logic with like [2961] templated text and stuff like that and [2962] then with AI generated text the reason [2964] why I'm doing it is cuz I just want to [2965] make sure that like the parts that are [2967] very valuable um I wrote myself I didn't [2969] have ai right the parts that are really [2971] valuable I want to just be clean and [2973] Powerful um anyway top to bottom [2975] everything works basically the same [2977] until we get to this section where it [2978] says your investment intelligent lead [2981] management system for left click right [2982] and we have a we have a price the way [2984] that this works is in paned you actually [2986] hook this up to a payment button and [2989] what happens is after the proposal is [2990] sent uh you basically sorry after you [2993] sign the proposal uh you have the option [2995] to pay immediately so it's great for [2997] collecting um I use this in order to [2999] scale my agency to 72k a month um I use [3002] this with 1 second copy where I scaled [3003] to 92k a month as well this is just like [3005] a much cleaner way of going about things [3007] than the way that most people handle [3009] agreements and stuff and I have a video [3010] on that um you know providing logic [3012] around my proposal stuff like that if [3014] you want to check it out in maker school [3015] as well I'll stop soft pitching that I [3017] think we're we're all adults here join [3019] my program if you want to get better at [3021] this sort of stuff um but yeah let me [3023] actually run you through what this looks [3025] like so I just C didn't like uh so in [3027] order to do this basically we need to we [3029] need to make a request to the API okay [3031] it's not enough for us to do a request [3033] to like a pandadoc note because there is [3034] no pandadoc node right I just checked [3037] out pandadoc you didn't find anything [3039] but you know you can do it with the HTP [3040] request they're 100% right on that now [3042] in order to get this done what we need [3044] to do is we need to feed in this giant [3046] super scary block of text that looks [3048] like this and it's basically just a ton [3050] of Json that we formatted to be um you [3053] know like curtail to this particular [3056] temp template so this template's a [3058] little bit different right we have [3059] tokens a value called client email [3061] sender email client scope one client [3062] scope 2 client scope 3 as you can see [3064] we're actually generating multiple [3065] client Scopes as opposed to just one and [3067] the reason why is because we are doing [3069] it like this right 1 2 3 4 five so I [3073] believe I'm I'm feeding in five in [3075] total um yeah looks like I'm feeding in [3077] five different scope items right how [3079] crazy is that then we have client [3080] company Center company client last name [3082] Center last name client timeline one [3084] timeline two timeline three these are [3086] all just takes on the same idea so [3088] really in order to modify the system [3089] that we previously had into a system [3090] that's capable of operating with this [3093] all we need to do is we just need to [3094] Output slightly different objects um and [3096] that will require us to just once adjust [3099] our AI generated copy so that you know [3102] the objects look like what this is [3103] expecting and then two we just need to [3105] update those um there's a place for us [3107] to put price and everything like that so [3108] I'm just going to go ahead and like do [3110] most of the gruntwork but I'm going to [3111] show you um while I do it uh like cut at [3113] several points just so you can see [3114] exactly what that looks like okay first [3116] things first I'm going to jump into the [3118] expression editor here and if you think [3120] about it I actually have like a title [3121] variable already so I'm just going to go [3123] proposal title right here and then [3125] there's client scope one client scope [3127] two client scope 3 client scope four [3129] client scope 5 so there five different [3130] client Scopes so I need to make sure [3131] that my object that I'm opening open a [3133] actually has five Scopes instead of just [3134] one just delete all of the Scopes [3136] descriptions we'll just change them all [3138] so that it's just the titles right make [3140] sure they're inside of the string okay [3142] and I just ran it using this API um for [3146] format uh this is a very long and kind [3148] of scary object for most so don't sweat [3151] the specifics too much if you guys want [3152] to learn how to make something like this [3153] for yourself I will be covering how to [3155] do API Connections in the next video but [3158] the end result is we end up with a [3159] proposal that looks something like this [3161] AI powered script writing system for [3162] left click uh you know here's some [3164] information about what the core problems [3166] are here are you know some pieces about [3169] the solution right as you can see my [3172] proposed solution to the problem above [3174] is as follows tack these challenges we [3175] propose an AI script writing system that [3177] automates your content creation workflow [3179] this system will scrape competitor to [3180] YouTube channels for Content ideas [3181] analyzing the best performing titles use [3183] AI to rephrase these titles and generate [3184] detailed outlines equip you with ready [3186] to use scripts to streamline your video [3187] production process I consider this [3189] reasonably straightforward and I'm [3190] confident I can do an outstanding job [3192] here for you if I wasn't I wouldn't have [3194] put together this proposal right we got [3196] all the scope stuff here we got the [3198] timeline uh and then over here this [3200] probably the most important part we have [3201] the price the way the price works we [3203] actually have 50% do up front 50% do at [3206] signup [3207] if we check our little payment node [3209] essentially what's going to happen is [3210] when we send this they're just going to [3211] receive an invoice um the moment that [3213] they sign for that amount of money and [3216] I'm seeing here that I think I used an [3217] extra capital L but you know we all [3220] can't be perfect uh yeah that's that's [3222] more or less it in a nutshell so you can [3224] take the same approach that I just [3225] showed you guys how to do today to [3227] virtually any proposal platform or [3228] virtually not even just a proposal [3230] platform but virtually any asset that [3231] you create cuz you know creating a [3233] Google slide if you think about it [3235] that's creating an asset that's basic [3236] basally creating like a lead magnet it's [3237] creating a PDF you could export that in [3239] a a number of different formats you can [3241] give it to somebody you could print [3242] freaking books with that right if you [3244] take this core idea here and then extend [3245] it you could do uh a number of things [3248] but I hope at this point I've at least [3249] just given you guys the knowledge to be [3250] able to build a simple AI powered flow [3253] without necessarily overwhelming [3254] yourself with uh you know talk about AI [3256] agents and stuff like that if you guys [3258] enjoy this video feel free to drop a [3260] comment down below I'd love to hear uh [3262] you know what about it you enjoyed as [3264] well as if you guys have any ideas or [3265] thoughts on future videos I should be [3266] making I do receive most of my video [3269] ideas from my communities and my um [3272] YouTube subscribers at this point so all [3274] that stuff is much appreciated otherwise [3275] if you guys do me a big solid like [3277] subscribe do all that fun YouTube stuff [3279] to pump me up to the top of the algo and [3280] I'll catch you on the next video cheers

Title: The REAL Reason You're not Signing AI Automation Clients
[0] today I'm going to tell you why you're [0] not getting any clients with AI [2] automation so logically you clicked on [4] this video that means you either run an [5] AI automation business or you're [6] planning on starting one and that's [8] great this is one of The Highest [8] Potential growth industries I'm [10] currently available but right now [11] there's this big elephant in the room [13] and that's where new entrance into the [14] market are investing time and capital [16] into starting a business and then they [18] start banging their heads on the wall [19] because they're not seeing any clients [20] not getting any results I scaled my own [22] AI automation business to $72,000 per [24] month and I now consult with over 1,400 [27] other AI automation businesses and [29] Freelancers so I've seen a lot of what [30] works and what doesn't today I'm going [32] to tell you exactly how to avoid that [33] and then start swimming in clients and [35] swimming in leads so there are three big [37] problems okay and these are the three [39] big problems why you're not getting any [41] clients with AI automation the first is [44] that you have what's called pipeline [48] famine if I could spell pipeline right [50] which I think I can then voila the [53] second major issue is that you have a [56] shiny object syndrome and I you know [59] hopefully I'm not hurting anybody's [60] feelings when I point it out like that [61] but a lot of you guys have shiny object [63] syndrome it's unfortunate but it's the [66] truth and then the third reason is you [68] guys are prioritizing learning over [71] doing and I'm going to cover each of [73] these in depth over the course of the [76] next few minutes um just so we're all on [78] the same page here but if you solve the [80] three big problems that I'm talking [81] about here today um you are going to be [83] able to scale a business substantially [84] easier substantially faster than [86] basically anybody else that's starting [87] uh you know getting into this industry [89] and not only that you're going to be [90] able to do so predictably as opposed to [92] it being sort of like a game of chance [93] where maybe you're fighting with [94] referrals or something like that um [96] you're you're going to be able to [97] frontload you know your lead gen and [98] start talking to to real customers and [100] and getting clients um much faster than [102] most other people my Approach works you [104] know it's been used by over a thousand [105] people to date um this is probably the [107] the straightest line path to succeeding [108] in this industry so not to toot my own [110] horn here let me actually just get into [111] the the information and you know if you [113] guys find it valuable you guys can [115] implement it and employ it for [116] yourselves so the first reason is called [117] pipeline famine basically to be clear if [120] you are not currently getting clients [121] with AI automation the only reason at [124] the end of the day that you are not [125] getting these clients is because you are [126] not talking to enough potential [128] customers basically you're in a state of [130] what I like to call pipeline famine okay [133] now for people that don't know and for [135] the People For Whom the term pipeline is [137] sort of new news um a pipeline [139] essentially just refers to all of the [140] marketing and sales activities of your [142] business and in AI automation because [144] it's so technical we tend to forget a [146] lot about this pipeline because we spend [147] our focus more on like the technical [149] shiny objects around us like the systems [151] that we build the no code tools that [153] we're we're using and learning and so on [154] and so forth but let me be clear in that [157] you know whether it's an AI automation [158] agency or like a local Services Agency [160] or an HVAC company or a plumbing company [162] or the next Uber whatever the only thing [164] that you need in order to have a [166] business is not like the product itself [169] because a product actually doesn't [170] matter what matters is the people that [172] were going to consume whatever product [174] you provide them and so that's what I [175] like to call the pipeline so your [177] pipeline's a foundation of your business [179] if you don't have that Foundation [180] Nothing Else Matters okay we could not [182] we we could have the most amazing [183] product in the world you could make the [185] gpt7 which you know artificial general [187] intelligence take over the world [188] whatever I don't know you're trying to [189] sell some amazing product here but if [191] you don't have a single buyer what you [193] have is not is not a business you are [194] barely operating a hobby and I don't say [196] this to be super harsh um I just say [198] this to be realistic this is the the [200] number one bottleneck and the major [201] issue that most people that I consult [203] with on a daily bases have they just [204] don't have any opportunities because [205] they don't have any opportunities they [206] don't really have a business doesn't [208] matter if you have the most amazing [209] product you can't sell to anybody it [210] doesn't matter so uh yeah you could have [212] nothing else in the world and I think [214] there are a lot of people that have [215] started a automation business that don't [217] have any skills in this industry okay no [219] skills no website no case studies no [222] experience no no actual systems [224] knowledge at all but they just talk to [226] enough customers long enough and then [227] they eventually win and they beat out [229] people that that focus on um these [231] instead okay uh extremely talented [234] people often never go anywhere and it's [236] simply because they don't have the [237] opportunities to do so you could be the [239] most you know talented Smart Genius [242] technically competent person on planet [243] Earth but if you just don't have a way [245] to convert that knowledge into some sort [246] of dollar value at the end of the day uh [248] it doesn't matter and and you're not [250] really going to be able to start any [251] sort of business so I was going to draw [253] this and I'm sort of like trying to [254] figure out exactly the best content [256] delivery mechanism for this between [257] drawing and then slideshowing right now [258] so bear with me but essentially the way [260] that I see it is pipelines marketing [263] oper generating opportunities these are [265] the the base of your pyramid okay so you [267] know if you think about our pyramid we [269] we have kind of three parts here one 2 [273] three the first is [277] marketing this gets people in through [279] the door and what you'll see is this is [280] actually sort of um opposed to how most [282] people pitch this most people kind of [284] pitch this as a funnel okay which is [286] like an inverse thing with marketing at [287] the top kind of sales in the middle and [289] then you know the business to the end [290] but I like to think of it as the [291] foundation okay so this is all of like [294] your [296] Leen it's all of uh I don't know like [299] maybe your your outbound so outbound [300] just refers to calls um text messages [303] DMS um you know video sends that sort of [305] stuff um over here is is your [309] sales so sales might be like the actual [312] I don't know the the the closing calls [314] that you jump [316] on um you know what are called discos or [318] Discovery calls might be the setting of [321] the appointments and so on and so forth [323] then up here you have your [325] fulfillment fulfillment is where you [327] actually deliver the thing um that you [328] know you promise the customer you would [330] so in the AI automation space usually [332] this is like the system right this is [334] some sort of uh no code Builder usually [336] naden make.com zappy or that sort of [338] stuff you put together a beautiful [340] system that delivers something to them [341] maybe it's like I don't know uh outbound [343] lead generation system maybe it's some [345] sort of proposal generator system maybe [346] it's some sort of CRM right that's the F [349] foma but I just want you guys to look at [350] the building okay if I if if we just [352] break this building down and if I use a [354] different color cuz I want to make this [355] a little bit sexy how much of this is [357] actually related to like like like how [358] much of this is after you get a client [360] realistically um only the very top of [362] this pyramid is actually like you [364] getting the client uh you know the [366] client having have sorry a prospect [368] having transformed into a client like [370] you know the the person is only a client [372] here when you're selling them they're [374] not a client when you're marketing [375] they're not a client I just want you to [377] look at like the total volume of this [378] triangle okay or um what should I say [380] surface area of this of this big [382] triangle the surface area of this [384] section right here like logically is [387] like one nth of this whole thing [390] okay it's it's it's like one nth I mean [392] I I could run the math on this I'm sure [394] but I mean like if you just count up all [396] of the you know centimeters or square [398] inches or whatever the hell you want to [399] use as a unit of measurement here this [401] pyramid uh you know 8 nths of it is the [404] sales and marketing and what what people [407] tend to do is they do the opposite they [408] make they they spend eight nths of their [410] time on the Fulfillment and then they [412] only spend one nth of their time on the [413] sales and the marketing and then they [415] wonder why the hell they aren't getting [416] any clients they aren't really getting [417] any customers so this is how you're [418] going to want to concept ize your [419] business you're going to spend the vast [421] overwhelming majority of your time on [423] sales and marketing opportunities and [425] you know because the widest Foundation [428] of this whole thing is marketing you're [429] going to want to spend like a [429] proportional amount of time on the [431] marketing especially when you get [432] started so this is fantastic and it's [434] amazing um I'm going to show you guys [436] how to actually do this step by step in [437] a second but um you know essentially [440] this is marketing it's leaden it's cold [442] calling it's cold dming um if you just [443] started a business N Out of the 10 hours [445] you spent on it should be generating [447] opportunities that's 90% as opposed to [449] spending 5 to 10% you're going to want [451] to literally multiply the amount of time [453] you are currently dedicating to this and [454] most likely you know for everybody [456] that's watching this is not have not yet [458] have a customer that's planning on doing [459] so you're going to want to spend at [461] least 10 to 20 times the amount of time [463] that you are currently spending on sales [465] and marketing if you really want to [466] succeed in and grow so uh what actually [469] matters for us here is you know not just [471] a bunch of theory because at the end of [472] the day uh we could spend all day [473] learning we could spend no time doing [475] and we'd be no better off um and that's [477] one of the things I'm going to cover in [478] a minute let me actually show you guys [479] how to generate more opportunities step [481] by step this is like step byep exactly [483] what I and many other AI automation [484] companies in the space are doing right [486] now so here are the steps that I would [487] take if I was currently at the start [489] line of an AI automation business and I [491] wanted to get more customers and more [493] clients I wanted to solve this big [494] problem the first thing that I would do [496] is that I would focus on outbound [498] activities outbound activities are just [500] things that you are sending out to other [502] people and you usually don't have any [504] pre-existing connection to them this is [506] the simplest most scalable way to [508] acquire customers with usually as [510] minimal a cost as humanly possible aside [512] from your time that is available when [514] you are beginning a business so um you [516] are reaching out to people to sell a [518] service the only need most of the time [521] is time or you know time with a little [523] bit of money sprinkled in think about it [524] like I don't know you could spend two [527] hours per day three hours per day [529] sending cold emails or something like [530] that um you know in terms of the total [532] amount of money that you spend that day [534] doing it it might be $2 or $3 right uh [536] most of these cold email platforms are [537] like you know between $50 to $100 or so [539] so so uh you know $50 to $1100 divided [541] by 30 days a month it's like you know [543] $1.5 to $3 plus the cost of leads you [545] spend $3 a day but then maybe two or [547] three hours of your time doing this um [549] and you know for a lot of businesses at [551] the start line that's a worthwhile [552] trade-off to make because they have more [553] time than they have money so here's [555] here's you know a way a very simple way [557] to shift 90% of your time to outbound [559] activities first thing you want to do is [561] you want to send 10 customized DMS per [563] day across [565] LinkedIn Twitter and x and Instagram my [568] recommendation and what I just talked [570] about in my last video so feel free to [571] check that out if you'd like is to [573] record high quality sales videos where [575] you actually solve a problem for the [576] customer before they've asked you then [579] what you do is you take that video you [581] customize the first line of your email [583] or something like that and then you send [584] it out to them and say hey I just solve [585] this problem for you in the video what [587] you do is you basically go through their [589] website you go through a system that [591] they have some funnel let's say if [592] they're maybe like a coach or consultant [593] on YouTube whatever the hell and you [595] give them some value before you make any [597] sort of ask another thing you can do [600] right now in order to shift that [601] outbound um activity ratio to you know [603] an 80 90% is you could set up cold email [606] infrastructure using platforms like [607] instantly and Apollo you could send [610] hundreds of cold emails per day and then [612] just spend an hour every morning going [613] through replies split testing campaigns [615] Etc everybody that's winning in my [617] community not everybody but the vast [618] majority of people that are are winning [620] in my communities they're doing this [621] right now um it's over 1400 uh you know [623] AI automation businesses the vast [625] majority of ones that are winning are [627] frontloading cold email and they're [628] talking to a thousand plus people a day [630] and they spend most of their time [631] iterating campaigns rewriting copy and [633] and that sort of stuff you can also this [636] is my big recommendation if you're a [637] total newbie to this you create a [639] profile on a freelancing website like [641] upwork and you can just send 10 [642] proposals per day okay same sort of idea [644] here you record highquality sales videos [646] where you solve a problem for the [647] customer before they've asked you [648] anything so this um this you know these [651] are very similar skills if you get good [653] at one of these you can very easily [654] transfer it over to another this right [656] over here 10 per day might realistically [658] take you between 30 minutes to an hour [660] if every video is you know 2 to 3 [661] minutes and you spend an additional [662] minute like looking up the the customer [664] or something like that um this over here [666] could send 2 to 3 minutes uh same same [668] deal 30 minutes to an hour this is 2 [670] hours and 2 hours that's 4 hours this [673] might be another hour realistically you [674] spend 5 hours of your 6-h hour workday [677] or something like that on uh outbound [679] and then you reserve the other hour for [681] following up with clients fulfilling [682] client requests that sort of stuff you [684] are very well positioned to get your [686] first few customers and get the ball [687] rolling and once the ball is rolling [689] then you can start Shifting the amount [691] of time you're spending on Outreach so [692] that maybe more of it is accommodating [693] to to client fulfillment but but don't [695] do that before cuz right now your skills [697] with the tools don't matter um you know [699] which tool you're using don't matter you [701] don't need to up skill you don't need to [702] up level the vast majority what you [703] really should be doing is you should [704] just be doing Outreach okay we're not [706] trying to make a billion dollar business [707] here we're just trying to help you get [708] to you know two three four 5K a month [711] another thing that you can do is you can [713] do what's called Network reactivation [716] you guys aren't familiar with network [717] reactivation it's the concept where we [719] actually have a lot of value buried in [721] our contact Network our Rolo deck so to [724] speak and that value rarely gets used or [726] exercised so if you've ever had any sort [728] of job in you know a technical industry [730] or if you've done any sort of [732] freelancing or if you've operated a [734] previous business or if you've done [735] anything like that you will likely have [736] contacts my recommendation is to use the [738] hormos method and reach out to them [740] hormos uh being Alex hormos he had a I [743] don't know I don't know if this is on a [744] podcast or something but it was sort of [745] a brief throwaway line or maybe a short [746] reel where he basically said here's what [748] you do you go through your current [749] Network right now you identify contacts [751] that own businesses freelance or have [753] worked with you before then you just [755] reach out to them and you check in you [756] say hey how's it going I know we haven't [757] talked in a while like what's going on [758] how are you doing what are you up to [759] these days I'd love to check in you know [761] I think we could offer some mutual value [762] to each other whatever you customize the [763] hell out of your communicate you know if [765] you can jump on a call and do that if [767] you have old clients this is the best [769] because old clients have already spent [770] money with you okay then all you do is [773] when they ask you what you're doing tell [774] them and then ask hey do you know anyone [777] that could benefit from what I am [778] building right now now this is a soft [780] pitch what I mean by this is you're not [782] actually pitching them directly what [783] you're doing is you're asking them if [785] they know anybody they might be [785] interested in what you are selling and [787] as a result uh if they are interested in [788] what you are selling they will say oh [789] well I'm interested in what you're [790] selling or H you know maybe that would [791] be interesting for me and then if [793] they're not then they can scour the [794] network and then if they're still super [796] not and they don't have anybody in their [797] Network then they can just tell you no [798] you preserve the relationship while [800] still allowing you uh you know an [802] opportunity to to reactivate your your [804] network this is a very simple example [805] you can obviously structure this however [807] much you want um but I found a lot of [808] the time this is you need to do when I [810] was running my uh content writing [811] company one second copy and we skill to [813] 92k a month a big chunk of that every [815] month 20 30k a month of our Revenue was [817] this we simply reached out to old [819] clients we did this every month we built [822] some sort of warm connection and we said [824] hey you know is there anybody that you [825] might know that might need content [826] writing services um and you know lo and [829] behold at the time you know this is uh [831] mid 2020 early 2021 a lot of people [834] needed content writing services and so [835] we sold like uh like [837] crazy the last thing to do [839] is to create content kind of like what [841] I'm doing right now think about it from [842] my perspective I'm not doing outbound [844] what I'm doing is inbound and I spend [845] the vast majority of my day now [847] producing content for inbound marketing [849] purposes so I'm doing the exact same [851] thing that I'm recommending you guys I'm [852] just doing in a slightly different [853] format but you can also do the same [854] thing I'm doing content is a fantastic [857] way to generate inbound leads it's one [859] of Nal Robie con's three ways of [860] Leverage um which I believe is like [862] labor media and code I should note that [865] this is only going to work if you have [866] some reason for people to listen to you [867] if you don't you know have anything [869] noteworthy no accomplishment like one of [871] the reasons I was able to grow on [872] YouTube so quickly is because i' [873] actually made money in the spaces that I [875] was talking about and so I had inherent [877] interest and inherent credibility in who [878] I was and what i' done if you don't [880] actually have this then you know don't [881] don't do content to start but if you do [883] have some sort of credibility if um I [885] don't know you started something in a [887] business in a vertical and you managed [889] to scale it to something impressive [890] maybe something that's like in the top [891] 1% of your field um then my [893] recommendation for you is just create [895] one piece of content per day and in that [897] content just give everybody the sauce [899] okay just tell them everything that you [901] did in order to get to where you are [902] right now and what you're planning on [904] doing as well in the future the value [905] that you will get out of your sharing [907] your secrets openly tends to vastly [910] outshort of Strategic Benefit that you [912] would have by keeping them to yourself [913] unless we're talking like a quadrillion [915] dollar industry here which doesn't exist [917] um the vast majority of the value that [919] you're going to get or sorry the vast [921] majority of the time the value that [922] you're going to get out of sharing is [923] going to be substantially higher than [924] the value you're going to get out of [925] safeguarding or keeping gatekeeping they [927] tend to say so my recommendation is in [930] terms of the ratio of what you give [931] versus what you ask for in your content [933] try to do it at least 99 at least 95% to [936] one so um I guess 95 to 5 is what I [939] meant to say um ideally it' be 99 to1 so [942] like 99% of the time in your content [943] like the content that I'm making just [945] just give people the Sask tell people [947] exactly what you did in order to get to [948] where you're going if you see problems [950] in your industry identify them um build [952] content around them build Solutions on [953] them try them yourself once youve [955] figured it out then just share it with [956] people uh and then if you're going to [958] make an Ask make like the tiniest [959] smallest ask at the end of the video or [961] at the end of the content and make it [963] like 2 seconds and make it abundantly [964] clear that like you don't you know [965] you're not forcing or holding anybody a [967] gunpoint to do this and if they don't [968] you're going to continue producing [969] content okay so that's problem number [971] one massive problem this is the main [973] problem that I would recommend that you [974] solve if you guys are currently you know [976] in the start line of any sort of a [978] automation business and this is uh the [980] client acquisition part has been a [981] struggle for you if you just solve that [983] one problem okay everything else here is [985] gravy you're probably going to start at [987] least building some sort of client [988] acquisition strategy or funnel or [990] repeatable system um and then if you can [992] solve the subsequent two problems I'm [993] going to show you here the shiny object [996] syndrome sorry I think my Escala draw [998] which is the tool I'm using to draw just [999] closed if you can solve the shiny object [1002] syndrome which we're going to talk about [1003] next and then the learning overdoing um [1005] it's it's going to be just you're just [1007] going to be printing money so the [1009] biggest problem the biggest contributor [1011] to the former problem which is not [1012] talking to enough potential customers [1013] that pipeline famine is something called [1015] shiny object syndrome we've all heard of [1017] shiny object syndrome okay we're not new [1019] to shiny object syndrome I'm going to [1021] try and draw a diamond here really [1023] quickly girlfriend would probably love [1026] this okay that's not how you draw a [1028] diamond okay so I clearly need to buy [1029] more people [1031] diamonds um you know the reality is in [1035] your your average industry you have one [1037] shiny object okay in our industry we [1039] have like five million shiny objects our [1042] industry is just Rife with shiny objects [1044] there are more shiny objects in AI on [1045] automation than any other industry hands [1048] down like like it's not even close it's [1051] like a million to one okay and the [1053] reason why is because our industry just [1055] inherently works with uh technology I [1057] don't really know why I'm drawing [1058] diamonds here I was told to try and make [1060] my content more engaging so there you go [1062] uh but you know we have we have new [1063] technologies that are coming out on [1064] daily basis a big chunk of our value is [1066] through artificial intelligence which is [1068] inherently interesting um there's just [1069] so many shiny objects and every new [1071] development in our industry seems like [1073] it's the final development you know oh [1075] uh GPT search GPT just came out that's [1077] going to invalidate bunch of search [1079] stuff Operator just came out that's [1080] going to invalidate a bunch of other [1082] stuff like everything is marketed to [1084] make it seem as if this is the end game [1087] for business in general in reality this [1090] is not uh and and 99.9% of these make no [1093] appreciable difference to the industry [1096] uh the industries that they are serving [1098] because our space just moves so quickly [1099] that they tend to be replaced uh you [1101] know within a I don't know a week a [1102] month a year whatever so don't focus on [1105] the tools don't focus on the objects [1107] okay focus on the skills underneath it [1110] I'm going to run you guys through how to [1111] fix shiny object syndrome and um there [1114] there are a couple of main ways the [1116] first is you can't bounce around and [1118] expect to win so what are some shiny [1120] objects in our in our uh Niche well [1122] industry is a shiny object people to [1124] Target okay tools the specific offers to [1127] try the reality is if you want to [1129] succeed in this vertical or any other [1131] you need a certain amount of investment [1133] in the thing in order to provide it an [1135] opportunity to win your ability to make [1138] something win in many cases is a [1140] self-fulfilling prophecy so if you try a [1144] thing and if you invest a lot of time [1146] and energy and and skill in a thing you [1149] are increasing the probability of that [1150] thing working out but if you start [1153] something okay every time you do you're [1155] you require some sort of reinvestment or [1157] re-learning period or or Readjustment [1159] period then every time you do that [1162] you're basically starting back from [1163] scratch you you pulled all that [1165] investment back it's absolutely nothing [1166] you've invested nothing at this point [1167] into this new thing you got you got to [1169] redo it all again and then what usually [1171] happens is humans get bored of something [1172] after a few weeks and then a few weeks [1173] go by and when you're finally just to [1175] the point where that thing's about to [1176] work you start something else okay so we [1179] have some built-in biases that I'm going [1181] to briefly cover just to give you guys [1182] some context and then I'm going to tell [1183] you guys exactly how to solve this the [1184] first is we have um a novelty bias so [1188] humans and I'm imagining you are a human [1190] not a crazy lizard person from space [1191] that's watching this video We crave [1194] novelty in reality okay winning the [1197] process of winning is very boring I know [1199] because I'm winning a lot right now you [1200] just do the same thing over and over and [1202] over and over again it's nothing special [1204] you just you wake up you have some set [1206] process that earns you more money uh [1207] than you put in okay it puts out more [1210] money than you put in there's a return [1211] on investment return on ad spend return [1213] on marketing spend whatever you want to [1214] call it and you just do it over and over [1215] and over 24/7 until you you know achieve [1217] whatever goal it is the reality is that [1219] humans require a level stimulation that [1221] focused winning in one industry just [1222] does not provide additionally our built [1224] in bias to find the next thing tends to [1226] occur right around the time we'd [1228] actually start seeing results in the [1229] thing that we want to do so you starting [1231] a new a service line for automation [1233] you're trying out you know recruitment [1235] agencies and you're trying to pitch them [1236] a specific product and you try for two [1238] or three weeks and nothing works okay [1240] and then you're like ah man two or three [1241] weeks have gone by uh this isn't working [1243] I should probably switch to something [1244] else okay this doesn't make any sense [1247] because you haven't invested [1248] sufficiently in the offer or the service [1250] line you haven't iterated you haven't [1252] improved it enough you haven't you know [1253] added on to it enough and really [1255] explored the market to be confident that [1257] what you're doing is the right decision [1259] another bias is that The Grass Is Always [1260] Greener now this is part of how we [1262] evolved since groups of people tend to [1263] exhaust local resources you kind of [1265] think of us as like hter gathers uh I [1268] don't know like you know 50,000 100,000 [1269] million years ago humans have this [1271] built-in predisposition to want to move [1273] around okay we want to change we want to [1275] see the grass on the other side of the [1276] Hill the reason why is because [1278] historically when we would move to that [1279] side we'd be more likely to survive so [1281] this is like the core architecture [1283] operating system of our minds it's not [1285] surprising That We crave shiny objects [1287] um We crave shiny objects you know 10 20 [1289] 30,000 years ago We crave shiny objects [1291] way more now and then on top of that the [1294] objects that we are craving are way [1295] shinier to begin with so there sort of [1297] like a recipe for disaster and it's not [1299] surprising at all that most people feel [1300] this way the third major bias is um we [1303] have a comparison bias so we compare [1304] ourselves to others because you know [1306] it's how we used to survive the [1307] unfortunate issue is in the modern world [1309] we have so many more opportunities to [1310] compare ourselves to others than nature [1312] ever intended and what we see a lot of [1314] is people winning faster than you are [1316] currently winning except they're doing [1317] in another niche [1319] it is natural to wonder why and then [1320] consider switching for yourself here is [1323] the truth behind it all the market and [1325] whether it's the AI automation agency [1326] market or the AI automation coaching [1328] Market or you know the HVAC Market or [1330] the plumbing Market or the large [1331] language Model Market whatever the hell [1332] it is the market has built-in lag when [1335] you try something you have to give it [1337] enough time to [1339] succeed you have to give it enough time [1341] in action I should say before it [1343] succeeds in order to really be able to [1346] definitively make uh a claim as to [1348] whether or not not what you're doing is [1349] right or not so as long as your [1351] fundamental assumptions are correct and [1353] you are consistently showing up and [1355] practicing you not seeing the results [1357] you expected is not a problem of what [1359] you are doing it is usually a problem of [1361] expectations so take however long you [1363] think it's going to uh need in order for [1365] you to do something or accomplish [1367] something and then my recommendation is [1368] to multiply by two or by three and then [1370] if you don't hit the thing you wanted to [1372] do by that time then you can consider [1374] switching because you know I mean I'm [1375] talking about you B not bouncing around [1377] and expecting to win but in reality um [1379] you moving is also um you know it's a [1382] form of learning and it's a form of [1383] growth the issue is not that people are [1385] moving they're just moving a little too [1386] soon so here's how to fix this step by [1389] step because it's one thing for me to [1390] you know wax poetic all about what the [1392] hell this this is theoretically it's [1393] another thing for you to actually take [1394] this information and employ it to your [1395] business so here are the exact steps I [1397] take if I were your choose the first is [1398] I would pick three niches for my [1400] business and I'd commit to them so [1402] choose the three niches that resonate [1403] most with your expertise with your [1405] social proof or your current [1406] opportunities now your going to commit [1409] to a set number of market segments that [1411] might be recruitment agencies B2B SAS um [1414] I don't know like coaching and [1414] Consultants or something from one of my [1415] most recent videos you're just going to [1417] commit to these three ahead of time and [1420] then by doing this you're going to cut [1421] off all distractions and then give [1423] yourself the runway to gain actual [1424] Traction in all three of these okay now [1426] the benefit to picking three niches as [1428] opposed to just one is you're also [1429] insulating against putting all your eggs [1430] in one basket there's still a level of [1433] novelty and greener pastures that you [1434] crave you're just not allowing for you [1435] know new greener pastures to grab you at [1437] every turn [1439] my recommendation is once you've run [1441] three niches for between 30 to 60 days [1443] you can then determine the highest [1444] performing Niche and then you can drop [1446] the other two and the benefit from this [1448] is you'll still have the sensation of [1449] change you're just going to have it [1450] without the drawbacks of you actually [1451] you know completely picking up shop and [1453] then and moving instead of you building [1455] you know experience fast in one thing [1456] and then switching over and then [1458] experience fast another thing and [1459] switching over you'll build your [1460] experience slowly in three things and [1461] then you'll drop two of them you'll [1463] shoot up the one that's a winner and [1464] then you can double down and invest in [1466] that after that I'd recommend setting a [1469] no change rule for 90 days so when I say [1471] 90 days of no changes I don't mean that [1473] you can't like make any adjustments or [1474] iterations to your product okay what I [1477] mean is you know don't don't pivot so [1479] don't start a new business don't go into [1481] any new vertical and don't choose any [1483] random side projects for at least three [1484] months at least three months just give [1485] yourself the chance to succeed what [1487] you're going to find is in life there's [1489] almost always a dip in results before [1491] success if I were to model OKAY the way [1494] that success looks like it's usually you [1496] know you start up pretty hopeful [1497] everything's great and then you have [1498] some Valley of disappointment before [1500] finally you start to grow exponentially [1502] this was me okay I started off and I [1504] thought everything was amazing um back [1506] when I I ran my door to-door marketing [1507] agency um I I found some you know [1510] measured success with it you know I made [1511] you know five 10 15 $20,000 and then I [1514] had this huge Valley I think it's uh [1516] term the valley of Despair I think a lot [1517] of other people talk about including [1519] hormos um but then I had massive Valley [1521] of Despair where I de had to do the same [1522] thing over and over and over and over [1524] and over and over again and it took me [1526] many many more years to get to the same [1529] point that I had at the beginning that [1531] than I thought before I started finally [1532] to exceed it and now you know if I look [1534] at my graph I'm probably like way that [1536] way the hell up here and I'm looking at [1538] everything from a bird side view it's [1539] obviously pretty sweet so um yeah that's [1542] that's kind of like the valley of uh [1543] despair idea that's sort of the no [1546] change Rule and the dip and results um [1548] what you what you do with this no change [1549] rule is it forces you to push through [1550] the dip which helps you avoid the false [1552] promise of greener pastures the next [1554] thing is to create a structured routine [1556] where you do uh your Revenue Genera [1558] activities first every morning okay and [1560] then focus on just the things that [1561] actually make you money and what are the [1563] things that actually make you money if [1564] you guys remember from the last problem [1565] it's usually Outreach it's usually sales [1566] it's usually marketing so what I mean by [1569] this is my recommendation just take a [1571] take your calendar right now and block [1573] out a 2 to three hour period every [1575] morning exclusively to some sort of [1577] outbound or exclusively some sort of [1579] marketing the reason why is because it's [1580] going to leave you little mental band [1582] with for chasing new ideas the second [1583] that you double down on all this [1584] Outreach there's a feedback loop you're [1587] going to start seeing responses from [1589] that Outreach you're going to start [1590] getting woven into sales calls and stuff [1591] like that the second that you do this [1593] you are basically pre-commit to spending [1595] future time in an industry and by you [1597] doing so you'll be thinking more about [1598] an industry ultimately succeeding more [1600] in that [1601] industry um my recommendation here is by [1604] doing your Revenue generating activities [1605] first that also means that even though [1607] it's really boring you're already ahead [1608] of pretty much everybody else by the [1610] time that you're done so I mean in my [1611] case you know I usually make my videos [1612] in the morning not today but um suffice [1614] to say by by the time I'm done my video [1616] which might take me a few hours I have [1617] produced produced more value in a day [1620] than the vast majority of people will do [1621] in a week or more and that's just [1622] because that's the very first thing that [1624] I do and once it's done hell I could uh [1626] I don't know watch SpongeBob or [1627] something all day uh and I'd probably [1629] still be better off than most of my [1631] competitors so the last thing I'm going [1633] to mention is um maintain a future ideas [1635] list so just you know if you're using [1636] Apple notes or if you have some notepad [1638] Evernote on your computer or I don't [1640] know you have some other app that you [1641] use or maybe like a physical a physical [1642] book anytime you get a tempting thought [1645] just write it down and just get out get [1647] it out of your head as quickly as [1648] possible then go right back to your [1651] current plan at least now you have it [1653] written somewhere at least now you've [1655] satisfied your brain's urge to like get [1657] some idea out right it's no longer [1659] bouncing around or rattling around in [1661] your skull it's actually somewhere out [1662] on a piece of paper and then at least [1663] then you can convince yourself hey I'm [1665] going to cover this you know the grass [1666] is greener on the other side I'm going [1667] to cover this when I'm done with my [1669] current thing so in this way you're sort [1671] of satisfying some of those built-in [1673] Cravings that I talked about of novelty [1674] you're also satisfying The Grass Is [1676] Always Greener um and then you're still [1678] allowing yourself to like have strategic [1679] value of the ideas that you are creating [1681] because there are tons of strategic [1682] there is tons of strategic value in a [1684] lot of the um sort of shiny objects that [1686] you're pursuing it's just a matter of [1687] how you execute on them right so that's [1689] my recommendation that's personally what [1690] I do um I have tons of fantastic ideas [1692] and they involve switching Industries [1693] and jumping on new projects and jumping [1695] on new products um but historically just [1697] given the return on investment I've had [1698] from doing the same thing over and over [1699] and over and over again um you know I [1701] just I add those to a list and I worry [1702] about them later and later can come when [1704] I've um satisfied or fulfilled my [1707] pre-commit to succeed in the thing that [1709] I'm currently doing so that's problem [1711] number two problem number three is that [1714] most of you are unfortunately learning [1717] overdoing what do I mean by this I mean [1719] and this is unfortunate because you're [1720] watching a YouTube video which by nature [1722] is learning it's a slideshow and then [1723] I'm like drawing on a page like you know [1726] school style Professor stuff um but the [1729] reality is more knowledge will not help [1732] you I've consulted with over 1,400 AI [1736] automation businesses now these are [1737] businesses these are companies agencies [1739] Freelancers coaches Consultants whatever [1741] the vast majority of these businesses [1743] the vast majority of them already knew [1745] enough to succeed when I you know jumped [1748] on a call with them or when I answered [1749] their question or did some Q&A or [1750] whatever it wasn't the the the [1753] information that they needed to succeed [1755] okay it was applying that information to [1759] their daily life so there's a difference [1761] between knowing [1765] something and then applying that thing [1770] for instance right now you [1773] know all of that stuff that I told you [1775] about Outreach you know 10 cold DMS a [1778] day with a with a customized video 10 [1780] upwork apps a day an hour every day uh I [1783] don't know looking over your cold emails [1784] and crafting new new campaigns but that [1786] is very different from actually doing it [1789] right to know something involves you [1792] scrolling through a YouTube feed with [1794] thousands of people constantly begging [1795] for your attention myself included to [1797] try and you know give you some value to [1798] have you hopefully exchange that into [1800] some some monetary thing on on our end [1803] that is a very different set of skills [1804] than actually going and doing the thing [1806] right the set of skills required to know [1808] is basically a passive consumption set [1810] of skills where you just need to be able [1811] to lay lay back and then kind of like I [1813] don't know identify the right material [1815] and then click a button and then like [1816] you know focus on something for half an [1817] hour and while that's still like a [1819] pretty good set of skills it's very [1821] different from the ability to apply [1822] stuff it's the very different from the [1823] ability to to write applications or to [1826] be uh I don't know somewhat Charming or [1828] well put together or presentable on some [1830] sort of video that you're sending out to [1832] people or to know the right copy to to [1834] write or to to build the skills needed [1837] to to be able to do some really cool [1838] automations applying is ultimately the [1842] name of the game the vast majority of us [1844] know everything we need to know it's [1845] just a matter of converting that into [1847] some sort of Action Now how do you [1849] convert stuff into action well that is a [1851] very very different set of skills which [1853] I'm going to cover in a second so you [1856] know I'm just going to sort of talk [1857] about the elephant in the room which is [1858] YouTube um this is a YouTube video the [1860] reality is you don't actually need to [1861] watch more YouTube videos about this and [1862] while um I think my channel has great [1864] information it's certainly a lot higher [1865] quality and higher prow than most other [1866] people's you don't actually need to [1868] watch this um everybody loves to learn [1870] okay learning is safe because there's no [1872] risk of failure no chance of rejection [1874] you could watch a million of my videos [1877] Until you realize that you're now 90 [1878] days in you've made $ [1879] Z so you know the danger is that you are [1883] tricking yourself into believing you're [1885] preparing but you can't really just [1887] prepare for life you have to go go and [1888] live life like at some point you have to [1890] jump out of the plane and then build [1891] your parachute in the way down and I [1892] know that's a really kind of crappy [1894] expression and it's like well I would [1895] never actually do that in real life but [1897] that's sort of how business Works to be [1898] honest at least in my experience you [1900] could spend all day building out these [1901] big projections or being skeptical about [1904] something before you actually try it for [1906] yourself there's no there's no there's [1907] no objective way for you to know whether [1909] or not you would have succeeded and then [1911] consider this the time is going to pass [1913] anyway like you know in the next 30 days [1915] or something by the end of the month 30 [1918] days is going to well I guess it's [1919] February so 28 days 28 days are going to [1922] pass whether or not you do the thing [1924] okay wouldn't it be better for you to [1925] have spent 28 days applying the [1927] knowledge that you are currently [1928] learning as opposed to just letting INF [1929] fester in your [1930] head so you know if you learn something [1933] new my recommendations applied the same [1934] day you know if you're watching my [1935] videos and um you know I want you to [1938] just do the thing that I'm doing [1939] alongside me like you know how I was [1941] just telling you a moment ago about [1942] setting aside the two hours of your [1944] calendar well don't just listen to that [1946] passively like actually go into your [1947] calendar block it out so that tomorrow [1948] when you wake up when you have that [1949] period you can actually start getting [1950] getting to work same thing if I do a [1952] live build or something anyway just [1955] don't let knowledge Fest in your head [1956] the real learning is always going to [1957] happen with some sort of [1959] doing so here's a step-by-step um [1962] program essentially that I have used on [1964] myself and I I give to a bunch of people [1965] U you know over a thousand people in my [1967] communities um and I find that this [1968] works extraordinarily well in practice [1970] so if you just follow this you know you [1971] should you should be able to make some [1972] meaningful Headway against the learning [1973] versus doing problem but in order for [1975] you to do this you're actually going to [1975] have to like take the steps that I'm [1976] applying right now you can even pause [1978] the video right um after I mention a [1980] thing that resonates with you go and do [1981] the thing and then just come back and [1982] you know watch the next bit so the very [1985] first thing is block consumption in [1987] media so my recommendation to you is yes [1990] block YouTube block Instagram block uh [1993] Facebook block Tik Tok if you have a [1995] problem and most people know that they [1997] have a problem right most people were [1999] not unaware of the fact that we have a [2000] problem with some sort of content [2001] consumption or whatever uh if you know [2003] that you have a problem with one of [2004] these platforms just block them now if [2007] you do this doesn't mean that you're a [2008] Content addict it's just a tool at the [2010] end of the day and it's a tool that adds [2012] a bit of friction the next time you're [2014] going to try and mindlessly access a [2015] resource that's all we're doing we're [2017] just adding a little bit of friction 5% [2018] here 10% there it's a blocker for your [2021] phone where in order for you to like you [2023] know uh I don't know you type in [2024] Instagram and then you try and click the [2025] thing it'll just say hey this is blocked [2026] for now do you want to unblock you click [2027] a button you usually have to do some [2028] friction thing you have to send yourself [2030] an email or you have to undo some little [2032] cool pattern code or you have to like [2034] solve a quick little equation this tiny [2036] bit of friction helps you jump out of [2039] the passive habit of [2041] consumption sorry about that the passive [2043] habit of consumption rather than active [2046] intent because typically the way that [2047] things work is you know you will sign on [2049] to and and watch an Instagram reel [2052] simply because um I don't know maybe [2054] like you get a notification on your [2055] phone you click the notification you you [2056] look at your friends text and then when [2057] you go back you just see Instagram and [2060] all of a sudden the first reel grabs you [2061] and then you scroll down the next one [2063] and the next one and the next one and [2064] the next one before you know youve [2064] wasted 45 minutes of your time you know [2067] same thing with a lot of platforms that [2068] we're we're watching today like YouTube [2069] and and other stuff the algorithms will [2071] suck you into an additional hour video [2073] the reality is algorithms like this are [2075] now getting better than our abilities to [2077] stop them so um you know a light bit of [2079] friction like that screen that says hey [2080] you shouldn't be doing this right now do [2081] you want to like do a friction code or [2083] something this will sufficiently [2084] eliminate 90% of those passive habits [2086] are you still going to do it yeah [2087] probably like I still do social media [2088] from time to time that's fine but I do [2090] it because I'm intentional about it like [2092] if I have a creator that I really like I [2094] will intentionally sign on and I will [2096] say you know I'm I'm curious do they [2098] have a new video If so I watch said [2100] video and then when I'm done I shut it [2102] off that little bit of intentionality um [2105] basically turns you into an active [2107] producer of your life not necessarily [2109] just a passive consumer of it okay the [2111] next thing is for just just to be clear [2113] for us to distinguish between real [2114] progress real progress is sending [2116] outbound messages fulfilling client work [2118] versus fake progress which is usually [2120] watching videos or reading books so my [2122] recommendation for you and what I've [2123] implemented and employed my own life is [2125] I only give myself permission to learn [2127] something after I've already done [2129] something for the day so uh a good [2131] example of this is I will only read [2132] tutorials and watch YouTube videos about [2134] automation if I've completed my Revenue [2136] generating activities for the day AK if [2138] you know I've already done my 2 hours [2140] from 6:00 to 8: a.m. I want you to think [2142] about this right now and consider what [2144] your Revenue generating activities are [2145] going to look like are you going to be [2147] producing some sort of content are you [2148] going to be doing outbound right do you [2150] have the credentials to produce content [2151] make that interesting or worthwhile or [2152] or do you have the credentials or the [2154] skills to sell stuff over video or sell [2156] stuff over cold emo once you've sorted [2158] that out schedule it and then build that [2161] self-imposed rule where you're only [2162] going to be reading and watching you [2163] know videos or or tutorials on a guide [2166] or a new piece of technology if you've [2167] already done the thing that makes you [2168] the money and then my goal is to um [2172] Inspire everybody here to adopt a learn [2174] and Implement immediately mindset so [2176] don't just watch three hours of training [2178] okay watch five minutes learn a thing [2180] pause then do the thing and then come [2182] back and proceed this changes things [2185] from this sort of passive edutainment [2186] Style uh media where you watch stuff and [2189] you think you get the positive dopamine [2191] of being oh I've actually done that [2192] thing right oh yeah you know Nick made a [2194] lot of sense when he talked about the [2195] system we like wow the way he built that [2196] was really really cool this changes your [2198] content consumption habits from this [2200] passive one into an active One You're [2202] Now actively engaging you're not just uh [2205] passively consuming edutainment you're [2206] actually immediately applying it so my [2209] rule is if you don't see a way to [2210] immediately apply what it is that you're [2211] consuming it's probably not a good piece [2213] of content to be watching in the first [2214] place okay uh whether you're you know [2217] that applies to my content or other [2218] people's that you're watching or [2219] something like that I'm going to leave [2221] that determination up to you but that is [2222] my recommendation to solve learning [2224] overdoing okay great so we've now [2226] covered all three of the big problems [2228] with um you know you not getting any [2229] clients with a automation just to recap [2232] because I'm starting to do these Recaps [2233] here I find people get value to them the [2234] first was pipeline famine which is where [2236] you need to spend realistically between [2238] 10 to 20 times statistically as much [2240] time as you are spending on client [2241] acquisition right now on client [2243] acquisition so you need to reshift your [2245] entire thought pattern towards what this [2247] is is this isn't an AI automation [2249] business if you're at the start line [2250] right now this is a lead generation [2252] business and your only business is to [2253] generate leads once you've solved this [2255] you will go the vast majority of the way [2257] to success but from there um tackle [2260] shiny object syndrome which is you know [2262] us looking at the the greener pastures [2264] across the hill us having that built-in [2267] bias to always be looking for novelty or [2269] some some sort of stimulation when we [2270] see that what we're doing is not [2271] immediately providing results understand [2274] that the market has that built-in leg [2276] and no amount of time or energy sorry no [2278] amount of energy that you put in right [2279] now is going to see you um getting [2282] results before that lag period finishes [2284] so as long as you're just consistent and [2285] you provide some sort of daily drip feed [2288] of action you know that action will [2289] eventually accumulate into success it's [2291] a self-fulfilling prophecy give yourself [2293] enough time to actually see that succeed [2295] rather than jump around every few weeks [2297] and the third thing was learning [2298] overdoing um as I've just talked about I [2300] think that you know my content is [2302] fantastic there are a couple other [2303] channels of content that are a couple [2305] other channels on YouTube out there that [2306] are fantastic there's definitely some [2307] value and some uh followed sorry some um [2311] channels that you can follow on like [2312] Instagram or Tik Tok or Twitter or [2314] whatever but my cardinal rule is just [2316] make sure that this is content that you [2318] can actually go out and apply to your [2320] own life to make your life better as [2321] opposed to just something you are [2322] passively consuming all day um because [2324] if you are doing the louder you're just [2325] tricking yourself into thinking you're [2327] moving prioritize taking information [2329] pausing whatever thing you are doing to [2331] learn and then doing something with it [2333] right prioritize actually taking actions [2335] in the real world because time is going [2336] to pass anyway and you might as well [2338] have some cool result to show for it [2340] awesome so that's where we're at um I [2342] hope you guys appreciated this video If [2343] you guys like the content that I [2344] produced check out maker school it's a [2345] day byday accountability program that [2347] actually gets you your first automation [2348] customer shows you how to build it from [2350] scratch I mean otherwise if you already [2351] have a business and you're interested in [2352] scaling it I'm join makemoney withm [2354] make.com my next Community which helps [2356] you get to 25k and Beyond by [2358] implementing good scalability practices [2360] uh that's a good example of like a 99% [2362] value to 1% value pitch so if you guys [2364] are looking to create your own inbound [2365] content then I personally uh would [2367] recommend deploying a structure like [2368] this hope you guys found value of the [2370] video if you have any questions or [2371] anything like that feel free to drop [2372] them down below as you guys know I [2373] Source most of my ideas for my audience [2375] at this point so if there's something [2376] you want me to do let me know otherwise [2378] do that cool YouTube stuff like [2380] subscribe get me to the top of the algo [2381] and I'll catch you on the next video [2382] thanks so much
