ta [872] you'll see this is long as hell well a [875] lot of big websites like this like fivr [877] they have rate limits in place and [879] they'll see if you call five or six [881] times in a minute from like some [883] make.com address which it's probably [885] some it's not like a residential IP it's [887] probably like a data warehouse IP or [889] something and they might actually block [891] you or ban you and so I mean do you [893] really want to have to like do an HTTP [895] request to Fiverr server to risk that [897] every single time you test your scenario [900] no you don't how much cooler would it be [902] if you could just take the HTML that it [904] just output like word for word well if I [909] keep doing this it's going to take like [910] five hours to get to the end of it [911] because you can obviously see how big it [913] is but how cool would it be if I could [914] just copy all [916] that move this [918] over and then just use a set variable [920] module instead if I could just paste all [923] of that in you know voila now I could [926] just use this as the input and I'll have [928] saved myself um both one operation here [931] but also the risk of getting rate [933] limited which would substantially impact [935] my ability to build out the rest of the [937] automation so sort of a quick hack here [940] um but it's it's one that I use quite [942] often and then I mentioned that um [944] adding API calls to variables is also [947] important well if I were trying to build [948] out this flow and I am going to build it [950] out just in a moment here but if I were [951] trying to build out this flow um you [954] know instead of me doing an API call to [956] type form or instead of me doing an API [958] call to hand do or something like that I [960] could just store the results of that [962] call in a set variable module I mean [964] like the anthropic Cloud one is probably [966] the best example because um you know I [968] don't want to have to call AI and spend [970] some money every time I [971] test but basically you could just you [974] just copy the whole response here [976] whether or not it's the the code or this [978] this is a lot easier for now and then [980] you could just feed it manually let's [984] say into this parsejson module [990] that didn't work one [998] moment make dooming with one hand is [1000] sort of like drinking and [1003] driving should not I I do not recommend [1006] should be [1008] illegal uh okay great so now we have the [1010] Json in here right I just copy and [1012] pasted the output from the previous [1014] module well now if I just run this [1015] you'll see that it just pars it all [1016] right so now I can just start my [1019] scenario here instead of going all the [1020] way back here realistically you I could [1024] just like begin the rest of the flow [1026] from here which is going to be the [1027] pandadoc and then click up [1029] Fields so yeah making gratuitous use of [1032] set and get variables is also quite [1033] valuable and it's something that I I [1035] love doing and I do pretty often if [1037] you've ever downloaded one of my [1038] Blueprints and you've wondered hey what [1039] the hell why are there all these purple [1040] variables in here we're just consuming [1042] all these extra Ops the point is that um [1045] the op consumption that I spend during [1049] the testing I will save during like not [1052] having to run the whole scenario a [1054] million billion times because I don't [1055] know what's going [1056] on and not only is it substantially less [1059] effort it's also a lot less frustrating [1061] which is quite [1062] valuable but all of this is sort of [1064] theory why don't we actually look at how [1066] you iteratively test in practice what [1068] I'm going to do here is I'm going to go [1069] through um my three top iterative [1072] testing practices and I'm going to go [1074] through and show you guys what that [1075] looks like in like a real [1077] scenario so this scenario here the one [1079] that I've been sort of playing around [1080] with just as an example essentially what [1082] this does is we'll fill out that type [1084] form that I mentioned earlier we'll feed [1086] in the results of that type form so like [1087] the company information what the company [1089] does you know who the prospect is [1091] whatever to Ai and then we'll have ai [1094] generate the output and the output is in [1096] Json JavaScript object notation just [1099] like this and you'll see that the values [1101] here are variables and I use these [1103] variables here to fill in a proposal in [1105] a pandadoc which is a proposal generator [1107] platform [1109] and then this allows me to generate like [1111] very nice looking pretty sexy proposals [1113] if I'm honest very quickly now what I do [1115] with these proposals is I will simply [1117] add them to a CRM called um my sales CRM [1121] here the value there is I just get to [1124] generate very Nic looking proposals in a [1126] very short amount of time which is [1127] obviously nice um and then we also just [1129] get to keep them all organized by [1131] putting them inside of [1132] pandadoc um which is which is valuable [1135] and I believe I probably deleted the [1137] pandadoc in question um which is why [1139] it's not being found uh but I'll show [1142] you guys the template in a second just [1143] that anybody that's watching this [1144] without having any sort of background [1145] will [1147] understand um what's going on here so [1150] we'll fill in the title we'll fill in [1152] the first name we'll fill in the last [1153] name we'll fill in the problem title you [1154] know we'll fill in this problem text [1156] it's basically just a base proposal [1158] template that we enrich using data from [1162] um you know this this proposal generator [1164] flow from uh from anthropic [1166] clad so if art actually try and build [1169] this out in practice with one hand uh [1171] what would I actually do well um i' [1174] employ these three best practices the [1177] first is that every step along the way I [1180] would run each module individually [1182] before I add more so I'd think to myself [1184] okay listen what's the goal of the [1186] scenario the goal of this scenario is to [1188] watch responses come in catch those [1191] responses use that to um create um use [1196] the the bullet points and the response [1197] to prompt Ai and have ai generate me a [1200] big list of problems and solution [1202] statements big list of variables [1203] basically and then I use those variables [1205] to fill in a pandadoc and then edit a [1206] task of custom [1208] fields at every step along the way what [1211] I would do is I would iteratively test [1213] every individual module so for instance [1216] I would I wouldn't wait until the very [1218] end actually do it from the very [1220] beginning so this proposal generator for [1222] workf Lo for instance I would actually [1223] just right click this I'd run once and [1225] then I'd go through and then I'd fill [1227] out this scenario or sorry this um this [1229] type [1230] form so I would do that and for the [1232] purpose of this demonstration I'm not [1233] actually going to go through and do that [1235] but then I would you know let's say I'm [1237] building this out module by module which [1240] is not actually the best way to do it as [1242] I'll explain in a moment I have a sleep [1243] module I'd actually run this and I just [1245] check to see does this sleep for 3 [1246] seconds it's almost like a sanity check [1248] right I put in a delay of three [1250] obviously it's going to sleep for 3 [1251] seconds but if you just iteratively test [1253] at every point along your way um [1257] essentially if there's there's an error [1259] you'll know that the error is between [1260] the previous module and the current [1262] module you're not going to put all the [1264] logic down press go and then wonder what [1266] the hell is going on and why it's not [1268] working so if I had a list responses [1270] module well now I'm going to run a list [1272] responses module right and in this case [1275] by running it I got to see that the [1276] limit was off I set the limit at 20 [1278] really should have been one now I run it [1280] again awesome input and output looks [1282] exactly what like what I'm expecting [1284] same thing with anthropic Cloud [1286] obviously I'm just copying and pasting [1287] these modules and this instance but um I [1290] will I will run through them one by one [1292] at every point just to make sure that [1294] everything is as intended essentially [1297] I'm getting the data that I thought that [1298] I would be [1300] getting so yeah that's pretty valuable I [1303] would say just right off the bat I'm [1305] going to leave the rest of these [1307] available just for the purposes of you [1309] know um sort of like as an exercise for [1311] the viewer but the point here is this [1314] just takes less than a second and it [1315] inoculates you against being lost later [1317] it also inoculates you about being [1319] um from being [1321] wrong the second way you iteratively [1323] test is you start at the end you work [1325] your way to the beginning and the way [1327] that you do this is pretty interesting [1329] um basically all you do is you ask [1330] yourself hey what is the purpose of my [1333] scenario it's a very simple question and [1336] you usually warrant a pretty simple [1338] answer in the case of this flow the [1340] purpose of the scenario is to [1343] update um a clickup record with a [1347] proposal and and if you think about it [1349] everything starts or everything um that [1353] we ask for at the end we could then just [1356] reverse engineer so if we want to update [1358] a clickup record the natural with a [1361] proposal the natural question becomes [1363] okay what makes this [1364] proposal and then after you create a [1367] proposal it's like okay well where did [1368] we get the data for that proposal that's [1370] probably Ai and then it's like okay [1372] where did we get the data for that AI [1374] prompt well it was a form okay well [1376] where did we get the data from that form [1378] then you go and make the form so if you [1380] wanted to build using this approach and [1382] this is really the one that I I usually [1383] do I'll just iteratively test working [1385] backwards using this approach is I sort [1387] of start at the end right and then I say [1390] hm okay so what was the goal of this [1392] well the goal of this was to update a [1394] click up record so what am I going to [1396] need to do I'm going to need to and in [1398] this case I know that the specific [1400] module I need is edit a task with custom [1402] Fields so I will start at the end right [1405] and then I will um go through and I'm [1407] going to do my my Conn ction and [1408] everything and I'm going to do this live [1411] um just for this one module so I can [1412] show you what that looks [1415] like so I'll go through and I'll do all [1417] the settings I'll select all the spaces [1419] the workspaces the [1421] folders I believe uh probably looking [1423] for the sales list [1426] here and then from here on out um this [1429] is this is essentially what I want [1431] because I started at the end now I know [1433] what variables I need like for instance [1436] big question is like hm okay well like [1438] what [1438] clickup record am I going to update I [1441] it's asking me for a task ID so now I [1443] know earlier in the scenario I'm going [1444] to have to supply a task ID and so by [1447] doing it back to front as opposed to [1448] front to back or end to start as opposed [1450] to start to end um you then intuitively [1454] understand what data you require at the [1456] beginning part of the scenario that you [1457] might not have currently thought [1460] about the value in doing this too is a [1462] lot of modules have requirements and so [1464] do you notice how these are bolded [1467] titles whereas these are non-bolded [1469] titles well if something's a bolded [1471] title it's required if I were to try and [1474] click okay here look at what's going to [1475] happen it's going to say the value must [1477] not be empty because it's bolded and so [1480] in this way I basically ensure no values [1481] are ever empty I'm never wondering where [1482] the hell is my data what data do I need [1485] right and I'm just always able to [1487] essentially [1488] build now what I would personally do in [1491] this instance you know I don't currently [1492] have my task ID what I do is i' I'd ask [1494] I'd add my task ID here then I'd scroll [1497] down and i' try and hardcode the [1500] information that I need I'd hardcode the [1502] pandadoc um URL in this case so I'd go [1505] and I generate maybe a pandadoc or [1508] something I don't know uh in this case [1510] I'm just going to [1512] do an example [1514] URL right app. panded do.com we should [1517] probably add an s in [1518] there but this is the whole the whole [1520] purpose of my flow is basically to [1522] provide a pandadoc URL right and then I [1525] think in my case I also want to update [1526] the status or something like that to [1527] proposal sent and now that I have this [1530] now I'm going to do my iterative testing [1531] now I'm going to right click I'm going [1532] to run this module only basically what [1534] I'm going to do is I'm just going to get [1536] I'm just going to like look to see in my [1537] CRM hey did what I just tried to do work [1540] right and the answer to that question is [1542] yes what I tried to do uh worked I [1545] updated the um task called Nix surth [1549] basically to proposal sent right over [1551] here so that's the value [1554] there the third way to do it is once [1558] you're building right so assuming that [1560] we've done iterative testing this whole [1561] time um basically run an end to-end test [1564] to cap it off and if you all are [1567] unfamiliar with what an end to end test [1568] is it's kind of what it sounds like it's [1570] an end to end it's from left to right [1572] you basically run through the entire [1573] scenario [1574] once but keep in mind that the vast [1576] majority of people when they build out [1577] make.com flows they'll run through the [1579] entire scenario every single time that [1580] they try and build something and so you [1584] will only ever have to do this a single [1585] time at the very end maybe once or twice [1588] who knows if it doesn't work exactly [1589] like you were intending it [1591] to but because you only had to do it [1593] once and the other person that's [1594] building the scenario would have had to [1596] do it 50 times you say 50 times however [1598] much time you it takes to run through a [1600] scenario and what you'll find is when [1602] you're developing more and more complex [1603] make.com flows the time that it takes to [1605] run the scenario starts being a rate [1607] limiting step I have had tons of [1609] scenarios that legitimately take like 10 [1612] to 15 to 20 minutes to test and if you [1615] were trying to test this every single [1617] time to get to the the point where there [1618] was the error and then see if your fix [1620] changed the error and made it better [1622] that would be absolute lunacy and it [1624] would take you [1625] hours so what do I mean by endend test [1628] well I'm going to assume here that I've [1629] just built this scenario this one up at [1631] the [1632] top what I do is I would treat [1635] everything in this scenario like live [1637] data so I'd actually fill out this [1639] automatic proposal [1641] form now it's kind of tough for me to do [1643] this right now simply because I have one [1645] hand but I'm going to try my best I'm [1647] just going to fill in a bunch of like [1648] very quick bullet [1649] points what I know that I need to do [1652] this is just something that I know I [1653] need to do in this scenario is I just [1654] need to grab this [1656] ID and then I just need to update this [1658] ID [1662] here and so now that I've done this what [1664] I have to do is you know I have to go [1666] back and and fill it all out so we'll [1668] say [1669] Nick we'll say [1672] shive we'll say at left [1676] click a [1678] we'll see my company is left [1682] click I need to enter in a oneliner so [1685] I'm going to copy this I'm going to past [1686] this in what's the problem they're [1688] suffering from no [1693] automatic [1695] way to [1697] generate [1702] proposals it's [1704] slow and annoying [1709] what's the solution that you pitched [1712] Auto [1717] generate proposals I have so much more [1719] respect for people that type with one [1720] hand [1722] Now using let's do panda [1727] doc what are the deliverables um we'll [1730] just go p d proposal [1736] template and then how long will this [1738] take to deliver we'll say one week for [1742] $2,000 awesome so I'm actually going to [1744] go through this whole thing and then I'm [1746] going to get it ready to [1748] submit and then I'm going to open the [1749] scenario here just make sure that it [1751] works I'm going to click [1752] submit and then I'm actually going to [1754] test it end then I'm going to test every [1755] single module in here in the desired [1757] flow and basically make it as similar as [1759] possible to what the client would be [1760] doing with my flow or what you know my [1762] team member would be doing or whatever [1763] the purpose of this flow really is just [1765] make it as as similar to real world [1767] conditions as you possibly could and [1770] that's what's going on right now it's [1771] going through it's it's uh using AI to [1772] create my prompt it's parsing the Json [1774] it's creating a document it's editing a [1775] task with custom Fields just doing [1777] everything that I wanted it to do [1779] essentially um and you know in my [1781] specific case it worked which is quite [1782] nice but in many cases when you're [1784] testing a flow that you haven't built [1785] before I built this one like 30 times at [1787] this point you know maybe there'll be an [1789] error right here maybe the Json won't be [1790] par like what the hell's going on why [1792] didn't the Jason parse or in my case [1795] actually there is an issue and the issue [1796] is that I've listed again 20 20 [1798] responses so I mean you know if I had an [1801] end to end tested that I wouldn't have [1803] known that I'm listing 20 responses when [1804] I really should just be listing one I [1805] should be listen the one that I just [1807] got so I hope it's clear but you do need [1810] to do an n10 test to cap everything off [1812] what I will personally do um running an [1814] automation company is I will usually run [1816] through everything from the first module [1818] to the last one time on my own and then [1821] the second time I'll run through it I'll [1823] turn on loom and then I'll actually [1824] record a video of me going through from [1826] start to finish so that I get to batch [1828] my time and then I also get to create a [1829] delivery video while I'm testing the [1831] whole flow I also get to talk myself [1834] through the process from start to finish [1836] which is quite valuable because if you [1837] really want to understand something the [1839] best way to do so is to explain it to [1841] somebody first in your case you're doing [1842] it to [1844] yourself all right that's it I promise [1847] it'd be a short video and there it is uh [1850] iterative testing is awesome you save [1852] tons of time energy frustration some [1854] gray hairs couple hernas it's my [1857] preferred and really only way that I [1859] build in 2024 and if you could just take [1862] away one thing from this video just take [1863] away the idea of reverse engineering [1866] essentially starting at the end and then [1867] working Your Way backwards if you just [1869] ask yourself that question what do I [1871] think the purpose of this scenario is [1873] you'll be light years ahead of most [1874] other people that try and develop things [1876] sort of from like the front to the back [1879] so hope that helps good luck thanks so [1881] much for watching if you guys have any [1883] questions about the process of iterative [1884] testing just drop them down below as a [1886] comment as well as any video suggestions [1889] otherwise like comment do all that fun [1890] YouTube stuff I'll catch you on the next [1892] video hopefully without uh this K-pop [1895] mic cheers

Title: The Definitive Make.com HTTP & API Masterclass
[0] hey Nick here and in this video I'm [1] going to show you everything you need to [3] know about the HTTP module in make.com [5] this is going to be the most [6] comprehensive tutorial that you will [8] find on this topic on the internet I'm [10] going to cover every single field in the [12] HTTP module I'm going to talk about how [14] to use and structure various requests [17] and then after some Theory we're [19] actually going to dive deep into me [21] practically using the HTTP module to [23] connect to four different apis all with [25] their own authentication methods so if [28] you've worried or struggled with [30] connecting HTTP modules to various apis [32] in the past or you guys just want to [33] brush up on your skills then this is the [36] video for you let's get into it so the [39] HTTP module that I'm going to be [41] focusing on in particular well there [42] really going to be two the first is the [46] make a request module which is how the [48] vast majority of API requests in [50] make.com are going to occur and then I'm [52] also going to cover the make an oaf 2.0 [54] request now you might be asking yourself [57] Nick why are you only covering these two [58] and it's because I've made over million [60] dollars with make.com up until this [61] point and I've basically never used any [64] of these other modules I just haven't [66] needed to so as most of my course and [69] training materials on make talk about [71] I'm only really worried about the [72] highest Roi bits I'm worried about the [74] parts that you're going to end up using [75] 99% of the time not all these random [77] edge cases I do use the get a file from [80] time to time but that's not really the [81] the purpose of this video so uh know [84] that this video is not going to turn you [85] into a web developer you're not going to [87] walk away from this with a computer [88] science degree unfortunately but it is [90] the 820 if you've wanted to learn how to [93] make HTTP requests what the hell all of [95] that fancy stuff in like the Chrome [97] developer tool console means um what the [100] responses in make.com when you make an [102] HTP request are then this is the video [104] for you I'm also going to show you how [106] to successfully make the vast majority [107] of API calls that you will ever need as [109] I mentioned to you there are a few [111] different types I'm going to connect to [112] four different apis um but there are a [114] couple different subgroups that they all [115] fall under um and once you learn this [117] you can basically connect anything that [119] you want into even if there's no like [120] native module I'm also going to be [122] reading some API documentation alongside [124] you um and I figure this is going to [125] help you guys learn some of the more [126] tacit uh knowledge sort of steps here um [130] involved in making API request [132] successfully because every API is a [133] little bit different all right so what [136] do you need to know you could spend [138] years going to school to learn thousands [139] of little edge cases with apis or I [142] could just walk you through what 99% of [143] those HTTP requests and API calls are [145] really going to look like in practice so [147] here's what we're going to cover over [148] the course of the next little bit the [149] first is we're going to cover what is [150] HTTP we're going to talk about how it [152] works where it came from and basically [154] just all the stuff that you need to know [156] in order to be able to to to read [158] documentation that relies on HTTP [160] requests the second is how do I connect [162] with apis and what are some examples the [165] third is what are the three main types [166] of API requests which I'm going to be [168] covering in detail and then the fourth [170] is how does Jason work I get this [172] question a lot Nick how do I learn Jason [174] do I need to know Jason before I get [175] deeper into make.com the truth is that [178] you don't but if you're watching this [179] video it's probably because you're [180] already a certain skill level and Jason [182] is just the natural next step for you so [184] we're going to be talking about that the [186] last thing is can you show me how to [187] connect to apis and I'm actually going [188] to be walking through three to four of [190] those connections just so that you can [192] pattern match so you can see what I'm [193] doing you be like okay he keeps on [195] clicking that field that field must be [196] important right all right so let's get [199] into it and let me just zoom this out a [201] little bit um I'm going to make this [202] video 4K so you guys are going to be [203] able to see how the text let's talk a [205] little bit about HTTP requests HTTP [208] stands for the hyp text transfer [211] protocol and I know that when you see [213] four-letter acronyms and the internet [215] freaking loves four-letter acronyms for [216] some reason but when you see these you [218] know immediately a lot of alarm bells [220] are probably going off in your head like [221] a that's computer nerd stuff how [222] the hell am I supposed to understand [224] this I just want to make some money well [227] it's okay uh Nick is here uh when they [230] say protocol Protocols are just an [232] established way of doing things to send [235] an HTTP request just means that you are [238] formatting a bunch of text in a very [240] particular way that some dude invented [243] back in 1989 I think it was Tim Po I I [246] might be mistaken um but somebody [247] invented this back in 1989 and then [250] because the internet is so iterative [251] because everything Builds on itself [253] right after he invented this HTTP um [256] framework you know a bunch of people [257] voted on a bunch of people shook hands [258] and it's basically just been what we've [260] been stuck with ever since so if you [261] want to send a request to a web server [264] you basically need to know how to [265] structure it and package it in the HTTP [268] way right using the hypertext transfer [271] protocol so the structure itself [274] includes a few key components and I'm [275] not going to run through every component [277] but these are the four ones that you [278] actually need to know the first one is [280] called the URL now if you ever wondered [282] what a URL stood for it stands for [283] Universal resource locator and that's it [287] so if I were to go back into make here [289] and then if I were to open up a module [291] let me just delete everything here and [292] make this uh like from scratch um this [294] URL module or this URL field over here [297] rather um that's that's referring to the [299] universal res Source locator luckily all [301] of us already know what that is um URL [303] is just a web address so google.com [305] that's a URL left click. that's my [307] website that's a URL amazon.com these [310] are all Universal resource locators as [312] the name sort of points to this is just [314] meant to be like a way to locate any [316] resource on the internet and to do it [318] universally right so that's number one [322] the second thing is called a method and [324] if we go back to our HTTP module here um [327] you'll see that there is a method field [329] and by the way if you're unfamiliar [330] anything in make.com where the text is [332] bolded like this that's a required field [334] meaning you have to select a method you [335] have to select a URL basically in order [337] to click okay and have this work if I [339] remove this it's going to tell me that [341] the value must not be empty so these are [344] required pieces of information um the [346] method field here is broken into a bunch [348] of different options and these were [349] really intimidating to me when I first [350] started out but the good news is you're [352] not actually going to need the vast [353] majority of options on this screen after [355] several years of working with make.com [357] and several more years of just making [359] HTT T your request on the internet [360] outside of make.com here are the only [363] ones that I actually use I only ever use [366] get which is sort of like one of the [368] first ways to request information on the [370] internet to access a resource sort of [372] the old way uh post which I like to [375] think of is just a modern get request [377] but it's also a way that you can like [378] add data to an API or resource or update [381] a database and then put and put is [384] basically like I talked about updating [385] um some apis um split adding resources [389] and updating resources into two [391] different methods and so post would be [393] an adding a resource and put would be [395] like updating a resource um this doesn't [398] really make any sense in theory so you [400] know if I were to discuss this [401] practically let's say you had a um I [404] don't know like a like a clickup uh CRM [407] and you had a bunch of leads in the CRM [408] with email addresses first names and [410] last names when you call the clickup API [414] like when you send a request to the [415] clickup module what you're really doing [417] is you're sending a post request with a [418] bunch of fields in it that basically say [420] hey I want to add a new record or hey I [422] want to delete a record when you send a [424] put request what you're doing is you're [425] basically providing the ID of a specific [427] record you're saying hey I want to [429] update this I want to change this I [430] don't actually know if clickup uses put [432] but uh you know that's more or less how [434] that works so those are the only three [436] that you actually really need to know [437] and in practice you know I've as I've [439] said I've made well over a million [440] dollars with make.com at this point I [442] actually have to like sit back and add [443] it up it's probably over a million and a [445] half now maybe even two million um these [448] are the only ones that I ever use and [449] they're probably the only ones that [450] you're ever going to use [452] to okay so that's URL that's method [455] let's talk a little bit about headers [457] headers are just structured key value [460] pairs that most servers look for what is [462] a key value pair well if I open up this [465] header Zan if I just click add a new [467] record you'll see that it asks for two [469] Fields one called name and in make.com a [472] name is just a just a key and then the [474] second is a value so if I were to [477] say ID equals = 30 [482] fe8 presumably this is the ID or [485] identifier of some resource that I'm [486] calling you know like a clickup record [488] or maybe a row in my Google sheet or [490] something like that um what I've done [493] here is I've basically added a [494] structured key value pair to the header [497] now the headers somebody just you know [499] as I mentioned this guy Tim or whoever [501] it was that invented this back in 1989 [503] um they basically just said hey uh we [506] just have some format here where you [508] know at the beginning of the request we [509] need to add a bunch of headers because [512] maybe we want the headers to be [513] standardized maybe they were thinking a [515] little bit about like cookies you know [516] 10 or 15 years from now they were just [518] thinking about like all the information [519] they could put in here and how if they [520] standardized it it'd be much easier for [522] people to send and receive requests um [524] and that's really the name of the game [525] here the internet is very standardized [527] now including HTTP requests which is why [529] you have these conventions so uh [531] realistically headers are stuff nowadays [533] like this user agent Mozilla 5.0 uh [537] there's like a standard header called [539] the user agent which just typically [540] tells a website hey what am I using to [542] browse this uh there's uh like I think [546] there's like uh a dimensions of the [548] browser it like tells them how big the [549] browser is for instance you can imagine [551] how this information might be useful to [553] the server because one it'll help them [555] track you and develop evil Cookie [558] monitoring ad services blahaha but [560] second and probably more importantly is [562] they'll actually be able to like cater [563] the content to people at either that [565] specific screen size or people that are [566] using that specific browser or what have [568] you the header that really matters for [571] us today is going to be the [573] authorization header and the [574] authorization header is just a standard [576] it's a convention that a lot of apis use [578] to send uh and receive requests using an [580] API key and the authorization header [582] just looks like this you literally just [584] the key is called authorization with a [586] capital A and then the value is always [587] the word Bearer plus a space and then [590] you know API key goes here so pretend I [593] had a big API key like this what I would [595] do is I would write authorization in the [597] key and then I would write Bearer and [598] then i' a space just like this with [601] capital B and everything and then I just [602] paste in my API key and I'll actually [604] connect to several apis using this exact [606] method in a few minutes so you can add [609] basically an infinite number of headers [611] um and as I mentioned there a bunch of [612] templated headers there's like uh like [614] cookie for instance there a bunch of [615] different types of cookies um so just [618] keep that in mind header is just a way [619] to structure that [621] information okay and then the last sort [624] of way or or main component in an HTTP [627] request is called a request content [630] or the request body and the request [632] content is just this section down over [634] here we see it as request content you [636] know how earlier we had let's just say [638] ID and let's just do this if this were [640] in our header for instance um you could [644] Al or or uh let me let me actually do [645] the authorization [647] example what you'll find and what I'll [649] talk about in a minute is that some apis [651] like when the API key is formatted like [653] this but other apis actually prefer the [656] API key to be formatted like this [661] and this format here is called Json Json [664] is still split into key value pairs it's [666] just written uh in this specific format [669] that I've showed you with curly braces [671] and quotes and keys wrapped in this uh [673] in these quotes with colons and between [675] them and then you know some closing [677] curly brace so I'll get into the [678] specifics of these formatting pieces in [681] a moment but for now just know that [683] again this is just a protocol that we [685] agreed on forever ago before I was born [687] that's for sure um and ever since then [690] the internet and really the World At [691] Large has just been using this [692] convention to send and receive [693] standardized [695] info so as I mentioned down here there [697] are a couple of finer points but I never [698] really use them and if you're building [700] an automation business that actually [701] makes money you probably won't either uh [703] you're just going to use those two [704] modules that I showed you early the make [706] a request module 95% of the time and [708] then the make an ooth 2 request module [710] the other 5% of the time so that's what [712] we'll cover and then I'll actually give [714] you some practical examples with the [715] HTTP modules in a moment but first I [717] want to talk a little bit about API [719] okay and how you can turn this module [723] basically into any other module you want [726] like this HTTP makeer request module if [728] you format it right it will be [730] functionally equivalent to this canva [731] created design module it's just instead [733] of make and canva having done the heavy [735] lifting for you you're actually going to [737] build out that connection [739] yourself all right in terms of apis we [743] have a very fancy diagram over here [746] which I definitely did not just search [748] up the word API diagram on Google Images [751] and then just copy the first result that [753] would be bad uh but we have a laptop [754] over here which is U and then it sends a [758] request to an API which is connected to [761] a server you can just think of these as [762] one for Simplicity and then the server [766] in the API they'll send a response back [768] and that response will be formatted a [769] particular way it'll go back into your [771] computer and then voila you'll get some [772] data now because we're using make.com [775] which is a cloud service our diagram [776] doesn't actually look like that our [778] diagram instead of the U the U is like [780] make.com so excuse me any request that [783] you're sending you're not sending from [784] yourself you're sending it from make.com [786] and that's important [787] distinction so what does an API actually [789] stand for API stands for application [791] programming interface and uh to be [793] honest I think it's just one of the [794] dumbest names anybody could have ever [796] used to uh you know encapsulate this [799] this this idea the whole idea [801] essentially is that this is an interface [803] uh your the internals of the API process [806] and your server are a black box so you [808] can only like access it through the [809] interface but I I just think that it's [811] really silly and I just hate how the [813] internet and computer scientists at [815] large have just turned everything into [816] three or fourl acronyms which don't [818] really provide a lot of uh convenience [821] for people that are learning this for [822] the first time that's okay this [824] basically just refers to a server that [826] you'll send something to to receive [827] something else what you'll send as we [829] show here is the request and what you [831] receive is the response so people always [833] talk about HTTP requests what was the [835] response body what was all that stuff [837] that's basically it when it's a request [839] it's what you're sending when it's a [840] response it's what they're sending back [841] to you now apis are kind of like you [844] know user accounts they're kind of like [846] uh they require a password essentially [848] and the password to access an API is [849] typically just referred to as the API [851] key so this is a password that allows [853] you to access your specific account and [856] because it's a password you you [857] typically have to be quite careful with [859] those things you don't want to like [860] expose your API key and you don't want [862] to show it to everybody because a lot of [863] the time apis are connected to the [865] pricing of some software service so uh [867] you know maybe you only have 100 API per [869] month on the $5 plan and then if you go [871] past that now you're paying 50 bucks [872] well if you expose your API key and [874] there's some douchebag out there on the [875] internet as there always is uh who you [877] know copies it and uses it to make his [879] own requests well now you know you're [880] sort of going to be up creek [884] without a paddle as I believe they uh [885] they [886] say but that's all Theory let's actually [888] make things practical why don't I [889] actually show you what this might look [891] like in reality well I have a service [893] here that I talk about pretty often um [895] called any mail finder and I love these [897] guys because they uh you know I've been [899] using them basically non-stop like [900] literally once a day probably for the [903] last godamn four or five months [905] something like that um they're really [907] cost effective like email enrichment [908] service if you're UNF familiar with [909] email enrichment basically U they will [911] try and find an email address for you at [912] a specific domain or something so this [915] is what the interface looks like and [916] basically the way that it works is you [918] know if you're using the user interface [919] if you're using like the the typical the [921] graphic user interface the GUI if you [923] wanted to find a um person at a domain [926] you just Supply the domain and then [927] you'd Supply their full name so Nick at [929] left [930] click. and what you see is it just [932] created a little new row and it says hey [935] we found an email at left click. Nick [938] left click. which actually turns out to [940] be my email um which you will not do bad [942] things with and [945] then uh you know this is basically like [947] the the workflow right but accessing [949] this GUI is super annoying like it just [951] sucks to have to go in here every time [953] what if you had 10,000 domains that you [955] really quickly wanted to check the full [957] names um and email addresses of [959] what are you going to do sit here like a [960] monkey and just copy and paste them in [962] for hours no obviously not and that's [964] where apis come in handy and so any [966] maale finder has an API where you're [968] supplying an API key and you can use [971] that API key to make requests to the any [973] mail finder API um and so what I'm going [976] to be showing you guys later is I will [978] literally copy this API key which is [980] like my password but it's not a big deal [981] because I can rotate it right after this [983] video that means I can just switch it um [985] but I can I can use that API key in a [987] request to basically supply all of the [989] same information I just supplied here [991] there'll be a field for left click. my [993] domain name there'll be a field for my [994] full name there'll be a domain for [996] whether it's a person search a decision [997] maker search a company search right I [999] could supply all of that information [1001] just using Json instead of you know what [1003] I'm doing here and then it'll go and [1005] it'll it'll do it for me it'll do the [1006] thing and and you know return a [1008] result so that's more or less it we're [1011] going to send an HTTP request to any [1013] mail finders API their server is going [1014] to do some fun magic I don't know what [1016] sort of like black Wizardry they're [1017] doing down there but uh you know you'll [1019] receive a response with the enriched [1021] email most platforms that you've [1023] probably used up until now inm make.com [1025] will have built-in API connections like [1028] for instance let's say I wanted to use [1029] this canva module here right the genon [1032] asset so essentially what canva has done [1036] is they have gone to their API and then [1039] they've written all the code to call a [1041] specific part of their API and then [1043] they've just packaged it into a module [1045] here for us to access and so now we [1047] don't actually have to do all the heavy [1048] lifting in order to to do it um all we [1050] have to do is just drag and drop a [1051] module and then go over here and then [1052] click create a connection where we just [1054] have an one little login screen and then [1056] we're [1057] good they're still using apis that's [1060] exactly what they're doing um but what [1064] we're going to do now is we're assuming [1065] that the service that you want to [1067] connect to doesn't have an API so you [1068] sort of have to do it [1070] yourself that's why knowing this is so [1072] powerful it more or less lets you create [1073] your own modules anytime that you want [1075] and I I consider it a requirement really [1077] if you want to scale up um your make.com [1080] just in general your automation [1083] workflows okay we got a little bit more [1085] Theory here and then we're going to dive [1086] into the Practical bit there are three [1089] main types of API [1090] requests now I'm saying because the [1092] internet is made by people and people [1094] are very opinionated and usually people [1097] will agree on something and then [1099] somebody later will come by and say why [1101] the hell are they doing it like that [1102] that sounds dumb I'm going to invent my [1103] own thing essentially because everybody [1106] has their own opinions about the best [1107] way to do things several conventions [1109] have Arisen um around how API requests [1113] should be formatted where you should put [1115] the API key uh what's the most secure [1117] method of going about it and how do you [1119] balance that security against the ease [1120] of use and integratability and and all [1122] that stuff so there are actually [1124] hundreds if not thousands of different [1126] ways that you know some random API over [1129] there is going to format it that way and [1130] this other API is going to format it the [1131] other way uh but in practice I find that [1133] they all fall they all fall into three [1135] main categories three main umbrellas [1139] the first is that you'll put your API [1140] keys in a header the second is that [1142] you'll put your API keys in the request [1144] content and the third and this is the [1147] hardest one for many people to [1148] understand and this is a question I get [1149] in my community all the time is you'll [1151] connect via ooth to which I'll cover uh [1154] later and I'm going to show you examples [1156] of each there's really no fundamental [1157] difference just a few minor changes to [1159] the steps of the AP request but before I [1162] do that just to show you what this means [1163] in practice we've actually already gone [1165] through this this module right we've [1167] seen the URL the meth method the um [1170] headers and then the request content so [1172] the first way is you just put your API [1173] keys in a header so just as I mentioned [1175] here with the authorization Bearer uh [1176] you just do something like this and [1179] sometimes it's authorization bear [1181] sometimes it's X API key and then you [1183] you remove the bear part sometimes it's [1185] like the service itself I think a [1187] phantom Buster is like this for instance [1189] um and I'm going to use their API call [1191] later but essentially you just put them [1193] in the header the second main way is you [1195] put it in the request content and so you [1197] actually have something like this that [1199] says API key you write it just like this [1202] and then you send it in a post request [1204] specifically you can't do a get request [1206] has to be a post uh and I'll show you an [1208] example of that later and then the third [1210] is you forgo this module entirely and [1212] then instead use a module called the [1214] make an O 2.0 request where you actually [1216] have to manually create a [1218] connection by essentially doing a little [1221] bit more complicated of an [1222] authentication flow where you have to [1224] get a client ID a client secret an [1225] authorize Ur a token URI a bunch of [1227]  more or less [1229] uh it's a lot more secure for [1230] sure but um you know for people that are [1232] just getting started it just seems a lot [1234] more complex regardless it's all right [1236] it's really not that hard and I'm going [1237] to show you how to do um I'm going to [1238] show you how to do it in a [1240] moment the last thing that we need to do [1242] in order to really deeply understand [1244] HTTP requests and then how to make API [1246] calls is we need to understand Json Json [1249] stands for JavaScript object notation [1253] JavaScript is a programming language [1255] primarily used on the internet [1257] JavaScript objects are part particular [1259] ways of writing information that are [1262] wrapped in these little curly braces so [1264] JavaScript object notation is basically [1267] where regardless of whether or not we're [1268] using JavaScript JavaScript we're [1271] writing uh about a resource just using [1273] that very specific convention with a [1274] very specific protocol very specific [1276] language so just like HTTP some people [1279] shook hands uh you know what's that 25 [1281] years ago and said 35 years ago and said [1284] this is how uh you know we're going to [1285] format our requests JavaScript was sort [1288] of a collab effort where a bunch of [1289] people said okay this is how we're going [1290] to do the format with the curly braces [1292] and the quotes and all that stuff [1294] JavaScript object notation really is [1296] nothing scary if you just stare at it [1298] for 10 minutes you will get it and [1301] you'll be able to deal with so many more [1304] possibilities and opportunities and make [1306] the issue is most people just don't get [1307] it explained to them in this way and so [1309] they always think of Jason as this very [1310] intimidating sort of like black box [1313] where you know you have to ask gp4 for [1315] or something like [1316] that historically getting right was a [1319] pain in the ass um because you know [1322] you'd spend 30 seconds you know looking [1325] at an example Jason request and then [1327] you'd format it the same way and you'd [1328] send it and then it would say error you [1330] know 400 requests invalid data whatever [1333] you'd be like what the hell's going on [1334] you'd stare at it line by line and then [1336] finally you'd realize that you forgot a [1337] little square bracket or curly bracket [1339] or something but nowadays if that ever [1341] happens to you you can just get AI to [1342] fix it in like two seconds you just copy [1344] and paste your Jason you send it to Ai [1346] and you say hey can you fix this Jason [1347] what's wrong with it and it'll expl [1348] explain it to you so what we're going to [1351] do next is we're just going to stare at [1352] the below examples and I'm going to walk [1353] you through basically how Json Works um [1357] not entirely but in a high Roi way again [1359] I'm going to do the 8020 I'm going to [1361] cut out all the stuff that doesn't super [1363] import like extremely [1365] matter so uh first things first what is [1368] this over here in the top left hand [1369] corner well this is probably the [1371] simplest Json structure you could [1373] possibly have notice how we have a left [1376] curly bracket that starts the object [1380] then we have a quote and then we have a [1382] key which I'm calling username then we [1385] have another quote so from there you [1387] could see that the keys are wrapped in [1389] quotes then we have a colon that's very [1392] important and then we have the value and [1395] in this case the value is also wrapped [1397] in quotes and then when you want to [1398] finish your object you just have to make [1400] sure that the number of open curly [1402] braces and the number of closed curly [1403] braces match so this here is an object [1408] you could imagine how this object might [1410] refer to a character in a video game [1412] maybe my username is King Nick right and [1415] I'm going to carry that example forward [1417] with you through a few more of [1418] these essentially all you need to know [1421] is that you're going to have some quoted [1424] thing on the left hand side and that's [1425] going to be your key and then you're [1427] going to have something on the right [1429] hand side this thing doesn't need to be [1430] quoted which I'll get to in a second and [1432] then between them you're just going to [1433] have a colon these are your key value [1436] pairs let's look at another example [1438] example here this is a more complex [1440] example but um this is probably at the [1442] level where most of the API requests [1444] that you are formatting sending and [1446] receiving will be so in this example we [1449] have the exact same thing that we had [1451] before it's just instead of closing our [1453] Json with another curly brace what we've [1455] done is we've extended it and we've [1457] added multiple options and the way that [1459] you add multiple options in Jason is you [1460] just add a little comma here right so I [1462] have a little comma right after username [1464] King neck and that just is a convention [1467] that says hey this is going to be more [1468] than one we're going to add multiple [1470] anytime you want to add another you just [1471] add another comma so now in addition to [1474] username King neck we also have a level [1476] key and that level key has a little [1479] colon behind it the value of that level [1480] key is 42 now I've wrapped this 42 in [1483] quotes but you don't actually have to [1485] wrap numbers in quotes some apis want [1488] numbers formatted with quotes and then [1490] other apis for whatever reason do not [1492] want numbers formatted with quotes this [1494] is a computer science principle [1496] essentially called type uh [1498] type casting or something like that make [1501] will typ cast everything essentially to [1502] a string most of the time or it'll try [1504] and intelligently typ cast it for you so [1506] for most instances you don't need to [1507] know specifically what type of variable [1509] it is um but in some you may so if you [1512] ever have some error where you try and [1515] call a video game API and feed them in [1516] username KCK with level 42 and it says [1519] you know in uh improperly formatted [1521] Jason just think to yourself hm okay [1524] maybe it's the number maybe I'll just [1525] take the quotes off try again odds are [1527] it's going to work [1529] okay and then down here we have a [1531] relatively big deviation from what we've [1533] done so far which is instead of having [1535] keys and values just both wrapped in [1537] quotes now we have another key called [1539] skills and a colon but the value this [1542] time isn't just a string the value this [1544] time is an array and arrays in Json [1548] start with a square bracket then end [1551] with a square bracket on the right hand [1552] side and so arrays are just basically [1556] like a list of different values [1558] separated by commas and if you've worked [1560] with arrays in make.com before you sort [1562] of instinctively understand how this [1564] will work um just make sure to wrap [1567] every string in these quotes here and [1569] then you could have as many as you want [1571] so in my case this is an object here [1574] that describes a username of King neck a [1576] level of 42 and then an array of skills [1579] that includes walking and running my [1580] video game character is very [1582] boring so I mentioned that skills is an [1584] array you have multiple values wrapped [1585] in square brackets play around with us [1587] there are a bunch of websites out there [1588] that allow you to format Json however [1590] you want you know you could add another [1592] comma here and then say sword play or [1595] something like that you could add [1596] another comma here and hypothetically [1598] you could say 39 right whether that's a [1600] skill or not I don't know but again [1601] we're just making up at this point [1604] um the point I'm making is you have [1605] multiple different data types buried [1606] within an array so in reality the thing [1610] above the second you start adding more [1611] like complicated data types like arrays [1614] and and stuff like that um it gets [1615] pretty hard to read so most people will [1617] just indent it and they have a very [1618] specific way to indent it where [1619] basically every time there's a curly [1621] bracket you will do a tab um to the [1624] right after and then you're basically [1625] going to have a small little space so [1627] let me show you a more complicated Json [1629] structure that includes everything that [1630] we've talked about so far just with one [1632] additional layer of [1634] complexity so we have this opening curly [1636] bra bracket but then instead of jumping [1639] right into the username what we've done [1641] is we've added a key called user and [1644] then we've added a colon and then check [1646] this out we've actually embedded another [1648] JavaScript object inside of the value of [1652] that user key and this is really the [1655] final piece to the puzzle this allows [1657] Jason to become arbitrarily complex [1659] because now you can Nest multiple [1661] objects within key value Pairs and you [1664] could have a key with an object as a [1665] value with a bunch of keys that have [1667] their own objects as values and in this [1669] way you can get like 20 layers deep I'll [1672] be frank though apis that typically do [1673] get you 20 layers deep are typically [1675] shitty apis there's usually no need for [1677] the data to be like that crazy deep and [1679] nested essentially um so some of the [1682] times it's just something that you have [1683] to deal with uh personally the the best [1685] apis that I find the easiest ones to use [1687] they go maybe like one two three layers [1689] deep at most the good news is all of [1692] this is easily understood by make.com [1694] because there are modules that parse [1695] this automatically that turn this into [1697] variables that you can just access with [1699] you know dragging and dropping a module [1700] like we normally do so uh we have a user [1703] key and then inside we have another [1705] object here and if you think about it [1707] this object starts with this this curly [1708] bracket and then ends with this curly [1710] bracket right because we have to have [1712] the number of Open brackets uh equal to [1714] the number of closed brackets and this [1715] is the next successive curly bracket so [1718] this whole object here starts here then [1721] inside of it we have a user key with [1722] another object here and inside of that [1724] user key we have a key called ID with [1726] King Nick level which is now just a [1728] number 42 and then again we have an [1730] array of skills which are walking and [1733] running and as I mentioned down here you [1735] can Nest infinitely [1738] okay so that's the 8020 with Jason to be [1740] honest I think that that's all you're [1741] really going to need in order to get out [1743] there and start practically [1745] understanding what is Jason when you [1746] know you send a request and then you [1748] receive uh a response from a server [1750] let's actually take this information out [1752] now and let's actually go connect to [1753] some apis let me show you how to do all [1755] of this Theory uh but in practice so the [1758] first API I'm going to connect to is [1759] called any mail [1761] finder as I've shown you guys previously [1763] you can easily enrich or find an email [1766] using the GUI just going to exit out a [1769] full screen here so I can bounce around [1770] a little bit [1772] easier what I have over here is of an [1774] HTTP and API [1776] playground what I'm going to do is I'm [1778] just going to rename this and I'll just [1780] call this any mail finder this just [1783] going to be like our test module then [1785] every time I connect to another API I'm [1787] just going to create a new module then [1788] we're just going to run them all [1791] independently okay so I want to connect [1793] to any mail finder well what do I need [1795] to do uh the thing that most of these [1797] websites tab is they'll Supply you some [1799] type of API documentation and so anytime [1801] you want to connect to the API of a [1803] service typically what I do is I just [1804] type nil finder API I'll just add the [1807] word API at the end of the service and [1810] here we have the email finder API [1812] documentation for any mail finder and [1814] this is basically what all API [1816] documentation is going to look like [1817] because they have a couple of custom um [1820] sorry not custom templated like [1822] libraries that make API documentation so [1824] usually on the left hand side you'll [1825] have like some sort of table of contents [1827] and then the middle here you'll have a [1828] bunch of data and on the right hand side [1830] if it's a good API they'll actually give [1831] you some examples of the way to format [1833] the requests and receive the [1835] responses so here we have the Emil [1837] finder API what I'll always do when I [1840] access one of these apis is I'll very [1841] quickly read to see um what the [1844] authentication looks like so I'm [1846] scrolling through here okay they talk [1848] about rate limits our API does not have [1849] rate limits that's awesome rate limit [1851] just means if you send too many requests [1854] um eventually they will just cap it out [1855] and they'll say sorry you can only send [1857] 10 all right so now we're already [1858] getting to the juicy part is the [1860] authentication so all requests require [1863] authentication to authenticate you'll [1864] need to set an authorization header with [1867] the API key you find in your your [1869] settings as a value for example if your [1872] API key is secretor key1 23 you will [1875] want to add an authorization header with [1877] the value Bearer space secretor key1 23 [1882] if you guys remember this is the first [1884] way to authenticate that I showed you [1887] guys earlier you basically need to put a [1889] header and that header needs to have the [1890] key authorization and the value bear [1892] space whatever your API key is so that's [1895] awesome very convenient and I most [1897] definitely did not plan this so first [1899] thing that we have to do is we have to [1900] go to our your settings as value so I'm [1902] going to open up a new tab and you see [1904] we have an API key over here which is [1906] awesome so I'm going to copy this API [1908] key I'm going to go back to make.com [1910] open up an any mailer Tab and then all [1913] I'm going to do for now is I'm going to [1914] add this authorization header [1921] this is going to be the format of our [1923] API [1924] request I'm going to click okay for now [1926] because we haven't learned anything more [1927] about this API um we want to see how to [1930] send a request and basically enrich an [1932] email I'm just exit out of [1933] that okay great now it's time for us to [1936] basically figure out what exactly we [1938] want to do right and what I want to do [1939] is I want to send a company domain like [1941] I did earlier left click. and I want to [1943] send a full name and I want to have uh I [1944] want it to return me the results I want [1946] it to say Nick left click. a just like [1949] this example gave us back over [1951] here the way that we do this is usually [1954] on the left hand side they'll be um as I [1956] mentioned a table of contents but these [1958] table of contents will all be different [1959] endpoints an endpoint is just a [1961] universal resource locator that's [1963] specific to a function so one function [1965] might be search for an email well [1967] that'll be a universal resource locator [1969] that points somewhere else search for [1971] all emails on a domain that'll be a [1973] different Universal resource locator so [1975] I'm going to click on search for an [1976] email and you see it's going to go all [1977] all the way down here and it's going to [1980] say use our post [1982] v5.0 [1984] Searchers Json endpoint to find an [1986] individual's email well that's great but [1988] what the hell does that mean anytime you [1991] see a slash and then you see um an [1993] ending like this this is referred to as [1995] a relative Universal resource locator a [1998] relative URL it means that you need to [2000] figure out what the base URL is now [2003] fortunately in this case they're nice [2005] enough to provide us an explicit example [2008] of what their root URL is which in this [2010] case is api. nilf [2012] finder.com this is the root here and [2014] then the V5 o and stuff that's just [2016] everything that comes after but in some [2019] instances uh you won't be able to and I [2021] find in practice most apis are like name [2024] of thee thing.com AI or they're api. [2027] nameof thee thing.com so that's your [2030] root but as you see it's as easy as this [2032] they actually provide us an example [2034] request content or request body to send [2037] and what I'm going to is I'm literally [2038] just going to copy all of this Json and [2040] I'm just going to replace it with my own [2041]  and if I'm honest that's 99% of [2043] what my job is I just find an example [2045] request then I go in and I replace it [2047] with the data from the client or the [2049] data that I want in my business so uh [2052] we're getting three pieces of [2053] information here we're getting the [2055] method which is post we're getting the [2056] universal resource locator and then [2058] we're getting the request content we've [2059] already mucked around with the header [2061] but if you think back to my earlier [2063] slide um those are the four pieces of [2065] information that you need the header the [2066] universal resource locator the method [2068] and then the request content everything [2069] else is templated everything else is [2071] just going to be the same basically [2072] every time so actually go ahead and [2075] let's do this just going to drag these [2077] two tabs so they're really close [2078] together I'm going to open up this email [2080] finder module and I'm just going to [2082] paste in the URL remember that it said [2084] post so I'm going to click method I'll [2085] go to post I already have my header here [2088] with the authorization and the bearer [2090] and there are a couple of additional [2091] Fields here that may look a little bit [2092] different to you um I always just do [2095] this I mean if I go back here and I [2096] pretend that all this is empty and I've [2098] never I haven't filled out anything I [2100] always do this go to raw and then [2101] content type just go to application Json [2104] this works more than 99% of the time um [2106] the vast majority of apis are formatted [2108] in this way the last thing we need to do [2111] is change the request content so I'm [2112] going to go back to my API documentation [2115] here and then I'm going to copy this [2116] because this is the request content and [2119] we know enough Json now for this to be [2122] very clear and by the way I just pasted [2124] this in command V or uh control V on [2128] Windows and then as you see it has a [2130] bunch of weird spacing the reason why is [2132] because it's not taking the new lines in [2133] it's just taking in the tabs so if you [2135] wanted to preserve spacing quick little [2137] hack is to right click and then press [2138] paste and match style that'll basically [2140] all the time um just just match it to [2142] whatever it was in the [2144] example okay and then what I want to do [2146] is if you think about it I'm looking for [2148] a specific person at a specific domain [2150] so in my case I'm going to type in left [2152] click. and the person's full name is [2154] going to be Nick [2156] sarv I'm going to click parse response [2158] is yes and that's it that's all you need [2160] in order to essentially create this API [2163] connection to a service that doesn't [2165] have um like a built-in service or [2167] built-in integration with [2169] make.com this show advance settings down [2171] here I don't use any of this so don't [2174] worry about it I never use the username [2176] the password the timeout share cookies [2178] with HTP module self sign certificate [2180] reject connections I've worked with [2183] probably several hundred apis at this [2185] point and I haven't needed to do this so [2187] odds are unless you're working with a [2188] very Legacy API or something that's just [2190] super non-standard you're probably not [2192] going to need to do that as well um if [2194] there ends up being a demand for it I'll [2195] make some videos on this but I'm not [2197] going to now simply because it's very [2199] very very rarely required or relevant [2202] and even when it is there's usually ways [2203] that you don't actually have to do this [2204] you could just go back to using [2205] something like bear authorization like I [2207] did [2208] above okay great so we've set everything [2211] up it's now time for the Moment of Truth [2214] what I'm going to do is I'm going to [2216] right click on this module and click run [2217] this module only this is functionally [2219] equivalent to clicking run once if [2220] you're curious um I just like doing it [2222] this [2223] way and we're going to see what it says [2226] so we just made a request status code [2228] was 200 when you receive a 200 status [2230] request that typically tells you that [2232] everything was [2233] okay as you see if you guys remember I [2236] talked about there being an HTTP request [2237] and I also talked about there being an [2239] HTTP response so this is the response [2241] right here and you see the response also [2243] includes headers so the response has a [2245] header called Date which stores the [2247] exact date the request is made has one [2249] called content type application Json [2251] right it has one called content length [2255] it has a bunch more I'm not going to [2257] dive into every single one but suffice [2258] to say that these are just standard ways [2261] that apis communicate with each other [2263] and they standard pieces of information [2265] that allow um people like you [2267] integrators to just have a little bit [2268] more metad a little bit more context to [2270] do cool stuff with hypothetically maybe [2272] you wanted to know that the um API was [2275] powered by Express Express is just a [2277] library or like yeah like a server [2279] library that allows you to run one of [2281] these apis yourself um now you [2283] know so that's headers if we go down to [2286] cookie headers you'll see that that's [2288] empty sometimes this just stores [2289] information that's like hypers specific [2291] to you the user now the thing that we [2293] really want here is this data [2295] collection and this data collection like [2298] uh when you make an HTTP request to a [2300] resource and it returns a positive [2301] result you'll always have something in [2303] this data collection so you're always [2304] going to have to go into the data [2305] collection in order to get something [2307] and you'll notice that there are two [2309] different um collections here or objects [2312] the first is called input and the second [2313] is called results so input is just any [2316] mail finder the specific API is [2318] providing you the same thing that you [2320] provided it just in case you need it and [2322] so this is the API just being nice and [2324] saying hey maybe you're going to need [2325] this domain name later hey maybe you're [2327] going to need this full name later I [2328] don't know obviously we don't because we [2330] have that information previously but [2332] maybe you're sending this information [2333] from one scenario and then you're [2335] retrieving it from another scenario or [2336] something like that [2338] these conveniences are afforded To Us by [2340] apis to make our lives a little bit [2342] easier all right and then the thing that [2344] we're really looking for at least in the [2345] specific API right although all of your [2348] results will be in data um different [2350] apis have different conventions for [2351] whether it's called input results [2353] whatever right these are all variables [2354] that they came up with but inside of [2356] this specific API the results collection [2358] has an email Nick at left click. and [2361] then a validation which is valid as well [2363] as some Alternatives which in this case [2365] are empty you'll also see there's a [2367] success uh key value pair and the value [2370] there is true so this gives you a ton of [2372] information and a ton of possibilities [2374] right you could feed this into a flow [2376] that is different things based off [2377] whether the success is true the success [2379] is false the success is true maybe it [2380] takes this email address and it sends [2382] him an email or adds them to some [2384] different campaign or something like [2385] that if it's false maybe it goes through [2387] some other validation method or maybe it [2388] tries to call their website to scrape a [2390] specific little snippet or something [2392] like that right a lot of options here uh [2394] but essentially that's how you do one of [2397] the most basic types of API [2399] requests all right but one rep is not [2401] enough to grow giant freaking biceps so [2403] what we're going to do is we're going to [2404] do this a few more times for different [2406] apis we just did this with any maale [2409] finder why don't I exit out of there and [2411] then why don't we also do this with [2413] Phantom Buster so I'm gonna open up [2414] Phantom [2418] Buster excuse me I actually already have [2422] Phantom Buster open over here good Lord [2425] so um Phantom buster if you're [2427] unfamiliar with how Phantom Buster works [2429] is what it is is it's like a scraping [2430] platform which allows you to uh [2432] basically scrape things like LinkedIn [2434] leads allows you to run scrapers I think [2437] for Instagram as well if I go to [2438] dashboard here and then I say browse [2440] Phantoms you'll see there's just a [2442] variety of different things you could do [2443] scrape leads from LinkedIn company post [2445] connect with profiles on LinkedIn search [2448] um you could AI LinkedIn message writer [2449] do DMS Google Maps search right this is [2452] basically just a big scraping platform [2454] and hypothetically you know I talk a lot [2455] about this platform in my community [2456] because it helps us get leads that we [2459] then do email Outreach to but [2461] hypothetically let's say you wanted to [2462] interact with this API um you know [2466] through make.com you didn't want to have [2467] to do it manually you wanted to do it [2468] all [2469] automatically well what I'm going to do [2471] as I did before is I'm going to go to [2472] Phantom Buster I'm going to type in API [2474] you'll see that the first result is [2476] phantombuster API let's give that a [2478] click says you can programmatically [2480] control your Phantom Buster account and [2482] then there's also an API reference right [2484] over here so I'm just going to open that [2485] in a new tab let's just see what this [2487] looks like ah great as we saw with the [2491] nil finder API it's organized in a very [2493] similar way you have three columns you [2495] have the end points on the left then you [2497] have a description about them in the [2498] middle then on the right you have like [2500] actual examples of what this looks like [2502] and this is a little bit more complex [2503] but the good news is I'm going to be [2504] able to walk you through some some [2506] different libraries that you could use [2508] um and and ways to get the information [2509] that you need so um they misspelled that [2513] losers no I'm just kidding if we scroll [2516] down here you'll see if there there's a [2517] bunch of information but again the one [2519] that's the most important for us is this [2521] one here authentication or request [2523] format because this is what's going to [2525] um basically allow us to connect to the [2527] API it's basically going to allow us to [2528] like sign into our specific account [2530] right so these guys are great because [2532] they actually provide you like a whole [2534] breakdown like a little GIF of how to [2536] access the API key and they even provide [2538] you a link for convenience where they [2541] say your API resides in your workspace [2542] settings page so if we just open this in [2543] a new tab as you see down over here [2546] third party AP key I can click add API [2548] key and this is the one over here that I [2550] want so I'm just going to oh they even [2551] have a little copy button I'm going to [2552] copy my API key [2554] here I'll just go back and I'll see what [2556] else they say about it how do we [2557] actually [2559] authenticate again they're saying [2561] protect your API key this is good uh [2563] good convention in my case I'm going to [2564] delete all my API keys after this video [2566] but don't go sharing this if you don't [2568] have to all right now we get to the good [2570] parts the authentication part how [2572] exactly do we connect with this API well [2575] let's see authentication is dead simple [2577] put your API key in the x- phantombuster [2581] D [2582] ke-1 HTTP header you can also put it in [2586] the key query string parameter of every [2588] request that you make fantastic now it [2591] looks like this is an API that actually [2592] gives us multiple ways to authenticate [2595] we're going to use this one because this [2596] one's easier but you can also [2598] authenticate using query strings which [2600] are interesting as well and I'll cover [2601] that [2603] briefly so that's fantastic this is [2605] exactly what we want [2607] we just feed in this x- phantombuster D [2610] key so why don't I go back here to my [2612] new module and I'm just going to rename [2613] this and call this [2616] phantombuster and let's just make this [2618] the [2619] trigger and why don't I go over here and [2622] then change this uh header structure so [2625] remember before it was authorization and [2627] the value is be space whatever the API [2629] key is let me just refresh my memory [2631] here it's x- phantombuster D [2634] ke-1 so instead of authorization [2639] it's this and then we just paste the API [2641] key in again people make API keys [2644] because they want you to use them so [2646] they're going to tell you how to do so [2647] at some point the unfortunate thing is [2649] some apis are just written quite poorly [2651] and some of them are nowhere near as [2653] straightforward and simple as [2655] otherwise okay I'll cover how to do [2657] query parameters in a moment but let's [2659] actually figure out what we want to do [2661] like the Endo that we want to [2662] specifically [2664] run so why don't I go back here [2669] and let me see what I got [2674] here there are a bunch of different [2676] things we could do as you see they're [2678] organized into like branches there's the [2680] orgs branch which is just um SL orgs [2683] there's containers SL containers there's [2685] slash branches SL agents SL script SLC [2688] capture SL AI oh that's interesting huh [2693] I didn't even know that we could use [2695] this for um AI calls very very cool org [2698] storage right all this stuff's pretty [2701] neat um I think what I'm going to do is [2704] I'm just going to export the agent usage [2707] because that seems the simplest to me [2708] and then we're just going to get some [2709] data that tells us I guess when the last [2711] time is that we used one of these [2712] Phantoms just going to give us some [2716] information so that seems pretty [2718] straightforward let's do [2720] that oh and then um it looks like the [2722] quer parameters we feed in is the how [2724] many excuse me how many days of data to [2727] export the number of days should not [2728] exceed 6 months all right so let's see [2731] what we can do here and let me show you [2733] exactly how I would do this if I were to [2734] go out and um like create this API [2737] request we already have the [2738] authentication part granted we haven't [2740] tested it yet but we are going to test [2741] it here as you see phantombuster [2744] actually allows you to to try and test [2747] um stuff with the API key over here so [2749] what I would do is before I even do the [2750] API request I'd actually copy this and [2751] then I paste all of this stuff in and [2754] then I just click try it to see what [2755] sort of data I could realistically look [2758] at okay so it's saying you should have a [2760] required property called number of days [2762] so I'm missing something basically I'm [2764] missing [2766] um yeah it looks like I'm missing the [2769] days parameter and that's [2773] because I need to fill this in here okay [2776] so let's say I want to feed in 30 days [2779] right over here let's click try it all [2783] right so now it gave me a response looks [2785] like the response was not Jason [2786] interestingly enough it's a CSV but [2788] that's okay um and that tells me that [2791] all of the information here is right I [2792] just need down to format it in my own [2795] make.com scenario in order to make it [2797] work so that's great um I have [2799] everything that I need right over here [2801] in this curl request curl is just like [2803] an old again it's another convention [2805] it's another way to make a request that [2807] you used to do in the terminal so you [2809] used to literally go into your terminal [2810] and you write [2812] curl like this you type in the website [2815] you press enter and then you just get [2816] all of the website data you get the HTML [2818] the website specifically so I could just [2820] copy all of this here and then I could [2824] paste this all in [2825] here and I'm getting a too many requests [2828] because it looks like I've just made [2829] like three or four requests in a second [2831] um that's okay um but essentially this [2833] is just a way to do the same thing that [2835] we did [2837] earlier um just in in our [2841] terminal okay I think the reason why is [2843] because I have a bunch of these weird [2845] little dashes here so I just need to [2847] remove these [2849] dashes [2852] oops okay yeah no I guess it's just uh [2854] throttling me because I'm I'm sending [2856] too many requests in Too Short a time um [2858] that said keep in mind I mentioned how [2860] the previous API did not have an API [2862] like rate limit um a lot of apis do so [2864] when you start sending too many requests [2865] too quickly or whatever they'll throttle [2867] you which is unfortunate um but that's [2869] okay it's not the end of the world what [2870] we're going to do instead is we're going [2871] to take this information we're going to [2872] put it in a make scenario instead so um [2874] the way that I do is I'll actually [2875] usually look for like a curl request [2877] example because it has everything that I [2878] need if you think about it has the URL [2879] right here the universal resource [2880] locator so all I do is I go all the way [2883] over [2884] here and this is sort of cheating and [2886] I'll tell you why in a second so we're [2888] going to leave the Phantom Buster key [2890] the method as we saw it's get it's not [2891] post the URL is over here and you'll [2894] notice that this URL has a days [2896] parameter equal to 30 now this is [2899] technically called a query string [2901] parameter query strings are the exact [2904] same thing as the request content [2907] it's just there for get requests instead [2909] of post [2910] requests let me give you an [2914] example you see this here which is Json [2918] which has a key called days and a value [2919] called 30 well this is functionally [2921] equivalent to what I [2923] wrote back over [2926] here this days occurs after this [2929] question mark and it's equal to [2931] 30 you don't actually have to memorize [2933] the formatting of this you could just go [2934] to query string and you could just do [2936] this [2937] and that would be the same thing if you [2939] remember um they mentioned that you [2941] could authenticate using query [2942] parameters as well well you could [2944] actually just feed in the term key here [2946] because that's what the API said and [2948] then you could feed in the API key here [2950] so if you didn't want to use the API key [2952] in the header you could also use it down [2953] here sometimes apis give you three or [2955] four ways to do the same thing just [2957] because people have different [2958] conventions how they like to do it um I [2960] personally just always like to use the [2961] one in the header but that's my own [2963] convention [2964] right okay so uh time for the the moment [2966] of truth let's give this API request a [2968] call I'm wondering if we're going to be [2969] throttled if we are I'm just going to [2970] try a different API key see what happens [2973] yeah so it looks like we were throttled [2975] which is interesting so I'm going to go [2977] back over [2978] here and then I'm going to try doing a [2981] different API [2983] key copy [2985] that sometimes changing your API key [2988] allows you to do more [2991] requests no it doesn't look like we we [2993] could there um it could be that this [2997] endpoint here just has a much lower rate [2999] limit so why don't we try this other one [3001] here export container usage so why don't [3004] I instead of calling that previous [3005] Universal resource locator I'm just [3007] going to copy this other resource [3009] locator go back here and then paste this [3013] in we'll have a days parameter equal to [3015] 30 as well and okay so that one worked [3018] so it must just be that the other um URL [3020] endpoint has a much lower rate limit [3022] that's all right you're going to find [3023] weird quirks of apis like this now and [3025] again but as you see this is the same [3027] structure that we're used to there's [3028] headers there's cookie headers and then [3029] there's data now instead of data being [3032] Json it looks like this API returns this [3034] specific data as a CSV CSV just stands [3037] for comma separated value where you [3039] basically have like tabular data this is [3040] something you could import into a Google [3041] sheet pretty easily ID URL agent name [3044] right and then you actually start having [3045] like the the values themselves um that's [3048] okay uh I'm not going to talk about like [3049] what you would do with this data because [3050] that's beyond the purpose of this video [3052] but just know that we successfully [3053] excuse me authenticated to this Phantom [3056] buster API and we did something pretty [3058] cool with [3059] it and you know that's sort of the [3061] second way um that you can communicate [3063] with apis or authenticate with [3066] them that's still in the header mind you [3069] okay let's go on to a third example [3072] here instead of this why don't we do [3075] what was my next example instantly just [3077] because I personally use instantly all [3078] the time figured I'd give you guys a [3080] practical example how that [3081] works okay so what do we want to do with [3084] instantly um we just want to go to a [3087] campaign here and then we just want to [3088] add a lead to a campaign so I have a [3089] campaign here us creative agencies with [3091] personalization instantly it's cold [3092] email software if you're INF familiar [3094] and all I want to do is I just want to [3095] add a lead to that campaign that sounds [3096] pretty fun so uh in order to do this [3098] what am I going to do I'm going to type [3099] in instantly [3101] API and then I'm going to find the [3103] instantly API documentation which is [3104] right over [3106] here and then I love how clear this API [3109] is it literally explicitly tells you [3111] what your API key is fantastic so you [3114] need to be on the hypergrowth plan or [3115] above to be able to access the API key [3118] now that I'm thinking about it I don't [3119] know if I'm on the hypergrowth plan with [3121] this account all right so I was actually [3122] using the wrong account but I'm using [3124] the right one now so essentially what we [3125] have to do is let's go back to this API [3127] documentation it says finding your API [3129] key the first step to using instantly is [3131] to find your API key the API key helps [3134] authenticate your incoming requests and [3135] is unique per instantly workspace to get [3137] your API key go to instantly dashboard [3139] settings integration API or go right [3142] over down here so I'm just going to copy [3143] this link address I love when they [3145] provided for us I'm going to paste this [3147] in okay great and what we have to do is [3150] we have to go down here to instantly API [3152] and then I'm just going to copy this API [3155] key and now I'm going to go down and [3157] you'll see that these guys along with [3159] having the same structure right with the [3162] um table of contents on the left hand [3163] side and the text in the middle and then [3164] like some examples on the right they say [3167] once you have your API key send a get [3169] request to ensure everything is ready [3172] very very cool they have an endpoint [3173] called authenticate which we could just [3175] use to test so so in order to do so all [3178] we have to do is pass the API key looks [3180] like in the query string itself isn't [3182] that [3183] interesting and they provide us an [3185] example that we can basically copy and [3186] paste to give this a go so why don't I [3188] just do that why don't I show you guys [3189] how to do one of these testing flows so [3192] I'm going to move this over here this is [3193] now going to be the trigger for my whole [3195] scenario and then what do I want to do I [3197] um let me just double check here so what [3200] do we get we get we get it's a get [3201] request this is the universal resource [3203] locator over here this is the API key [3205] over here so why don't we just uh give [3207] this a go I will just paste in my API [3210] key and then I'm just going to paste in [3212] this [3213] too just to show you guys that these are [3215] functionally equivalent I could have [3217] used a key called um API key and then I [3221] could have pasted that down over here [3223] but to be honest it's functional [3224] equivalent to just writing it like this [3226] so that's what I'm going to [3227] do okay let's give this a run let's see [3229] what [3230] happens all right so we received a 200 [3232] status code and it gives us our [3233] workspace name looks like this is [3235] instantly api's testing function and it [3238] looks like we passed with flying colors [3240] they have some rate limits down here 10 [3242] requests per second that seems pretty [3243] fine to me and then what what did I [3245] really want to do I wanted to I think [3248] add a lead to a campaign [3251] right so let's see here I go to campaign [3254] add leads to a campaign yeah so this is [3256] what I want to do this is probably a [3257] little bit more realistic of a function [3259] so let's go for it now you'll notice [3261] that although the test function was a [3264] get to actually use the API it looks [3267] like you need to use post so there's a [3268] little bit of a difference there and [3270] there's also a ton of data here that we [3273] feed in basically which is a lot more [3275] complex than anything else that we had [3276] to do before notice that the way that [3278] we're feeding this in two is using the [3281] request content it's not using the um [3284] query string it's not using anything [3286] else we're actually using the request [3287] content which is that big Json thing so [3289] I'm going to show you exactly how I [3291] would do this if I were tasked with this [3292] either for my own business or for [3293] somebody else I'd quickly make note the [3296] URL Universal resource locators right [3298] over here then I'd look at the request [3301] type which would the method would be [3302] post i' look at this big object and I [3305] think man that's a huge ass object what [3307] the heck is this object about and then [3308] I'd be like oh right you know what it's [3310] Json because it's Json that's probably [3311] going to be request [3312] content so uh I'm going to copy all of [3315] these over one by one so I'll start with [3317] this I'll go back over here zoom in give [3321] it a click paste okay oh you know what I [3324] should keep my API key [3327] uh all right hold [3329] on paste this and then I'm going [3333] to steal my API key out of there put [3336] that there just for now it's a little [3337] placeholder I'm going to change the [3339] method to post I'm going to go back here [3342] what else do we got then we have the [3343] data raw notice how we have an API key [3345] campaign ID skip ifin workspace skip [3348] ifin campaign all these different [3349] parameters what I'm going to do is I'm [3351] actually going to copy let's just copy [3353] this whole thing it'll be a little bit [3354] easier I'm going go down here I'm just [3356] going to paste it all in oops let's [3358] paste it in nice like [3361] this then all I want is remember we [3363] talked about Jason earlier right so all [3365] I really want is this Json so I'm me [3367] delete this I'm going to take this API [3370] key copy that and I'm going to put it [3372] where it says API key then there's a [3375] campaign ID now I already know what the [3378] campaign ID is but usually the ID of [3382] something on an app or resource like [3384] this is almost always going to be in the [3386] URL so if you zoom in up at the very top [3389] of this you'll see that I have some long [3391] winded campaign ID with a bunch of these [3393] random letters and numbers if I just [3394] copy that in go back here then paste it [3398] you see that it fits basically [3400] exactly and then I have an object called [3403] leads and it looks like or H sorry have [3406] a a key called leads with a value and [3408] that value is a big array so I'm just [3411] going to make this a little bit bigger [3412] here so y'all can see but it looks like [3414] we have two objects buried within that [3417] array so I don't actually need two [3419] objects I only need one object I'm just [3421] want to test this with a single email so [3423] I'm going to remove this second [3426] object which that should be good then [3429] I'm just going to go over here and then [3430] add my own [3440] information and then I'm going to add a [3442] good little phone number going to add my [3444] own website here [3447] my favorite restaurant is f Daddy just a [3451] couple blocks St from my house my [3452] language is English okay so I had to [3454] make a couple of changes there oh and [3456] I'm going to remove this final back tick [3457] here I had to make a couple changes to [3459] the structure in order to make it work I [3460] had to remove a few things so what I'm [3462] going to do just to make sure that I'm [3463] fine is I'm going to go over here to [3464] Json for.org I'm just going to paste all [3467] of this in and then I'm going to click [3469] validate sorry I'm going to click format [3471] and beautify if you click format and [3473] beautify and it gives you an error like [3475] if to do this and then click format and [3477] beautify it says that there's an error [3479] it'll usually tell you where the error [3481] is and you can just fix it like [3484] that and so I just did this really [3486] quickly just make sure that that's fine [3488] looks good to me I'm going to go back [3490] here I'm going to just paste that in and [3493] we'll click okay and now what I'm going [3495] to do is I'm going to right click this [3497] and we're going to see whether or not [3499] this worked whether or not our API call [3501] was [3502] successful looks like the status of this [3505] API request wasc success total sent one [3507] leads upload and in block list skip [3508] count invalid email count duplicate [3510] email count I wasn't expecting any of [3512] these keys or or values um the only one [3514] I was really wondering whether I'd get [3516] is this success one but just notice how [3517] it instantly structures their API a [3519] little bit differently than most other [3520] platforms do so that's how instantly did [3523] it which looks pretty [3524] cool all right and the last thing that [3526] I'm going to do is I'm just going to run [3527] you through how to do [3529] oo2 all of the API requests we've made [3532] up until now have been using this make a [3533] request module now I'm going to go down [3535] to make an oo2 request now I'm going to [3538] run pretty quickly over this simply [3540] because the vast majority of the [3541] requests you're going to make are not [3542] going to be oo2 requests and O2 requests [3545] are just very annoying to do to be [3547] completely honest um but that's okay um [3549] I'll show you how to do it anyway for a [3550] platform called Deviant Art Deviant Art [3553] is just like a big art platform uh they [3555] used to be really big like you know 5 [3557] 10ish years ago I don't think they're [3559] anywhere near as big now but looks like [3560] AI artist just completely taken over [3562] their platform by the way that's so [3563] funny I think most people here like [3565] absolutely hate AI art which is funny or [3568] maybe they used to until it just like [3571] took over man like all of this stuff's [3572] AI art that's so funny okay uh I say [3575] this is somebody that used to run an AI [3576] Art website and I routinely get artists [3578]  on me being like this isn't [3580] real art how could you and it's like [3582] yeah I understand your concerns I do um [3584] but you know technolog is here and [3586] there's not much you can do about it [3587] okay so the make an oh 2.0 request looks [3590] different you have all the same [3592] information that you have underneath [3593] here but you also have this HTTP [3594] connection section what you need to do [3595] is need need to click add and there are [3597] a couple of quirks [3599] here um let's just go Nick at left [3603] click. a and let's call this Aug 12 2024 [3606] there are a couple of quirks here okay [3608] and these quirks can be pretty difficult [3609] to understand if you're not used to um [3612] any of this so I'm not going to go and [3614] explain the details behind each of these [3616] fields I'm just going to show you that [3619] if you want to make an O2 request just [3620] like there was an API key and the apis [3623] had instructions how to use them these [3625] apis will give you the authorized URI [3627] token URI client ID client secret Fields [3629] they'll just give you everything that [3630] you need essentially all you need to do [3631] is just pump it all in [3633] here so the way to do this in Deviant [3635] Art is you need to go up to um [3637] deviantart.com [3638] developers and this is just specific to [3640] their API I just typed in like devian [3642] art API then you need to register your [3644] application so I'm going to register a [3645] new application I'm just going to call [3647] this example ooth 2 [3649] request you're going to select an ooth [3651] to Grand type mine's going to be [3653] authorization code if you click back [3654] here notice how they have the two same [3656] settings authorization code or implicit [3658] you could pick either but I'm going to [3659] do authorization code because a little [3660] bit more complex then it says ooth to [3663] redirect URI white list now this is the [3666] thing that trips up 99% of people that [3668] try connecting stuff with ooth [3670] to anytime you see a redirect [3672] URI when you're designing or creating or [3675] publishing or registering your app or [3677] whatever what you need to do is you need [3679] to go to uh integrat [3682] oo2 um URL [3686] and then you need to get this specific [3687] URL here and that's what you need to use [3691] in order for your whole oo2 flow to work [3694] you need to copy this URL and that's the [3695] one you need to to add into whatever the [3697] redirect URI section [3700] is I'm also going to put a white list in [3702] for integrat I don't think you actually [3704] need to do that um mind you and then I'm [3707] going to in this case for devv art I'm [3709] just going to disable comments and stuff [3711] like that because I don't want people [3712] commenting on my app my app is just a [3714] test app anyway and for whatever reason [3715] there's no way you can publish like a [3717] secret app on deviantART it has to be a [3719] public app or something which is kind of [3720] dumb anyway then I'm just going to go [3722] back um here where it says your [3725] applications and keys and then just [3727] notice how there's published [3729] applications oh okay yeah I guess the oo [3732] to redirect URL weight list is required [3734] so I'm going to publish [3735] this oh I do not know what happened [3738] there my bad I think it was this one [3741] here I don't actually know but probably [3743] so uh then you're going to go to your [3744] application Al know it says a client ID [3747] and a client secret so I'm going to [3748] paste in the client ID I'll go over here [3750] show this and then I'll paste in the [3752] client secret as [3754] well and then you'll notice there's an [3756] authorized URI token URI it's okay it's [3758] going to explain all of this for us in a [3760] second I'm then going to go to [3762] authentication it's going to give me a [3764] big breakdown of how authentication [3765] Works authorization code implicit client [3768] credentials the one that I care about is [3772] how to use the authorization code Grant [3773] so it's going to teach me that I need to [3775] put this essentially in the um [3778] authorization URI which is right over [3781] here then I'm going to scroll down here [3783] to where it says getting a user access [3784] token I'm going to copy this one put it [3786] in the user access token [3788] URI and then um there's one more kind of [3791] gacha which a lot of these API [3793] documentations won't tell you about [3795] unfortunately um but it's about [3796] specifically how to um basically how to [3800] give yourself permissions and so all of [3803] these O2 API requests are going to [3805] include a scope [3806] and a scope is just a very granular way [3808] of pro granting permissions to you a [3810] person that's going to do a connection [3812] and so um you need to do this specific [3814] to an API but I know for sure that [3817] deviant art has a permission called [3819] browse there's one called the browse [3821] daily deviation endpoint and it says the [3824] following Scopes are required to access [3825] this resource explicitly I need to [3827] provide a scope called browse so in [3829] order for me to do this connection I [3831] actually have to go down here and I [3831] actually have to physically write [3833] browse now what's happening behind the [3835] hood [3836] is I'm basically going on to devart I'm [3838] providing all of these these details the [3841] client Ed the client Seeker the token U [3842] the authorized U and then in Deviant Art [3844] I have to like provide that integrat URL [3847] and then what's happening is when I [3848] click save what it's going to do is it's [3850] going to open a deviant art window right [3852] in front of me here and it's going to [3853] say hey do you authorize make.com or [3856] integromat to go in and use our Deviant [3859] Art application to do things like make [3861] API calls so if I click save here as you [3865] see we're getting an authorizing window [3868] and because I've already clicked accept [3870] um it just opened and closed instantly [3872] but it's going to say hey do you [3873] authorize make.com to comment you click [3875] authorize or accept and then voila you [3876] have your connection and now all you do [3879] is you do the same thing you did before [3880] here's the URL I'm going to copy this in [3883] paste it in looks like the parameters [3885] here are get and then date so I don't [3887] actually need it because it's optional [3890] so I'm just going to go to get request [3891] here I'm going to click parse response [3893] we'll go body type Raw contentp type [3895] application Json click okay I'm going to [3898] right click this and you'll see here [3900] that I got a 200 status code which means [3902] that my request was [3905] successful and it looks like they gave [3907] me a bunch of I don't know URLs of cool [3910] art let's open that puppy up that's [3913] pretty dope man oh yeah that's a cool [3916] signature I wonder if AI came up with [3917] that no looks like a person actually did [3919] wonderful yeah yeah yeah so that is more [3922] or less it that's how to make API [3924] requests using three fundamental [3926] different types one where you put your [3927] API request in the header another where [3929] you put it in the request content and [3931] then the last one where you do it [3932] through ooth [3934] to I'm going to full screen this and [3936] then go to the last page and wish [3938] everybody good luck and congratulations [3940] on making it this far if you've kept [3943] with me until now you know more about [3945] how to make API connections and how to [3947] structure the HTTP module than probably [3949] 95% of other people on make.com and [3951] that's even if you had no programming [3953] background no understanding and Jason no [3954] nothing so to reiterate there are a [3957] couple points I just want you to keep in [3958] mind moving forward the first is that [3960] HTTP is just a way to structure the text [3962] of a request it's a protocol for hyper [3965] hyper text transfer it's just an [3967] opinionated convention it's just a way [3969] that people started doing things a while [3971] ago agreed on and it's just sort of how [3973] we have to structure our requests now [3975] make makes it easy for us by providing a [3977] bunch of structured Fields like the URL [3978] the header and the method you can use [3981] these fields in the way that I've shown [3982] you to communicate with apis very easy [3985] and because we're using make.com and [3986] make.com is pretty awesome if it wasn't [3988] I would have would not have built [3989] several businesses around it um as long [3993] as you keep in mind the three major ways [3996] that you can connect with authorize [3997] authenticate and then interact with apis [4000] you'll be good to reiterate there was [4002] the authorization flow here Phantom [4005] Busters had an x- phantombuster D ke-1 [4008] instantly just had the API key directly [4010] in the request body and then ooth 2 [4012] basically just had three or four [4014] different API Keys they're just [4015] something different I really loved [4018] putting this video together love talking [4020] about make.com and specifically about [4021] HTTP requests and apis cuz just such [4023] like a big point of contention both in [4025] my community and on the internet you [4027] have everything that you need now to get [4028] out there and crush it if you have any [4030] questions please leave a comment down [4032] below and I'll get to it otherwise if [4034] you guys could do me a big favor like [4036] subscribe do all the rest of that fun [4038] YouTube stuff and I'll catch you on the [4039] next video thanks so much bye-bye

Title: How To Service Your First AI Automation Agency Client In 2024 (Make.com)
[0] hey everybody Nick here and in this [1] video I'm going to show you how to [2] service your first automation client in [4] 2024 I'm going to build out a flow live [6] in front of you and then we're going to [8] talk about how to maximize the quality [10] and the value of every customer that you [12] get from here on out let's get into it [14] so first things first this is just my [16] own process that got me to 72k a month [18] with my automation agency it is not the [20] only way there are variety of methods [22] plans and systems um take whatever makes [25] sense to you out of this video and then [27] discard whatever isn't relevant and [29] ultimately no gay I'm going to show you [30] everything plus I'll give you the whole [31] system that you could sell plus the [33] Whimsical at the end of this video uh [34] and it's going to be basically one of [36] the most valuable things that I think [38] that I've given for free on YouTube to [39] date so let's talk about where you are [42] right now you got your first client [44] you've labored for maybe days weeks or [47] months on cold email or communities or [51] uh upwork or Fiverr or referrals through [54] a friend whatever your sales method has [56] been you finally got a client well I got [58] great news for you and I got shitty news [60] for you the first is that getting a [62] client is definitely hard but keeping a [65] client is harder and it's in the keeping [67] of the client that you get to generate [69] multiples on your time and it's really [71] in the retention that this industry [73] becomes as profitable and as high [74] leverage as it is the unfortunate thing [77] about any service model is that there [79] are hundreds of things that can go wrong [81] during the Fulfillment stage luckily I [84] have made the vast majority of these [85] mistakes and after dozens of projects [87] I've built a pretty simple flow which I [89] find a eliminates 95% of all the [91] problems that most people eventually [93] face um just upfront essentially you can [95] kind of think about this as like it's [97] like a treatment that inoculates you [98] against most of the BS and if you guys [101] can take that away from this video [103] you're going to save yourself a lot of [104] time energy and suffering I'm suffering [106] that I and you know other people that [107] didn't have road maps had to go through [108] to get here so I'm going to build it out [110] with you live in a minute I'm going to [112] give you the template afterwards and I [113] want you to know that this process I can [115] like personally guarantee that it works [116] from $0 all the way up to $72,000 a [119] month I have tested it further with the [120] automation agency uh but my suspicion is [123] it's very scalable it'll work all the [124] way up to more than a million dollars a [125] month just because of how much it [127] inoculates against these very common [129] Agency problems so just before I get [132] into that I wanted to cover what your [134] job is as a service provider and you [137] know I hate to break it to you but your [138] job in running an automation agency is [140] not just the building of the systems [142] most people think that your job starts [144] the second that you like sign the deal [146] shake hands you know and then make a [148] little bit of money but in real your job [150] actually started the second that you [152] made initial contact with the Prospect [154] and the way that we know this is just [156] just think about it for a second like [158] you doing sales is still work right you [160] doing marketing is still work you [162] messaging people all of that is stuff [164] that you would still probably consider [165] work right if you were to Bill $500 an [168] hour to do a 4-Hour project you might [170] think H my hourly rate on that is 500 [172] bucks an hour I made 2,000 bucks in 4 [173] hours that's sick well in reality if you [176] also spent 4 hours to acquire that [178] client uh your hourly rate for that job [180] is not $500 an hour you did not make [182] $2,000 in4 hours you made $2,000 in 8 [184] hours AKA made $250 and that's what a [187] lot of the um freelance and and agency [189] world uh doesn't really deeply [191] understand about the money that they're [193] making they they're like oh man I made [194] $1,000 for for 30 minutes of work that's [196] incredible well actually you didn't make [198] $1,000 for 30 minutes of work you made [200] $1,000 for however long it took to find [202] that client however long it took to [203] close that client however long it took [205] to nurture that client whatever you had [207] to do plus the time it took you to do [208] the job so the reason I bring up that [211] analogy is because I think it's a little [212] more straightforward to understand that [213] what I'm about to tell you but it's the [215] exact same thing same conceptual thing [218] once you get the job if you were to [220] price a project at $2,000 right and then [223] it took you an hour to put the project [225] together all the little bits and pieces [227] but then it took you another nine hours [229] to talk to your client give them updates [231] do revision requests ask them for [233] materials every other week so on and so [236] on then I'm sorry to break it to you but [238] the $2,000 you made you did not make in [239] an hour you made it over 10 hours so [241] your hourly rate is not 2K it's 200 [243] bucks and the two are very different so [246] I'm bringing this up because I want to [247] illustrate that the important thing in [249] the business is not just like optimizing [251] the work that you do it's not just the [252] templates and stuff although it [253] certainly helps um it's optimizing [255] everything around the work that you do [257] and this is really like business [258] infrastructure talk this is really um a [260] systematic framework that's going to [262] work for any type of agency not just an [264] automation agency and that's why I think [266] it's so high leverage so what I'm going [268] to do next is we're actually going to [268] build out the flow in uh whimsicle [271] together which is a flowchart software [273] and I'm just going to walk you through [274] this whole thing from end to end I'm [275] also going to show you three uh [278] templated resources that I have for you [280] um I've created a list of templated [282] project update emails for you guys and [285] so we have I don't know like maybe five [287] or six or something like that I've [289] created a project delivery template for [290] you which we're going to talk about um [292] I've also created a kickoff call sop and [295] if you guys have already downloaded this [296] from one of my older videos I've gone [297] through and I provided much much more [299] detail here um so that I basically give [301] you almost like a script that you can go [302] through um during both of these [304] processes to maximize the quality of [306] every [307] lead okay so how do we actually go about [310] you know winning sorry how do we go [311] about servicing a client once we've won [313] them well um it's reasonably [315] straightforward and I'm just going to uh [317] make sure that you guys can see what's [319] on my screen here because I know [320] technically my face is in the bottom [321] right hand corner and in previous videos [323] I've sort of covered stuff up [324] inadvertently so let me just make sure [326] that everything's good [327] here okay so first things first um you [330] know the project once you win the [333] project right you winning the project um [335] starts after you you you change the [337] hands right that's sort of like the win [339] condition if money does not change hands [341] then you haven't really won the project [343] yet so if somebody's verbally agreed to [344] you and said hey this sounds great I'd [346] love to do this hell yeah you close the [347] deal man high five that doesn't actually [349] mean the only thing that matters is [351] when you have some type of money in your [352] bank account uh if you're on a platform [354] sales like upwork or Fiverr is a little [356] bit different because some of these [357] platforms have escro features where like [359] like the Fiverr or upwork will hold the [362] money for you until you do your part of [363] the job that's okay um that you can [365] still consider that as winning a deal [367] but really the thing that you should be [368] looking for is some type of either [369] upfront deposit or the full payment [371] amount essentially so what happens after [374] Money Changes hands you win the project [375] well you need to host a kickoff call a [379] kickoff call as I've mentioned before is [382] uh basically just a brief little call [384] that you have doesn't have to be more [385] than 15 or 20 minutes but it's where you [388] do all of the work at the front of the [391] project to inoculate yourself against [393] all of the future BS that commonly comes [395] up and what do you do in a kickoff call [397] well there are a bunch of things the [398] first is that you discuss your timelines [400] with the prospect or I guess they're a [402] client at this point um so you're going [404] to discuss hey I'm going to have X for [406] you by y date hey I'm going to do this [408] job by this Milestone um this is how [411] quickly we're going to finish the [412] project this is when you can expect to [413] be able to use it and that sort of thing [416] the next is you're going to Define your [417] availability this is something that I [419] never used to do but ever since I [420] started doing it I get like 90% fewer [423] problems availability in this case means [426] if a client wants to reach you for [427] whatever reason maybe there's some [428] emergency in their system maybe they [429] need some maintenance maybe there's some [431] just random one-off questions uh when [433] can they do so if they were to send you [434] just a random email or text message and [436] then you didn't get back to them for 48 [437] hours because you were I don't know on a [439] boat with your girlfriend or something [440] like that sailing away uh they're [442] probably going to be a little bit you [443] know tiffed at you right and likewise [445] you're probably going to be a little bit [446] tiffed at them for thinking well [448] man it was my vacation well the reason [449] why is because you didn't talk about it [451] with them they don't know your [452] availability and so you can't be a mind [454] reader and you can't expect your client [455] to be a mind reader the simplest way I [457] found to inoculate against all this is [458] to give them an availability window [461] which is basically like a you know hour [463] or two hour slot per day that you can be [465] reached what I will usually do and I'll [467] show you guys in the kickoff call sop [469] but what I'll usually do is I'll give [470] them a 2-hour window between 10: a.m. [472] and 12:00 p.m. my time and I'll say hey [474] if you have any questions I can get back [475] to you within 15 minutes if you send me [477] a message on slack within that time [479] period I'll do my best to respond [481] outside of that time period but I can't [482] really guarantee it the next thing we're [484] going to do is we're going to talk about [485] our expectations with the client we're [487] going to figure out what they need from [488] us we're going to see if there's [490] anything that maybe they're under the [491] impression that we're going to provide [492] that we are not going to provide we're [493] going to see if maybe there's some [494] Impressions that we have on their [496] responsibilities that they don't [497] understand and the reason why again is [499] because you just eliminate most of the [501]  involved in service um [503] management if you just talk about this [505] stuff UPF front you can kind of think [506] about it like a relationship if you I [510] don't know your spouse or your partner [511] or something like that does something [512] that you don't like and then you don't [514] respond to them right away you just like [516] man I really didn't like that then it [517] starts bouncing around in your Noggin [519] and you know six months a year later [521] after bounced around in your brain for [523] the last year uh you're fuming and you [525] know you get really angry and and you [527] know the the reason why this has become [528] an issue is just because you haven't [529] talked about it with the person that you [531] have this sort of relationship with and [533] business relationships are no different [534] if you just talk about what to expect [536] and if you just get all of that heavy [538] lifting done the moment that you start [540] something with them um your life's going [541] to be a lot easier moving forward the [544] next thing to talk about is you need to [546] get your clients to sign up to platforms [548] um and I personally do all of this live [550] so I get them to sign up to all the [551] platforms they need live specifically [553] because it takes care of all my [554] two-factor authentication stuff takes [556] care of any last minute questions it [557] ensures they always sign up to the right [559] package basically ensures that there is [561] no back and forth once this step is done [563] after the kickoff call I literally have [565] everything I need to just finish the [566] project and hand it off to them right [567] it's it's done um the vast majority of [570] automation projects that I did when I [571] started I had like 50% of the [573] information so then I had to slowly ask [575] them for more info over time and be like [577] hey the last thing I need is this [579] the actual last thing I need is this and [581] it provides a very unprofessional sort [583] of approach um and and customers can [585] kind of sniff out that you're [586] inexperienced when you do stuff like [588] that uh the next thing I'm going to do [590] here and the reason why I'm I'm moving [591] this around the way that I am you'll see [592] in a second but the next thing I'm going [595] to do is I'm going to walk them through [597] any issues or any problem that I foresee [600] with the scope of the project usually [602] there's no real issue or problem but if [604] there is an issue that I foresee like [606] Hey listen one thing that might happen [607] is XYZ could occur I like to get ahead [610] of it the reason why is because if the [612] problem does occur well you've gotten [613] ahead of it and the client's going to [614] think that you're conscientious and [615] they're going to appreciate you Haven [616] brought it up and then if the problem [618] doesn't occur well then you are going to [620] seem even better because you told the [622] client that there could be a problem and [623] the problem didn't occur so sort of the [625] situation is even better than expected [627] either way it's a win for you an example [628] of this might might be you're building [629] some sort of system that requires a [631] specific platform and uh maybe their web [633] hooks are shoddy or they don't send [635] consistent data or something so you say [637] Hey listen one problem that may occur is [639] that we may not get consistent data from [640] this web hug there are a couple of [642] workarounds that I'm going to build for [644] you if that doesn't work but I just [645] wanted to let you know that if we do [646] suffer from that problem this timeline [648] here is going to be a little bit longer [649] is that all right yeah of course [651] typically there are no major issues [652] there and then you just get a bunch of [653] brownie points for bringing it up and [656] then the last thing that I'll do is add [657] everything to password manager slpm [661] system uh password manager is something [663] like last pass one pass Dashlane it's a [666] platform that just allows you to keep [667] track of all your credentials and all [669] your customer credentials a PM system is [671] just you know a project management [672] system um just getting something in [674] either it doesn't have to be Complicated [675] by the way it could be like your notes [676] your Apple notes app it could be um like [679] Bearer it could be todoist it could be [681] just some little piece of paper where [682] you're keeping track of um of where the [684] client's at and as you get more complex [687] and as your business grows a little bit [688] more uh you know this project management [690] system starts being shared with a [691] variety of other people but for now just [692] make sure you have some type of textual [694] representation of what's going on in the [695] project because you don't want to lose [696] track of [697] anything okay the reason why I did this [699] is because these are sort of like [701] substeps of the kickoff call so I'm just [703] going to make these Dash and we'll just [704] make these nice and sexy and purple this [707] is the main flow Money Changes hands you [709] host a kickoff call what's next well you [711] start working on the [714] project and there's no magic here um I'm [716] not going to be able to really like [718] break the actual ual project down [719] specifically because we're not talking [720] about a specific type of project sorry [722] we're not talking about a specific [723] project we're just talking about a type [724] of project which is an automation [725] project um but generally speaking when [727] you run an automation project um the way [729] that I recommend you do things is you [731] sell systems that you have blueprints [732] for or templates for systems that you've [734] built um you know either for another [736] client in the past or more likely for [738] yourself if it's your first project um [740] and what I mean by that is you copy [742] blueprints um templates if it's like a [744] like a CRM or something oneclick [746] template um you know to the client [749] workspace [750] essentially whatever that workspace is [752] if they got like a make account which [753] I'd recommend that they do um you just [755] copy it from your own make account to [756] theirs same with zapier if it's like [759] Monday CRM you copy all the the the [760] board structure and stuff like that from [762] yours to theirs um essentially the [764] reason why I I template everything out [766] so much is because if I start a [769] completely new project every single time [771] I work with a new customer I'm basically [772] building the wheel again from scratch [774] but the reality is most customers want [776] the same things just tweaked a little [777] bit differently depending on the project [779] management system that they're using or [780] the CRM so if you could build 80% of it [783] out in advance then the distance you [785] have to travel is not 100% uh z% to 100% [788] it's 80% to 100% which is you know by [791] default five times leverage and [792] sometimes your templates can get a lot [793] better than that sometimes they can get [795] 99% of the way there but obviously after [798] you make the template you need to [799] customize the template to the client [802] request so that's what I mean here like [804] if you have a blueprint for a cold email [806] system or something that you are selling [808] um and your blueprint uses instantly and [810] then the customer wants to use Smart [812] lead for whatever reason or maybe [813] they've already paid for a subscription [814] to some other platform um all you have [815] to do is just take the infrastructure [817] there and just replace those modules uh [819] you know hot swap basically the [822] functionality after you essentially [824] customize the template what you're done [826] what you have done is you have finished [827] the project so now you just need to [829] deliver or sorry let me just say you [831] complete the project here then we'll do [833] the delivery [835] afterwards um actually you know what the [838] one step you have to do and you have to [840] deliver progress updates so after you've [843] built some of this project out you need [845] to show the client basically what you've [846] done and you need to be in constant [848] communication with them in some way [849] shape or form um whether or not you're [851] actually in constant communication with [852] them or you're just providing them the [853] impression that's actually not that big [855] of a deal you can schedule a lot of [856] these progress updates in advance if you [857] wanted to be really sneaky and automate [859] the hell out of your own job uh but uh [861] yeah you need to deliver some type of [862] progress update essentially um so what I [865] would do here is instead of doing this [867] manually every time and I'll show you my [869] templates in a moment use templates [873] let's make this purple too that's nice [875] and then uh you can send these weekly [877] you can send these bi-weekly uh you can [879] send these monthly if it's a big project [881] until basically the project is completed [884] and then after all of this is done um [886] you know we'll we'll have effectively [887] completed this project so let me just [889] make a little arrow that goes up here [890] and then we'll say you complete the [893] project and then um yeah let's just stop [897] right there and let's run through some [898] of these templates so I'm just going to [900] drag the update and delivery templates [902] here because we're going to use both of [903] them in a moment then I'll drag the [905] kickoff call sop template down here just [907] so you guys could see what that looks [908] like and I'm just going to deliver this [909] to you afterwards but let's run through [911] this flow from top to bottom essentially [912] what's going to happen is money's going [914] to change hands after Money Changes [916] hands you're going to book and host a [917] kickoff call on that kickoff call you're [919] going to discuss timelines you're going [920] to Define an availability window you're [922] going to talk about your expectations [923] then you're going to get your clients to [924] sign up to these platforms live you're [926] going to walk them through any issues [927] that you suspect may be occurring or may [929] occur then at the end you're going to [930] add everything to your password manager [932] project management system if you can do [933] this on the call even better that way [935] the second the call is done you're good [937] you're then going to start working on [938] the project the way to actually work on [940] the project is you're going to copy [941] Blueprints and templates and that sort [942] of thing to the client workspace you're [943] then going to spend a little bit of time [945] customizing the template to the client [947] request and that's really like your job [948] job if you think about it that way and [950] then while you're doing this and as [951] you're completing the project you're [952] going to deliver progress updates but [955] instead of doing this every time [956] manually like writing out some big long [957] progress update what we're going to do [959] and I'm going to give them to you is [960] we're just going to write like four or [961] five like email or message templates and [964] you just going to copy and paste them [965] basically every single time then you're [967] going to send a weekly bi-weekly or [969] monthly updates and then you're going to [971] complete the project all right now once [973] your project is done what do we do well [975] you need to test the flow from end to [977] end e to e testing I believe is the [980] terminology in the software development [982] and that just means that you basically [983] have to run through the entire flow [985] whether it's one scenario multiple [987] scenarios five different software [988] products whatever you just have to make [989] sure that like the input can make it all [992] the way to the output so don't just test [994] modules independently don't just test [996] one scenario at a time test the entire [998] thing from start to finish yeah this can [1000] take a fair amount um this is to me to [1002] be honest usually like the lengthiest [1004] part this actual testing process because [1006] I need to make sure that it works before [1007] the client sees it obviously um but this [1009] is the number one most sort of like [1011] worth it part to this right and the fact [1013] that you're using templates here is [1014] going to do most of that heavy lifting [1015] for you because you'll have tested the [1016] templates before but it's really that [1018] customized connection that you're making [1020] um that's [1021] important after you do this I would [1023] highly recommend you do the following [1024] three steps you create a Google [1030] Document [1032] outlining the SOP to use the [1035] system essentially create a textual [1038] Google document that goes through and [1042] shows the client how to build or rather [1045] how to use the system from end to end as [1047] well as how to make a couple of updates [1049] to the system as well you could just ask [1052] gp4 or Claude to write a template for [1054] you and then you could go in there and [1056] make a couple of changes I'll show you [1058] how to do that in a second I'll actually [1060] um ask Claude to do it live for us but [1063] then after you create the Google Doc you [1064] also need to record a [1067] video delivering the project from end to [1072] end and so we tested it from end end [1074] here well now we actually have to record [1076] a video where we do it again [1078] and then this is really like the juice [1080] because this is what the client sees [1081] this is what's really important for the [1082] client but the last step is you send a [1084] templated message with an upsell to your [1088] retainer or secondary product or [1093] Etc awesome um that is essentially the [1097] whole flow from end to end if you do [1099] this with every project you're going to [1101] go a long way so let's actually jump [1103] into some of these Sops I'm going to [1104] open up the kickoff call sop first and [1106] I'll run you through what the actual [1107] kickoff call looks like um basically [1109] word for [1110] word so I am going [1113] to zoom out here just so we can all see [1116] this and uh just run you through this [1118] whole kickoff call sop first thing is [1120] that this is a detailed kickoff call sop [1122] standard operating procedure to help you [1124] unboard clients for your automation [1125] agency I Ed the structure all the time [1127] at my own agency which hits 72k a month [1130] you can create a copy and use it for [1131] yourself the first thing is you need to [1133] introduce yourself so say hi thank them [1135] for joining that sort of thing the [1137] second thing is you just need to discuss [1138] why you're there um and what I usually [1140] do is I break this into a problem [1141] statement where I just say Hey listen [1143] the biggest issue in our space is [1145] logistics have you ever worked with [1146] another automation provider before yeah [1148] well I'm willing to bet that like two [1149] Factor authentication was a pain [1150] password credentials all that stuff was [1152] a pain right they're like yeah okay [1154] awesome I like to sidestep all this [1155] personally by frontloading the [1157] onboarding call and after hundreds of [1158] projects I found this to be the most [1160] straightforward way we're just going to [1161] do everything together over the course [1163] the next 30 minutes okay all right so [1165] here's my goal we're going to cover [1167] timelines then we're going to talk about [1169] how to stay in touch with each other [1170] basically like Mutual availability and [1172] then I'm going to show you what you can [1173] expect at every step of the process by [1174] going through the The Proposal that we [1176] drafted at the beginning of our [1178] relationship then we are together going [1180] to sign up to all of the platforms that [1182] are listed here so make.com smart le. [1186] pandadoc I've prepared detailed [1188] instructions for each that I just shared [1189] with you over email a moment ago uh and [1191] the reason why we're doing this together [1193] is so that I can physically be here to [1194] walk you through any issues that may [1196] arise and so that we can tackle two [1198] Factor authentication together if that [1199] ends up being an issue so if you need a [1202] code or if I need a code to log in I'll [1204] just be able to ask you right now as [1205] opposed to try and figure this out at [1207] like 9:30 p.m. on a Tuesday Fair okay if [1210] you have any questions before we begin [1211] at the end we'll have a little Q&A [1212] session and then we can wrap this up [1214] how's that sound all right sweet then we [1217] dive into the timelines where I [1218] basically say hey I'm going to start on [1220] this date and I'm G to end on this date [1222] if I can deliver the project even [1223] earlier or faster I will in terms of the [1225] Milestones my work is going to be split [1226] into the following sections and then [1228] I'll open the proposal and I'll walk [1229] through it with them does that work for [1231] you then I'll talk about availability [1233] I'll say I know a lot of people don't [1235] like talking about availability but I [1236] think it's an exibly incredibly [1238] important part of a good working [1239] relationship I personally hate random [1241] calls but I make myself available every [1243] day between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 P p.m. [1245] on slack uh I just put this in as an [1247] example time and platform it's not the [1248] only time and platform that you can use [1250] just edit this to whatever your own [1252] project specifications are what I [1254] usually say is if you have any oneoff [1256] questions during this period I'll be [1257] able to get back to within about 15 [1258] minutes or so otherwise I'll just give [1260] you regular progress updates every [1262] whatever days does that work for you you [1264] notice I'm asking does that work for you [1265] every time because I'm essentially [1266] getting the client to verbally say yes [1269] to everything that I'm proposing I want [1271] their buyin if I don't have their buyin [1272] then what's the point of this [1274] anyway the next thing we talk about are [1276] platforms where I say okay great let's [1278] get you sent up to these platforms I [1279] like doing it all in a call just because [1280] it lets me have everything I need by the [1281] end of our conversation it also sidest [1283] steps to fa issues like I talked about [1284] which are big in the automation space [1286] you'll know what I mean if you've ever [1287] worked with somebody else before here's [1288] a quick guide that I used on how that I [1291] have on how to sign up to instantly how [1293] to sign up to smartly how to sign up to [1295] pandadoc I just sent it over to you do [1296] you mind giving it a click and letting [1298] me know if you see it all right yeah [1300] okay sweet well let's start with the [1301] first platform on that list how about [1304] instantly and then they say awesome um [1306] thanks so much for your time do you have [1308] any questions for me before you wrap up [1310] if there's like a Q&A period that's when [1311] we do it right now um last but not least [1313] all right I will give you your first [1315] update on this date guaranteed looking [1317] forward to working with you you're going [1318] toce receive an email from me thanks so [1319] much if you follow a process like this [1322] whatever your business is whether it's [1325] an automation agency whether it's a [1326] marketing agency whether it's some type [1328] of I don't know like service fulfillment [1330] thing you're going to do extraordinarily [1332] well um just because this is way more [1335] professional than what most people do [1336] and this structured onboarding or [1338] kickoff call also gets all the [1339] information you need right then and [1341] there without having to muddy up client [1343] relationships later by asking them for [1345]  as I mentioned on 9:30 p.m. on a [1347] Tuesday so that's the kickoff call sop [1349] um let's cover the project update and [1351] delivery [1352] templates essentially what I've done [1354] here is I've template out a bunch of [1356] progress update emails I've just gone [1357] through my own emails with clients and [1358] then I just anonymized most of the [1360] information and made a couple of changes [1361] to make them even better than what they [1362] were um if you're sending these over a [1364] messaging platform instead like slacker [1366] teams I'd actually like encourage you [1367] guys to use slacker teams versus email I [1369] find I just personally get all my [1370] lost over email but just remove the [1372] signature portion at the end of this [1373] it's a little bit cleaner so quick uh [1376] little example one I'm only going to [1377] read out two is hey client progress [1379] update for you here's where I'm at I [1381] just wrapped up X next up is y [1384] everything's great and working exactly [1385] as we planned I'm actually a little bit [1387] ahead of schedule looking forward to [1388] delivering this for you thanks if you [1390] send a client one or two of these [1391] between the start of the project and the [1393] end of the project uh their uh [1395] perception or opinion of you is going to [1396] be way higher than if you just say okay [1398] let's get started and okay here's the [1400] project there are two reasons for that [1402] the first is that you're obviously [1403] prioritizing client communication um [1406] which is just important in building [1407] relationships right if you talk to them [1409] more often they're going to like you [1410] more often generally if you're good what [1411] you do but the more important thing is [1413] this will make the project seem more [1414] involved it'll make it seem like it has [1415] more extra steps it'll make it seem like [1417] it's more of a big deal and so uh they [1419] will feel better about having spent two [1421] three four five $10,000 with you uh if [1424] you make the project seem bigger and [1426] more involved obviously they're going to [1428] think all right man this guy really [1429] knows his stuff I'm really glad that I [1430] chose to work with him on this wow this [1432] person's really diligent geez yeah you [1434] know he's finishing those Milestones [1435] exactly like you said he would wow this [1436] Project's a lot more involved than just [1438] like a a few minutes on make.com eh [1440] that's the point that I'm making and [1441] it's really the value um in doing this [1443] with a with a [1444] prospect client excuse me at this [1447] point okay here's another one uh Hey [1449] client just checking in on Project X is [1452] on schedule we just wrapped up this [1453] portion and we're going to complete this [1454] other portion next week I'll even attach [1456] the screenshot below I had a quick [1457] question about Z by the way do you know [1459] about blah blah blah blah I hope you're [1461] enjoying the week thank you as I [1462] mentioned if you're sending messages [1464] just remove that little signature [1465] portion down here at the end completely [1466] unnecessary um but uh you know providing [1469] these updates and just using all of [1470] these templates essentially makes it so [1473] that this also doesn't seem like it's a [1474] standardized process it kind of seems [1476] incidental it's like hey you know I had [1477] a quick question about Z by the way I [1479] finished all this stuff here and here's [1480] a quick screenshot I thought you'd like [1481] it as you see down here um you know uh I [1486] know I said I'd deliver a progress [1487] update for you but we just wrapped this [1488] portion up a little bit early and I [1489] figure I'd collect my brownie points or [1492] hey did you hear about the news the [1493] other day I saw on my feet and thought [1494] about your company things are going [1495] really swimmingly Etc the last thing I [1498] have down here is I have a project [1499] delivery template and this is a little [1501] bit different than the project update [1502] template the project delivery template [1503] is what you give to them when you [1504] deliver the project as I mentioned there [1507] are two portions to delivering the [1509] project or three really the first is [1511] you're going to obviously give them all [1512] the credentials and everything they need [1514] you're going to give them the system [1515] you're going to finish it but the second [1516] is you're going to give them a Google [1517] doc sop and then you're going to give [1519] them a video sop as well so in order to [1522] represent that um this project delivery [1524] template mentions both hey name had a [1527] blast working on this just wrapped up [1528] your cold email project I always include [1531] documentation alongside every delivery [1533] just so you and your team know how [1534] things work here's a guide I recorded [1536] that shows you how to use the scenario [1537] and how to get your leads and then if [1539] you prefer text I also wrote an in-depth [1540] piece of documentation here so you give [1542] them both this is your chance to like [1545] score extra points with the customer and [1547] this sort of thing is what gets you the [1548] the long retentions with clients and [1551] essentially allows you to multiply your [1552] leverage would you mind taking a look at [1554] this and letting me know your thoughts [1555] assuming everything's good to go I'll [1556] send you over an invoice for the [1557] remaining balance and we can wrap things [1559] up I always like to refer to and [1561] reference the payment I always like to [1562] talk about the payment openly if you [1564] don't talk about the payment openly in a [1565] service business a lot of people like to [1567] just pretend everything's all hunky dory [1569] when really there's resentment because [1571] you know you still haven't received [1572] payment or you might finish the project [1573] deliver everything and then not mention [1575] payment and you and the back of your [1576] mind you're like where the hell is my [1577]  payment right like why is this [1579] guy not addressing the elephant in the [1581] room but then the customer thinks huh [1583] that's wonderful like what a great job [1584] I'm so happy and everything about the [1585] customer you know the the my vendor is [1587] amazing uh they'd be happy to pay if you [1589] just brought it up so just bring it up [1591] um and then down here is where I always [1593] use something like this I always say PS [1595] I have a bunch of interesting ideas for [1596] you I'd like to share after we're done I [1598] think I could realistically double blank [1600] bottleneck with some tweaks let me know [1601] if you'd like to hear them so hey uh I [1604] think I could realistically double you [1606] know um boardwalk's Revenue in the next [1609] six months with this system let me know [1611] if you'd like to hear about that I [1612] always like to leave it up to the [1613] prospect to decide whether or not they [1615] want to hear about it who's going to say [1617] no to that hey I can can double your [1618] number of leads per month hey I can [1620] double your Revenue hey I think I can [1622] like make your I think I can double your [1623] margin I can reduce your cogs by two or [1626] I can cut your cogs in half the point [1628] that I'm making is uh you're not just [1630] forcing them or trying to like push them [1632] to sign up on some next project or [1633] retainer but you're basically framing [1635] this as like hey I have some suggestions [1636] for you just thought I'd let you know if [1638] you want to hear about them maybe we can [1639] jump on a call we can talk about a [1640] little bit more further and I find that [1642] this personally is the best way to frame [1645] like a retainer style relationship and [1646] this is sort of how like you slide s [1648] organically into a long-term [1650] relationship with that client slide [1652] right in those DMS so yeah that is the [1655] Whimsical here with those three [1656] templated assets what I'm going to do is [1657] I'm going to um copy all of this and [1659] then I'll share this in the video [1660] description link just so you have the [1662] Whimsical and then you can just access [1663] the docs directly through said Whimsical [1665] if you guys follow this structure and [1667] this format you're going to do really [1668] well and it doesn't matter if it's like [1670] a creative agency if it's like a PPC [1673] company or if it's an automation agency [1675] this is just general service industry [1676] infrastructure um that just does doeses [1679] awesome so yeah in closing uh do not [1683] rebuild the wheel use templates to do [1685] both the project and then to even [1687] communicate with the customer um so that [1689] you only have to do things once and then [1690] you can just take advantage of the work [1691] that you've done in the past the second [1693] thing is don't just build for your [1695] customer uh but service them your job as [1697] a service provider is exactly it's the [1699] servicing part it's not necessarily just [1701] providing the building it's everything [1704] around the building and if you can build [1706] great but if you can't like run the rest [1708] of your business grate you'll never [1710] really be able to progress you're never [1711] really going to be able to make a lot of [1712] money um that's very much like a 9 to-5 [1715] like corporate job sort of mindset [1716] that's not like an entrepreneurial [1717] mindset if you're an entrepreneur you [1719] really do need to own the entire stack [1721] and that involves the sales the [1722] marketing uh that involves the the [1724] service fulfillment that involves the [1725] retention the follow-ups [1727] everything uh last thing I'll mention is [1729] the skills that I'm talking about here [1730] they apply to every industry not just [1731] automation so if you learn them once [1733] these will benefit you basically forever [1735] I really hope you guys appreciated this [1737] video had a lot of fun putting it [1738] together if you guys have any comments [1739] or questions about this just leave them [1741] down below otherwise if you could do me [1743] a hefty favor and like And subscribe to [1746] my channel that' mean a lot thanks so [1747] much for watching have a great rest of [1748] day see you in the next one bye-bye

Title: The 3 Best Niches For AI Automation Agencies in 2024
[0] hey everybody Nick here and in this [1] video I'm going to be covering the top [2] three niches for automation agencies in [5] 2024 and moving into the 2025 New Year [9] so first things first this is just my [10] own process and my own thinking that got [12] me to 72k per month these are not the [15] only niches that you need to use and [17] they're certainly not the only ones that [18] are available to you so there are plenty [20] of other profitable ones here these are [21] just the ones that I think are the best [23] as of the recording time of this video [26] take whatever makes sense to you if you [27] disagree firmly with something that I [29] say later on that's all cool discard [31] that part take the good parts take the [33] gems and then make yourself better for [34] it and the last thing I'll mention here [36] is no gatekeeping I'm just going to show [37] you everything I'll even give you whole [39] systems that you could sell to these [40] niches in a moment so first things first [43] before I talk about these niches what [44] makes the best Niche to begin with there [47] are three qualifiers in my mind the [49] first is that they have to be digital [51] AKA they can't be brick and mortar [53] you're not really going to get good [54] results working with your croissant [56] store across the street or the retail um [59] women's shoe store down the block right [62] and I'll talk about why in a second the [63] second is they have to be mid or high [65] ticket mid or high ticket just refers to [68] the average uh Revenue per user or [71] average order value generally you don't [73] want to work with people that sell stuff [75] for $2 or $3 you can and I have before [78] but it's nowhere near as justifiable of [80] an expense for the company to work with [82] you than if you are working with people [84] that make 10 15 $20,000 per customer and [88] the third thing and really the most [89] important thing is that the niche that [90] you're targeting needs to suffer from [92] problems that your automation solves and [94] this can be a little bit uh there can be [96] a couple of quirks here and I'm going to [98] get into that in a second but let's [99] break each of these down just to be [101] practical so why digital over brick and [104] mortar well the first thing is that if [106] you were to pick a brick-and mortar [107] Niche sourcing your leads right from the [109] get-go is like 50 times as difficult as [112] if you're working with a digital Niche a [114] company that you could Source from the [115] internet from LinkedIn from Apollo from [118] each of these lead sources websites [120] especially if you want to do cold [121] Outreach too I'll give you a quick [123] example let's say you're working with an [124] HVAC company in Chattanooga or rather [126] you're targeting HVAC companies in [127] Chattanooga I just um figured out what [129] Chattanooga was by the way I didn't [131] realize that Chattanooga was a city and [133] I had no idea how to spell it so [134] hopefully I spelled it right over there [136] but let's say you're working with or [137] you're looking to work with HVAC [139] companies in Chattanooga Tennessee how [141] many HVAC companies are there [142] realistically in Chattanooga Tennessee [144] um 500 I don't actually know so I'm just [147] going to guess them it based off my [148] understanding of the population if there [150] are 500 worthwhile HVAC companies to [153] work with in Chattanooga Tennessee how [155] many of those companies contact [156] information do you think you can get [158] maybe 200 or so so you essentially have [160] a lead pool of 200 people to go after [163] now how long do you think it's going to [165] take to test your offer to refine uh the [167] best way to pitch this thing right could [169] take you weeks could take you months [170] could take you tens of thousands of [172] contacts to really hit like offer Market [174] fit if you only have 200 to play around [176] with you're not going to get the best [178] results cuz you're not going to know [179] what's going to work for them your uh [181] lead generation is therefore going to be [183] much shittier and so will your project [185] management are fulfilling because you [186] won't have a lot of practice essentially [187] working with companies like this so [190] sourcing leads is way harder uh if it's [192] like a local business so I like to avoid [194] that entirely not saying you can't make [195] it work you can there's just no reason [197] why we have to be playing this video [199] game on Extreme difficulty when we could [200] be playing it on easy instead the second [203] big problem is that clients often don't [205] understand the value of automation or [206] are skeptical I'm not saying that people [209] that work at brick and mortar businesses [210] or people that own them are necessarily [212] less technological or like less Adept [215] with these Technologies but I do find on [218] average that they tend to be and the [220] reason why is because they just don't [221] have to work with these Technologies on [222] a daily basis right if you're running a [224] croissant store I mean how often do you [225] really need to like learn about cold [227] email software or crms right you [230] probably have an order management system [232] just out of the box provided for you by [234] maybe the the the company that runs your [235] payment processor or or something like [238] that they're just three or four big P [240] systems for croissants I don't know so [242] the point I'm making is they don't [243] really know enough about the industry to [246] see the value as directly as somebody [248] that is digital because somebody that's [249] digital you know they work with chat gbt [251] probably on a daily basis they [253] understand how Claude Works they [254] understand the value of these llms just [255] a little bit more [256] intuitively the third big problem is [258] that budgets are often smaller since [260] their own reach is limited have you ever [262] asked yourself how much these companies [263] actually make per month like that [265] croissant store that like retail shoe [267] store that I'm talking about here the [268] vast majority of these businesses do not [270] make much money and they have very thin [271] margins it's going to be very difficult [273] for them to justify paying money to you [276] even if you could deliver some outsid [278] result so their budgets are smaller I [280] mean you know why work with somebody [282] that's making $20,000 a month that if [284] you were to be paid 5K um that's a [286] quarter of their whole Revenue when you [288] could be working with somebody that's [289] making 100K a month then your 5K is only [291] 5% of their revenue I mentioned that [294] it's a pain in the ass working with [295] technologically inept people it is this [297] isn't the biggest part by any means but [298] it's certainly a pain my ass so I like [300] to work with people that at least [302] understand like you know how to log into [303] their Gmail and work with their Outlook [304] and that sort of stuff and and really my [307] bottom line here is just the internet is [309] where Money Changes hands in 2024 and [311] because it's where Money Changes hands [312] it's where you should be you should be [314] working on the internet you're working [315] with automation tools which typically [317] work very well with the internet they're [319] all interconnected so it's logical that [321] you would get your customers on the [322] internet as well if you just contrast [324] that with digital I'll just spend a [325] second on this um you could Source tens [327] of thousands of leads within a few days [329] for just a couple hundred doar that is [331] insane since clients work online they're [334] typically more problem aware AKA they'll [335] instinctively get your Automation and [337] because their budgets are often bigger [339] because people are often more Forward [340] Thinking and ambitious their networks [342] are larger for referral purposes they [344] tend to use the tools that you sell just [345] a lot easier to get up and running with [347] them and so this is like my main [348] qualifier um when I'm selecting niches [351] and when I'm I'm looking for niches to [352] work with now onto the mid and high [355] ticket um when you work with people that [357] charge a lot of money per customer you [359] have three or four types of Leverage the [361] first is that you have sales leverage [363] acquiring a single new customer for your [365] client often justifies your own expense [368] for months and or [369] years if I'm work I'll give you an [371] example with a company that I work with [373] uh just a run-ofthe-mill marketing [374] agency if they sign one client they make [377] $335,000 a year my expense for them is [380] about $4 or $5,000 a month depends [382] sometimes I charge them a little bit [383] extra so if you think about it my my [385] annual fee is uh I don't know about 48 [388] to $50,000 working with that client and [390] then if I just get them two customers [392] literally just two customers um they're [394] already making money on their investment [395] with me so how easy it is it is it to [398] get two customers obviously that depends [399] on your Niche but mathematically it's [401] usually a lot easier than let's say [402] getting a thousand customers at a lower [404] price point so acquiring a single [406] customer for you gives you tons of sales [407] leverage gives the company tons of sales [409] leverage um that's why mid and high [410] ticket rocks the second is people [412] leverage since mid and high ticket [414] usually offers offers usually involve a [416] lot of people like to fulfill you know [418] if you're charging somebody for $50,000 [420] a year um you know often there's a fair [422] amount of work that needs to go into [423] that automation has the potential to [425] make a big difference at least in their [426] fulfillment in their gross margins and [428] like their cost of good sold if you guys [430] are familiar with that term so you get a [432] lot of people leverage as well um [434] opportunities mid and high ticket offers [436] make a lot of money right I say that a [438] few sales per month typically equate to [439] about seven figures very true so there's [441] also a lot more referral opportunity for [443] you these people are typically better [444] well connected they typically have a lot [445] more money to spend and people that have [446] more money to spend tend to cooporate [448] with other people that have more money [449] need to spend um they tend to be more [451] meaningful just kind of better for your [452] career and then the budgets are often [454] higher people are more professional guys [456] that work with people that make you know [458] 10 15 $20,000 per sale uh just tend to [460] kind of got get their together if [462] that makes sense they don't have to deal [463] with a lowest common denominator sort of [465] consumer they typically deal with people [466] that are um sort of on like a different [468] different level if you want to put it [469] that way and so their thinking are [471] different um the quality of the work [473] that you're going to do with them tends [474] to be different and I personally find [475] it's just a lot more [476] streamlined okay the last thing I'm [478] going to mention before we dive into [479] these three niches are the problems that [482] they need to suffer from so this isn't [483] an exhaustive list of all of the [485] problems that companies can suffer from [486] but it's certainly a list of problems [488] that um I look for in the niches that I [490] want to work with the first big problem [493] and the sort of an umbrella is they [495] don't have enough money so their sales [496] and marketing blows so this might mean [498] that they struggle with legun they [500] struggle with sales admin sales admin [502] here refers to stuff like how much time [503] is their team spending on proposals how [505] much time is their team spending doing [506] routine data entry or um logging in a [509] CRM that maybe do or do not need to be [511] logged how much time do they spend on [513] forms right um if the team struggles [516] with follow-ups if the niche struggles [518] with invoicing or software if this if [520] this in Industry sorry usually doesn't [522] have data visualization no dashboards no [524] charts they have poor quality inbound [526] flows right maybe their marketing sucks [528] um their PPC campaigns are poorly [530] structured and so they don't have you [532] know maybe a good chatbot system they [534] don't have good social media management [535] they don't have good reputation [536] management these are all things that I [538] look for um and usually the way that I [540] do it is I'll just find like 50 [541] companies in a niche that I will Source [543] completely at random and I'll just look [545] really quickly to see what their website [547] looks like what their uh problems look [549] like how they're sourcing their leads [550] and I'll sort of make a determination [552] that way obviously we can only really [553] int it all of this is anecdotal but uh [556] you know providing yourself with more [557] data does allow you to make a better [559] result however anecdotal it is the [561] second is uh not enough manpower on the [564] Fulfillment side of things so we just [566] talked about sales and marketing what [567] about your ability to actually do the [568] project once you land [570] I look for niches that have no or poor [572] project management systems I look for [574] ones that typically have very complex [575] org charts org chart just refers to the [577] distribution of people in a business [579] right CEO CTO coo maybe a director of [583] marketing director of sales I look for [584] people with these really bloated org [586] charts typically where they don't [587] necessarily need to be anywhere near as [589] bloated but they are just because that's [590] how the niche does things I look for uh [594] niches that do menial tasks that take up [596] a lot of time there are a lot of niches [597] that work with spreadsheets on a daily [599] basis but they're only really uncovering [600] 10% of the power of those spreadsheets [602] those are exactly the sorts of people [603] you want to work with I look for niches [606] that typically don't have good Sops I [608] look for new niches that aren't very [609] established where there aren't Sops for [611] tasks then I look for niches that have [613] fulfillment processes that could be [614] automated with AI but aren't a good [616] example that's my writing business when [618] my writing business was on the come- up [619] the reason why it was on the come- up is [621] because we automated the vast majority [622] of our fulfillment processes with AI in [625] an era where nobody else was doing that [627] and that's what enabled us to scale to [628] to 92 UK most businesses suffer from one [632] or all of these problems obviously but [634] certain industries suffer more and [635] that's what I look for in my [637] niches okay drum roll please we're now [639] done talking about what makes a good [641] Niche we can actually talk about the [643] niches themselves and I have three very [645] juicy ones for you and for every Niche [647] I'm also going to talk about some [648] example companies I'm going to give you [650] example problems that they suffer from [651] I'm even going to give you the exact [652] systems to sell to them as well these [655] are systems that people in my community [656] are selling as we speak and making a ton [659] money doing so these are systems that I [661] know other people on YouTube are doing [663] I'm just going to give you it all right [664] here so the first Niche that I think is [669] easily probably the highest Ry Niche on [671] this list is B2B Tech what do I mean by [674] B2B Tech well B2B stands for business to [677] business Tech is technology obviously [679] this is essentially like high ticket SAS [681] or high ticket Enterprise software [684] products so Min High tiet software with [687] many customer touch points I.E not a low [689] ticket self served saf this SAS this [692] isn't something where somebody can go on [693] a website click sign up pay $5 a month [696] and then just run it completely for [697] themselves this is tons of customer [700] touch points this is where you're [701] assigned a rep this is where you have to [703] book in a call so they do a demo for you [705] this is something that takes a lot more [706] time effort and energy in order to [708] acquire on the sales side of things but [709] the thing is usually the average ticket [711] value of a single customer is way higher [713] as well and so it sort of pays off most [716] of these companies have annual revenues [717] of 7 eight figures some of them on the [719] high High eight figure side you're [720] probably not going to be able to work [721] with or acquire cold like the way that I [723] usually do but the people in like the [725] the low to mid seven figures easy the [727] people in the low eight figures [729] potentially and I've actually gone [730] through and I've found some examples of [732] companies because I want to show you [734] guys what these websites actually look [736] like this first one here is called sber [739] sber is a communication API product [741] essentially it allows you to create apis [745] for the entire customer Journey using [747] live chat video AI chat Bots Omni [749] Channel B business messaging notice how [751] like what this company does is not [753] evidently clear to you an average [755] consumer who doesn't understand this [756] Niche off the top of your head this is [758] the sort of product that you're looking [759] for because it solves a super specific [761] need in the market typically for [763] Enterprise look at how much money these [765] guys are charging 3.99 a month $5.99 a [767] month right what if you have uh 5K 10K [770] right the prices are pretty high if you [773] wanted to do 25k monthly active users [776] you're looking at like an annual fee [777] about 14 15K on the starter plan more on [781] the Pro Plan so this is a good example [783] of one high mid or high ticket [786] Enterprise product this is another one [788] called check these guys do some embedded [790] Payroll Solutions notice how they don't [791] even have pricing on their website [793] because they probably charge so much [794] money that to put pricing on their [796] website would I don't know be a [798] disservice to them or something turn [799] people off instead you need to contact [801] them you need to book a meeting with [802] their sales team this is the demo flow [804] that I was telling you [805] about the last one is this company IMO [808] Health same same sort of idea you need [810] to schedule a demo they have a lot of [811] customer touch points they obviously are [813] big dick in they have AWS here you know [816] Cedar siai they have netsmart they have [818] a lot of like huge companies that they [819] work with specifically in the healthcare [821] Niche so these are companies these are [823] like compan I'm not saying work with [825] these companies explicitly I'm just [826] trying to give you examples so you can [828] pattern match this when you're on the [829] internet looking for businesses and [830] niches to Target in this [833] umbrella why B2B Tech specifically three [835] main reasons you have an extremely high [837] customer LTV which means if you can [839] acquire One customer for them you [841] justify your expense basically [842] immediately right if you're charging I [844] don't know 3,000 bucks a month or [845] something you get two customers for [847] sbird you've you've already Justified [849] your expense completely they're big but [851] they're typically not like Enterprise [852] level big um what I mean by that is if [854] you're meeting people on like the seven [856] figure Mark like I was talking about [858] typically you can still find the contact [859] details of a major decision maker [861] somebody that can say yes or no to you [863] uh reasonably easily you can do so for a [865] few dollars and then they're also easy [867] to Source they're digital they're not [869] brick and mortar so they have a wealth [870] of data you could use to personalize [871] your Outreach and then you can just [872] Source a lot of those leads really [874] really simply and [875] easily some specific problems that these [878] companies suffer from um lead gen is a [881] big one in my experience any of these [883] like mid to high ticket B2B tech [884] companies that are founded more than a [886] few years ago they often rely on really [888] crappy bloated sales teams outdated [890] Outreach products we're talking Outreach [892] products that cost them2 or $3,000 a [895] month to operate um you know they they [898] typic some times they get some type of [900] like uh like investment for instance [902] they like raise around or something like [903] that and they got all these Tech Pros [904] that come in a few years back you know [906] four or five years ago um I've worked [908] with tons of companies that have uh [910] received investment four or five years [912] ago and this is just a pattern that I'm [913] seeing where they'll just buy like a [915] really expensive software stack because [917] that's what the director of marketing at [919] this bloated ass company uh is used to [922] using and so essentially what happens is [924] these aforementioned sales or marketing [926] products are often super expensive so [927] you can just justify your monthly [928] container in month one by saying hey why [930] are we using this right like why are you [932] using this why don't we use this this [933] will instantly save you you know $2,000 [936] a month or something like that and you [937] know if you're charging $2 to $4,000 a [939] month you can see how it's a very simple [940] proposition for it you're almost like an [941] IT consultant at that point granted um a [944] lot of them also have very complicated [946] internal fulfillment processes so these [948] companies often have software Engineers [949] because they need people to work on [950] their product it's a B2B tech product [952] it's kind of like a mid High ticket SAS [953] right but even though they have software [956] developers and software Engineers what a [958] lot of lack is they lack a business [960] engineer and the business engineer's [962] purpose is our purpose it's to work on [964] everything surrounding the product [966] itself it's to work on the [967] infrastructure of the company it's to [969] work on optimizing the sales process [971] it's to work on optimizing the marketing [972] process it's to work on Building Systems [974] that automate large chunks of their work [976] and so they have software Engineers for [977] their product they have product [978] Engineers but they don't have people [980] that work around the product on the on [981] the delivery mechanism of the product [983] the vehicle they're in and even if they [985] do these people don't tend to understand [987] automation so what systems would I sell [989] them I'll give you the exact systems I [991] would sell this is going to be a common [993] thing on my list by the way I'm going to [994] sell my cold email lead gen system [996] absolutely if I was working with one of [998] these companies and they were paying me [1000] three four $5,000 a month this is [1001] exactly what I would do day one I'd buy [1003] 10 domains I'd link 30 mailboxes to [1006] Smart leader instantly I have links in [1007] the description if you need them I'd [1009] start warming them up ASAP I'd Source [1011] 4,000 leads by the end of month one if [1014] you do this right if you warm up between [1015] two to 3 weeks and then you send emails [1017] immediately you will have reached out to [1019] all 4,000 leads with a response rate of [1021] about 4% you'll have generated about 150 [1023] 160 replies many of which will turn into [1025] justifiable sales opportunities booked [1027] meetings demos that sort of thing for [1029] that company if you can do that by the [1030] end of month one you will have Justified [1032] your own expense instantly and you're [1034] probably uh already at the point where [1035] you're going to start generating [1036] multiples on it so this is the very [1038] first system that I would look to sell [1039] companies like this immediately right [1041] off the get-go the second is i' look for [1043] CRM [1044] automations as I mentioned to you [1046] previously these companies often rely [1047] and sort of like out ofd tools or tools [1049] that are just way too unnecessarily [1051] complex what I would do is I would I [1053] would build CRM automations for either [1055] their own CRM or I try and get them on [1056] one of mine something like clickup [1058] something like one of the few software [1059] platforms I've mentioned to you guys in [1060] previous videos so when a new lead comes [1063] in what happens I'm going to build [1064] automations that respond to the lead [1065] instantly with AI personalized messaging [1067] if you can increase conversion rate by [1069] even 5% right 5% of $50,000 is [1074] $2,500 you're effectively increasing the [1077] revenue that they make on every person [1079] that comes in by $2,500 which is [1082] huge the last thing I'd propose to them [1085] or I'd build for them is proposal [1086] generator B2B Tech often has very [1088] similar sales processes to agencies and [1091] I've talked a lot about how the agency [1092] sales process looks but there's usually [1094] some sort of Discovery call or demo call [1096] sometimes there's a big super expensive [1098] sort of closing call where you get the [1100] person to say yes to you and then [1101] there's usually some proposal there's a [1102] quote there's an agreement there's a [1104] sort of like drawn out um more like [1106] oldfashioned old timey sales process [1108] it's just like a button that you click [1109] and you accept the terms and conditions [1111] and then you pay so because of that you [1113] have a lot of stuff that you can [1114] automate you can template proposals you [1116] can template um quotes and agreements [1118] and stuff like that using Ai and no code [1120] and there's a ton of sales leverage [1122] there for the companies because [1123] companies like this typically spend a [1124] lot of their sales Budget on sales [1127] Administration okay Niche number two is [1129] recruitment we actually have somebody in [1131] my community right now called sod that [1133] scaled from $ z uh I think like 35 or 40 [1137] days ago um to I think over $155,000 a [1141] month in profit and all he's doing is [1142] targeting recruitment agencies so mid to [1145] high ticket Services especially in [1147] executive Search and specialized roles [1148] executive Search just refers to looking [1150] for like people a little bit higher up [1153] um you know CEOs C Level companies [1155] director level sorry C Level people [1158] director level people VPS that sort of [1161] thing the way that recruitment companies [1163] work is they typically handle a very [1164] high volume of applications and a high [1166] volume of candidates and anytime a [1167] business handles a high volume of [1169] something um a small percent Improvement [1171] in what you do for every specific [1173] customer will yield very big results and [1176] usually these recruitment companies have [1177] annual revenues from like the high you [1179] know the sorts of companies you're going [1180] to work want to work with have revenues [1182] from like the high six figures all the [1184] way up to maybe like the low eight [1185] figures if it's a bigger recruitment [1186] business I have a couple of examples for [1188] you here this one is in my province in [1191] Canada it's called recruitment [1193] Partners um this is just a good example [1195] of u a company whose money I don't [1199] actually know if their revenues are [1200] between six to eight figures but I [1202] strongly suspect that they are just [1204] because of how many offices they have [1205] the fact that I know the areas that [1206] their offices are in and that sort of [1208] stuff so that's a good example locally [1210] in Canada another one that might be a [1212] little bit higher in on the scale would [1214] be modern uh recruitment or executive [1216] Solutions these guys do executive [1218] recruiting specifically SE Suite B Suite [1221] um you know stuff like [1223] that now why recruitment specifically I [1226] mentioned the high volume repetitive [1227] processes that's huge [1229] but the big thing that they have that [1230] that stands out is they have tons of [1232] pain points in sourcing screening and [1236] communicating with both leads and [1239] candidates so these are all people-based [1241] problems which automation helps a ton [1243] with but they're also outreach-based [1245] problems which you can leverage the [1248] systems that I've talked about before to [1249] sell tons of Outreach based problems [1252] mean these are problems typically and [1254] how communication is managed how people [1256] are contacted for the very first time [1258] cold email cold DMS that sort of thing [1262] the last thing is they're digital first [1264] industry and they're very accustomed to [1265] using various software tools recruitment [1267] companies typically have a very very big [1269] software stack um and so recruitment is [1271] a fantastic industry to be in and I'd [1274] highly recommend you know you at least [1276] try or check this out the specific [1278] problems they suffer from just to [1279] itemize lead gen recruitment companies [1282] struggle with consistently finding new [1283] clients or job openings job openings [1285] meaning like job openings for them they [1287] look for companies that want to Place uh [1289] people in a specific role and then they [1290] say Hey listen let me place that for you [1293] older firms especially rely on very [1294] outdated methods like uh expensive job [1296] board subscriptions I find these very [1298] silly um you can pay several thousand [1300] dollars a month for these things and [1301] they yield you basically nothing the [1303] second is time consuming candidate [1305] sourcing recruiters will spend tons of [1307] time to manually search through Linkedin [1309] job boards uh tons of like databases in [1312] different niches like you know like uh [1313] like programmers C developers that sort [1315] of thing to find potential candidates [1317] this is pretty inici and there are much [1319] easier ways to access a much larger [1321] candidate quantity list that may be a [1324] little bit lower quality but the law of [1325] large numbers works in your favor the [1327] last thing is uh they typically have [1329] very poor candidate communication they [1330] have very poor follow-ups keeping all [1332] candidates informed about their [1334] application status where they are in the [1335] pipeline especially people that aren't [1336] selected is important but uh almost [1339] everybody neglects it because it's just [1340] simply infeasible if you're processing [1342] several hundred candidates at a time I [1344] talk about this leading to negative [1345] employer brand and missed opportunities [1347] for future placements um I I think [1348] that's reasonably straightforward you [1350] can solve all this with automation you [1352] could have a pipeline with a bunch of [1353] stages you could have it so that when [1355] somebody moves from one stage to another [1356] they're automatically notified of their [1357] placement in that stage I've built these [1360] systems out for a couple of recruitment [1362] companies myself this provides a ton of [1364] Leverage here are the systems that you [1366] could sell them or at least some systems [1368] the first is a cold email Legion system [1369] again I'm going to go buy 10 domains [1371] link 30 mailboxes start warming them up [1373] Source 4K leads and then reach out to [1374] those people by the end of month one [1376] you'll have generated at least 160 repes [1378] it'll cost the company a few hundred [1380] these are justifiable sales [1381] opportunities this is going to to to [1383] secure you several more months working [1385] with this sort of client the second is a [1388] candidate generation system and this is [1389] really cool essentially it's the exact [1391] same thing as your cold email lead gen [1392] system it's just now you're doing it on [1394] candidates and not leads you can find a [1397] list of people you can find lists of [1399] companies at similar companies to the [1401] company that you are looking to place a [1403] role for you can scrape all of the [1406] people that work at those companies and [1408] you perform some type of directed [1409] Outreach to those people or you can use [1412] those people to generate like a [1413] lookalike list or a list of attributes [1415] that you are looking for in the people [1417] to source and then you can just perform [1419] your own uh sort of search LinkedIn [1421] recruiter LinkedIn the sales Navigator [1423] these are great platforms for [1425] this the third is automated resume [1427] screening this isn't just resume [1429] screening mind you can actually feed in [1430] all of the responses to their like um [1432] proposal or application processes into [1434] AI uh you could have them go through [1436] everything holistically just dump it all [1438] out and text have them tell you whether [1440] this person is qualified or at least the [1441] sort of person that you're looking for [1443] um tons of older recruitment companies [1444] do what's called keyword matching which [1446] is where they literally just look for [1447] the presence of a word in a resume or a [1449] CV it's outdated um more companies are [1451] now using AI to read through stuff like [1453] that but they're still a lot of [1454] potential and opportunity out there so [1456] I'd encourage you guys to give that a [1457] try and the last is a dashboard because [1460] recruitment agencies deal with large [1462] numbers so many candidates many job [1463] openings visualizing this data and using [1466] it like like you have a lot of [1467] opportunity make your company better [1469] when you have a lot of data but the vast [1471] majority of recruitment agencies at all [1472] level six State figures typically don't [1475] take advantage of that anywhere near as [1476] well as they should be so you can very [1478] easily create comprehensive dashboards [1480] that visualize recruitment metrics the [1481] number of people placed the the pipeline [1484] value of the leads in their pipeline who [1486] needs to be followed up with who's doing [1488] their job who's not the average cost of [1491] a new lead per recruiter you could break [1493] things down that way there's tons of [1495] Leverage in that industry all right [1497] Niche number three is creative agencies [1500] and I actually created an example for [1501] this in my community where I created a [1503] company that targets specifically [1504] creative agencies and actually went and [1506] I got a customer for them um so I'm very [1508] familiar with this Niche I've worked [1509] with a few in my time the most recent [1511] being literally um well like two and a [1514] half three weeks ago something like that [1516] so creative agencies are mid to high [1518] ticket services that offer various [1520] Creative Solutions obviously they offer [1522] some type of creative so design but they [1524] also tend to do marketing they tend to [1525] do advertising they tend to do like PBC [1527] campaigns that sort of thing now just a [1529] holistic creative service most of these [1532] agencies manage multiple client projects [1534] simultaneously most of them are also [1535] extraordinarily disorganized so there's [1537] a lot of added value in you coming in [1539] and cleaning up and they often have [1541] a mix of retainer and Project based [1542] Revenue models with revenues typically [1544] in the 68 figure range I'll show you a [1546] couple examples as usual the first is C2 [1549] creative Studio this is an independent [1550] brand strategy and design team in [1552] Chicago um this is the sort of website [1555] for the sort of company that I would be [1557] looking to work with as you see they're [1559] nice and clean they're obviously very [1560] handsome fellas um and then you know you [1562] can schedule a discovery call that way [1564] so this is something that you could very [1566] easily do Outreach for and uh you could [1568] get a lot of customers it's also [1569] something you could easily build crms or [1571] project management systems or that sort [1573] of thing this is another one called [1576] nosy and then this is the last one [1578] called [1580] Havas and as you see these are creative [1582] right there's a reason they're creative [1584] agencies because the websites are [1585] creative the art is you know creative [1589] all of it's quite [1590] beautiful in terms of the problems that [1592] these companies suffer from again you'll [1595] notice that there's uh Trend here and [1597] it's that basically every company [1598] suffers from leaden and so Leen is [1600] something that you should be selling to [1601] these people regardless of who they are [1603] what company would n their in because [1605] they're probably going to be like a [1606] yeah we need more leads agencies [1608] obviously struggle with consistently [1609] finding new clients the vast majority of [1611] agencies that I have worked with when I [1613] ask them so how do you acquire new [1614] clients their number one response is [1615] well mostly referrals that just tells me [1617] they don't have a scalable lead [1618] generation system they don't have a [1620] scalable way to acquire more customers [1622] and they're essentially operating a [1623] hobby more than they're operating a real [1625] business another problem is poor project [1627] management they often juggle multiple [1629] projects with varying deadlines or [1630] resource requirements they typically [1631] have very poor project management [1633] systems or if they have a shitty sales [1634] process they'll usually acquire [1637] customers that they can't fulfill using [1639] a standardized templated offer which [1641] leads to bottlenecks miss deadlines [1642] burnout amongst team members [1644] dissatisfaction with the company that [1646] sort of thing you see this all the time [1648] uh timec consuming Administration [1650] agencies spend a ton of time on [1651] non-billable administrative work like [1654] time sheets organizing assets uh [1656] interstaff communication waiting on [1659] resources to be freed up or allowed [1661] deliverables that sort of thing this is [1663] a huge impact to productivity and it [1664] results in you spending maybe at least [1666] another 50% more than you actually have [1668] to if you're unfamiliar with the term [1670] billable or non-billable um typically [1673] billable is referred to in like hourly [1675] based pricing models which a lot of [1676] agencies do agencies will get on a big [1678] retainer for $200 $300 an hour or [1680] something like that and then they'll [1682] give a little discount to the company if [1683] they purchase a set number of hours from [1684] them so let's say it's $200 an hour and [1686] then they discount it to 150 for 30 [1688] hours that's 4,500 bucks a month well [1691] there's billable work which is typically [1692] working on systems and then there's non [1694] or sorry working on deliverables and [1696] then there's non-billable work which is [1698] stuff like filling out time sheets [1699] organizing your own assets basically [1701] internal work that you don't show to the [1703] customer client and so it's this [1705] internal work that ends up being timec [1706] consuming and since you're not making [1707] money on it obviously you want to [1709] minimize it however possible the last [1711] thing is difficulty in tracking your [1713] billable hours difficulty in invoicing [1716] because a lot of them have like super [1717] drawn out invoicing procedures that are [1719] all like Net 30 Terms just a massive [1721] pain in the ass creative work often [1723] involves tons of these small tasks and [1724] iterations that are hard to track which [1726] leads to undercharging for services [1727] scope creep and difficulty I mentioned [1730] here in assessing the true profitability [1731] of projects or clients here are some of [1734] systems that I would sell to them and I [1735] have sold all of all of these systems to [1738] to creative agencies before as well as [1740] basically every other company on this [1741] list uh cold Emil Leen systems of course [1744] I'm not going to go through the whole RI [1745] roll of telling you how many domains to [1746] buy you can buy as many as you want I'm [1748] just trying to give you an indication as [1750] to how aggressively I would approach [1751] these mid to high ticket [1753] companies uh really important one is AI [1755] powered fulfillments and project [1756] management I would build out custom [1758] project management pipelines for that [1759] industry what whatever uh their their [1762] service offerings are so if they have [1763] three service lines if they do like um I [1766] don't know they have like an all-in-one [1767] creative agency management thing which [1769] is $155,000 a month and then they have [1771] some other thing that's uh like a $3,000 [1773] a month like ad creative package and [1775] then they have some other thing that's a [1776] big social media managing package i' [1778] build it a custom pipeline for each of [1779] those okay so I'd have like a service [1781] line pipeline for um you know the [1784] organic stuff one for the PPC stuff one [1786] for the um all-in-one and with every [1789] step I would use artificial intelligence [1791] to template out resources for the team [1793] based off the input that the client gave [1795] them via a brief or something like that [1797] you could e easily do half or more of [1799] the work for any sort of text based task [1801] probably less for like a visual task [1803] still although AI art and AI designs are [1805] getting quite good quite quickly so you [1806] could always build the infrastructure in [1808] there knowing that that's going to [1809] arrive quite soon but any text based [1811] task you could easily automate more than [1812] half of I do it at my own company one [1814] second copy it's one of the reasons why [1815] we're able to scale so quickly I'd also [1818] automate their time track and automate [1819] their invoicing literally just getting [1821] one of these companies on stripe is [1823] usually huge I know it's silly but a lot [1825] of these companies that make you know 50 [1827] $100,000 a month they're just using [1829] really outdated payment processors that [1831] maybe charge them like 2.5% instead of [1833] 2.9% but end up taking the founder or [1835] the directors like 30 hours a month or [1838] something organizing invoicing talking [1839] to customers collecting complete utter [1842] waste of time so um what I would do is [1844] i' track billable hours directly in [1845] their PM system and I just build them [1847] out like an automated invoicing [1849] procedure where I count up the number of [1850] hours that my team has spent on the task [1853] that are billable versus non-billable if [1854] you're charging somebody hourly then I [1856] multiply it by the hourly rate on some [1858] other column and then I'd send them the [1860] invoice and I'd actually automatically [1861] build them and then just send them a [1862] receipt but if they want me to manually [1864] you know send them the invoice I'd [1865] manually send them an invoice and then [1867] when they pay assuming that I have some [1869] some structure in place where I've [1871] guaranteed my margins I then probably [1873] pre-draft invoices from my team to me if [1875] I'm working with contractors something [1877] like that the last thing is client [1879] Communications and PM a lot of these [1881] companies would do really well with like [1882] a design Joy like system um design Joy [1886] was operated by oh I believe his name is [1887] Brett Brett Larson or something like [1889] that I might be mistaken on the last [1890] name but essentially he rose to [1893] prominence because he was a oneman like [1895] Design shop and um the way that he [1897] managed his clients was sort of Novel [1899] where he gave all of his clients a [1901] Trello board and then he said hey if you [1904] want to assign me a new project all you [1905] need to do is create a new task in this [1907] trell board so you could create a client [1909] communication or project management [1910] system like this where your clients [1912] actually control the the the things that [1914] they give to you and you could very [1915] easily template and I've done this [1917] before you you could very easily create [1918] a form for customers to fill out to [1921] assign you tasks because you created the [1923] form you get to control all of the [1925] information that they put in you get to [1927] ensure that your company has a [1928] standardized sort of field Set uh and [1931] that also makes it very easy for you to [1933] automate your work [1934] too those are my closing thoughts on the [1937] three top niches in automation agencies [1940] in 2024 and moving on into the 2025 New [1943] Year if I could summarize all this it [1944] would be to look for niches that are [1946] digital mid to high ticket and suff from [1948] problems that you solve the three niches [1949] that I talked about in this video [1950] specifically are B2B Tech I also talked [1953] about recruitment companies and the last [1954] one was creative agencies really hope [1956] you guys appreciated this video had a [1958] lot of fun putting it together I'd love [1959] if you guys could like subscribe uh [1962] leave a comment down below if you have [1963] any requests for future videos if you [1965] guys have anything you wanted to say [1966] about this one thanks so much for [1967] watching have a great rest of day and [1968] looking forward to the next one

Title: 3 Common Automation Agency Mistakes You NEED To Avoid In 2024
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here and [1] in this video I'm going to cover the [2] three common automation agency mistakes [4] to avoid in 2024 as well as moving on [7] into the 2025 New Year uh first and [10] foremost these are my mistakes they're [12] not the only ones they're just the [13] mistakes that I personally make due to [15] my own decision-making biases and sort [16] of like business history um I wish I [18] could go back and fix these because if I [20] did I'd probably be at least a million [22] to $2 million richer right now so take [24] whatever makes sense the out of this [26] video and then just discard whatever [27] isn't relevant um no gatekeeping as [29] always I'm just going to show you [30] everything give you the sauce I'm going [31] to show you how to do a lot of how to [33] solve a lot of these mistakes with [34] templates and that sort of thing so [36] first and foremost uh my number one [38] agency mistake was not starting cold [40] email earlier I lost well over a quarter [42] million dollars specifically because of [44] this because how effective cold email is [47] in 2024 um it is stupidly effective when [50] I say stupidly effective I mean the cost [52] to acquire a customer in cold email is [54] something like 10 to 15 times at minimum [56] lower than basically every other major [59] approach right now it is light years [61] ahead of pay-per-click ads it's light [64] years ahead of any sort of like referral [66] scheme it is so godamn cheapap that if [68] you aren't doing it right now you're [70] missing out and you're losing a ton of [72] money so automator in particular AKA [75] people like you and I people that know [77] make.com and zapier and nat10 or um gp4 [81] or Claud right we also get to benefit [83] disproportionately from cold email as [85] relative to all other agencies out there [87] all other agencies have to send [88] templated shitty emails that go like hey [91] um I saw your company and I want to [93] increase your leads by 50% in the next 6 [95] months or your money back we don't have [97] to do that we get to say stuff like hey [99] Sandra I saw that you worked at [100] Boardwalk my third cousin twice removed [102] spent a semester there back in college [104] I'd love to connect when people see that [107] second email in the intro they're like [110] 99.99% more likely to click that [112] freaking email and the second that [114] they're they're in you've already done [116] like the vast majority of your work as [117] somebody that's pitching cold email so [119] you know enough AI to be dangerous um [121] even if you didn't I would still [123] recommend that you use cold emo because [124] it's still very profitable but because [126] you do it's even more profitable it's [128] like orders and orders and Orders of [129] magnitude more profitable so uh you know [132] if I could dial back the clock I would [133] have started cold EMA literally on day [134] one hell I probably would have started 5 [136] years ago instead of going freaking [138] door- knocking and getting thrown out by [139] security I could have just sent a bunch [140] of emails wouldn't have that been much [142] easier anyway the other point I'm going [143] to make here is most other people in [145] most other Industries they're going to [146] cap out at a 1 to 2% response rate on [147] average unless their copy is incredible [149] um but with personalization like I [151] talked about earlier with Sandra and [152] Boardwalk uh you can easily achieve 5% [155] plus and my top performing campaign ever [157] is uh it was somewhere between 20 to 25% [160] granted this was like an event specific [162] campaign where we acquired a big list [163] from an event organizer and then reached [165] out to the mall using personalization uh [167] but still it was it was absolutely [168] ridiculous and if you think about a 25% [171] response rate I mean you know if a [172] quarter of those people respond [173] positively you could send 1,000 emails [175] and then literally get like 70 booked [177] meetings the cost per email on that is [180] basically nothing it's dumb so some [183] quick math here just using the approach [185] that I'm about to show you in a few [186] minutes um you can send a th000 emails a [188] day and get anywhere between a 2.5 to 5% [191] response rate meaning that you'll get um [193] 25 to 50 responses for less than $15 [197] like do the math there the vast majority [198] of like pay-per-click ads uh booked [200] appointments usually cost anywhere [202] between like $50 to $100 now is you can [204] literally get like an order of like like [206] 20 times that for 15 bucks like it's [209] just it's crazy anyway I'm going to stop [212] edifying cold email um the last thing [214] I'll say is that it it takes less than [216] two hours to set up and really the [217] benefit is selling cold is actually one [219] of the hardest ways to sell like it [221] might be easier to acquire the meeting [222] but it's usually a little bit harder to [223] get the lead that said you can learn how [225] to do it extraordinarily effectively and [227] when you do if you learn how to sell to [229] cold audiences you can sell to literally [231] anybody else on planet Earth um and [233] essentially the rest of your business [235] becomes a freaking Cakewalk so that's [238] that um in terms of specific took cold [240] email mistakes I think that a lot of [242] people get started with cold email and [244] then they end up floundering because of [245] the following the first is they're not [247] using the right platforms the only two [249] platforms that I'd recommend at least as [251] of the time of this recording is [252] instantly and smart late they allow you [254] to distribute um basically like volume [256] across dozens or hundreds of mailboxes [258] simultaneously and they do all the hard [260] work sort of on the back end for you I [262] used to use platforms like lemlist or [264] outreach.io or a bunch of these other [266] ones where you had to pay per mailbox [268] and it ended up uh for an equivalent [270] cost it would have been something like [271] $500 for what instantly can do for you [273] for like 50 so yeah instantly or smart [276] lead don't waste your time with others [277] as of now these are basically just the [279] the best platforms on planet Earth for [281] the specific purpose the second mistake [283] relatives a cold email is that um you [286] know you're not starting early enough [287] cold mailboxes usually take between 14 [289] to 21 days to warm up so if you want to [291] start sending today you should have set [293] up your mailboxes 2 to 3 weeks ago that [295] means that if you want to send in 2 to 3 [297] weeks you got to start setting up your [298] mailboxes today so one of my businesses [300] is I run a community where I teach [301] people how to use make to make money on [303] the internet and uh a big thing that I'm [306] seeing constantly come up is man I wish [308] I had freaking set up my mailboxes [309] earlier because now I have to wait two [310] or three weeks um two or three weeks if [312] you run a campaign for two or three [314] weeks and you're sending two or 300 [315] emails a day like if you do the math [317] that's anywhere between 5,000 to 6,000 [319] total emails sent out if you do some [321] response rate math on top of that um [323] that's like I don't know at least like [325] 15 20 booked meetings that you are [327] literally just throwing away because he [329] decided to start later as opposed to [332] earlier the last big issue is in terms [334] of the copyrighting U my personal issue [336] that I made when I started was I never [337] talked to my prospects like people I [339] start kind of talk to them as like a [341] like an ideal idealized customer Avatar [344] cold email copy is very different from [346] worm email copy it's very different from [347] newsletter funnels it's very different [349] from direct sales letters and it's [351] certainly very different than like [352] scripts for video sales letters in order [354] to succeed you need to be blunt you need [356] to be very straightforward you need to [357] be personalized uh my tip which which [359] I've seen circulated on Twitter and [360] Linkedin a bunch of times is just talk [362] to people like you are talking to like [364] you would talk to them at the bar like [366] if you're Reaching Across the bar You' [367] be like hey bro what's going on man I [368] saw your shirt I really liked it how can [370] I uh you know how can we connect [372] something like that the point that I'm [374] making is just cut all the out [376] try and get it as short assumably [377] possible try and make it as visible in a [379] phone screen as you can um personalize [381] it and just be very straightforward with [383] what you're asking and if you guys want [384] more tips on how to actually write a [385] coldy mail campaign um I have a whole [387] video where I break down my my four-step [389] copyrighting formula um which has you [391] know netted me tons of results similar [393] to what I'm about to show you here so in [395] terms of a typical campaign that you can [397] expect for cold email this is just one [398] that I was running for my community just [400] a few weeks ago I don't have any cold [402] email campaigns for myself up right now [404] just because I've had to sort of like [406] bottleneck U my community is sort of [408] bottlenecking me along with my YouTube [409] stuff so I'm not actually running [411] anything right now this is just from a [412] few weeks ago uh July 5th up until maybe [414] like July 11th and we sent to 447 people [417] we had a reply rate of 4.3% or we 19 [420] about six of those were people that were [422] explicitly asking me hey Nick I'd love [423] to book in your calendar the copy that I [426] wrote was this and I'm just going to [427] zoom in here and actually read the [428] entire thing out for you so bear with me [430] um we have a personalization snippet up [432] at the top that personalization snippet [434] is the AI sort of like approach which [436] will personalize the email intro so that [437] it says like hey Sandra you know I saw [440] that you worked at XYZ company and maybe [442] you know you have a you have a wonderful [444] cute Yorkshire Terrier I love dogs and I [446] just thought that i' reach out so some [448] personalized section up here that like [449] really just instantly snags them and [451] then after that this is what I wrote I [452] know this is a long shot but I work [454] specifically with creative agencies [455] basically I make project management [457] system using apps like clickup or Monday [459] that automate all of your creative and [460] your copy and your articles and your ads [462] Etc I did this in my own agency one [464] second copy and I scaled Revenue to 92k [467] a month at 50k margins similar business [469] to yours although obviously more [470] specific to cooperating also it was my [472] own company so I had a lot of latitude [473] but I want to see if I could build out a [474] similar project management system for [476] you as I think your vertical is one [477] where you could easily do more than 92k [479] assuming you had a good pipeline also in [481] my experience project management is one [482] of the major things that hold creative [484] agencies back I could do this upfront at [486] no cost and if you like it if it makes [487] sense we could work together long term [489] pay for it all myself and assuming [490] you're in I can get back to you in 72 [491] hours with a video and a link to your [493] CRM would this make sense for you if so [495] do you want me just to go ahead and do [496] it or would you rather chat first then I [498] was kind of sneaky and I said I'm kind [499] of awkward over the phone but we can [501] chat if you're game uh and then down [503] here I kind of big it and I was [505] like PS if you're not sure who I am or [506] skeptical Google me and I I do this [508] actually as kind of a hack because the [510] more people that Google you the higher [511] your Google search um graph thing goes [514] right because it sort of illustrates a [515] lot of people are interested in you but [517] uh when people Google me they tend to [518] like see my Google Knowledge Graph and [519] they're like oh wow that guy's pretty [520] good he's legit let me reply to his [522] email so this is what I'd call like [524] pretty solid copy it's nothing [526] incredible but you know it's like maybe [528] average a little bit above average um [530] you guys can just copy and paste this [531] sort of approach if you want um but [533] again I have a four-step copyrighting [534] formula which breaks this down if you're [535] selling a different product from a CRM [537] or a project management system [538] definitely check that out um to sort of [540] learn why I did what I did here and then [542] yeah you know we got a a 4.3% reply rate [545] across the 447 people that we emailed [547] super simple super straightforward [549] nothing difficult whatsoever in terms of [551] how to actually go about like sourcing [552] the leads for this and how to actually [554] go about sending them um if I could [556] teleport this knowledge back in time [557] again i' I'd literally have made more [559] than an extra quarter million dollars of [560] the last 18 months um what I would do is [563] I would Source a list using LinkedIn [565] sales Navigator I would then send it to [567] a platform called Phantom Buster I would [569] then get those leads and Export them to [571] any mail finder and then I'd use gp4 or [573] Claud to personalize those emails you [575] could also use Apollo which is sort of [577] like a one-click platform I have a link [578] down in the description if need be and [580] then feed that into gb4 or Claud um and [583] there are many other lead sourcing [584] Avenues but the point that I'm making is [585] in order to win in 2024 with an audience [587] you do have to personalize your [589] messaging anything else is instantly [590] moved to the spam box and you're [592] probably not going to get response rates [593] of more than like a half a percent maybe [595] 1% so with average copy and an average [597] audience you can expect around 3 to 5% [599] resp response rates if a quarter of [600] those responses are positive that means [601] you could send 150 emails and book one [603] meeting now what if you were to send 300 [606] a day well then you're booking two what [607] if you send 600 a day now you're booking [609] four my math Ain't So Good a thousand a [612] day seven right I think um could he even [614] do seven meetings in a day probably not [616] the point that I'm making is like you [619] can actually like if you're watching [620] this video and you've never done this [621] before from now until 21 days from now [624] in that time period you could actually [626] have a lead generation funnel set up [628] where you are generating between one to [630] seven meetings a day and you could do it [632] for less than three or 400 bucks a month [634] it's like 15ish bucks a day max you [636] could do that right now if you wanted to [638] all you would have to do is set all the [640] stuff up set a calendar reminder on your [641] email warm-ups and then voila you're [644] good so really if I could go back in [646] time and start this process at the very [647] beginning I definitely would have and uh [649] I think that I can give you guys the [651] benefit of foresight if you're there [652] then you should start now too all right [655] so uh big mistake number two is not [657] productizing earlier I probably lost [659] well over half a million dollars because [661] of this this is a little bit tougher to [662] say with cold email copy it's just like [664] how many meetings what's your conversion [665] and how much money do you make per deal [667] um this is a little bit more up in the [669] air but I think it's probably at least [670] half a million dollars I definitely uh [672] lost a lot of uh a lot of sleepless [674] nights I I want to say so what [676] productization is is it refers to making [678] your service as templated and as [680] straightforward as possible if you're [682] delivering a um I don't know a proposal [685] automation system like I've shown in my [686] previous videos producti productizing [689] essentially refers to breaking down how [691] to make that into just a series of [692] simple steps that you could just take [694] and hand to a monkey and the monkey [695] could do it um whether or not you [697] delegate this work to anybody that isn't [698] important you could actually just take [699] that checklist and then just use it [701] yourself that's totally fine um but the [703] process of productizing the process of [704] listing your work in terms of these [706] deliverables and steps and that's [707] extraordinarily important because the [709] next time you sell it you can make [710] little improvements here or there to [712] each one of those steps to save yourself [713] money and then that way your business [715] starts being this like evolving machine [717] that just gets better and better and [718] better at acquiring and then optimizing [720] for Capital so the issue is most [723] automation agencies like mine and this [725] applies to software consultancies and [726] software development agencies as well is [728] they'll start by offering custom [730] implementations because their goal is [732] they want to win any deal at any cost [734] and this is totally fine for your first [736] few months like I actually encourage all [737] of the people in my community and that [739] are watching this video to just do [740] whatever it takes to get their first few [742] jobs because the second that they have a [743] couple of jobs selling Automation [745] Services they learn so much about client [747] management client relationships what [749] takes to build a system you know you can [751] worry about actually making it great [752] after just worry about getting from zero [753] to one first but after a few projects [756] you do need to move away from Custom [758] implementations if you want any chance [760] at a successful business um custom [762] projects are incredibly difficult to [763] hire for because you need to hire [765] somebody that has this massive diverse [766] array of skills it's also very difficult [768] to scale because every project you get [770] is going to be different and the number [771] one issue in Automation and software [773] development agencies is scope creep [775] where you know because it's such a [777] complex system with so many [778] interdependencies you can't actually [779] scope it out in advance perfectly and so [782] what the client and customer will [783] request from you it's usually going to [785] be slightly different from what you [786] deliver um and you have to you're [788] responsible for that Gap essentially um [790] and scope creep is a whole other video [791] which I'm going to get into um but it's [793] something that we just want to avoid [794] however possible sure custom projects [796] are interesting but personally I care [798] more about making money I think a lot of [799] you guys do too I love Automation and I [801] love working on stuff like this but um [803] personally if I could just make a [805] million bajillion dollars a day uh and [807] then just you know build the same system [808] out I definitely would that's one of the [809] main reasons I'm in business right to [811] buy myself this incredible lifestyle and [813] and you know work on things that that I [815] enjoy so here are the the main mistakes [818] that people make when they try and [820] producti or maybe don't producti hard [822] enough um the first thing is they sell [824] their ability rather than a specific [826] project so instead of selling a cold [829] email lead generation system they say [831] hey how's it going I'm a cold email lead [833] generation specialist I can build out [834] anything for you so the the second [837] sounds cool and it's nice to brand [839] identity as a business and sell your own [841] ability what this ends up being in [842] practice is people think H okay well [844] like warm emails are kind of similar to [845] cold emails right so why don't we do a [847] project with warm emails too H can you [848] make the system do X Y and Z on top of [850] what you normally do oh yeah great okay [852] sweet why don't we expand this right the [854] point that I'm making is it's really [855] cool and it's impressive um but selling [857] your specific project is what makes you [859] money and you don't have to Brand this [861] as like hey buy this project by this [863] product um but when you sell your [866] service essentially if you could just [867] make it as similar as possible every [869] single time um you will go a very long [872] way in in automation because now you [873] have like a templated sort of thing and [875] you can just sell the templated thing [876] and make some minor adjustments to it as [878] opposed to having to like rebuild the [879] Wheel from scratch every time the second [882] issue is not using project management [883] tools a project management tools like [885] clickup which I have screenshotted here [887] these basically force you to productize [889] just because the way that they're set up [891] I have an image here that I've attached [892] and this is just an example of how to [894] productize the launching of an instantly [896] campaign and how to convert this Broad [899] product that you're selling into a list [900] of steps um you know if you think about [902] the the project launch instantly [904] campaign um you can break this down to [906] several subtasks the first might be to [908] connect the domains to the workspace the [910] second might be to connect the mailboxes [911] to instantly the third might be to warm [913] up and configure those mailboxes [914] complete the SPF and dmark and dkim and [916] all that stuff write the campaigns right [918] these are all slightly different tasks [921] um but this is how you can turn this [922] broad service that you're providing into [924] a list of steps that you can then hand [926] off to a monkey as I was speaking about [928] earlier um you know you can then take [930] advantage of project management uh [932] platform tools like status updates [934] assignes due dates time estimates time [937] tracked this is a standard operating [938] procedure column so you could literally [940] embed steps and guides on how to do all [942] those steps inside the project [943] management system and this is what I uh [945] this is what i' consider a good quality [946] automation project management system and [948] I'm going to be making videos on how to [949] build one for yourself pretty [951] soon the last thing is saying yes to [954] projects that add Revenue now but will [956] eat up your time and fulfillment later [958] um one of uh the coolest guys in my [959] community and he he just delivered like [961] a what we call a fireside chat which is [963] almost like an interactive Workshop [965] where he runs you through his business [966] and how it works uh his name is sahil he [968] runs a great YouTube channel and [971] essentially one of his big issues when [972] he started one of the reasons why he [973] couldn't scale his business past I I [975] don't remember what the figure is maybe [976] it was 10K 15 or 20K a month was because [979] he'd accepted on these two or three [981] really big custom projects and they were [983] huge and they'd went on for three or [986] four months and sure he added Revenue [988] technically the month that he closed the [989] deal but the time and energy that he had [991] to spend managing this project over the [993] course of that time period ended up [995] eating up his ability to sell new [997] projects and so this is sort of like a [999] short-term win at the cost of long-term [1002] potential and success and as I've [1003] mentioned you need to balance these you [1005] shouldn't be all long-term you shouldn't [1006] be all short-term if you're starting out [1008] in your business definitely be more [1009] short-term than long-term if you're a [1010] little bit further on then be more [1011] long-term than short-term um but this [1013] can definitely eat up your time and this [1015] can really ruin your ability to fulfill [1016] later so be careful saying yes to [1018] project s that add Revenue now but are [1020] just so big and you have you almost have [1022] no idea where to start um especially if [1024] you've already won a couple projects [1026] especially if you already um sort of [1028] understand how automation works also [1030] scope [1031] creep now in terms of how to actually go [1033] out there and product do this is a [1035] step-by-step checklist this is basically [1036] what I recommend anytime like somebody [1038] jumps on a call with me for Consulting [1039] Services anybody asks me in my community [1042] like hey Nick how do you producti how do [1043] you do this um it's like a five or a [1045] six-step process I've written about this [1047] on my blog if you guys want to check [1048] that out but essentially the first is [1050] you need to identify your deliverables [1052] what does the customer actually see okay [1055] now uh I'm going to give you a simple [1057] example for a proposal generation system [1059] this is a system that generates a uh a [1062] pandadoc link for instance you can click [1064] on the panda do link and then you see a [1065] beautifully templated Proposal with all [1067] the right information in all the right [1069] Fields um there's a form because the [1071] customer needs to fill out the form in [1072] order to you know create that right um [1075] what else there's some emails that the [1076] customer and uh their client will get um [1079] as a result of this process so these are [1081] the deliverables okay the form the [1082] proposal and then the emails this is [1084] what the customer sees this is all that [1086] actually really matters for you because [1088] it's how the customer is going to [1089] interface with your system if you think [1091] about it the customer doesn't give a [1092]  about your make.com flow or zapier [1094] flow or your nat10 flow they don't care [1095] about the the code or the script that [1097] you've had to write in the background [1098] they don't give a crap about any of that [1100] the only thing they're going to care [1101] about is what they see so that's what [1102] we're going to prioritize by after [1105] you've identified your deliverables you [1106] list them you need to list the T TKS [1109] that go into creating every one of those [1111] deliverables so what do you and your [1113] team need to do to create those [1114] deliverables if you think about the [1116] panda do for instance well if your [1117] customer is going to see a pandadoc what [1119] goes into the pandadoc well you need to [1121] like design the pandadoc right you could [1122] I don't know maybe pick up a template [1124] and then make some minor adjustments to [1126] it or something that's fine but that is [1127] a task that you need to do so maybe the [1129] task is like identify best pandadoc [1131] template then another task is customize [1134] pandadoc template to the client right [1136] maybe the form is create or dup ate the [1139] template of the form and to create the [1141] new form maybe the next step is update [1143] all of the logos with the client logo I [1145] think you guys are getting my point but [1147] basically you break down these big [1148] umbrella deliverables into subtasks once [1151] you have these subtasks what you do is [1153] you group each of them based off of a [1155] job role so the question you're [1157] answering now is who do I need to hire [1159] to accomplish these jobs right who do I [1161] need to hire to accomplish these tasks [1164] and this is really the magic of [1165] productization because how you do this [1167] can basically make or break your ability [1169] to scale your business the number one [1170] issue that I think too many agencies do [1172] is they try and make these tasks as [1174] granular as possible and then they try [1176] and hire like 17 people to do one thing [1179] uh in reality what you should be doing [1180] is you should be hiring one person to do [1182] as many things as humanly possible and [1184] it's true that you know the more General [1185] a skill set of a person gets the less [1187] good they will typically be at any one [1189] particular thing but you have to make [1190] some compromises there for instance an [1192] example I always bring up is when I was [1194] working with um an agency three or four [1196] months ago no four or five months ago um [1198] and they were like developing websites [1200] as part of their offering and they had [1202] like a um they had a figma designer and [1204] then they had a webflow designer and [1206] then they had a copywriter and then then [1208] an account manager so there are four [1210] people basically responsible to do this [1211] one job what I did is um I I cut down [1215] like three of those roles essentially [1217] and I made the web flow designer the I [1220] basically took the figma designer and I [1222] said okay we don't need to do anything [1223] in figma we can just do it in web flow [1224] so let's just chop that then I said uh [1226] okay we don't need an account manager we [1228] could just have the web designer deliver [1229] it to the customer so chop that and I [1231] basically turned this big thing which [1232] took God knows how many steps and how [1234] many messages back and forth how many [1236] emails into two roles uh that just [1238] perform substantially more efficiently [1239] with a much higher margin so this [1241] there's some magic to this there's some [1242] thinking but basically group these tasks [1244] into job roles as best you can and try [1246] and find similar tasks and assign them [1248] to the same job roll once you've done [1251] this just calculate how much it would [1252] cost you to do each one of these tasks [1254] and each of these um and how long uh in [1257] terms of time it would take to complete [1258] each of these tasks note that you can [1260] pay these job roles hourly you can pay [1262] them via fixed price create whatever [1264] type of scheme you want maybe do two [1266] maybe do one for fixed price one for [1267] hourly just to calculate in your head [1269] how much money in time and energy it'll [1270] cost then once you have a list of each [1273] of these job roles with how much money [1274] it would take to create this project [1276] well now you have a great example of um [1278] like your internal cost your cost of [1280] goods sold to deliver right that's super [1282] straight forward you've now done [1283] something that like 90% of businesses [1284] never do and it only realistically takes [1286] you a few hours once you have this all [1289] you do is you take this and then you ask [1290] yourself how much money do I want to [1292] make like what sort of profit am I [1294] looking for do I want 80% profit well [1297] then I just multiply this by five if it [1299] costs me $1,000 to fulfill the project [1301] well then I just charge the customer [1302] $5,000 and then voila now I've made 80% [1305] cost of uh 80% margins gross this is a [1308] super simple way to just fix your costs [1310] it's also almost like a scientific way [1311] to like always be scaling your business [1313] because of how much profit you have the [1315] last thing you do is you just take all [1316] of these tasks and all of these subtasks [1318] and you just create templates in your [1319] project management tool just like I did [1321] up here when the time comes you then [1324] assign and then you just complete the [1325] project now you don't have to assign to [1327] other people uh for instance I do most [1329] of the work myself for my own automation [1330] agency I just have a virtual assistant [1332] that assists me with some minor tasks [1333] here there um so you know you could just [1335] do it yourself again if you just follow [1337] a simple step-by-step process um the [1339] benefit here is even if you're doing it [1341] yourself you can just improve the [1342] process a little bit with every step [1344] until you ultimately end up with like a [1345] totally different and better business [1348] okay the last big thing that I want to [1350] talk about and really the major mistake [1352] and is if you've noticed I've kind of [1353] gone broader I've gone from a cold email [1355] to more of like a a business development [1357] thing and now I'm going to talk about a [1358] life development thing the last big [1361] mistake that I wish I could have gone [1362] back and writed myself for is that I [1365] wasn't focusing on high Roi activities [1368] I've lost several million dollars [1369] because of this not just because of my [1371] automation agency but because of all of [1372] the time and energy that I spent on [1374] wasted low Roi activities between the [1376] ages of when I first started kind of [1378] venturing out into business maybe 20ish [1380] years old uh to now and you know I'm 28 [1383] I'm going to turn 29 in in a few months [1386] essentially in any business situation [1388] you have several options available to [1390] you it's almost like an RPG right if you [1392] guys ever played a role playing game [1393] when um you know some situation happens [1395] you have a dialogue window it's like I [1397] could pick a I could pick B I could pick [1398] C I could pick D what do I say that [1401] yields me the best [1402] result anytime you're faced with a [1405] situation in business you have the [1407] equivalent of a dialogue screen in front [1409] of you and every one of the things that [1411] you could say or do has an estimated [1414] return on investment attached to it okay [1417] to borrow from mathematics and AI [1420] specifically because we're using AI you [1421] know in our services I forgot i' use an [1423] AI example your job is as a business [1425] owner is to Hill Climb if you guys are [1428] unfamiliar with what hill climbing is [1429] check out this graph over here this is a [1432] threedimensional graph right we have an [1433] x- axis here then we have a y- AIS up [1435] here and we have a z- axis up there [1437] basically this just means that we are [1439] taking some some function you don't have [1441] to look at this uh this mathematical [1443] equation over here this basically just [1444] means this is some function this is what [1446] the function looks like if you were to [1447] graph it okay and notice how it looks [1450] it's basically flat at the ends and then [1452] in the middle it rises sharply and then [1454] it [1455] Peaks what hill climbing is is it says [1459] listen let's say you find yourself at [1461] any point on this graph let's say we [1462] find ourselves right here okay I don't [1465] know why it got smaller when I zoomed in [1466] but let's say we find ourselves right [1468] over here if I move to the right if I [1472] move back if I move to the left or if I [1474] move forward which of those four options [1477] will yield me the best result which of [1480] these options will make me go up the [1482] most I mean if you look at in this very [1484] simple contrived example it's [1485] straightforward right if you just move [1487] one unit here you're going straight up [1490] basically as as straight line as you can [1492] up to this peak now this is a a simple [1495] and somewhat contrived mathematical [1496] example but the point that I'm making is [1498] a business owner your job is to assess [1501] where you are on this landscape of [1503] possible business decisions and then [1505] it's to think okay how do I get to that [1507] Peak as quickly and effectively as [1509] possible in as few steps as possible [1511] this is basically what AI is doing when [1513] it's learning by the way which is uh [1514] pretty interesting um but anyway you do [1517] this by moving in the most positive [1520] direction so uh ever since I started [1522] thinking like this and ever since I also [1524] started implementing bottleneck thinking [1526] which I talked about in a couple [1527] previous videos [1529] um my Roi and all the decisions that I [1531] make on a day-to-day basis has shot way [1532] the hell up for instance right now I'm [1534] recording a ton of YouTube videos and [1535] the reason why I'm recording YouTube [1536] videos is because I looked at the amount [1538] of money that I made over the course of [1540] the last uh I guess what five or six [1541] months and then I looked at how much [1543] money was attributable to YouTube and [1545] then I looked at uh how many videos i' [1548] posted and then I divided the money that [1550] I'd made as well as the subscribers that [1551] I gotten by the number of videos and I [1553] said okay well on average one video [1555] gives me I don't know 350 subscribers [1558] per five months what if I were to [1560] extrapolate this over the course of the [1561] next year how much money does every [1563] video and how many subscribers every [1564] video make me this is probably the [1566] highest Roi action I can do which is [1567] which is just why I'm doing it right now [1569] just to be transparent with you so I'm [1570] attempting to move in the highest Roi [1572] Direction in my own life and as a [1573] business owner you should be trying to [1575] do this um in in yours as well the [1577] highest Roi action is rarely the most [1579] complex one what I mean by this is a lot [1583] of people because we watch tons of [1585] movies and and television and and films [1587] growing up we tend to think of these [1589] rich successful business owners as these [1592] guys in suits and ties with sunglasses [1594] on that are looking at these big [1596] spreadsheets and charts and [1597] visualizations in some busy New York [1599] finance office and we think damn those [1602] guys are smart they deal with complex [1603] stuff on a daily basis well if you want [1606] the truth um It's usually the simplest [1609] and most straightforward that you [1610] do that yields you the most money not [1612] the most complicated stuff that you do [1614] that yields you the most money I think [1616] personally that it's not IG like if you [1619] if and you know I think I talk about [1620] this in the next um uh page but I [1622] personally think that it's not if you [1624] look at all of your friends and all the [1626] people in your network and you ask [1627] yourself hm who's the most intelligent [1628] person there the most intelligent person [1631] is rarely the one that is also the [1632] richest intelligence is not the thing [1634] that you need to look for or complexity [1636] of what they do is not the thing that [1637] you need to look for to determine how to [1638] generate money um you know in our [1641] capitalistic game for instance [1642] intelligence is not the main thing that [1644] makes you win intelligence points aren't [1645] directly correlated to your net worth [1647] well I mean they're probably corated in [1648] some way but [1650] anyway so practically what this means [1652] essentially what I'm getting at is if [1654] you are under about $25,000 a month [1656] which I think most people watching this [1658] video probably are your high Roi [1660] activities are usually sales calls [1662] they're daily email management their [1665] daily DMS their daily job applications [1668] basically they're focused on driving [1670] Revenue as quickly and effectively as [1673] humanly possible and if you are focused [1676] on anything else that is not sales calls [1679] or daily email management or DMS or [1682] whatever it is a strategic error and [1685] it's usually why you're not getting [1686] anywhere as fast as a lot of the other [1688] people that you're seeing um [1692] go here are a couple of highy mistakes [1694] that I think a lot of people make and [1696] that I definitely myself uh was guilty [1698] of making when I was first starting out [1699] with this business model the first thing [1701] is I focused a lot on things that were [1704] indirectly useful but they weren't [1706] directly useful to the task of [1708] generating money of of essentially [1709] getting Revenue I spent weeks building [1712] my website months learning skills before [1716] I entered the market and realistically I [1718] spent a few years that I didn't have to [1720] trying to think about what's my Identity [1722] or or what are my core values prior [1724] actually starting my business and I [1726] understand that this is quite [1726] controversial here um and a lot of [1728] people are going to be like wellit what [1729] the hell core values your identity your [1731] skills these are all very important it's [1732] true they are but counterintuitively the [1735] fastest way to gain those skills and to [1736] learn your identity and your core values [1738] is usually just to go out there and do [1739]  and if you spend all this time [1742] thinking before you actually just go out [1743] there and do your your core values [1746] in your identity they're usually going [1747] to be wrong you're usually going to have [1748] to readjust them when you actually enter [1749] the real world so interface with the [1751] real world as much as humanly possible [1753] and if you think about your task as an [1754] automation agency owner well if you're [1756] not making money it's it's a hobby it's [1757] not a business if you want it to be a [1758] business you need to go out there and [1759] make money and if you want to make money [1761] identify the things that are highest Roi [1763] to you and and just do them [1765] relentlessly the second issue is not [1767] spending your time on the things that [1769] are most important to you so if growing [1770] your revenue is important and you have [1772] let's say six hours a day to work I [1774] don't know you're juggling you know I [1775] know a lot of people that are watching [1776] these videos they're not in my position [1778] which is quite blessed where I am you [1780] know I basically have all of my day [1781] available to work I don't have any [1783] dependence I don't have super strenuous [1785] relationships I don't have people that [1787] are that are well I have people that are [1788] counting on me but I don't have anywhere [1790] near the sort of like daily obligation [1792] to do things as other people which is [1794] why I can work as much as I as I want to [1796] but let's hypothetically say you don't [1797] have all day like me uh you have six [1799] hours per day to work well if you spend [1801] four of those hours doing non-revenue [1802] related activities if you spend that [1804] time doing I don't know bookkeeping or [1806] if you spend that time on the phone with [1808] current clients but you're not actually [1809] like selling them or upselling them or [1810] moving the needle forward you will not [1812] grow effectively and so you need to [1814] count the number of hours that you're [1815] spending in a day on task count how [1817] productive and the output that you're [1818] producing and just ask yourself how can [1820] I reallocate those towards things that [1822] are driving the needle and I'll give you [1823] some examples in a [1824] moment the last thing is not committing [1826] to small daily activities so many things [1830] in business and this is a really [1831] interesting thing that I I just came [1833] across earlier but many things in [1835] business do not scale proportionately to [1837] the effort that you put in they Scale [1839] permissively based on whether you showed [1841] up that day what I mean by this and [1844] YouTube is a great [1845] example I could sit down and I could [1848] record 30 videos today and if I post all [1850] 30 videos today I'm only going to grow a [1853] little bit but if I recorded one video [1856] every day and then I posted every video [1857] for the next 30 days I'd grow a little [1859] bit on one day a little bit the next day [1861] a little bit the next day and I'd [1862] continue going this is a permissive [1864] relationship it's not like a scaling [1866] relationship it's not proportional there [1868] are so many things in business and in [1870] life where you just need to show up [1871] every day and if you just show up every [1873] day and you just do a little bit every [1874] day um because it's a marathon and not a [1876] Sprint you'll go so much farther cold [1879] emails for instance if you show up just [1881] a little bit every day just 10 minutes [1882] every day of checking your your email [1884] inbox and responding to things as they [1885] come in and that sort of deal you're [1887] going to go a lot farther than if you [1888] spend seven hours staring at an empty [1889] inbox right um daily job applications if [1893] you're hunting for a job like a 9 to-5 [1894] or something like that or a corporate [1895] position you're going to go way further [1897] if you just clock in a little bit every [1899] day than if you just sit down for five [1901] hours and try doing a bunch of apps this [1904] is basically like [1906] directly counterintuitive uh to what [1909] most of us did in school which is we [1910] like you know waited until the last [1911] second cram for the exam did 14 hours of [1913] work and then handed in a 90% or [1915] whatever okay 90% if you're lucky let's [1918] be real but um I guess teachers were [1921] trying to tell you not to do this by the [1923] way that's pretty [1924] funny that's really funny I definitely [1926] did not um take their advice I would [1928] cram the very last second maybe school [1931] isn't exactly the perfect example but [1932] the point that I'm making is just so [1934] many things in life require you to show [1935] up and do a little bit today like the [1937] gym for instance you could work out like [1938] 15 hours one day that's not going to do [1940]  for you you need to work out like [1941] an hour hour and a half maybe three four [1943] days a week and you need to stretch that [1944] out over the course of a year to see [1946] really good results so uh identify the [1948] things that scale proportionately versus [1950] permissively and focus on the things or [1951] at least for the things that scill [1953] permissively just focus on showing up [1954] every day okay so here's some tips that [1957] I wish I could transport back in time [1959] and give to my younger self um I'm going [1961] to call them hill climbing tips because [1963] again that's basically what we're doing [1964] and I want us to frame our minds in the [1965] in the in the context of like okay like [1967] what direction do I need to move in [1969] order to go as far up as humanly [1971] possible I have a little simple exercise [1973] that I want us to do together the first [1975] is um we're going to list well we're [1978] going to list five things that you can [1979] do right now to make more money for each [1981] of these things we're going to write [1982] down the complexity of this task the [1985] estimated percent success rate of this [1987] task and then the estimated impact of [1989] this task in dollar terms we're then [1991] going to divide all these out with a [1992] formula that I'll show you in a second [1994] the reason why I'm doing this is because [1996] this is a tool to help us think um we're [1998] going to use this tool let me just um go [2001] to a different tab here we're going to [2003] use this tool to demonstrate what I mean [2006] by hill climbing and then ultimately to [2009] um help us prioritize our day a little [2011] bit more [2011] effectively so this is a little [2013] spreadsheet template that I have and you [2014] guys can feel free to copy this if you [2016] need but essentially on the left hand [2017] column here we have a bunch of actions [2019] we have set up cold email campaign send [2020] offer to email list set up upwork [2022] profile start posting in communities [2023] whatever then we have a complexity and [2026] I'm just rating that at 1 to five so 2 4 [2028] 3 3 then we have an estimated success [2030] rate of 80% 50% 80% 50% then we have an [2034] estimated impact and I uh I meant to do [2036] this in terms of dollar terms so I guess [2039] I actually need to go back to this tab [2043] here then I need to change this so that [2045] this is a dollar [2048] sign um okay great so uh this is what [2051] our spreadsheet looks like and basically [2053] what I've done is I've taken this [2055] formula here success times impact [2057] divided by complexity and the numbers [2059] here aren't important this is just like [2060] a thinking tool just a way for you to [2061] think about things like um you know what [2064] what should I do today well what has the [2065] highest likelihood of success what has [2067] the highest impact then what's the least [2069] complex thing that I could do and if you [2071] just ask yourself that question every [2072] day you're going to go a lot farther [2073] than somebody that doesn't because [2074] you're going to be constantly optimizing [2076] where you are on that hill so uh the [2079] setup cold email camp in terms of [2080] complexity is pretty straightforward you [2081] can just follow a step-by-step guide I'm [2083] going to call that a two the estimated [2084] success probability of this might be 80% [2087] I don't really think that there's really [2088] a way you could screw up setting up a [2089] cold email campaign because you could [2091] just follow a step-by-step guide I might [2093] be wrong this is an estimated success [2095] percentage rate this isn't the actual [2097] 100% success rate uh if I were to send a [2100] th emails a day over the course of the [2101] next year let's say um and let's just [2104] call this estimated yearly [2107] impact um how much money do I think I [2109] could make well I think I could make [2111] $300,000 okay well the priority there [2114] now is I don't know 120,000 the number [2116] isn't super important as see in a sec [2118] what about send an offer to my email [2119] list well I think the complexity of this [2120] is a little bit higher because I need to [2122] rate this offer and that's a little bit [2123] tougher what's the estimated success [2125] rate well if I rate this offer I don't [2127] know I mean like there are a lot of [2128] variables here I'm not very confident in [2129] my ability to do so what sort of yearly [2131] impact do I think I could do if I send [2133] this offer well I think if I send this [2135] offer right now maybe I can make [2137] $50,000 H setting up my upward profile [2139] I'm going to give that a three I'll say [2140] there's an 80% chance I'm going to do [2142] this right I'm going to say the [2143] estimated yearly impact on this is [2145] $250,000 posting in communities I'm [2147] going to call it a three I'm going to [2148] say it's a 50% chance and I'm going to [2150] say the estimated yearly impact of [2151] posting in communities is uh I don't [2153] know $300,000 as well all you do then is [2156] you take this priority test [2158] and you just sort it based off the [2159] biggest thing so the biggest thing here [2161] that I've estimated is this priority um [2164] to set up a cold email campaign for [2165] instance the second is to set up my [2167] upper profile the third is to start [2168] posting in my communities and the last [2170] is to send the offer to my email list [2172] this is a very simple and somewhat [2173] contrived example you don't have to take [2175] it literally it's just a thinking tool [2177] but the point that I'm making is you [2178] could structure your thinking in such a [2180] way where basically at every point in [2182] time you're just asking yourself really [2183] quickly okay is this the complex thing [2186] is this the thing that has the highest [2187] likelihood impact is this the thing that [2189] has the highest estimated success chance [2192] as long as you're asking yourself these [2193] things um you'll constantly be moving in [2195] a much higher Roi Direction than [2197] otherwise my other tip for hill climbing [2200] is that making money is a lot simpler [2201] than most people think and I it's taken [2204] me a while to realize this myself but [2206] essentially it's not the most [2208] intelligent person that you know that [2210] makes the most money it's instead almost [2212] certainly the most committed person you [2213] know like sit down and ask yourself [2216] right now pause the video and try and [2217] figure out of the five closest people to [2220] you for instance who's the most [2221] intelligent and then maybe who's the [2222] most financially successful maybe [2224] broaden that a little maybe your whole [2225] family maybe your cousins your second [2227] cousins that sort of thing I'll [2229] guarantee you that it's not the person [2230] that's the smartest in terms of IQ or [2232] how they did on their SATs it's the [2234] person that is the most committed the [2235] person that is willing and capable and [2237] does show up every day to do the stuff [2239] that needs doing so if you think about [2241] it if making money is a lot simpler than [2242] most people think and then most people [2244] also just spend all their time learning [2246] tasks and like learning things and and [2248] not actually going out and doing the [2249] things one of your highest Roi actions [2251] as a business owner is probably just [2253] becoming a more committed person if [2255] you're not you can work on it there are [2257] a variety of ways to improve your [2258] ability to form habits um your ability [2260] to set and Achieve successful goals and [2263] that sort of thing but yeah that's [2265] that's my those are my two hill climbing [2266] tips I'm essentially becoming a more [2268] committed person is probably usually the [2270] higher Roi task for most you so focus on [2272] becoming more committed focus on [2274] restructuring your thinking to think in [2276] terms of high Roi as supposed to just [2278] like I have to do all this stuff today [2280] um and then spend time on things that [2282] are important to you all right those are [2285] my three common mistakes that I wish I [2288] could go back in time and avoid in my [2290] automation agency I hope you guys like [2292] this video I had a lot of fun putting it [2293] together my closing thoughts here are [2295] just to start cold emails early start [2297] productizing as soon as you get a couple [2298] of customers because that's all you need [2299] in order to figure out whether or not [2300] this business model is validated and it [2302] works for you and then anchor your [2304] thinking in terms of Roi I had so much [2306] fun talking about this as always uh if [2308] you guys have any comments or questions [2310] feel free to leave them down below and [2311] I'll get back to you otherwise please [2313] like subscribe do all that fun YouTube [2314] stuff and I'll catch you in the next [2316] video thanks

Title: The Definitive Guide to Map() in Make.com
[0] hello everybody and welcome to the most [1] comprehensive tutorial on mapping inm [3] make.com available on the internet over [5] the course of the next few minutes [6] you're going to learn everything you [8] need to know about mapping to get out [10] there and start crushing your own [11] scenarios I'm going to cover edge cases [13] I'll cover a little bit of the theory [14] behind it and essentially this is just [16] going to be the end all Beall the only [17] video you have to watch in order to [19] understand this concept [21] [Music] [22] fully first things first there are only [24] two things that you need to know about [26] the map function in make.com before we [28] dive into the scenario [30] the first is a very simple pneumonic [33] that I use anytime that I am mapping the [36] pneumonic goes like this from a I need B [40] where C is equal to D I understand that [43] if you're not familiar with the map [45] function or really pneumonics in general [47] this may seem like uh pointless to you [49] but I assure you if you just memorize [51] this one sentence mapping gets [53] extraordinarily easy as I will drill [55] into your head over the course of the [56] next 15 or 20 minutes the second thing [60] is that mapping only works on arrays it [62] does not work on other data types one of [64] the most common questions that I get in [65] my make.com community is hey why is this [67] map function not working and I [69] inevitably will see that it is being [71] used on a collection or maybe an object [73] or just some data type that is not an [75] array so mapping is an array function an [78] incredibly potent and Powerful array [80] function at that but it is an array [82] function it's not a collection function [83] it's not you know an object function it [85] only works on arrays as long as you have [89] these two things in mind and I will be [92] running through the first one again and [93] again and again over the course of the [94] next five scenarios you will be fine and [97] you will understand mapping okay so [98] let's actually get into building this [100] out in real scenarios I have a map [103] playground set up over here with five [105] different modules and each of these five [107] modules are going to be basically like a [109] test uh what we're going to do is we're [111] going to solve all of these tests all of [112] these tasks with mapping and I'll show [115] you just how easy mapping makes all of [117] this makes it extraordinarily [118] straightforward now I've set these up [120] here instead of just put them in five [121] different scenarios for Simplicity my [123] goal is I will make this available to [125] you as a blueprint later on and then you [127] can just go to the video description and [128] then download this blueprint if you want [130] to play around with this if you want to [131] redo some of these examples here just [132] for your own learning feel free um the [135] purpose of this is for you to know [136] everything you need to know about [137] mapping okay so what are these parse [139] adjacent modules well I'm not going to [141] get super far into that because it's [142] beyond the scope of this discussion but [143] essentially this is just a quick and [144] easy way for us to generate data [147] structures with arrays in them so what [148] I'm going to do is I'm going to link all [150] of the rest of these array array items [152] and then I'm just going to focus on this [153] one which is our first test or our first [156] task uh which is subscriptions with [158] status equal pending and let me show you [160] what I mean by that if I right click and [162] then press run module and then I zoom in [165] here to the data structure that's output [167] you'll see that this is an array and [169] this array contains five collections or [172] five items in the array there's item one [175] item two item three item four and item [178] five and in inside of every item we have [180] an email address then we have a [183] subscription status then we have a full [185] name and then that's our item we have [188] three keys essentially with three values [191] now hypothetically let's say instead of [193] five items because I just did five items [195] as an example um this array had 500 [198] items and we wanted to select the item [201] inside of this array specifically wanted [204] to extract the email address for the [206] item that had a subscription status [208] equal to pending Maybe we building a big [210] email blast for a client or something [212] like that and we need to only be sending [214] these to people with subscription status [216] pending and for whatever reason we don't [218] have access to this data right now we're [220] getting it in make we can just very [221] quickly run very simple and [223] straightforward map operation that makes [224] use of our nemonic to get it the reason [226] why mapping is so powerful is it's not [228] necessarily powerful when you have five [230] items like this because you could see [232] who is subscription status pending it's [234] this good fell Bob Marley here really [235] isn't paying his [237] bills but if you have an with 500 items [241] it takes you the exact same amount of [242] work to solve this problem for an array [244] with five items versus an array with 500 [246] versus an array with 50,000 versus an [247] array with 5 million you only have to [249] write the string of code or [251] make.com um you know no code logic [254] basically once and then it just solves [256] that problem for you forever and it also [259] just allows you to do things in flows [261] that otherwise might have taken you 20 [263] or 30 different modules to do or um just [266] takes away the makes your your flows a [268] lot more flexible like you know we could [270] theoretically Index this array and only [272] get the third result right but that [274] would require us knowing in advance that [276] Bob Marley has a subscription status of [278] pending and is the third result what if [280] we add somebody new to this array well [281] now we got to basically go back in time [283] do all this over again and so mapping [285] just allows you to eliminate that and [286] just be so much faster um and it's [288] something that I do on a daily basis to [291] solve problems that people mention in my [292] community and uh and and more [294] specifically my clients so let's [296] actually give this a go and let's [297] actually see how we would map this in [299] practice I'm just going to move this up [301] here because it's going to make our [301] lives a little bit easier in a moment [303] and then I'm going to use a tool module [305] called set variable I'm going to drag [307] that up here connect it and I'm just [309] going to call this our tester our tester [312] is going to be where we're going to put [313] in all the the mapping Logic the [316] variable name for tester uh I'm just [318] going to call this well let's actually [319] think about our problem statement here [321] our problem is that we want to extract [323] email addresses with subscription status [325] equal to pending so why don't I just [327] call this pending [328] emails I'm using camel case that is just [331] where every word after the first is [333] capitalized with the first letter but [335] the first isn't guess that's why it kind [337] of looks like a camel because the [338] camel's head is down here and then the [339] bump is is up there and this is just [341] like a naming convention you could you [343] know put an underscore if you wanted or [344] whatever I just personally do this [345] because I used to do software [347] development and I was just a big a big [348] into JavaScript which typically uses [350] camel case anyway let's actually go into [352] this variable value and let's run [354] through our mapping function so in order [356] to um instantiate the map function I [358] just type map and then a little left [359] bracket and it'll automatically pull it [361] from the array value you can also go [363] back to this array function list and [364] then you could specifically select map [366] it'll um add that little semicolon for [368] you and then add that right bracket I'm [369] just going to do it faster because I [371] think it's faster like this and keep in [373] mind you can do this for any function in [374] make.com if it's a function the second [377] that you put this little left bracket [378] after the over verbiage it will um it [379] will pop up in this little gray box if [381] you try and do this with like um [383] keywords like empty array wouldn't work [385] which is why if you wrap them in two [387] curly brackets each on the left side the [389] left cly bracket the right side the [390] right cly bracket you can also make that [392] variable pop up but uh if you don't do [393] that the variable is not going to pop up [395] what I'm talking about right now only [396] applies to two functions so anyway um [399] for map specifically remember earlier we [401] had that neonic right and that was from [403] a I want B where C is equal to D well [407] let me show you how simple it is to [409] extract the data that we want from this [411] in one [413] second the way that mapping works is [415] from a a is the array [420] everything after the array you need to [421] just write out in text not as a variable [425] so from a I want B okay I want [431] email where subscription [434] status is equal to [437] pending that's our map function this [440] piece of logic essentially does exactly [442] what I just wanted it to a moment ago [445] and this piece of logic is capable of [447] basically going out and getting hundreds [449] of thousands of pending records and [451] filtering through thousands and [452] thousands and thousands of different [454] email addresses if we needed to now in [456] our case we only needed five and you see [457] it found the email address Bob Marley a [460] fly on my microphone interestingly [461] enough Bob Marley example.net but this [464] works for literally anything this works [466] for any um arbitrary length of array um [469] and it also works for any other value [471] that we want you know how earlier we [473] said email what if instead of the email [475] we just wanted the full [478] name if you just write full name instead [480] of email if you just replace the b in [482] our neonic with full name and you run [485] this again you see that now instead of [487] it's saying um Bob Marley at example.net [489] it says Bob Marley's full name so we can [491] change the values that we want to [493] extract and we can also change the [496] criteria of the variables that we are [498] looking to to pull so maybe instead of [500] pending what if we want active I'm just [502] going to replace that with active plus [503] run run once well voila now we have [505] three because there were three entries [507] with subscription status set to active [509] Dondo Alice wonder and Xavier the great [512] so hopefully this seems pretty [513] straightforward and the purpose of this [515] is to make this seem as unintimidating [516] to you as possible as we slowly ramp up [518] the complexity in mapping but at least [521] at the initial example as long as you [523] use that pneumonic from a I want B where [526] C is equal to D um you can just repeat [528] that back and uh back and forth and back [531] and forth in your head and rock yourself [533] forward while hugging a pillow in a [534] straight jacket uh and you know [536] eventually you'll figure out how mapping [538] Works God damn my dad jokes are out of [540] control um anyway so that's [543] subscriptions with status equal pending [545] that's our very first example now why [547] don't we put this away stick that in the [548] corner where it belongs then we're going [550] to go grab emails by user location [552] equals Morocco I'm sure you guys can [554] kind of guess what this is going to be [556] doing this is going to be doing um a [558] relatively similar example it's just [559] instead of getting um emails with [561] subscription status equal to pending [563] we're going to be grabbing emails by the [564] user location let's actually run this [566] and let's see what pops [568] up so if I go to the output which is the [570] important part here and I zoom in you'll [572] see that this is an array with five [573] objects again except these objects look [575] a little bit different previously we had [577] first name uh full name and then we had [579] email and then we had subscription [580] status I think now we have first name [582] last name email City and [584] Country and we do this again for all [586] five objects and I think that the name [589] of the module makes it pretty [591] self-explanatory but hypothetically [592] let's just say our project for the day [594] was we needed to pull out all of the [596] email addresses with country equal to to [599] Morocco that's what we need maybe again [602] we're sending an email campaign or [604] something like that or we're filtering [605] out to do something maybe specific to [607] people that live in Morocco how exactly [610] excuse me would we go about doing that [611] in make.com using mapping well it is the [615] exact same thing all we have to do is [619] use our mapping formula which is [621] map and then from [624] array I want [627] email where country oops sorry I clicked [631] on it this time I shouldn't have just [633] going to write country is equal to [636] Morocco and now I'm going to run this [639] whole flow and let's see what our result [642] is now I didn't change the title here [644] it's still say pending emails but I [645] think you guys still get my point we [647] have Jane example.com and FMA [649] example. fun fact that I learned a few [651] minutes ago ma is just the Morocco um [654] top level domain name so that's pretty [656] neat like in Canada here um the great w [658] North we have uh uhca and I guess they [663] have Ma I wonder why more people in the [665] United States don't use the US domain [668] name just because they have to dominate [670] everything anyway so yeah that's that um [673] let's hypothetically say instead of uh [677] countries Morocco we want cities and we [680] want the city to be equal to New York [682] well all I do is I grab the city and [685] then I believe it was just new space [687] York so I'm going to give that a try [690] press okay and then let's press run once [691] let's see what happens yeah we got John [694] at example.com because John lives in New [696] York as per this data structure if [699] you're wondering what this is this is [700] just the um string that I had to feed [702] this module in order to generate this [703] example for us it's not hyper relevant [706] to us this is the more relevant portion [707] down here but let's just look for John [709] yeah there you go we got a John Doe over [710] here with the city of New York we could [712] do the same thing for first names we [714] could do same thing for last names we [715] could do the same thing for example uh [716] emails um and if you know you're [718] wondering which is which is my logical [720] question at this point hm why are you [721] only pulling out the emails why are you [723] pulling out the first name and the last [724] name well I'll show you a quick little [726] trick that you could use um in a [728] subsequent example where you can [729] actually pull out multiple um you pull [731] out each of them individually and then [732] you just stick multiple of them back [734] together using the multiple variables [736] module so that's our second example [739] which is again quite straightforward no [740] magic here as you see as long as you [742] have that neonic down you will [744] understand mapping um what I'm going to [746] do is I'm going to unlink the second [750] example stick this over here unlink this [753] and then voila we're now looking at a [755] third example and the purpose of this [758] third example is to slowly ramp up the [759] complexity a little bit and show you how [761] this might look like if you instead of [763] just trying to get one item so instead [764] of just trying to get let's say like [766] email addresses you're trying to get um [767] a few simultaneously uh from an array [770] instead let me show you what I mean well [772] if I right click this and plus run [773] module once minimize this big input [776] array and then if I zoom into this data [779] you'll see that our input array now [781] looks like this we have a first name [784] then we have a last name then we have an [786] email then we have a type and then we [788] have an array full of Interest hiking [790] photography and cooking now [792] hypothetically let's say you had sort of [794] like a data example and you were [796] interested in finding the interests of [798] people that have high ticket sales types [801] so maybe this is a list of customers in [804] your database you for some reason [806] tracked interests and you're looking to [808] grab the interests of people that only [809] have the type High ticket you're not [812] interested in people with like Emma here [814] who's low ticket who cares about Emma [816] you only want people like Olivia and Tom [819] and and Sarah who are high ticket and [821] our goal is to basically get this big [823] list of interests of people um that have [825] that type equals High ticket so how [828] would you actually go about doing this [829] well it's really not any more difficult [831] or different from what we've done so far [833] let's just call this variable user [836] interests let me zoom in here and show [839] you how you do this in practice so this [840] is our array structure here on the right [842] right well you just do the same thing [844] you map from [847] array I want uh [850] interests sorry I'm just adding a space [852] here because I have a little keyboard [853] macro that automatically adds a bunch of [855] text now if you're wondering where I get [858] this string interest from I mean you [860] know why would I put interest here if [862] this interest has like these two little [863] left or right brackets the way to know [865] what the variable name is to reference [867] in mapping is you just Mouse over the [869] little purple um variable picker and [872] then you look in that little popup as [874] you see it says interests and then [875] there's little array um thing [877] immediately to the right of it and then [878] underneath it says raw and then it says [880] interest well that raw section that is [882] the raw text that refers to that [885] variable and that's what you put in here [887] but anyway I'm getting ahead of myself [888] let's go back and do our pneumonic from [891] array I want interests where type is [895] equal to high ticket [899] that's that quite [901] straightforward let's give this a run [902] and see what [904] happens all right so we have a user [907] interest array and as'll see we've [909] pulled out three different sub arrays [912] and each of these arrays has hiking [913] photography cooking gaming technology [915] entrepreneurship Fashion Beauty travel [918] these are our lists of interests for [920] everybody that had a type High ticket [922] now I'm going to throw something else in [924] here that I didn't talk about in the [926] video description but map isn't the only [929] valuable array function there are a [930] variety of valuable array functions and [932] one very valuable one that I find myself [935] using every now and then is called [936] flatten and so if you look at this array [938] structure here we basically have three [940] arrays all embedded inside of another [943] array called user interests well if we [945] flatten these arrays if we flatten the [947] the top array what we're basically going [948] to be doing is we're just going to be [949] pulling all of these array objects out [951] into one master array and maybe that's [954] valuable because you just want to I [955] don't know pump this out into an email [956] to send to somebody for tracking [958] purposes or D or something I don't know [960] but if we feed this into another array [962] function called flatten we give that [963] another [964] run we'll see that now we just have a [966] list of nine um user interests so there [969] going to be some edge cases where stuff [970] like this is required for you um other [972] edge cases where it's not really um but [975] flatten and map you know I use these [977] reasonably often in my own life um along [979] with uh just running through here I use [981] reverse every now and then um I use [983] slice um I'll do D duplicate pretty [986] often sometimes I'll use first and last [989] um um that's that's about it off the top [991] of my head but okay great that's example [994] number three and as you can see these [995] are slowly increasing in complexity in [997] terms of the data that we're trying to [998] grab what I'm going to do now is I'm [1001] going to jump up a complexity quite a [1002] bit and we're going to Target a more [1004] challenging example and this example is [1007] going to be grabbing emails by roll [1009] permissions and the reason why this is [1010] going to be a more complicated example [1012] is because this is going to require us [1013] to do to use nesting um keys and values [1018] we're essentially going have to index [1019] things if you're curious what that means [1022] let's just give this model a run let's [1024] zoom in and let's see what the data [1026] structure looks like so as the title [1028] here probably suggests we're looking for [1030] emails and we're looking to get specific [1032] emails that have a role permission that [1034] is not um read basically they're not [1036] allowed to read what does this mean in [1038] practice well we have a first name then [1041] a last name then an email then a roll [1043] and then down here we have a collection [1045] of permissions read false write true [1048] delete true this is Sophia Rossi who has [1051] permissions read true WR true delete [1053] false this is Jacob Nakamura which has [1056] read true WR false delete false and this [1059] is so low I can't even [1062] scroll um Olivia Sanchez and Benjamin [1066] Anderson all right so essentially what [1067] we're looking to do is we're just [1069] looking to pull let's just say the email [1070] address of somebody whose permission is [1073] equal to false essentially who's not [1075] true and I think there's only one person [1076] in this list so we're probably going to [1078] be pulling we're looking for Liam again [1080] if you imagine this was a list or an [1081] array with 5,000 entries this might be a [1083] little bit more valuable to you off the [1084] top of your head but uh I just want to [1086] show you guys in a way that where I can [1087] actually run through all of these [1088] elements make things very interpretable [1090] for you the question here and the big [1093] thing that's different from our previous [1094] example is notice how instead of us just [1096] looking for an object or instead of us [1098] just looking for a key and a value pair [1100] this is actually nested we have another [1101] collection called permissions and inside [1103] of permissions we have read false so we [1105] basically have to go one level deeper [1107] that's okay and this normally trips up a [1109] lot of people but I'll show you again a [1111] very simple and easy way that you never [1113] have to be tripped up by this again so [1115] what I'm going to be looking for is I'll [1116] be um I'll just saying false [1119] read false read emails let's just do [1122] that and then let me make some space [1124] here and then zoom in so we could see [1126] exactly what's going on with this array [1128] object uh array object that's funny um [1131] exactly what's going on with this array [1133] so you see it's array first name last [1135] name email roll permissions read write [1137] delete so what we want is we want [1141] entries where read is set to false and [1143] the data I'm going to be pulling out is [1144] going to be the email so I want emails [1146] where that is set to false no problem [1149] let's just use our pneumonic we're going [1150] to map from [1153] array and then what we want to pull is I [1156] want uh from array I want emails so I'm [1158] going to go [1159] email and then yeah sorry that's my [1161] little thing here that instantly pops up [1164] my um my email address nicklis drive at [1166] gmail.com don't send me nicely written [1169] letters uh so from a I want B where C is [1175] equal to d right so where read is equal [1179] to D the question is how do we actually [1181] get read well it's really simple in [1183] make.com the way that things work is if [1186] you have a collection you're trying to [1188] get an OB um a a key within the [1190] collection you just have to write the [1192] parent key dot the child key so I would [1198] in this case write [1200] permissions. read the way that I know [1203] this is I moused over permissions I saw [1204] the raw it said permissions and then I [1206] moused over read I saw the rod said [1208] read so from array I want email where [1213] permissions. read are equal to and what [1216] are we looking for we're looking for [1217] false so I'm just going to type false in [1220] there and now let's give that a run [1222] let's see what [1224] happens and as you see we pulled out [1226] Liam and example.com and if you guys [1228] remember Le was the only one who had the [1230] read set to false in that case but we [1234] could try something different maybe [1236] instead of permissions. read is false [1237] maybe we want permissions. read is true [1240] how about that let's give that a try [1242] what do you guys expect is going to [1244] happen here well we're probably going to [1246] pull four people out right and we did [1249] Sophia Jacob Olivia Benjamin of the five [1251] these four had reads set to true but why [1254] don't we try looking for another thing [1256] that we could do maybe instead of [1257] permissions. read we want permissions. [1259] delete right so why don't we try that [1262] let's go permissions. delete and we want [1265] permissions. delete is equal to true so [1267] let's give that a [1268] run so you see here we got one because [1270] it was only Liam whose permissions. [1272] delete was set to [1274] true now let me do uh something else I'm [1277] going to write and um make this an even [1280] more complex more contrived example [1282] because I want to show you guys how deep [1283] we can go here what if there was a [1285] second permissions object and inside of [1289] second permissions you had x equal to [1293] true I [1295] think I believe that'll be right if not [1298] I am dumb let's give this a [1303] run okay awesome so now we have two [1305] objects and what I have to do in order [1307] to make this example actually relevant [1309] is I just have to go through each of [1310] these then I have to write the second [1312] permissions X is equal to True X is [1315] equal to True X is equal to true and [1318] then X is equal to true and let's make [1320] this one false and let's make that one [1322] false let's just give this a run [1324] here okay great I think everything was [1327] fine here looks like it so now [1331] hypothetically let's try and Nest one [1333] level deeper let's say here inside of [1336] permissions and then second permissions [1338] what we're looking for is we only want [1339] to pull the emails of Records where [1342] permissions do second permissions dox is [1344] equal to false probably seems like a [1346] mouthful right but it's okay as long as [1347] we follow the same structure that we had [1349] before will be fine let's zoom in on our [1353] array structure here and then let's use [1355] our pneumonic so from array I want [1363] email where permissions let's just Mouse [1367] over this make sure that raw is [1369] permissions yes it is and then second [1371] permissions dot second [1374] permissions let's see what this is this [1376] is just X so dox is equal to false let's [1380] give this a [1382] run as you see we got two records and if [1384] you remember three of those were true [1386] that I just quickly created and two of [1387] those were false these were the two that [1389] were false so as you can see we can go [1391] arbitrarily deep into extraordinarily [1392] nested structures very very easily [1395] simply by keeping in mind um dot [1397] indexing where basically we have the [1399] parent key dot the child key dot that [1402] child's key do that child's key all the [1404] way until you get what you're finally [1405] looking for and you can go arbitrarily [1407] deep doesn't really matter matter but [1409] all right that is our fourth example why [1411] don't we go to our fifth example and [1413] I'll show you how this structure that [1416] I'm doing can [1417] work if you wanted to pull out multiple [1420] Keys instead of just one [1421] key and if you wanted to make use of [1425] what I just talked about in my previous [1426] video if you guys have another chance to [1427] check it out um iterators and [1429] aggregators which sort of adds another [1430] level of complexity to this whole thing [1433] but all right in this case we have [1434] product sold in the last month let's [1435] right click Prest one this module only [1437] let's look at the the array what do we [1439] have here we have an array with items [1442] called pro-001 name wireless headphones [1445] category Electronics price in stock true [1447] sales info sold in last month true [1449] number of sold last sale this is sort of [1451] the structure of this you can imagine [1452] this is like some e-commerce store now [1454] what we're looking to do is we're [1456] looking to grab all the products that [1457] are sold in the last month but we don't [1460] just want to pull one thing like before [1461] you know we were just pulling the email [1463] we're just pulling the ID we actually [1464] want to pull two things so I want to [1465] pull the [1466] pro-2 and I also excuse me I also want [1471] to pull the price so I want to do two [1473] things not just one so how exactly would [1475] you do that with mapping well [1477] fortunately mapping only allows you to [1478] pull one thing right doesn't work you [1480] can't just I don't know you can't type [1482] in two things here you know I wish you [1484] could that' make my life a lot easier [1486] but uh you can't you know from array I [1489] want to pull ID and name where um I [1492] don't know sales [1494] info. sold in last month is equal to [1497] true like how great would it be if you [1499] could just click run once and then this [1501] would output everything you need well it [1503] doesn't so what you have to do instead [1505] is you have to do a workaround where [1507] instead of setting one variable you're [1508] actually setting multiple and then you [1510] aggregate them all together into the [1512] target object that you're looking for [1514] does that sound like French to you um [1517] great French is a beautiful language I'm [1519] I'm thankful no uh no problem we're [1522] going to solve this I'm going to go to [1523] tools instead of set a variable I'm [1525] going to set multiple variables okay and [1527] what I'm going to do is my very first [1529] variable name is going to be ID then my [1532] second variable name is going to be uh [1535] price for the first variable I'm going [1537] to map this array so from this array I [1541] want the ID [1544] where sales info. soldin last month is [1549] set to True okay now if I just give this [1553] a [1555] run what happened here well all ID array [1559] is filled with three entries product 1 [1560] three and five just because those are [1561] the ones that happen to correspond to [1563] the logic that I put out the price is [1565] empty because I didn't fill it in but [1566] notice how essentially we're going to be [1567] getting an array so what if we got an [1570] array of IDs and then an array of prices [1571] how would we combine them well I'll show [1573] you very very Nifty little [1575] trick let's do the same thing for price [1577] now and now that we know our neonic this [1579] is going to be super straightforward [1581] we're looking from array to grab the [1584] price where sales info do sold in last [1587] month is is set to True it'll be the [1590] exact same logic as this I'm going to [1592] click okay give this a [1594] run then I'm going to look at what's in [1597] here we have product o 179.99 product O3 [1600] 39.99 product o5$ 12.99 and now let's [1604] say I need to have both of this data I [1606] need to combine them somehow all right [1607] so unfortunately I had a call that I had [1608] to deal with and it has uh taken me a [1610] little bit longer than I expected [1612] however let me walk you through what the [1614] logic to actually get this done looks [1615] like and then you can actually just copy [1617] the um little snippet of code [1619] essentially and then just reuse it [1621] anytime that you want to create uh the [1623] same sort of structure that I've done so [1625] we have the product sold in the last [1626] month over here uh if I run this you see [1629] that we generate the array that we [1632] talked about before right with sales [1633] info sold and last month all that stuff [1635] and then basically what we're doing is [1636] with a set multiple variables module we [1638] have variable names so IDs and prices so [1640] now we're we're deconstructing or we're [1643] mapping two separate arrays now with one [1645] item in each but those two items [1647] correspond to each other line item by [1648] line item we are then feeding in one of [1651] these into an iterator now the cool part [1653] about feeding something into an iterator [1654] is that when you feed it into an [1655] iterator you get what's called a if I [1658] run this you'll [1660] see you get the bundle order position so [1663] one two and three and this bundle order [1667] position is going to allow us to track [1669] which element in the array of the other [1671] array we can use to index the specific [1674] item um so again this is some pretty [1676] advanced stuff you don't need to know [1677] how to do in order to do most of what [1679] you can do in make.com but I figur that [1681] I'd show you guys next up we use what's [1684] called a text aggregator the way that a [1686] text aggregator works if you've watched [1687] my previous video it should be [1688] reasonably straightforward but um you [1690] are just aggreg you are going through [1692] every item in the array and then you are [1695] sticking them all together in text so [1698] what I've done is I've created my own [1699] JavaScript object notation JavaScript [1701] object notation is just a left curly [1703] brace then quotes around whatever the [1705] value variable name is so this is the [1707] key right so just like we had um ID here [1710] um this is the exact same thing so ID [1713] and then colon and then uh oops I just [1716] moved some quotes around can't move [1718] quotes around and then uh we got quotes [1721] and then I'm P I'm pulling in the value [1723] from the iterator so p-001 p-003 prod [1727] -005 and then for Price what I'm doing [1729] is I'm putting in this price value but [1733] then I'm actually um indexing it by the [1736] bundle order position now I think this [1738] is a glitch or something this should say [1739] one it says [1741] pro-001 but basically what I'm going to [1743] be doing here is I'm going to be going [1745] the first time this runs it's going to [1747] say one the second time it runs is going [1748] to say two the third times it runs it's [1749] going to say three so it's going to pull [1750] out the first price in the first run the [1752] second price in the second R the third [1753] price in the third round and what [1755] happens after that is we then feed that [1758] all into a parse Json module which then [1761] looks like this this is the thing that [1765] I'm basically feeding in essentially um [1768] this array and then we have the whole [1771] string and the logic to get that done [1774] I'll show [1775] you and you know afterwards we get the [1777] prod one with the price prod two with [1779] the price or prod three with the price [1780] prod five with the price the logic to [1781] get that done is this formula as follows [1785] it's curly brace quote array then [1790] another quote and then comma uh then [1792] colon and then a square bracket and then [1794] this piece of text join split text split [1797] by the presence of of this comma and [1799] then uh join by the presence of this [1801] comma this basically just gets rid of a [1803] couple of additional commas and then we [1805] wrap it in a square bracket and then a [1807] curly brace I understand that this [1808] you're unfamiliar with Jason probably [1810] means nothing to you but you can also [1812] just copy this and just use this sort of [1814] like a back pocket sort of hack anytime [1816] you want to do the similar sort of [1817] function that I'm showing here which is [1819] again to take data map several different [1823] keys and then stick those keys and [1825] values together into a new array after [1829] so I hope that makes sense hope you guys [1830] enjoy that that is the wrong screen this [1832] is the right screen uh hope you guys [1834] enjoyed the video if you guys have any [1835] questions about how this process works [1836] feel free to just drop a comment down [1838] below I think that we leveled up the [1840] complexity of the mapping um quite [1843] steadily over the course of this so I [1844] think everybody here should probably [1846] know if I could just summarize this [1847] whole thing it would be remember the [1849] pneumonic that we talked about at the [1850] beginning from a I want B where C is [1854] equal to D if you just keep that in your [1856] mind and repeat that five over 10 times [1858] over the course of the next few minutes [1860] um the next time you have any sort of [1861] mapping problem you will take care of it [1863] with ease aside from that if you could [1865] do me a favor and like subscribe do all [1867] that YouTube stuff that I love when [1868] people do and I will see you all in the [1870] next video thanks so much cheers

Title: The Definitive Make.com Iterator & Aggregator Masterclass
[0] what's going on guys Nick here and in [1] this video I'm going to show you [2] everything you need to know about [3] iterators and aggregators in make.com to [5] get out there and make money it will [7] literally be impossible for you not to [9] watch this video from start to finish [10] and walk away with everything that you [12] need so don't even try [15] me very first thing that I'm going to [17] talk about is I'm going to provide you a [18] little bit of background context behind [20] iterators and aggregators we're going to [22] be looking at a couple of little [23] slideshow uh Pages like this and then [25] I'm actually going to get into building [27] 10 whole scenarios for you using [29] iterators and AG ators I wasn't lying [31] when the title said that this was a [32] master class so first and foremost the [34] majority of confusion around iterators [36] and aggregators in make is because make [38] has pretty crappy naming practices I'm [41] so sorry make Gods please forgive me [44] bundles what the hell are they [46] collections arrays tables what does any [49] of this mean and is it relevant to be [51] honest I don't even know and I'm hoping [52] somebody in the audience can tell me uh [54] the good news is you don't actually have [57] to know too much about all of these [58] things in order to get out there and use [60] make to make money I hope I've [62] Illustrated that to you guys in my [63] introductory make.com course make.com [65] for people who want to make real money [67] um the great news for iterators and [69] aggregators is if you just strip away [71] all of this [72] verbiage into the most simplest [75] Parts they become extraordinarily easy [77] to understand and you can start using [79] them in your scenarios to save you a ton [81] of operations if you guys are familiar [83] with operations it's basically how [84] make.com charges you for every uh [86] scenario run as well as do things much [89] faster and much more efficiently so [92] that's what we're going to do in this [93] video I'm literally going to hammer this [95] into your brain by running through 10 [97] different scenarios leading up to a [99] final culminating scenario uh that I've [102] shown before on my channel but that's [103] quite complex that uses iterators [105] aggregators set get variables I think I [108] even do some funny mapping in there uh [110] we're going to dive into this all over [112] the course of the next hour or two so [115] first things [118] first inputs in outputs if you guys are [121] unfamiliar with inputs and outputs in [122] make every module has what's called an [125] input bundle and an output bundle output [128] bundles are pretty self-explanatory it's [130] just whatever you want the module to do [132] for instance if you are using a search [134] rows module well it's probably going to [137] be outputting some rows if you're using [139] a markdown to HTML module it's probably [141] going to be outputting some HTML so [143] outputs are pretty simple and easy to [145] understand but the inputs are where a [147] lot of people trip up and I run a [148] make.com community where I show people [150] how to do this stuff and usually the [151] number one questions that I get have to [153] do with things that could have been [156] solved in a few moments just if people [157] understood how inputs worked so that's [159] what I'm going to do right now for all [161] of you I have a little example scenario [163] set up here zero inputs outputs aray [166] bundles and Collections and I have three [168] modules the first is a Google sheet [169] search rows module the second is a parse [171] Json module which is going to be [173] responsible for making an array for us [174] and the third is a set variable module [176] so I'm just going to connect these two [178] together first and I'm just going to run [179] through what they're doing and how they [181] work basically I have a search rows [183] module set up here which is going to [185] pull a spreadsheet that I have on my [188] account Nick left click. and it's just [190] going to list all of the results okay as [193] you see there are a bunch of settings [195] here there is spreadsheet which I have [196] mapped with the ID of the spreadsheet [199] you could do this or you could just [200] select it manually I've just decided to [202] map it because it's just easier for me [203] to copy and paste the ID of the [204] spreadsheet in there's the sheet name [206] right over here which is sheet one the [208] table contains headers this is a setting [210] that we can provide this is part of our [211] input uh column range a to CZ whatever [214] the hell that means no filter sort order [217] ascending order by nothing maximum [219] number of return rows threes maximum [221] number of returned rows three let's [223] actually run this and see what happens [225] so I gave this a run and what it's done [227] is it's pulled from this spreadsheet [229] here which is just a list of dentists [232] basically that uh I had for one of my [234] other clients here that needed a giant [236] list of dentists and as you see here we [238] have two different different sides to [240] this we have an input bundle let me zoom [243] in here so everybody could see it and [245] then we have three output bundles this [247] is really at the core of why you need an [249] iterator and an aggregator in the first [250] place to be honest but I'll run you guys [252] through that in a moment the output [254] bundle is kind of what we expected you [256] know this module is called search rows [257] so it sort of makes sense that the [259] output would just be a bunch of row [260] information right if we look on the [263] collection here we have profile URL full [265] name title row number spreadsheet sheet [268] total number of bundles bundle position [270] one if we look back on the actual [272] spreadsheet we notice that there's a [273] profile URL full name and title column [276] so it's pretty obvious that this is [277] pulling the profile URL from the sheet [279] then it's pulling the full name from the [280] sheet then it's pulling the title and [282] then there's also just some metadata to [283] do with uh what what row number we're at [287] uh what the spreadsheet ID is what the [289] sheet name is the total number of [291] bundles Bund loader position every [293] module in make.com is going to give you [295] slightly different metadata in addition [297] usually to the data that you're asking [299] for and so this is just an artifact of [301] how the Google Sheets API works every [303] time you search a rows or something like [305] that it's just going to give you this [307] information there's nothing you can do [308] about it and a lot of the time it's [310] valuable maybe you'll need this [311] information um to use later on or [313] something like that so they just give it [315] back to you almost as just like hey [316] here's some additional information in [318] case you need it so that's the output [320] notice that there are three bundles in [322] this output what a bundle is we'll get [324] into in a second but essentially um we [327] have different information in every [329] bundle [330] the first one is for this woman Kayla [332] this next one for this woman irony and [333] this last one's for this person Kenny [335] right and if you look here this sort of [337] corresponds the first three rows of our [339] spreadsheet Okay cool so that's pretty [341] introductory knowledge but let's [342] actually get into this input because as [344] you see there's both an input and an [345] output here if we check out the input [347] you'll see that there are a bunch of [349] parameters laid out very similarly to [351] what we saw on the output but that a lot [352] of people aren't like sort of realizing [354] that we're actually providing to the API [357] to this Google Sheets um search modu [359] module so we have a search method called [361] Drive maximum number of return rows [363] three a sheet name sheet one sort order [366] ascending the spreadsheet ID the column [368] range the table contains headers this [371] value render option date and time render [373] option now the specifics of these keys [375] and these values they aren't very super [377] important to us all I mean to show you [379] is that if you just click on these [381] little white uh circles to the top right [384] of every module after a run you get a [386] ton of information on what you are [388] supplying to the server or two um Google [391] Sheets and then what you are receiving [393] in return okay if you're unfamiliar with [396] what's actually going on behind the hood [398] essentially make.com is serving as the [400] client in this instance it's sending a [402] request over to Google Sheets which is [404] now on the right Google Sheets has been [406] configured to respond to the to certain [409] inputs with certain outputs and so we've [412] structured our input [414] here like this and Google Sheets they're [418] Google API essentially reads that input [421] does something cool and funky behind the [423] confines of this gray rectangle and then [425] sends it back to us as a response which [427] we are reading down here in the [429] output so that's how make.com inputs and [432] outputs work keep in mind that there are [434] both inputs and outputs most people only [436] ever look at the outputs and they sort [437] of wonder why their scenarios aren't [438] working if you guys understand that [441] you'll probably save yourself a few [442] hours of debugging just over the course [443] of the next couple of weeks that takes [446] me to another very important concept and [448] that concept is Nick what the hell is a [450] bundle well bundles are as I mentioned [454] simply make.com nomenclature make.com [457] just pulled the word bundle out of their [458] ass and we are all suffering now because [460] of it but essentially a bundle or a [463] collection or the two are slightly [465] different but essentially a bundle is [468] just one execution of your [471] scenario every time you get a [474] bundle at the beginning of a mod at a [478] scenario the the subsequent modules in [481] that scenario will run so if you have [483] one bundle every module after the module [487] that output of that one bundle will run [489] once if you have two bundles every [492] module after the output of that those [494] initial two modules will run twice if [496] you have three it'll run three times if [498] you have five it'll run five times if [499] you have n which I'm just going to use [501] as a placeholder variable it will run n [505] times you'll know that something is a [507] bundle because it'll say bundle one in [508] purple over here here like we see now [511] let's actually look at this um in [513] practice because it's one thing to see [515] it on a hastily written um gamma [518] spreadsheet it's another thing entirely [520] to see it in [521] make.com so first and foremost if I [523] click on this and I scroll down you [525] notice that the bottom field here says [527] maximum number of returned rows and then [529] it's set to three so if I were to turn [532] this to one and then if I were to give [533] this a [534] run the output of this module is just [537] one bundle right if I if I were to turn [539] this to three and then run the output of [544] this bundle sorry the output of this [545] module is now three bundles okay now [549] instead of just clip right clicking and [550] then running this module only I'm [552] actually going to run the entire [553] scenario and show you guys how it works [555] so first we have this Google sheet [556] search row module and it's connected to [558] another variable here called example [560] variable and all I'm doing is I'm adding [562] this profile URL and I'm turning into a [564] variable let's actually just call this [565] profile URL now in reality there's [568] basically no reason why you'd actually [569] want to do this because you already have [571] a variable called profile URL which has [573] the URL of the profile up here right but [574] I'm just doing this as an example don't [576] get your knickers in a Twist I'm going [579] to click this run once module I don't [580] know why I said that I'm going to click [581] this run once module um and we're going [584] to see what happens with these three [585] bundles all right let me let me give it [588] a [588] go something very interesting just [591] occurred essentially if you click on the [593] white little bubble up here um by the [595] search row module you'll notice that [597] three bundles were output [599] and then after every module after the [602] three bundles were output ran three [604] times that's why there's operation one [606] operation two operation three and you'll [609] see what ended up happening is we fed in [611] a different profile URL to this um [614] variable every single [615] time essentially what happened is we're [618] selecting profile URL up here right and [621] then every time a new bundle is run it [624] will select a different profile URL so [626] the first time it'll select this one up [628] here the second time it'll select this [629] one over here and then the third time [631] it'll select this one over here and then [633] we also have three executions or three [635] operations that were [637] used where we have input and then output [639] and notice how the input is different [641] for every single one if you look at the [643] input for the set variable module on [644] operation one well you'll see that this [646] corresponds to the first row in our [648] spreadsheet the second input is another [651] bundle this corresponds to the second [652] row in our spreadsheet the third uh [655] operation is a third bundle and it [657] corresponds to the third value of our [659] spreadsheet here don't pay attention to [661] the fact that it says bundle one or [663] bundle one or bundle one um these [665] correspond to the three bundles that we [667] generated earlier unfortunately another [669] downside of make.com naming practices is [671] that they don't carry over the bundle [673] number with them from one module to [675] another regardless this was the first [677] operation this is the second operation [679] and this is the third all right so as I [682] mentioned previously that's how bundles [684] work every time you output more than one [686] bundle every module in a scenario will [688] run as many many times as you have [690] bundles output 27 bundles from your [692] first trigger scenario well every other [695] module in your scenario even if you have [697] 20 are going to run 27 times if you do [700] the math and you try and figure out how [701] many operations this is going to cost [703] you you could see that this sort of [704] thing would add up pretty fast I mean if [706] you have 10 modules in the scenario and [708] every module runs 10 times 10 time 10 is [711] 100 total operations right you can only [713] really do that a certain number of times [714] before you run out of operations and [716] then make.com price gges you for another [718] $4 82 cents or whatever so that's what [722] bundles are let's talk a little bit [723] about arrays arrays instead of bundles [727] are numbered lists of data if we just [729] look at the way that this looks like if [731] we just look at the Aesthetics of it [732] you'll see that in the previous page we [734] had an output and we had bundle one [736] bundle two bundle three here we have an [738] array and then the array just has [740] numbers one two or [743] three if you feed in an array into a [746] scenario if you have one item in the [748] array it'll run your scenario once if [751] you have two items in the array it'll [753] still run your scenario once if you have [755] three items it'll run once if you have [757] five items it'll run once if you have n [758] items it'll always just run once [760] basically an array will not trigger a [763] scenario to run multiple times it'll [765] only run once regardless of how many [767] items are in that [768] array so whereas with bundles the number [771] of times the scenario runs is going to [773] depend on the number of bundles that you [774] feed in with arrays the number of items [777] in the array has no impact on the number [779] of times at the rest the scenario is [780] going to run a very easy way to know [783] that something is an array is just to [784] look at it and then if it has a gray [786] little um piece of text there that says [789] array well I'm not a scientist but uh [793] that'll that'll obviously be an array so [796] let me give you another practical [797] example here previously we were using [799] this Google sheet search rows module [801] right and you see the output of this is [802] a profile Ur full name title because [804] we're pulling from this spreadsheet over [805] here well what if hypothetically I was [808] sneaky and I created another module here [811] that instead of outputting multiple [813] bundles outputs an array with the same [815] data let's give this a little [817] Zoom as you see we have an array with [820] three items we have title full name [823] profile URL title full name profile URL [826] title full name profile URL this is a [829] singular bundle and inside of that [831] bundle we have an array that generates [834] three of these collections which I'll [836] touch on in a moment essentially the [838] data here is virtually the same as the [840] data we had before but the way that it's [841] formatted is different and because the [843] way that it's formatted is different if [844] we were to try and feed this into this [846] set variable module well look at what [849] happens our variable selector looks very [852] different indeed instead of having [854] access to all of those variables before [857] that we did with the spreadsheet ID and [859] all that stuff now we only have access [860] to a single array that contains title [862] full name and profile URL furthermore if [866] we give one of these a click you'll see [867] that there is a space between the left [870] hand side of this variable and then the [871] right hand side of this variable because [874] this space is asking us hey which array [876] element do you want us to select this is [878] called array indexing let me give you an [880] example if I wanted the full name of the [883] second entry here I would go array to [887] title and if I give this a run you'll [890] see that it's now [892] pulling hold on one second oh sorry I [895] don't want a title I want the full name [897] I take that back okay if I wanted the [899] second full name here I put two now give [902] this a run look at what happens we [904] receive Peter locks if we look at our [907] array [908] here Peter locks was number two now [911] let's say I want to grab Kayla Sans here [913] if I go back here and then I say one [915] instead click run once well now we've [918] indexed Kayla Sand's name and if we want [920] to do this lady and Marie click okay um [924] now we have that lady and Marie the [926] point that I'm making is the number [929] elements in this array has no bearing on [931] the number of times that the scenario [932] runs instead it's just presented to us [935] as like this data structure that we can [936] then index to take specific objects from [939] right and that's why the two um types of [942] Pickers look very different because one [943] is running on a bundle basis and the [945] other one's running on like an array [946] basis basically so anytime that you [949] select an object and it's sort of split [951] into two parts like this you're [952] manipulating an array in my case my [954] array variable is literally called array [956] but if you want to see if something's an [957] array just look for these two little [959] brackets beside it like this um one left [961] square bracket and then one right square [963] bracket anything there will be an array [965] and then it'll also ask you if you [967] select an element within the array to [968] index it like this I believe if you [971] don't select one it'll just [972] automatically select the first let's see [975] yes it automatically selects the first [977] um element in the array if you don't [979] select one let's run this with the full [981] name variable and then we see that's KLA [983] s but you can manually say I want the [985] third one I want the second one I want [986] the first one okay so that's how arrays [990] work in a nutshell the way that this [992] corresponds to iterators and aggregators [994] is as follows an iterator will turn a [998] set like an array into a bunch of [1001] bundles an aggregator will turn a bunch [1005] of bundles into an array that's [1008] basically it there's no real magic [1010] behind it now that you understand these [1011] Concepts all we're really doing is we're [1013] just changing the way that the scenario [1015] data is formatted from before like where [1017] we're using this Google Sheets from [1019] bundles to arrays that would be an [1020] aggregator or from an array into a bunch [1023] of bundles which would be an iterator [1025] and I'm going to show you how all of [1026] that works now with a bunch of practical [1028] scenarios and practical examples where [1030] we'll manipulate the data and I'll talk [1031] you guys through it and by the end of [1033] these 10 practical examples you guys [1036] will know everything that you need to [1037] know in order to make make.com iterators [1040] and aggregators work for you all right [1043] so the very first example I have here is [1045] that many modules have built in [1047] iterators many modes modes usually [1050] modules with names like search or find [1053] or list or get or that sort of thing [1055] will have built-in iterators already [1058] that just means that most of you guys [1059] already understand how iterators work [1061] because you've been using them all along [1062] it's just when you actually drag the [1063] iterator module into play the things [1065] start being a little more complex let me [1068] show you what I mean I have an example [1069] scenario set up here the way that this [1071] example scenario works is we are pulling [1073] from the same Google sheet that I was [1074] pulling before okay that's what the [1076] search rows module does we're selecting [1079] three returned rows if I go back here [1081] you'll see that the first three here are [1083] Kayla irini and Kenny so if I were to [1086] run this what do you guys think is going [1087] to [1088] happen well the output is going to be [1091] Kayla ir and [1093] Kenny next up I have a set multiple [1097] variables module and the purpose of this [1099] module is I'm going to be creating a [1102] custom subject line using the person's [1104] first name as input what I want is I [1107] want a subject line that says something [1108] like this [1111] because I'm going to be using this in an [1113] email sequence later on I want it to [1115] look casual I want it to be sort of [1117] grammatically incorrect I want people to [1118] think that I actually like saw Kayla's [1120] profile I sat down and then I wrote this [1122] myself this is a real flow that I use in [1125] a ton of my cold emailing applications [1127] where if you send somebody a really [1129] formall looking subject line and say [1131] dearest Kayla I would love to uh [1134] serenade you with whatever she's going [1136] to look at that and instantly put that [1137] in the trash but if you were say [1139] something like hey Kayla Das space saw [1141] your profile she's like 30 times more [1143] likely to open it it's a little bit of [1145] cold email magic but that's not the [1146] point of the course anywh who um how [1148] would we actually go about doing this [1150] dynamically getting the full name if [1152] you're familiar with how make.com [1154] splitting operations works then give it [1156] a quick pause and try and do it for [1158] yourself if not what we're going to do [1160] is we're going to write the word hey I'm [1162] going to put a space and I'm going to [1163] say split the full name [1167] here by the presence of a space I use [1170] these two little curly brackets to [1172] instantly grab variables that you can [1174] also find over here in the variable [1176] picker I just do it a little bit faster [1177] that [1178] way so what I'm doing now is I'm [1180] grabbing this full name I'm splitting it [1181] by the presence of a space I'm turning [1183] this string into three elements it's [1185] basically now a three element array then [1187] what I want to do is I want to wrap this [1188] in a get function which allows me to [1190] pick specific things from the array and [1192] I'm going to pick the first one then I'm [1194] going to add a little Dash and I'll say [1196] saw your profile just like [1200] that's what this currently looks like I [1202] then have a Gmail module over [1205] here where I can select the subject line [1208] I can add content I can add a recipient [1210] I can do all that fun stuff what I'm [1211] going to do here is I'm just going to [1213] select uh drafts I [1215] believe then the email address I'm going [1217] to do this um I'm just going to do my [1220] own because I don't actually want to [1221] send any emails to anybody and I'm just [1222] going to write [1223] test okay great now I'm going to unlink [1226] this Gmail module just because I want to [1228] test with going on before the Gmail [1229] module and show you how iterators and [1231] aggregators work in respect to [1234] this as we see the maximum number of [1237] return rows is three I'm going to set [1238] that to one and I'm just going to run [1240] this so what ended up happening is we [1243] fed that in as input that the maximum [1245] number of return rows is going to be one [1247] and then the data that we got as output [1249] was Kayla general dentist yada yada the [1253] variable that we were using from this [1254] was full name so that's the only one [1256] that really we should be manipulating [1258] and as you see see the input here was [1261] subject line hey KLA saw your profile [1263] the output is hey KLA saw your profile [1265] essentially this this worked for us if I [1267] were to say convert this to three rows [1270] instead of one row then give this a run [1274] you'll see that this is already [1276] technically iterating over our data [1278] because the search rows module actually [1280] just natively has an iterator built in [1282] we outputed multiple bundles here's one [1284] two and three and for every bundle we [1286] had one run of the subsequent module [1288] which is this so as you see the first [1290] one said hey Kayla the second one said [1292] hey irini and the third one said hey [1294] Kenny now if we connect this to the [1296] Gmail module I'm actually not sure if [1297] this is going to work we're going to [1298] give it a go [1300] regardless you could see that not only [1302] did the second module here run three [1304] times but also the third module here ran [1306] three times the reason why is because um [1310] basically at every module the number of [1311] bundles output by that module will [1313] multiply by the number of bundles output [1314] by the next module to get the total [1316] number of bundles output by the [1317] subsequent module [1319] so if this module here output three [1320] bundles 1 2 three then this module here [1324] output one bundle each one one and one [1329] the total output of this is three for [1331] the subsequent module if hypothetically [1333] we did some data structure here where we [1335] had an iterator that iterated over the [1336] bundles or something then we just keep [1339] on multiplying those out until you get [1340] the total number of executions or runs [1343] at that last module but in this case [1345] it's 3 * 1 is equal to three pretty [1347] simple to understand right now the [1349] reason why I'm showing you this is [1350] because I just want to make it clear [1351] that most people that are using make.com [1353] and are probably at the point where [1354] they're like watching this video have [1356] already used iterators and have already [1357] used aggregators even if you don't think [1359] that you have because tons of modules [1361] just have that functionality built into [1362] them which is very [1364] convenient all right so that's many [1366] modules at built-in [1368] iterators let's learn a little bit about [1370] what we do if there is no built-in [1372] iterator and we're forced to do it [1374] ourself let's hypo hypothesize that's a [1376] fancy word uh let's hypothesize and [1379] let's just pretend that we're getting [1381] the exact same data that we got in the [1383] previous example the only difference is [1386] now it's an array instead of a series of [1388] bundles well iterators turn an array [1391] into a series of bundles right so if we [1393] want to get the same result if we want [1395] to send three emails all with three [1396] separate subject lines we're going to [1398] have to add an iterator module so that's [1401] what we're going to be doing um and I'll [1403] talk about this rule of thumb and I'll [1404] talk about the inputs and outputs in a [1405] second but essentially this is what the [1409] scenario is going to look like let me [1410] just copy this over here and make it the [1412] same basically instead of having the [1415] Google Sheets module like we had [1416] previously what I've done is I've just [1418] created my own array using this parse [1419] Json module and that's not very [1421] important for the purpose of this video [1422] what is important is that if you click [1424] run this module once the output is you [1426] get this array and in the array you [1428] basically get the same looking data as [1430] we got previously it's just now it's an [1432] array format as opposed to bundles so we [1434] have the title we have the full name we [1435] have the profile URL right now now if I [1439] click on [1440] this and then if [1443] I try and do the same thing that I did [1446] over here with subject line how could I [1448] possibly like if you just stop pause the [1450] video here for a second and try and [1452] think how could you possibly try how [1454] could you possibly get the same result [1456] with three different subject lines each [1459] corresponding to a dynamic uh full name [1462] you really couldn't unless you use an [1463] iterator like I mean subject line the [1466] maximum subject line I'd be able to do [1468] is I'd have to manually index these one [1470] two 3 four let's say there's 100 right [1472] I'd have to basically create a router [1474] with 100 different outputs and then I'd [1477] have to connect that to 100 different of [1478] these modules then I'd have to manually [1480] select a 100 different things that's [1482] super ludicrous and basically impossible [1484] to do certainly not feasible and not [1486] something you should be doing so what we [1488] have to do is we have to transform this [1489] data structure here into a series of [1491] bundles so that we can just dynamically [1493] grab one variable at a time as opposed [1495] to having to index it like we're doing [1496] here and that's where the [1498] um iterator module comes in so what I'm [1501] going to do is I'm going to click on [1502] this little green flow control and [1503] you'll see that the very first uh the [1506] very second result here is called [1508] iterator it's because it's one of the [1509] most common ones that uh that are used [1511] in make.com all you have to do is just [1513] drag this in front of whatever module [1515] has the array I'm just going to Auto [1516] align this spread this out a little bit [1517] more then if you click on it what we [1519] need to do is we need to feed in an [1521] array and all you need to do is just [1523] click on the top level array the one [1525] with the two little brackets so as you [1526] see this variable here it's convenient [1529] that it's called array but even if it [1530] wasn't called array as long as it has [1532] these two little brackets on it we're [1534] good [1535] oops and then I'm going to unlink [1538] this and then I'm just going to run this [1541] with the iterator so we see what [1544] happens okay so we ran the generate [1546] array first so we've generated an array [1549] with three elements right now what [1551] happens when you feed it into an [1552] iterator well as you see the input at [1555] the top corner here was our array [1557] General dentist Kayla s's profile URL [1560] but the output of this B of this uh run [1563] is three different bundles each that [1565] have basically the same data that we had [1567] before as well as some silly little [1569] metadata here like which bundle that uh [1572] which array element it was that was [1574] output for instance this Kayla SS this [1576] was bundle order position one um Peter [1579] locks was bundle order position two [1581] right this actually sort of keeps track [1583] of it which could be useful in some [1584] cases but for most cases it probably [1586] isn't now that we have output in this [1589] bundle format well if you think back to [1590] it that's basically the exact same [1592] output format that we got over here [1594] right so if we go here and if we connect [1598] this now what we can do is we can [1600] actually use the data from this iterator [1602] as part of our flow so if I do the same [1604] thing that I did before where I split [1607] the presence of this full name based off [1609] of a space and then I get the very first [1611] result and then I write saw your profile [1615] then if I unlink this from the Gmail [1616] module just because I want to test this [1617] up until the this last module here let's [1620] see what happened we had one run of [1621] generate array one run of the iterator [1623] now we had three runs of this set [1625] multiple variables module and in every [1627] run we have the dynamic first name [1630] that's being pulled essentially because [1632] we're doing that cool string [1633] manipulation and now if we feed this [1635] into our Gmail module which I'm probably [1637] going to have to update because I just [1638] copied that from another module [1640] below and now if we run it how many runs [1644] is this Gmail module going to generate [1646] pause the video and just give it a give [1647] it a quick think before [1655] proceeding three the reason why is [1657] because we went from 1 1 * 1 is 1 then [1661] we went 1 * 1 2 3 3 is three and then we [1665] went 3 * 1 is three and so basically [1670] this generat array generated one bundle [1672] then we took it into an iterator and [1674] then we took that one bundle turn it [1675] into three because we we iterated over [1677] the array [1678] and then uh we set three different [1681] variables here and then we used it to [1683] create three different Gmail [1685] drafts so the good rule of thumb here is [1688] anytime you're sort of uh not sure of [1690] exactly what to do with an iterator just [1692] always use the green variables from that [1694] iterator in subsequent modules because [1696] that will contain the data that you want [1698] as you see we have a title variable full [1699] name variable profile URL variable [1701] whatever one thing that really screw me [1703] up initially was I would keep on using [1705] this um array variable uh you know key [1708] key values instead of the iterator uh [1710] key values and I just never really [1712] understand why this would work but [1714] essentially this iterator just runs it [1716] on a bundle by bundle basis whereas this [1719] um array is just going to run once per [1721] bundle which is unfortunate so yeah just [1723] always try and use the green variables [1725] here as opposed to the variables from [1727] previous modules and if you're ever [1730] unsure what's going on just look at the [1731] inputs and the outputs I've tried to [1733] really drill this in over the course of [1734] the last 15 or 20 minutes however long [1736] this has been so far um but the inputs [1738] up it's just the easiest way to know [1739] what's going on and you can usually [1740] diagnose the hell out of your own flows [1742] just by clicking on these little things [1743] after they run seeing what was fed in so [1746] you see an array was fed in the iterator [1747] did its job fed in the output okay great [1749] let's take a look at this unfortunately [1752] the set variable modules are a little [1753] bit trickier because they don't actually [1754] show you the the logic that was done but [1756] that's okay uh we can look at the Gmail [1758] module as well right here's the input we [1760] have copy recipient two blind copy [1762] recipient attachments right all of this [1764] data is basically fed in content test [1766] and then you can see the subject line [1767] was F in as well so when you go through [1770] the output um the Gmail module just [1773] gives you a bunch of like message IDs [1774] and stuff the reason why it does that is [1775] because you can actually feed in the [1776] message IDs into subsequent modules to [1778] pull the specific message to see it for [1780] yourself um but you know every module [1782] will output something [1783] different but yeah that's more or less [1785] how you do it [1786] yourself okay so that's cool but what [1789] exactly is an array what exactly happens [1793] every time I click on one of these and [1794] then on the right hand side it says [1795] collection it says array how exactly do [1797] I take that and then do something cool [1799] with it well in order to understand [1802] arrays and Collections and really all [1804] the different data structures in [1805] make.com you need to understand what a [1807] key to Value pair is and key value pairs [1810] are at the core of how make.com works [1812] and basically just in general how [1813] programming works this is basically what [1815] a variable is for instance if I had a [1818] variable called first name and the value [1820] of it was Nick in this case first name [1823] would be the key Nick would be the value [1825] you can also think of it as first name [1827] as the variable Nick is the result or [1829] value of the variable right if I were to [1832] do a more practical example and if I [1833] were just to click into our first result [1835] here sorry my back is killing me I've [1837] been on this little plastic chair for [1838] like seven hours today so don't hate me [1841] for moving around um if I if I were to [1844] click into this you'll see that there [1845] are a bunch of these purple uh there [1848] there's a bunch of text in purple and [1849] then there's a bunch of text just in [1850] like black over here basically all the [1851] text in purple here this is a key and [1854] then this is the corresponding value of [1855] that key so the key of profile URL has a [1858] value of this big URL here the key of [1860] full name has this value of this K Kayla [1863] the title key has the value of general [1865] dentist this row number key is a value [1867] of two right if you try and use this in [1869] subsequent modules here like in the [1871] fields the variables themselves you'll [1873] see that we can actually select this but [1875] what we're clicking on really is we're [1876] clicking on the key right this uh [1879] spreadsheet ID that the name of that is [1881] key the sheet the name of that is a key [1884] right the value is sheet one but the [1885] name of it is this so when I click full [1887] name like when I'm doing is I'm pulling [1888] a key right so that's at the core of [1891] basically how anything in programming [1893] Works to be honest um but once you know [1896] that you start to understand how [1897] Collections and how arrays work and [1899] really the way that make.com is Define [1901] them although they won't really tell you [1902] how they Define them or maybe they have [1904] and I'm just too lazy and I haven't read [1905] them is that a collection is just any [1907] group of key to Value pairs whereas an [1910] array is just groups of collections of [1913] key of collections or of key to Value [1916] pairs I know that that's a mouthful so [1918] let me show you a practical example in [1921] our no built-in iterator here's how to [1922] do it yourself run if we were to give [1924] this a quick little [1927] click you'll see that we have an array [1929] here and inside of the array we have [1930] three collections I give this a little [1932] click the collection is a set of key [1934] value pairs so title General NST full [1936] name Kayla profile URL um here's the URL [1939] an array in this instance is simply a [1942] collect or an array is simply a [1944] collection of it no it's not a [1945] collection rewind the video really [1947] quickly [1948] an array is just a set of collections or [1952] key to Value pairs what I mean by that [1953] well I mean like technically we could [1955] have an additional value here which is [1957] just a key to Value pair um I could give [1962] this a little try [1968] here I [1971] think if that breaks then I'm going to [1974] cry yeah that totally broke [1981] you could just put a number there [1982] instead [1984] though okay so basically what we've done [1987] here is we've created an additional [1990] variable and the variable just has a [1992] value of three it's given this sort of [1995] it's not really a key but it's given [1996] like a key of four here basically and [1998] then the value of it is three I could [2000] not have picked a more confusing example [2002] but essentially this isn't a collection [2003] this is just a value but it's still [2005] technically an array right so an array [2007] can contain uh uh collections key value [2009] pairs or it can also just contain values [2011] like [2012] this contrast that with an array sorry [2016] contrast that with a collection a [2020] collection like this typically just [2022] contains key to Value Pairs and [2025] sometimes these keys can have [2026] collections within them as well so what [2029] do I mean by this well if I go back to [2030] all this fancy looking code then I [2033] create a new one [2043] I'm now essentially creating an [2044] additional collection item inside of [2047] this and our thing is growing more and [2049] more needlessly complex you see that [2051] this array now has a collection inside [2053] of it and this collection has a key [2054] value pair another key value pair and a [2056] third key value pair but then it also [2057] has another collection with another key [2059] value pair [2060] inside so to keep things simple because [2062] that's really the point of this you can [2064] essentially have an arbitrary number of [2065] key to Value pairs or collections Within [2067] either a collection or an array but just [2069] think about collections as any group of [2071] key to Value Pairs and then just think [2073] about arrays as groups of Collections [2075] and or key to Value pairs very very [2077] simple way of looking at things now I'm [2079] going to show you a practical example of [2081] what this might look [2083] like this is our um module here this is [2086] our scenario here called three okay but [2088] how do you work with arrays and [2089] collections as you can see I put a lot [2090] of thought into naming these things if I [2092] give this a run see that we now have an [2096] array but our array looks a little bit [2098] different than the old one previously we [2100] simply had the title full name and [2102] profile URL but I've actually went [2103] through and I've added an additional [2104] collection inside of every collection [2106] inside of the array with two new key [2109] value pairs email provider and email [2112] address and so inside of every one you [2115] can see that we have an email provider [2116] um Google or Outlook or or Google and [2119] then inside further we have the email [2121] address of the person these are fake [2122] email addresses that I've generated just [2124] for the purposes of this example but the [2126] good news is we can now map that [2128] dynamically and then feed that into our [2130] Gmail module and the mechanics of what [2132] I'm going to do here aren't any [2133] different but I want to show you the the [2135] value and understanding how these things [2137] are defined and how they work because it [2139] does give you a ton of latitude in [2142] make.com so I have to create my own [2144] subject line again so I'm just going to [2147] do [2148] this so that I can show you guys how to [2151] do string manipulation really [2154] quickly so this is me manipulating a [2156] string [2158] and I'm writing saw your profile again [2160] and then maybe what I also want to do is [2162] I want to manipulate the provider name [2164] which I'll find over here email provider [2166] and I want to turn that into a lowercase [2168] thing what you'll see is happening is [2171] that we're actually indexing the [2172] variable you see it's under email and [2174] then it says email provider when you see [2176] a format like this the reason why you're [2177] seeing it is because this is the title [2179] of the [2181] key in the collection uh key for the [2185] collection so email is the key for the [2187] subsequent [2188] collection of two key value pairs of [2190] email provider Google email address and [2192] Maria am Dental um and so that's what [2194] this is referring to this is saying hey [2196] email is a collection and then the key [2198] that we're looking at is actually inside [2199] of the email key and it's called the [2201] email provider you don't need to know or [2204] memorize all this stuff I'm just [2205] pointing this out uh for sheer [2207] interest once you've done that you could [2209] theoretically add a [2211] filter and it could only add [2216] emails only send emails if the provider [2218] is Outlook you can imagine how maybe you [2221] are having some specific business [2222] purpose where you only want to email [2224] Outlook emails or maybe you're a little [2226] skeptical of the deliverability of non- [2227] Outlook emails so what we're doing now [2230] is I've essentially added a filter and [2231] the reason why I've done this is just to [2232] show you how um both the indexing works [2235] and also How Deeply nested you can [2238] access variables using iterator but if [2240] we look at the input and output pairs of [2241] all the modules before you see the first [2243] one is an [2245] array and it has this email email [2247] collection right with the email provider [2250] and email address this iterator then [2253] takes the array and then it converts it [2255] into bundles and it also keeps the place [2259] of all of the key value pairs or [2260] collections there in so we can now [2262] access all of the same information it's [2264] just instead of it being an array now [2265] it's in bundle so we can dynamically map [2267] it and then we have this set multiple [2268] variables module which I showed you [2270] before and what this is doing is it's [2272] taking in the subject line and then it's [2274] also making the U provider name [2276] lowercase so Google goes to a lowercase [2278] G Outlook goes to a lower case o this [2282] runs three times because it runs once [2284] for every bundle right and then we have [2286] a filter module here and the filter will [2289] also run once per bundle and so [2291] essentially what we've said in the [2292] filter is we want this to be equal to [2294] Outlook and only if it's equal to [2296] Outlook do we want to continue and if we [2298] click on this little um button here [2300] it'll show us the results of the filter [2302] it says for the first bundle that went [2303] through for Kayla um provider lowercase [2305] equals Outlook this failed this did not [2307] pass for the second person irini um [2310] provider lowercase equals out look this [2312] passed because it is and then for the [2314] third person Kenny provider lowercase [2316] equals Outlook this also failed and so [2318] this didn't pass and so basically two of [2320] these three runs were caught right here [2322] and only one run continued to this Gmail [2324] module which is why there's three runs [2326] here and only one run here and you see [2328] that this one for Peter this one [2329] actually ran and we we ended up creating [2331] a draft and we have a big message ID [2332] with that draft now as well so that's [2335] how you work with arrays and collections [2336] that's sort of what they mean mean and [2337] what they're referring to um again just [2339] to keep it really simple this is how I [2341] personally Define them collections are [2342] just any group of key to Value pairs um [2345] and then arrays are just groups of [2347] collections or key to Value pairs uh you [2350] can you can add arrays within [2351] Collections and you can add collections [2352] within arrays as we both seen um so this [2354] is just a quick and easy sort of rule of [2356] thumb that should help you guys [2358] understand a little bit more about the [2359] differences of these two data [2361] types all right now let's actually get [2363] out there and use our iterator knowledge [2365] with a practical example which is going [2367] to be us iterating over an [2368] API now if this is the first time you [2370] guys have worked with an API don't fear [2373] it's very similar just to using like one [2375] of the make.com modules it's just [2377] instead of using a built-in make.com [2378] module we're just sort of making our own [2380] with this HTTP request what I have over [2383] here is I have an API setup which isn't [2385] super important but I've shown this in [2386] my how to scrape any website with [2388] make.com video and what we're doing is [2390] we're feeding in just a bunch of the [2392] these headers over here and if you're [2393] unfamiliar with how headers work or or [2395] why they're important or whatnot then [2397] just check out my how to scrape any [2398] website with make.com video but [2400] essentially the reason I'm showing you [2402] this is if I run this right click and [2403] click run this module [2405] only you'll see that um the output of [2408] this was a bundle and inside of that [2411] bundle we have a bunch of key value [2412] pairs we have status code 200 then we [2415] have an array with a bunch of headers [2417] and inside of this headers array we have [2419] a bunch of [2422] collections if I scroll down a little [2424] bit you'll see we also have cookie [2426] headers and then most most importantly [2427] we have this data collection and inside [2430] of this data collection we also have a a [2432] key called Data with the value being [2434] this massive array if I click this [2437] you'll see that we basically have what [2439] looks like 60 different um collections [2442] within that array now I know that that [2445] was a mouthful to get through but the [2447] reason I'm showing you this is because [2448] this is basically how every API that [2449] you're ever going to interact with for [2451] tabular data for data that has like [2453] multiple versions of it are are going to [2455] interact this is how you are going to [2457] take data from an API and then make it [2459] usable within make.com because this [2462] whole array right like this doesn't [2463] actually mean anything if you think [2464] about it if I were to try and access the [2466] contents of this in any uh future flow [2469] be virtually impossible for me to do so [2471] because again I'd have to index the [2473] specific value in order for me to get [2476] the very first one I have to go one two [2477] three four five we don't want to have to [2479] do this manually every time we'd prefer [2481] a solution where we just feed it in once [2483] and then we can access whatever variable [2485] the the specific bundle or run as on [2487] right so that's where the iterator [2489] module comes in what you need to do in [2492] order to access this is you need to find [2493] your array which in our case is this [2495] data variable here and then you need to [2498] feed that in as the input to the [2499] iterator and as you see the way I did [2501] this was I went to data and then I [2503] clicked on data here because it has that [2504] little bracket here and it even says [2505] array if I Mouse over this um [2507] immediately to the right of data we see [2510] a smaller than or a less than symbol [2513] than the word array and then a greater [2514] than symbol so this is the one that we [2516] want and if I if I just remove all of [2518] the subsequent modules just to show you [2519] what this data looks like if I run this [2523] again what you'll see is we're going to [2524] feed an array with 60 objects and the [2527] result is going to be 60 bundles all [2530] with data from our API now the data from [2533] our API in particular this time excuse [2535] me is uh just a bunch of like [2537] residential or sorry I guess like [2539] commercial data uh about real estate so [2541] it's giving us like address it's giving [2542] us the number of square footage it's [2544] giving us the number of items The [2545] Brokerage name all that stuff and this [2547] is very important for one of my real [2548] estate clients forever ago um but the [2550] really cool part about this is now that [2552] we have this in this format we can [2553] actually go through and then use it in [2554] make.com to do stuff with right so I [2557] have this Google Sheets at a row module [2559] here and basically what this is doing is [2561] it's taking the data and it's just [2562] dumping it in to this um sheet which is [2564] empty at present and the whole idea here [2568] is now that we've added an iterator we [2570] can actually index and sorry we can [2572] actually go through and add data from [2575] every single one of these element items [2577] we can just put that in our Google sheet [2579] we can basically take it from an API and [2581] then dump it somewhere where we can do [2582] stuff with it or maybe our client wants [2583] it or something like that right so [2585] that's what I've done here I've pushed [2587] this through an iterator I ran the [2588] iterator once and when you run the [2589] iterator once you all of a sudden get [2591] access to all of the variables inside [2593] and so I've now just went through the [2595] list and I've you know added all of [2596] these to different columns so column C [2598] is brokerage name column D is [2600] description column e is has flyer column [2601] f is has om I don't actually know what [2603] all of these mean specifically but I [2605] hope that that's a pretty pretty good [2607] example of what's going on then at the [2609] end I have a sleep module which sleeps [2611] for one second because I want to let the [2615] Google Sheets API cool down just a [2616] little bit I'm I am doing 60 API calls [2619] here right so if I do 60 API calls and I [2621] just try and run it all at the same time [2623] there's a chance that maybe the Google [2624] Sheets API will have a fit and they're [2625] not going to like it so they're going to [2627] throttle me or something I want to [2628] eliminate this by giving myself [2630] basically a delay of one second per run [2632] uh which is pretty simple to do all you [2634] have to do is just drag a sleep module [2636] and add it to the end [2637] now you're thinking well this is at the [2638] end why is this going to work well it's [2640] going to work because you have multiple [2642] bundles and every time you have multiple [2643] bundles basically what happens is it [2644] will go through every entry every module [2646] subsequent to the one that outputs [2647] multiple bundles and it'll run it once [2649] before it starts with the next so [2651] basically what's going to happen is we [2652] run this once this is going to run once [2654] now we're going to have 60 things to go [2656] through but the way the 60 things are [2657] going to go through are item one is [2659] going to start here then go here item [2661] two is going to start here then go here [2663] item three is going to start here then [2665] go here and I'm going to get that one [2667] second every single time I run so let's [2669] actually give this a run and let's see [2670] what happens in [2673] practice as you see here We've ran this [2676] once we outputed that big thing of data [2680] we've now iterated over all of the 60 [2683] items in the array we've turned them [2684] into bundles and now we're just [2686] iterating over every bundle what's [2688] happening is we're running number 14 [2690] number 15 number 16 number 17 and [2693] basically they're about a second apart [2695] where this one runs and then we wait one [2697] second until this finishes this one runs [2698] we wait one second until this finishes [2700] and I'm not going to stop this because I [2702] actually want to show you guys but do [2703] keep in mind that this is consuming [2704] operations right this is uh going to [2706] consume 60 Ops at the end this is going [2708] to consume 60 and this is going to [2710] consume two so in total this run this [2712] example that I'm doing is going consume [2713] 122 OBS as you see we are adding all of [2716] these rowwise into our Google sheet [2719] which is pretty nice and sexy and uh [2721] yeah this is just a a quick example of [2722] what you could do with really any API [2724] scraping any sort of data and then [2726] turning that dat into tabular Data that [2728] you can then put into a CRM you could [2729] put into a project management system you [2731] could turn into a document right maybe [2734] this is that maybe these represent the [2736] fields in like a panda do or something [2738] and that's how you're filling in this [2739] beautiful looking proposal right there [2741] are a variety of different ways that you [2742] can do [2743] this now because I want to um have this [2747] stop I'm just waiting until 60 here you [2749] don't actually have to wait okay great [2751] so now that this is done um if I click [2753] on the results of this you'll see that [2755] there are 60 operations each with their [2758] own input and their own output the [2760] reason why there's their own input and [2761] their own output is because for every [2763] new row we're actually adding different [2765] information right so this is the [2767] information that we're adding as our [2768] input to the first [2770] bundle this is the information that [2772] we're adding as input to our second [2773] bundle third fourth fifth all the way [2776] down to operation number 60 below every [2778] time the um scenario finishes it [2780] actually gives us a return with just a [2782] list of updates and again this is just [2783] specific Mana data just to Google Sheets [2785] just to this particular modu module [2787] every module that you run is going to [2788] have slightly different metadata but [2790] yeah this is the result um if I were a [2792] little bit smarter I probably would have [2793] added a header field because now I have [2795] no idea what any of these mean but say [2796] love um live and learn you can also just [2798] add a header field by right clicking and [2800] clicking insert one row above and then [2802] just manually writing them all out here [2803] but this is just an example so I'm not [2805] super wetted to this or [2807] anything so yeah that's how this works [2809] um just know that anytime you're doing [2810] an HTTP call it's usually going to [2812] return responses in a data object that [2814] data object is usually going to be an [2816] array of a bunch of of tabular data um [2818] unless you're just like trying to [2819] request one resource right sometimes [2821] apis give you one resource sometimes [2822] apis have endpoints that give you [2823] multiple resources this specifically [2825] corresponds to those multiple [2827] resources all right congratulations if [2830] you are at this point in the video you [2831] now know basically everything you need [2833] to know about iterators in order to make [2834] them work and in order to make good [2836] money with them um literally iterators [2838] are not any more complex than that [2839] they're super straightforward and as [2841] long as you follow everything that I've [2842] showed you here you're going to be [2843] completely and utterly fine don't worry [2845] about it from now on what we're going to [2848] do is we're going to discuss aggregators [2850] and aggregators to be honest are a [2852] little bit more complex than iterators [2853] and it's also like why the hell would I [2856] ever want an aggregator so I'm going to [2858] show you guys some reasons why you might [2859] want to run aggregators I'm going to [2861] show you how they work why you end up [2863] with this weird little dark section all [2865] of a sudden in your make.com scenarios [2866] and then I'm going to combine that with [2868] what we learned about iterators early on [2870] and then use both iterators and [2871] aggregators in one flow before I show [2874] you my master super complicated content [2876] generator flow which makes gratuitous [2877] use of [2878] both all right so what are aggregators [2881] well first of all aggregators are [2883] basically the exact opposite of [2885] iterators you know how earlier we talked [2888] about iterators converting an array into [2890] a list of bundles right well all an [2893] aggregator does is it turns a bunch of [2894] bundles into an array and you're [2897] probably wondering why the hell could [2898] you ever possibly want to convert a [2900] bunch of bundles into an array aren't [2901] bundle so much more useful you don't [2903] need to index specific elements like we [2905] showed earlier you don't need to do [2906] anything like like that well they're [2908] useful because once you turn a series of [2909] bundles into an array you can now run [2911] array functions on them and this can [2914] save you both tons of operations it can [2916] also open up completely new use cases [2918] and there are a couple of additional [2919] things that you could do with text [2920] aggregators numeric aggregators just in [2922] one module which save you a little bit [2924] of time energy and uh and money [2926] realistically so that all sounds pretty [2928] theoretical but what does this actually [2930] look like in practice well I'm going to [2932] go back to our very first example where [2933] we just had a Google sheet and that [2935] Google sheet was spitting out a bunch of [2936] bundles just to show you guys how the [2937] aggregator Works run through some very [2939] basic examples so we have the Google [2942] Sheets search rows module here right if [2944] I give this a click you'll see that I'm [2946] pulling the exact same spreadsheet that [2947] I was pulling before that's this one [2948] over [2949] here um I'm feeding in the same sheet [2952] name all that information is exactly the [2954] same and I'm returning let's just do [2956] five rows instead of 50 now if I run [2959] this what do you think is going to [2960] happen I'm just running this one module [2962] only I'm not running the whole flow if I [2963] just try and search up five Google [2965] Sheets rows what do you think I'm going [2966] to to get how many bundles is it going [2967] to be what what's the data going to look [2969] like well if I click this run once [2972] you'll see that I've outputed five [2973] bundles because this Google sheet search [2975] row module actually has a built-in [2976] iterator right it's generating multiple [2979] bundles now the purpose of an aggregator [2981] is to turn these five bundles into one [2983] bundle that contains an array that has [2986] five elements and I'll show you how that [2988] works right [2989] now we have an array aggregator here and [2991] I'm just going to select a new one the [2994] way that you do so is you go to a flow [2996] control then you select array aggregator [2998] it's right below iterator and just drag [3000] it into the scenario and then when you [3002] click on it you'll see it has way more [3004] options than an iterator it has a source [3006] module it has a Target structure type [3008] and then it has a bunch of aggregated [3010] fields the only thing you need to know [3013] is that the source module should just be [3015] whatever is outputting multiple bundles [3017] and that's it whatever is first starting [3020] to Output all of the bundles that's what [3022] you want is your Source module if you [3024] had five other things in here [3027] right if I just put another module in [3028] here and then I space this out you'll [3030] see that I can now select two this tools [3032] and this Google Sheets well this [3034] multiple varibles this this is not [3035] outputting multiple bundles the thing [3036] that's outputting multiple bundles is [3037] this Google sheet search rows module [3039] that's the one that I want as my iter as [3041] my aggregator Source module so that's [3043] what I'm going to set and when I do this [3045] and if I click you'll see a little gray [3048] um background is going to encapsulate [3050] everything between the aggregator and [3052] that Source module and this is basically [3054] just make.com telling you that all the [3055] data outside is inacessible ible I'll [3057] cover that in a second but anyway so now [3059] that we've selected this we actually [3060] have to select some Fields because I [3062] added this general dentist variable here [3064] um you know we can see that we actually [3066] have it accessible it'll show you the [3068] module and then it'll show you all the [3069] variables within set module so for the [3071] purpose of this demo I'm actually just [3072] going to delete that again make it nice [3073] and simple for us okay so now we all we [3075] have is the Google sheet search rows [3077] module and then we have all the [3078] variables that are accessible to us here [3080] now the really the only variables I want [3082] to pull from this to make my array is [3085] profile URL full name and title I know [3087] that we're outputting some additional [3089] metadata like row number spreadsheet ID [3090] sheet I know that I don't really want [3092] any of that data in my new array the [3094] great part about aggregators is you get [3095] to choose the data that is going to [3097] populate your new so you have a lot of [3099] choice over it so to make my life as [3100] simple as possible I only I'm only going [3102] to grab the data that I need here which [3103] are these three now that I have this I'm [3106] going to disconnect the subsequent [3108] module and I'm just going to run these [3109] two to show you how this [3110] works I'm going to get an a warning [3113] because aggregators should usually not [3114] be the last module on the route but [3116] that's it's okay all right so I've now [3118] run this and what we see is the output [3120] of the first module is we see five [3122] bundles just as we were expecting now as [3125] if we follow this gray dark out section [3127] here and we click on the array [3128] aggregator uput you'll see what happened [3130] the input to this was five bundles with [3132] the title sorry with the profile URL the [3135] full name and then the title because [3137] those are the only three things that we [3138] selected in the array aggregator and [3140] then the output of this is now instead [3142] of five bundles we only have one and [3144] inside of that one bundle is an array [3146] and inside of that array is five [3147] elements each with uh Keys values that [3150] correspond to the data that we had in [3152] the individual bundles Above So [3154] essentially what we've done is we've [3155] done the exact opposite of what we had [3157] previously previously we went from [3159] arrays to bundles and now we're going [3161] from bundles to arrays and that is what [3163] the output of that specific uh flow [3165] looks [3166] like now what I'm going to do is I'm [3169] going to do a little contrived example [3171] here but I want to show you guys why [3173] array aggregators are actually valuable [3174] and not just a complete UT waste of your [3176] time [3177] I'm going to go over here to our Google [3178] sheet where we're pulling the data from [3180] and then what I'm going to do is I'm [3181] actually going to just um add a [3183] duplicate so you see this person here [3185] arini I'm going to copy this I'm going [3186] to paste this and so now what we have is [3189] we have a duplicate so of the five [3191] records that we have here um two of [3193] these are going to be the [3194] same I'm going to run this just to show [3197] you guys what this looks like and make [3199] you see we have Kayla we have irini we [3201] have arini and then we have Kenny and [3203] then [3204] Colin now the reason why this is valid [3207] is because if you didn't act let's say [3210] we were trying to get rid of duplicates [3212] if you didn't use an aggregator the only [3215] way to get rid of duplicates or the [3218] alternative way to get rid of duplicates [3219] would consume a fair number of modules [3222] if you use an aggregator you can do the [3225] D duplication in one module or sorry in [3227] one operation in one step just using a [3229] single module here um because it's now [3232] an array we have the privilege of using [3235] array operations or array functions on [3237] them and if you go over here to this [3238] functions for arrays section there are [3241] tons of different options here that you [3243] can choose from the one that I'm curious [3244] and the one that I really care about is [3245] this D duplicate one so what I'm going [3247] to do is uh the D duplicate function [3249] just finds similar array options and if [3251] you have more than one of the same array [3253] option inside of your array it'll just [3255] remove it for you and so what I'd like [3257] to do is I'd like to feed in an array [3259] with five elements is the input and then [3261] to have four elements be the output [3263] because again we are D duplicating we're [3264] removing that additional one from irini [3266] I'm going to click Start and let's see [3268] what happens so Google Sheets module we [3271] fed in we outputed five bundles as as [3274] expected array aggregator we fed in five [3276] bundles and turn those into an array [3278] with five elements two of which are the [3280] same as expected and we fed this into [3282] this tools module and we'll see that we [3285] fed [3286] in sorry the output of this is uh [3290] general dentist array with only four [3292] elements and the reason why is because [3294] we got to Leverage The D duplicate [3297] function that you would not have been [3298] able to run on a per bundle basis to [3300] just take all that data really quickly [3302] filter it and uh you know output set [3304] right now what's really cool about this [3307] is now we can go to the flow control and [3310] we can just iterate over the data again [3312] so we could just feed in this array and [3314] now we can run it and now we get the [3316] exact same thing that we had before with [3318] four different bundles sorry with [3320] multiple different bundles meaning all [3322] subsequent modules are going to run [3323] multiple times but we've automatically [3325] filtered out all the duplicates and [3327] we've just done it like ourselves we we [3328] basically did it in four um uh like in [3332] total four scenario runs as opposed to [3334] however many scenario runs it would have [3336] had to take however many operations it [3337] would have had to consume if we had done [3339] this outside of things there are so many [3342] cool array operations and I'm actually [3343] going to be diving deep into how to use [3344] a couple of them like map for instance [3346] which is heavily requested um if you [3348] learn how these array operations work [3350] you can usually cut down your Ops spend [3351] by at least half on your average [3353] scenario that you know goes through [3354] tabular data um but not the purpose of [3356] this video so I'm going to leave that [3357] for another one regardless just know [3359] that if you're a little bit smart about [3360] how you aggregate data do stuff to that [3363] data you can always just iterate it [3364] afterwards and then you could save [3366] yourself a ton of time energy and steps [3368] so that's how you use both iterators and [3370] aggregators together run array functions [3373] on them and then just you know do cool [3375] stuff now um I actually show this in the [3378] subsequent module as well um [3380] specifically I think because I select [3382] like 50 or something instead of five um [3385] and the purpose of this was I wanted to [3386] really quickly run you guys through what [3388] like the map function might look like um [3390] hypothetically let's say that okay you [3392] see how we have all of these functions [3393] I'm just going to remove this duplicate [3394] here because it's not really required [3395] anymore you see how we have profile URL [3397] full name and title let's hypothetically [3399] say we only wanted to grab the general [3401] dentists from this list if you think [3404] about how we do this otherwise um this [3406] is the exact same scenario as before by [3407] the way if you think about how we would [3409] do this otherwise if you don't use [3411] aggregators and iterators you would have [3413] to basically manually use a filter and [3416] after this filter you'd have to say um [3419] title is equal to general dentist [3423] here this filter would run 50 times [3427] every subsequent module would then run a [3428] certain number of times this would be [3431] very um operation intensive and to be [3433] honest it would also take a little while [3434] longer than you could real than you [3436] realistically wanted to um there's no [3438] need to run this whole thing 30 or 40 or [3440] 50 times you could just do all of this [3441] in one F swoop with a map function uh as [3445] again I'm not going to get into like the [3446] super crazy details of map functions I'm [3448] just going to run a map function quite [3450] quickly for you guys and you guys can [3451] take a look at how that works basically [3454] what we're going to be feeding in as our [3455] input is we're going to be feeding in an [3456] array and then what we want is let's say [3458] I just want to pull out the first names [3460] I don't know I just want the first names [3461] of people that are General dentists um [3463] you index it using this full [3466] name sorry you actually don't even need [3468] that you just write full name [3471] out actually you don't do that I I lied [3474] if you Mouse over a very varable here [3477] you'll see that this variable has a raw [3480] name a zero in this case a one or a two [3484] basically the way that raw names work [3485] are the variable names that we're seeing [3487] here title full name profile these are [3489] like um human friendly names but the [3491] actual way the data is being represented [3492] under the under the hood is with these [3494] numbers and so if you want to use the [3496] map function you have to find the raw [3497] name and that's what you have to pull [3499] out I'll give you a quick example here [3501] let's say hypothetically I only want to [3502] pull out the full names from this array [3504] and I only want to pull out the full [3505] names for people whose titles are equal [3508] to general dentist I don't want to pull [3510] out anybody else except for the general [3512] dentists what I would do is I'd write [3514] map array so I feed in the array as the [3516] main element here and then I go [3518] one which is the value of full name then [3522] two which is the value of title and then [3525] I'd write general dentist here um [3527] essentially what I'm looking for is I'm [3528] looking for the full [3530] names where title is equal to general [3533] dentist sort of how that works in like [3535] English [3537] now if I were to run this whole [3538] puppy what you'll see is we will feed in [3541] 50 values here because that's what we've [3543] output a bundle with sorry a a module [3546] with 50 uh bundle outputs and then we [3549] will feed in that array here the output [3552] will be 39 objects we will essentially [3554] have instantly filtered out the 11 that [3556] aren't General dentists and that will [3558] enable us to do things with this very [3559] very quickly U maybe we I don't know we [3561] want to send like a personalized email [3563] to only people that you know don't that [3566] are not that are General dentists rather [3568] um well that's a very quick and easy way [3569] to do so so again we get to save a fair [3572] number of operations because we don't [3573] have to do like a rowwise thing we don't [3574] have to like do an operation on a per [3576] bundle basis we can do everything that [3577] we need here in basically three bundles [3579] and then we could just convert it back [3580] to an iterator afterwards right which [3582] just gives us the exact same [3583] functionality we had before it's just [3585] now we uh now we've done it in four Ops [3586] as opposed to God knows how [3588] many so yeah I've mentioned down here [3591] that this requires um just one operation [3593] per module as opposed to one operation [3595] per module per bundle which is fantastic [3597] and it turns um scenarios that otherwise [3599] would have been pretty annoying to deal [3601] with that you know you might have to [3602] filter hundreds of Records into ones [3604] that you just have to filter once let's [3606] move on to our next scenario here which [3608] is aggregator data is inaccessible [3610] outside of the flow so if you've ever [3612] wondered why when you add an aggregator [3614] to a flow and you select a source module [3616] everything between the aggregator at the [3618] end there and then the source module at [3619] the beginning there turns gray well it's [3621] because make.com is just trying to tell [3622] you that hey all of the data inside of [3625] the confines and this gray stuff is [3626] inaccessible you can't actually access [3628] it the only data you get to access is [3630] the data from the output the data from [3631] the aggregator so almost in away you can [3634] think of this as just one big module [3636] essentially just stack these this is [3639] sort of like our our big module and we [3641] can only access the output of that [3642] module in subsequent modules what do I [3645] mean by this well I have a little [3646] example set up with the same idea I'm [3648] searching through a bunch of rows and [3650] then what I'm doing here is for whatever [3652] reason I'm setting the full name to [3653] lowercase and that's sort of what's [3655] going on inside of this flow and then [3657] I'm aggregating all of this data and I'm [3659] aggregating the profile URL the full [3660] name and the title okay so I'm just [3662] going to run [3664] this and it's going to tell me that a [3665] Transformer should not be the last modin [3667] route that's fine so I'm just going to [3669] run this and you'll see what happened we [3670] ran this scenario once and then the set [3673] full name lower instantly ran 50 times [3675] because it ran for every single I [3677] shouldn't have done 50 Ops but screw it [3680] uh it ran every single time for every [3681] single full name here and then the [3683] output of this module 50 times was full [3685] name lower with the full lower name [3687] right so that's pretty cool what if we [3689] wanted to access this and maybe we [3691] wanted to index it later well if I give [3692] this a click hey I can't see it anywhere [3696] where is set full name lower the reason [3698] why you can't see it is because it's in [3700] this dark gray section the only [3702] variables that are accessible to modules [3704] after the it sorry after the aggregator [3707] after the gray section is the last one [3708] is the actual array aggregator and [3711] that's why it allows you to pick the [3712] aggregated fields because if you don't [3715] pick the cre field it's just assuming [3717] that this is just some intermediary step [3718] you're doing to calculate something or [3720] whatever so if I want to select this [3722] full name lower and then let me instead [3724] of running 50 wasting 50 of my [3726] operations why don't I just waste five [3728] that sounds a little [3730] nicer um and then let's unlink this if I [3732] run this now you'll see this ran a [3735] humble five times and the output of this [3737] is going to be an array with five items [3740] and they'll be the full name lower [3742] associated with every single one of [3743] these records right so collection three [3746] was Kenny collection four you know this [3749] is all the way on the right side of my [3750] screen so apologies that was being cut [3752] off um Colin this last one was Ibraham [3755] right and now that I connect this to the [3757] inaccessible variable well now I can [3759] actually I can actually connect this [3761] basically granted keep in mind because [3763] this is now in an array I still do have [3764] to um index it right but if I didn't [3768] want to index it um you know I there are [3769] a variety of other things that I could [3771] do here um you know I could iterate this [3773] I could turn this back into an array or [3774] something like that um I could also take [3778] um right over here I could take the [3780] bundle order [3782] position I could then run this output [3786] this I now have a variable called bundle [3788] order [3789] position and then I could go back to [3792] inaccessible variables and then I could [3794] pull the full name lower of the thing [3796] that has the bundle order position so [3797] this will pull basically this will [3799] basically like null nullify what I just [3800] did here um and you know so on and so on [3803] and so forth so yeah that's uh that's [3806] pretty interesting pretty cool and uh [3808] that's why aggregator data is [3809] inaccessible outside of the flow you [3811] just can't um you know you can't select [3813] any data outside of the flow because [3815] make.com doesn't want you to it doesn't [3816] really make any sense I mean think about [3818] it this is going to run five times and [3820] then everything after this is just going [3821] to run once so how does it logically [3822] make sense that you should be able to [3824] access the data inside five times you [3826] can't right all right and down here I [3828] say you can get around this by using set [3829] and get variables uh you can you can [3832] basically use what's whatever is [3834] occurring in the middle of this [3836] flow [3838] to generate something new like uh you [3842] could generate your own array and then [3844] pull it afterwards and I'm just going to [3846] show you this for the purposes of being [3847] complete um I don't actually recommend [3849] that most people here do this it just [3851] seems like sort of an unnecessarily [3852] complex data structure but theoretically [3855] let's say we have some you know we start [3856] the scenario outside of the aggregator [3858] here okay and then I have a set multiple [3860] variables module here and the the first [3863] variable that I add is just going to be [3864] called like uh I don't know example [3866] array and so what I've done is I've gone [3869] to array and then I've said empty array [3871] so I'm instantiating an empty array all [3874] right then what I do inside of this [3876] aggregator is I will actually then [3879] get my example [3884] array and then afterwards I will [3888] set my example [3892] array and it's going to be [3896] um we'll go add I'm going to select my [3900] example array from before and then I'm [3902] just going to add uh let me [3905] think I don't know let's just say the [3907] bundle order position so I'm adding the [3909] bundle order position to my example [3911] array what this means is I'm going to [3913] have an [3914] array and that array is going to [3916] populate itself with the current bundle [3918] order position that is coming out of [3919] this Google Sheets module on every [3921] subsequent run inside of the aggregator [3923] and then what I'm going to do is after [3925] I'm done with all of the aggregation [3927] stuff I'm then going to get my example [3931] array so let me just go through here and [3934] make sure this is all good AR great [3935] we're selecting the right place awesome [3938] um now that I think about it we don't [3939] actually need this we just need [3942] this so I'm going to rename this for [3945] Simplicity set example [3947] array this is going to be get example [3951] right the variable that we are then [3953] going to use from this is going to be um [3955] add to example array and then I just [3959] realized here [3960] that um what we need is yeah we need [3963] this output here and then aggregator [3966] names have just changed so it needs me [3967] to refresh this and then the variable [3970] that I'm going to get back here is this [3971] all right so watch what happens when I [3972] run [3974] this oh sorry I think there was a filter [3976] or [3978] something oh yeah there was an [3981] additional module here from a previous [3982] test don't worry about that okay give [3985] this thing a run [3986] and let's see what happened first of all [3987] we set an example array the example [3989] array was an empty array because we're [3991] using array functions and this is just a [3993] predefined array function called create [3995] an empty array basically and so it [3997] starts off with zero elements inside we [4000] then go through the first stage in our [4002] aggregating flow where we will search [4005] for rows and then we will have five [4008] bundles now because we're starting this [4010] with five bundles that means every [4012] subsequent module inside of this until [4013] it's aggregated will run five times so [4016] what we're doing is immediately after we [4018] run we will get the example array now [4021] the first time it runs it's going to be [4022] empty the second time it runs though [4024] there's going to be this value one in it [4026] the third time it runs is going to be [4028] value one and two the fourth time it [4029] runs it'll be one two three and the [4031] fifth time it runs it'll be 1 2 3 4 why [4033] well that's because after this it's [4035] actually adding to an example array [4037] afterwards right over here so this is [4039] actually doing the add function which we [4041] talked about where it basically just [4042] grabs the current bundle number and then [4044] it adds it to the the um the [4047] module then we will take all of this [4049] data and then we'll actually aggregate [4051] it and turn it into one um variable [4053] right we'll we'll turn it into an array [4055] again now we didn't select anything [4057] inside of here which is why all of the [4059] data inside is just the profile URL full [4061] name and title but check this out we use [4063] the get variable module afterwards we [4066] get this variable and it actually has [4068] all of the variables inside or all of [4071] the numbers inside even though we didn't [4073] access it using the array aggregator [4076] so this is a little workaround that you [4077] can do to access things from within an [4079] aggregator flow um assuming that you [4081] know how to use the get and the set [4083] variables there are a few instances in [4085] which you'll actually need this um aside [4087] from my content flow which I'm going to [4088] show you in a moment but this is just [4090] like an extra tool in your kit that you [4091] could use know that you can just set and [4094] Pull and get essentially variables from [4096] anywhere in a make.com flow as long as [4098] you just call them by name like you [4100] notice how it says get exampler right [4102] I'm not feeding in a variable here I [4104] don't feed in the title I actually just [4105] feed in the name example array that's [4107] because the raw name of this array is [4109] called example array so you need to just [4111] write it in like plain text like [4113] this but all right um we are getting [4115] into some real edge cases [4117] now now we're going to talk about the [4119] three different kinds of aggregators so [4122] I may have misled you up until now to [4123] think that there's actually just one [4124] type of aggregator that there's just [4126] that green aggregator module right but [4128] it turns out there's actually three [4130] different types of aggregators which are [4132] quite interesting um and not all of them [4135] are super valuable or useful uh I'm [4137] going to talk about two of them one's [4138] called the text aggregator the other's [4140] called the numeric aggregator and the [4141] last one's called the table aggregator [4143] but I just never use the table [4144] aggregator so personally I wouldn't [4145] worry about it I've made a fair amount [4147] of casola with make.com at this point if [4149] I haven't needed the table aggregator to [4150] do it I don't know there probably some [4152] edge cases in which you can but you can [4153] also just format the data using anything [4155] else so not a big deal yeah so that's [4158] the text and the numeric aggregator [4159] let's actually go through some some [4161] practical examples of what this looks [4162] like though I have a little example [4164] scenario set up called the three [4166] different kinds of aggregators and [4168] inside of it I have a Google sheet [4169] search rows module this is doing the [4171] same thing that our previous flows were [4172] it's just instead of 50 I'm going right [4173] three God I'm a lunatic what was I [4175] thinking uh I then have a function here [4177] called full name lower and the purpose [4179] of this is just to grab the full name [4180] and again just to make it lowercase and [4182] then I have an array aggregator here and [4185] what this is going to do is I just want [4186] to pull the full name lowercase and then [4187] I also want to pull the profile name [4188] full name and title you know if you [4189] think about it logically you don't [4190] actually need to do this within the [4192] aggregator you could just make the full [4193] name lower case afterwards but screw [4195] we're having fun all right so if I run [4199] this now I click run anyway what do we [4201] expect is going to happen we just [4203] outputed five bundles from the Google [4205] Sheets search row module right then we [4207] passed through here I'm sorry I think I [4209] wrote three my bad we just outputed [4212] three bundles from the search Rose [4213] module and then we passed it through [4215] this module here which just turns all [4216] the full names to lowercase individually [4218] per bundle right and then we have an [4220] array aggregator which took those three [4222] sort of like made it all big and then it [4223] like turned that back into to into an [4225] array that's sort of like why it looks [4227] like this right we have multiple [4228] elements and that's being converted into [4229] one array whereas the iterator looks [4231] exact opposite it has like a you know [4233] one array and is turning into multiple [4235] bundles but anyway uh what's the output [4237] of this well it's an array with three [4238] elements with profile URL full name [4240] title full name lower profile URL full [4242] name title full name lower profile URL [4244] full name title and full name lower this [4246] is expected Behavior right but now let's [4249] look at these other two aggregators we [4251] have one called numeric aggregator and [4252] then we have another one called text [4253] aggregator and this is pretty dang [4255] interesting to me um so why don't we use [4257] both what I'm going to do is I'm going [4259] to unlink this array aggregator I'm [4261] going to grab this text aggregator [4263] instead and let's let's run through and [4265] let's see how it works the first field [4267] here that we can manipulate is the [4268] source module field and you'll see it [4270] works very similarly to the green [4272] aggregator where you can select what you [4274] want to be your Source module and what [4276] we want to be our source module is this [4278] Google sheet search row module so I'm [4279] going to give that a click and then what [4281] you see is this text field and you're [4284] thinking what the hell does this text [4285] field mean well the really cool thing in [4287] this text field is basically for every [4290] element in your aggregated array it'll [4294] just go through and then concatenate [4295] them all together it'll just add them [4297] all together for you what do I mean by [4299] that if I go full name lower and then [4301] afterwards I add a [4302] space and then I give this thing a run [4306] it will take all of those names and it [4308] will just concatenate them one after the [4310] other so cayb Pennington was the first [4312] ireni was the second Kenny was the third [4316] and so this text [4317] aggregator um as you see here you could [4319] use it to do quite a quite a lot to be [4321] completely honest you could have this be [4323] like a list for instance of of names or [4326] something I don't know maybe if you're [4327] trying to format an email or something [4329] you could have this be um a list of [4331] names where you have the full name lower [4334] and you output this and now you have [4336] this text with full name lower if we go [4339] and we feed this back into an email [4341] maybe you're trying to automate a [4343] function where you will email people [4345] with the content saying these people [4347] have been very bad indeed and then you [4351] feed in this text I'm just going to say [4355] test what'll happen when you run this [4357] thing is it's going to generate an [4360] email with this text saying these people [4363] have been very bad indeed Kayla reny [4365] Kenny um and we were able to do that [4367] because we took all that data and then [4368] we just uh we we created like a big text [4370] string by iterating over the stuff in [4372] the aggregator essentially we were able [4374] to do this with just one operation as [4375] opposed to having to split this into two [4377] where we grab all the elements from the [4378] array and then we have to iterate them [4380] iterate through them all manually so the [4382] text aggregator just allows you to [4383] create like some pretty cool text [4384] strings if I'm being honest um whether [4386] these text strings are totally required [4389] uh whether this module is totally [4390] required or not I think that's Up For [4391] Debate I don't really think it is um but [4393] you know there there's a lot that you [4394] could do with it there's also a row [4395] separator and the reason why I said that [4397] the table aggregator doesn't really do [4398] anything is because you could just do it [4399] all here with the row separator um you [4401] could have it be a new row you could [4403] separate things by tab Maybe every [4405] element is now separated by tab instead [4407] of a new line for instance so I'm going [4408] to unlink this run this [4410] again you know and now you see it's [4412] separated by tab instead right um the [4414] table aggregator does the same thing um [4416] twice for some reason but anyway uh yeah [4418] that's what the text aggregator does and [4419] you can do a lot of things practically [4421] like create a big list for instance of [4423] records that some staff member needs to [4425] check or maybe you create an email that [4427] automatically sends it to people for [4428] their late payments with itemized [4430] invoice there are a variety of functions [4432] that you could use tax aggregators for [4434] and I'm really just scratching this [4435] surface the other function you could use [4437] is this numeric aggregator and this [4439] functions similarly in that we select [4441] the source module but then there's this [4442] additional field called aggregate [4444] function with average sum count maximum [4446] value and Min and what this really is is [4448] this is just like a mathematical [4449] function let's hypothetically say if I [4452] go back to our initial sheet here and [4453] then I insert a new column and I call [4455] this uh money let's say for whatever [4457] reason I'm counting up the money that [4459] these people owe us [4463] okay and I'm just going to pull one two [4465] three four five [4467] records so I'm go back to my Google [4469] sheet I'm just C five because I want to [4471] pull this money field okay now the [4473] source module I'm going to use is this [4474] Google Sheets and what I want to count [4476] is I just want to count the total amount [4477] of money that all these people owe [4479] me and uh because I haven't actually run [4481] this yet I got to run this just once [4483] before I can uh fill out the money there [4485] you [4486] go what this numeric aggregator will do [4489] is it'll function similar to the text [4490] aggregator in so far that it will go [4492] through and then it will just let us do [4493] two things in one uh basically it'll [4495] create an array with that data and then [4497] it'll just sum all of the numbers in [4498] that array for us so I mean now it say [4501] sum 312 down there well let's see what [4503] happens when we run this numeric [4504] aggregator you'll see that the sum is [4506] 312 if hypothetically you wanted to [4508] count up the average amount of money [4509] that every person owed you well what [4511] it's sort of doing behind the scenes is [4512] it's creating an array and then it's [4514] calculating the average amount of money [4516] 62.4 um you could do count you could [4518] count the number of elements which is [4519] sort of Superfluous you don't really [4520] need to do that because we get all that [4521] data from Google Sheets anyway you get [4523] the minimum value maybe in an email you [4526] want to say you know the least amount of [4527] money somebody owes us is $37 but then [4530] uh some people owe us as much money as1 [4533] 125 right variety of different ways that [4535] you could use the numeric aggregator and [4537] while you know none of these are mission [4538] critical or super important they are [4540] just another tool in your tool belt that [4542] you could use I use both the numeric [4543] aggregator and the text aggregator [4545] pretty commonly in my own flows [4546] especially um the text aggregator when [4548] I'm sending emails that pull from like [4550] tabular data like a spreadsheet or a CRM [4552] and then the numeric one anytime I'm [4553] calculating averages sums just doing [4556] some type of like uh you know array [4558] number function all right now that we've [4560] learned basically everything we need to [4562] know about iterators and aggregators to [4563] actually make cool stuff happen let me [4565] run through a practical example just to [4567] consolidate all of that knowledge and [4569] turn it into something that you know you [4571] guys can actually go out there and [4572] either sell or build for yourselves so [4574] this is a real system my content [4576] generator pipeline that I have sold for [4578] over $5,000 um I've used it as part of [4580] my own business I eded it as part of a [4582] dozen or more businesses and I've [4583] created a blueprint for this that I've [4585] given out to probably over 500 people by [4587] now something like that depending on how [4589] my gum Road looks maybe it's more um [4592] this flow makes gratuitous use of [4594] iterators and agats and basically the [4596] reason why I'm showing you guys this is [4597] because if you understand what I'm about [4598] to show you you basically get it you [4600] sort of understand how these work sure [4602] you may take this data or this knowledge [4604] and then try and make something yourself [4606] and then it might not work the first few [4607] times you might be like why the hell is [4608] this data showing here but you'll know [4610] enough that you'll be able to a diagnose [4612] it very very quickly and then B when you [4614] find do get it it'll be like that aha [4616] moment and you'll never struggle with it [4617] again I'm talking about this because [4620] this is my experience as well I've done [4622] basically exactly what a lot of the [4623] people that are watching this video are [4625] doing right now and are going through so [4627] yeah I'm just going to run you guys [4628] through this from top to bottom now when [4630] I tried this about uh I don't know three [4632] or four hours ago um the claw API which [4635] is what I use now as part of this flow I [4637] was actually down so I don't actually [4638] know if it's going to be up or if it's [4639] going to be working um so I'm just going [4641] to run this just a single time right now [4643] just to give it a little peek [4645] see how things are going if our Almighty [4648] uh Lord and Savior AI is down then GG no [4650] it's not okay great it's up uh let me [4653] run you through what's going on here [4654] basically what I have is I have a simple [4656] type form set up a type form is just a [4657] form platform if you guys are unfamiliar [4659] with how that works uh and this form [4661] platform is just like a way that you can [4664] uh you know fill out like give give [4666] customers a very simple form and then [4668] map that into make.com so if you haven't [4670] used type form before I highly recommend [4671] it's very simple I'm not going to go [4673] into the details of what that looks like [4674] I'm just going to show you the input and [4675] the output essentially what we have is [4678] we have a um I just realized that that [4682] is definitely not the data that I wanted [4684] to pull WQ DQ WD all right let me [4688] actually pull out the right data here [4690] geez that's [4691] funny um why don't we pull out let's [4695] see let's do this one [4698] here okay let's actually run this let's [4701] check out the mapable answers that is [4704] definitely not [4706] correct I used to do so much testing on [4709] this thing that's probably why it's not [4712] uh then we just do 10 and then we'll [4714] just grab the last [4717] 10 yeah don't use cerlic when you're [4719] filling this format okay great so uh as [4721] you see it's outputting multiple bundles [4722] so this is the same type of module like [4724] the search rows module in so far that [4726] it's listing a bunch of different [4728] responses we have tons of little little [4730] bundles [4731] here okay so I'm going to grab the [4733] second last one [4736] which is just uh it looks like it's just [4739] some one about achieving a Hollywood [4742] level smile give this a [4744] run awesome that that looks like uh like [4747] it's working so I'm actually just going [4748] to run this full thing and basically [4749] what happens is first we're listing [4751] these responses and we're just grabbing [4752] the responses to the form okay and um [4755] you know you can fill this form out the [4757] second that you fill it out it'll run [4758] this watch responses module and then [4760] it'll trigger this which actually just [4761] gets all the data for us after that what [4763] we're doing is I'm adding it to to a [4764] Google sheet and I'm just adding into a [4766] Google sheet because I want to um have [4768] all of that data stored somewhere I [4770] basically want to know hey every time [4772] this somebody fills out the form what [4773] time did they fill out the form who are [4775] they that filled out the form uh what [4777] data did they put in the form just so [4778] that if anybody ever goes WQ wddd again [4781] and puts in a bunch of cerlic characters [4784] I can just look back and then be like [4785] hey y'all aren't using the form right [4787] then after we search rows and you'll see [4789] what happens after we search the rows [4791] right you're thinking this is a list uh [4793] this is a search iterator modle so it [4795] should probably output multiple bundles [4796] right but I've actually set the number [4799] of returned rows to one and so in this [4801] case we're only getting one bundle from [4803] that module so we're not iterating [4806] through we're not automatically creating [4807] multiple runs from that on afterwards [4810] we're setting variables I have a bunch [4812] of variables set up here which I will [4814] show you in just a moment after this [4816] flow completes um but essentially we [4818] have a bunch of variables set up and [4820] those variables include things [4823] like title word count primary word count [4826] secondary keywords internal links [4829] external links as well as some [4830] additional instructions and the reason [4832] why I'm turning this from a form [4834] previously and just resetting all of [4836] these variables here is just because I [4838] personally think it's a little simpler [4840] and moreover it becomes really easy to [4841] test flows when you have a couple of set [4843] variables modules because in the future [4845] if you ever just want to run this whole [4846] scenario um on your own data like you're [4848] not 100% sure that this is going to work [4850] so you just want to like try it with [4851] hardcoded data you don't actually have [4853] to like change all of the data every [4855] single one of these you only have to [4856] change a set variables module um because [4858] as long as everything subsequently from [4860] then on is pulling from the set [4861] variables module you'll be good let me [4864] show you what I mean if I give this a [4865] click you see we have title title word [4867] count primary keywords secondary [4868] keywords we have some logic here but [4870] that's unimportant notice how the CLA [4872] prompt is actually pulling directly from [4876] this so in the future if I ever wanted [4878] to change this and I just wanted to say [4880] you know what I just want to run a [4880] hardcoded test on like how to make [4883] pineapple pizza cuz I am the spawn of [4885] Satan uh I would just add the data here [4888] and then from future modules that pull [4890] from this um it would just all pull like [4893] the data would just be formatted [4894] perfectly correctly it'd be pulling from [4895] the right module in the future if I [4896] wanted to switch this back all I'd have [4898] to do is go here and then switch this to [4899] title and click okay so it's just a much [4901] easier testing Paradigm anyway from then [4904] on what I'm doing is I'm getting AI so [4905] anthropic Claud specifically to produce [4908] a whole outline in what's called [4909] markdown format of the content so [4911] introduction definition of Hollywood [4913] smells the evolution of the Hollywood SM [4915] etc etc and then once I have all this [4917] stuff I'm using the markdown to HTML [4919] module to convert this markdown format [4922] and markdown is just anything with like [4923] a hashtag like this that stands for an [4925] H1 this stands for an H2 it's just like [4927] a different way to format and it's [4929] taking this big input and it's turning [4931] this into output of HTML now the reason [4934] why I'm doing this is because I want to [4936] be able to make a Google Docs outline [4938] really quickly and basically Google Docs [4940] requires that I have a uh like html's [4943] input so you know that's how I'm getting [4945] these headings and these introductions [4947] and all this stuff right that's how I'm [4948] basically generating this content um you [4951] know all together and now we're starting [4953] to get to the interesting Parts because [4954] now we're about to get to the iterator [4956] so what happens after is I will take [4959] this and I will create what's called an [4960] input brief I'll basically take the [4962] output of Claud right over here and [4965] again you're probably wondering hey why [4967] are you using a set variable module to [4969] like just add CLA input when you could [4971] just use this as your input well the [4973] reason why is again just want to be able [4974] to test this flow very quickly so I'm [4976] just taking you know if I ever have like [4978] a hardcoded thing I would just I would [4979] just write it right here and then the [4981] rest of my flow um would use that [4984] variable but this is where things get [4986] interesting and this is where the [4987] iterator starts coming into play along [4988] with the aggregator as you see what [4990] we're doing is we're we're um iterating [4992] through something and then what we're [4994] doing because you can see by the [4995] presence of the gray we are then [4997] aggregating all of the section text [4999] using the text aggregator right this is [5001] a practical usage of that aggregator [5003] we're also setting inputs setting [5005] section text and then getting inputs and [5007] getting section texts uh which is pretty [5009] interesting um you know in light of the [5012] fact that I I ran you guys how to do [5013] that over here with getting and setting [5015] example rays but okay great so what are [5017] we actually doing and how does this work [5018] so after we get the input brief right we [5020] now just have a variable with the result [5022] of the previous CLA thing which is just [5024] a big markdown outline what we're doing [5026] is we are iterating over this text and [5029] the way that I'm iterating is first I'm [5031] creating an array and I'm creating an [5033] array [5035] by splitting this input [5038] brief [5041] into um how do I show you guys this [5044] simply okay so this is the input brief [5046] right here right and what I'm doing is [5047] I'm basically finding every new line and [5048] I'm using that to cut this thing into an [5050] array so now this is one Element this is [5054] another element this is another element [5056] this is another element this is another [5057] element this is another element so on [5059] and so on and so forth okay I'm [5061] splitting this by the presence of a new [5062] line and that's why if you look at the [5064] output you'll see here that this is 56 [5066] elements inside because what I do is I [5069] split it and then I iterate over it so [5071] that's what this iterator modle is doing [5072] which turns an array with 56 elements in [5074] it up here into um 56 different bundles [5079] basically which all run [5081] independently next I look to see if the [5084] section starts with an H2 so if the [5087] value of this output starts with an H2 [5089] starts with these two hashtags I know [5091] that it's like a heading right it's like [5093] uh this is going to be a that we're [5094] going to write it's going to be at least [5095] a few paragraphs in there so if it [5097] doesn't start with those two then I [5099] don't worry about [5100] it and there are other ways that you [5102] could have done that I could have done [5103] this I could have mapped over it and [5104] looked for the presence of contains you [5106] know two hashtags or something um I [5108] could have done this a variety of other [5109] ways but I chose to use a filter and so [5112] what it did is it found that we had 11 [5115] H2S inside of this big outline and then [5117] for every H2 we're now going to generate [5119] content for it the real tricky and Nifty [5122] way of doing so is we will set the the [5124] section input of this um of this flow [5128] which essentially is a really shitty [5130] name for it but what we'll do is we will [5132] replace the whole okay we'll go into [5136] this input brief which I showed you back [5138] over here which is just the whole text [5140] Chunk um of the outline and markdown and [5143] we will replace the text that we found [5147] with the [5148] heading with the same text plus this [5151] little [5152] arrow and if you're UNAM amiliar with [5154] how AI Works in general one of the big [5156] issues with generating content is AI [5159] will usually lose its place and sort of [5161] forget where it is and forget why it's [5162] doing what it's doing so this is a way [5164] that we can basically um just create a [5168] whole another brief so we just duplicate [5171] the exact same brief but the only thing [5172] we do that's different is we will add a [5173] little arrow next to the section that we [5175] wanted to write on and I'll show you [5178] guys why and you're going to have an aha [5179] moment if you haven't already but [5182] essentially this section input [5185] then looks like actually let's go to the [5186] let's go to the second one here this [5188] section input now looks like this we [5190] have the exact same outline the only [5193] difference is we have an arrow next to [5195] the heading that we're going to be [5196] writing and so this is what we're [5197] feeding into Ai and what we're saying to [5199] the AI is hey I want you to write a [5202] section but only for the heading that [5204] has the arrow next to it and the reason [5206] why is because we want it to know what [5207] it talked about before we want it to [5209] know what it talked about after but we [5211] don't want to have to spend all the [5212] tokens in order to do it and the quality [5215] of AI tends to go down the longer the [5216] token count is so this is just a way for [5218] it to be like K I probably talked [5220] about the impact of perfect smiles and [5222] popular cultures I talked about the [5223] components of a Hollywood smile after so [5225] in this section I'm going to talk about [5227] this and that and that and that and I'm [5228] going to lead into the next paragraph [5230] and I'm going to I'm going to lead out [5231] right so what we do is we take that and [5234] that's what we feed as input into this [5236] the following is an outline for an [5238] awardwinning article your task is to [5239] write one section one section only the [5240] one marked by an arrow write in a way [5242] that's accommodating a previous and [5243] future paragraphs tone of always mildly [5244] Spartan obviously the prompt depends on [5246] whatever the hell you want but then we [5247] feed in the section input now notice [5249] that we're still doing this within the [5251] iterator an aggregator dark section [5254] right so we basically written this but [5256] none of this is accessible to Future [5258] modules and so in order to do stuff with [5261] this what we need to do is we then set a [5263] section text over here which is we we [5265] set the text that we just generated and [5267] we put that in its own [5269] variable so you see it wrote a big [5271] section on Hollywood smiles over here [5273] right that's the first section um this [5275] is the section the second section that's [5277] a tongue [5279] twister and I'm going to avoid this [5280] route just for now but what we do is [5283] after we set this we will then get it we [5287] do it because of this other function [5288] which I'll show you above but we get it [5290] again and then we just feed all that [5292] into a text aggregator here and so all [5295] we're doing is we're just aggregating it [5296] we're just sticking it all together and [5298] we do it one section after another using [5300] this get Section text so if you know [5303] what [5304] I've talked about over the course of the [5305] last like hour hour and a half if you've [5307] gotten to that point everything that [5309] I've talked about so far should make [5310] sense to you there are a bunch of gets [5312] and sets and you may be unfamiliar with [5314] that specific design pattern but the [5316] actual iterator part where we will split [5319] the input brief based off a new line so [5321] now we have an array with 56 elements [5323] and then we feed that into an iterator [5324] well it's going to be 56 bundles then we [5327] run 56 bundles we're using a filter it [5329] only gets 11 of them and then because we [5331] have 11 bundles remaining it's going to [5332] run every module at least 11 times right [5334] all of this stuff should be pretty [5335] familiar to you you should sort of get [5336] it at the end what we do is we get a [5339] section [5340] text and then the section text as you [5343] see we feed in like 10 or 11 [5346] bundles all with their own paragraphs [5349] and stuff what we do is we aggregate it [5350] all together and then voila we have the [5351] full article here which is you know [5353] super crazy long [5355] usually yeah it's it's like 1500 2,000 [5358] words then what we do is we will convert [5360] the markdown to [5361] HTML so we'll turn all that mark down [5364] back into HTML and then we'll be able to [5366] create an article with it in Google Docs [5368] which then you can just open up and take [5370] a look at here and it doesn't look very [5372] nicely formatted here just because I [5373] haven't set the formatting [5376] um oops didn't want to do that uh but if [5379] you add if you add some spaces and stuff [5381] like that looks pretty good right um and [5384] that's how the AI content generator [5385] works now there's one section that I [5387] missed out on and this is a pretty [5388] interesting section um but I would [5390] consider pretty Advanced but essentially [5392] what we've done is within the iterator [5393] and AG flow what I came to realize after [5396] I generated some of this stuff um was [5398] that a lot of the time the sections just [5400] looked really really repetitive and it [5401] was just the same sort of thing just you [5403] know just non-stop paragraph after [5404] paragraph after paragraph and I wanted [5406] to uh make it a little different I [5408] wanted to like spice it up a bit so what [5410] I did is I created a route a route here [5413] and inside of that route I had two [5416] subsequent modules one here which fed [5419] into the rest of my aggregator flow [5421] which is why it's under a dark section [5422] and then another here which has 25% on [5425] it and what I did here is I set a [5428] function up where basically if [5432] um uh I basically gave it a 25% chance [5435] of running that route and 25% of the [5438] time I to run the route the other 25% [5440] time I wouldn't run the route if it did [5441] run the route 25% of the time what I'd [5443] do is I'd feed it into Ai and then I [5445] would edit the text to break up the flow [5447] to add bullet points and subheadings [5449] were needed for variety essentially all [5452] that this does all that the purpose this [5454] is to do is just to add a couple of [5456] additional uh ways to spice up the [5458] content a bit so it's just not all just [5460] a huge block of text essentially and [5462] then notice that after that run I would [5464] set the section text and then it would [5466] go down here and then get the section [5468] text so this is sort of how how it [5470] worked it would uh complete the run it [5472] would then get the section text of the [5474] previous run right over here um and then [5477] you know that's how I that's how i' [5479] basically build the content in a [5480] slightly more interesting manner uh [5482] which uh yeah which is pretty [5484] fun so I'm just going to unlink both of [5486] these I'll link this back up here link [5488] this back over [5490] here so yeah that is it in a nutshell um [5493] if you understood what I use the [5494] iterators and the aggregators for right [5496] here then you know more than enough to [5498] go out and make real money with make.com [5500] um I firmly salute everybody that has [5503] made it to the end of this lovely video [5505] had a lot of fun putting it together [5508] essentially if I could take home one [5511] thing here [5515] essentially if I could just drive home [5516] one point here it would be that [5518] iterators turn an array into a set of [5521] bundles then aggregators turn a set of [5522] bundles into an array and that's it the [5525] only real value of aggregators are that [5527] they allow you to utilize array [5529] functions on data that otherwise would [5531] have came in in a bundle format and the [5533] only real value of iterators are they [5535] allow you to dynamically access internal [5538] variables that you otherwise wouldn't [5539] have been able to unless you would have [5540] done something silly like array indexed [5544] now that you [5545] know everything that you need to know [5547] about iterators and aggregators you [5549] should be good to get out there and make [5551] some real money with make.com because if [5553] you've been operating without them up [5555] until now you're probably you've [5557] probably been reasonably [5558] limited thanks so much for watching this [5561] video I really appreciate your guys time [5562] if you guys have any questions about how [5564] iterators or erators work just drop a [5565] comment down below I'm more than happy [5567] to attend to it um I have a blast [5569] putting these together and answering [5570] specific make.com questions so there's [5572] anything else that you guys want to know [5573] as as I mentioned I'm going to be [5574] covering map I'm going to be covering a [5575] couple of other aray functions soon just [5577] drop them down and I'll use them as [5579] inspiration for my next video otherwise [5581] please like subscribe do all that fun [5583] YouTube stuff that gets me a little bit [5584] more visibility and uh I will catch [5586] youall in the next video thanks so much [5588] bye-bye

Title: The Unconventional Daily Schedule That Got Me To $70K/Month
[0] hey everybody Nick here and in this [1] video I'm going to show you how I [2] organize my day at $70,000 per month [5] let's get into it so my net profit for [7] the last 3 months we just take the [8] average is about 70,000 a month it's [10] actually closer to 80 now because I [11] wrote this about a week and a half ago [13] but that's all right this money comes [15] from 4 five different places it comes [17] from my community which is like my [19] make.com group where I coach people [21] collectively through this group coaching [23] model then help them achieve you know 10 [25] 15 20 25k a month comes from Automation [28] Services where I actually like I run an [30] automation company and I provide [31] Automation Services mostly on retainer [33] and subscription at this point because I [34] find that the highest leverage comes [36] from my content writing company called 1 [37] second copy which is still operational [39] still chugging and still paying out the [41] owner's a fair dividend at the end of [43] every month then it comes from uh just [45] my ad revenues my Affiliates this is a [47] smaller part of the P so I'm just going [48] to group it all together but stuff like [50] YouTube ads stuff like Affiliates for [52] Fanta Buster signups smart lead signups [54] that sort of thing so the reason why I'm [57] making this video is because back in the [59] day when I wasn't really making enough [60] money to like barely live on let alone [62] you know afford some nicer conveniences [64] and stuff like that one of my favorite [65] things to do was to go on YouTube and to [68] search up like entrepreneur schedule how [71] guys that make 100K a month spend their [73] time and spend their day and the reason [75] I really like to do it is because it was [76] usually quite different like you'll find [78] that people have a very diverse array of [80] schedules and what works for some people [82] might not work for others so some people [84] were night owls some other people were [86] you know they they they woke up at 4:00 [87] a.m. grinded for the first 7 hours and [89] then then spent the the afternoon with [91] their family or something and it was so [93] diverse but what I realized is somewhere [96] in that diversity there were always [97] parallels and I realized that you know [99] people that make money because because [101] capitalism is a game right like we're [102] here just like playing a game that we [103] were sort of forced to play the second [105] we came out of the womb in order to win [107] this game there's certain things that [108] basically everybody who's even mildly [110] successful at it does and seeing those [113] things in real time and just seeing how [115] they they broke down from the big array [117] of schedules on YouTube was one of the [119] most interesting things to me and and I [121] love learning about it and since then [123] many people have asked me the same thing [125] so I thought that I'd record a video [126] doing so not to be presumptuous not [129] because I really care too much but [130] because I think it's actually going to [130] be providing you guys some value so I [134] always do this disclaimer but uh [136] everybody's different this is just my [137] process this my schedule this is what [139] works for me it's not the only way to [141] get to 70k a month and believe it or not [143] there are a lot of people that make 2 3 [145] 400k a month that I know personally that [147] work very very differently to me [149] probably work a lot less so take what [152] whatever makes sense to you guys out of [153] this video and then discard whatever [155] isn't irrelevant no gatekeeping here [157] I'll show you everything I would have [159] recorded my full day with like a 24-hour [161] Vlog type thing I thought that would [162] have been really interesting but then I [163] realized that uh my day is actually just [165] me in front of the computer so there's [167] probably no better way of recording my [168] day than just what I'm doing now all [170] right so the very first thing I want to [171] get into just before I actually break [173] down my schedule is some Concepts that [175] I've learned over the course of the last [176] few years especially as my career went [178] from you know I used to be making two or [179] three a month for most of my [180] entrepreneurial career um up to where [183] where it is now and the first is that [185] what you work on is a lot more important [187] than how much you [189] work basically in you know automation [193] specifically there's a big [195] misunderstanding between efficiency and [197] Effectiveness everybody wants to be [199] efficient but not a lot of people think [201] hard about what that means efficiency is [204] basically just the amount of time and [205] energy it takes you to do one task and [208] so if you're efficient you minimize the [209] amount of time and you minimize the [211] amount of energy to do that one task but [213] to be honest efficiency doesn't really [214] matter when I was making only a few [217] thousand per month and that was my net [218] profit and I was eating you know instant [220] Ramen soup bows I was extraordinarily [223] efficient every time a task would come [225] to me I would crush it but I was not [226] very effective because the tasks that I [228] was working on at the in the first place [231] were not the tasks that were going to [232] drive my life forward or give me a high [234] Roi so this is the number one thing that [237] if I could go back in time to when I was [238] door knocking um you know when I when I [240] first started my entrepreneurial Journey [242] this is the number one thing that I wish [243] I could like teleport back in time and [245] tell myself it would save me years of my [247] life probably quite a few gray hairs I [251] used to work door to-door where I would [253] go business to business for about eight [255] hours a day and I'd look for about 80 [257] prospects or so per day um and I did [260] some of this on my own I had a business [261] partner when the going was tough you [263] know you needed somebody to kick you in [264] the ass to keep to keep pushing and [267] essentially you know in order to get 80 [269] Pros ECT it required me eight hours so [271] like mathematically the reason I'm [273] saying this is because it was about 10 [274] Prospects an hour that were hearing that [276] were hearing my pitch right nowadays I [279] do one hour of button clicks whether [281] it's like a cold email campaign where [282] it's like Community stuff or whether [285] it's my inbound marketing now through [286] YouTube and I reach several thousand so [289] the difference there right eight [291] prospects versus versus a thousand and [293] the amount of effort that I put in is [295] completely extraordinarily different I [296] was a very efficient door kner but that [299] doesn't mean that was a right thing to [300] do it wasn't very effective to begin [302] with so yeah you know if if I could [305] combine my work ethic back then and I'll [308] say that my work ethic back then might [309] even be higher than it is now or better [311] than it is now um with Effectiveness and [314] focusing on the right things from the [315] get-go I'd be so much further ahead so [318] while you do need to work really really [319] hard in order to be successful don't let [321] me U mistake you and I and I think that [323] in order for me to continue growing in [325] my financial success and in my run out [327] of YouTube I need to continue working [328] harder and harder and harder not let and [330] less and less um you know if I were you [332] I would spend a few moments considering [334] how best to utilize your time and you [336] know I have a little hint down here it's [337] usually [339] customers another concept I want to get [341] into is this concept of willpower versus [343] environment design so you know we talk a [346] lot about procrastination when we talk [348] about schedules and stuff like that like [350] you know I should have gotten X Y and Z [351] done but I was so busy procrastinating I [353] was just like I watched YouTube or anime [356] for 3 hours or played some video games [358] or hung out with with my my my boyfriend [361] or something like that [362] right most people will spend their whole [365] day fighting [366] temptation they always have some nagging [369] thing at the back of their mind that's [370] like pulling them in a million different [372] directions for example right now my [374] phone is in my left pocket and I know [376] for a fact that I probably have 15 [378] notifications right there and so in a [382] way a small portion of my my brain power [384] is being dedicated to suppressing the [386] desire to pick up my phone and I really [388] should have put this on another room cuz [390] it like totally illustrates what I'm [391] about to talk about but what I've come [393] to realize is this is very ineffective [396] and this is the definition of something [398] like one of those ineffective behaviors [399] that you shouldn't be doing because [401] every single time you summon some of [402] your willpower uh you are draining your [405] effort and your total like output [406] capacity as much as people like to [408] pretend that willpower is limited it is [409] not we only really have a certain amount [411] of it every day and if you push through [413] more and more there's some there's some [414] adverse effects on things like your [416] health and your longevity your [417] well-being your your cognition [420] modern civilization makes this [422] phenomenon that used to be present but [424] not a big deal like a million trillion [426] times worse because now like you know [428] now it's a cell phone here it's like 300 [431] email notifications there it's the Tik [433] Tok and Instagram and brain rot dopamine [437] phones drugs drinks I mean I mean like [439] literally all of these industries have [441] been built up and they're very mature [442] Industries now with teams of [444] psychologists whose whole job it is to [446] try and distract you so if you try uh [449] just with your little feeble human brain [451] which evolved you know 50 100 150,000 [453] years ago the science is still out to [455] try and you know like like fight against [458] this modern industry it's like fighting [460] with sticks and stones against freaking [462] intercontinental ballistic missiles it's [464] a complete and utter waste of your time [465] you should not you should not be doing [466] it even the most stoic person and the [469] person with the most willpower will [470] inevitably give in it's simply [472] impossible not to so you don't have to [476] do this is probably the big realization [478] that I want to talk about and and also [480] the big realization that changed me um [483] you don't have to live in an environment [485] that somebody else like these companies [488] designed for you you can actually live [490] in an environment that you design for [492] yourself and you can design the [493] lifestyle that you want as long as [495] you're very conscious about it and if [496] you spend a few moments designing that [498] lifestyle you can sidestep The Willpower [501] problem entirely and substantially [502] improve your efficien uh Effectiveness [505] your your your like your work ethic [507] essentially by proxy um and ultimately [510] your success you can structure your day [511] so that there's basically nothing else [512] you can do except to work on those high [514] priority High Roi tasks so that's what I [518] do I like to build my environment in a [519] way that means that I never have to [520] expend willpower that it minimizes the [522] friction that allows me to you know it's [524] almost like I'm on a slide right every [526] day when I wake up in the morning I just [527] go down a slide and my very first stop [529] is stuff that makes me money and I sort [531] of have to do it because it's just the [533] simplest most straightforward easiest [535] most logical next step for me [539] the last thing I'm going to mention is [540] I'm a dumb monkey I acknowledge this [543] treating yourself as a dumb monkey makes [544] it as easy as possible to do the highy [546] stuff I talked about earlier without [547] giving in my guiding philosophy is not I [550] will do this today even if it's hard [553] it's how can I set up my environment and [555] how can I set up my lifestyle in a way [557] that I can continue doing this every day [559] for the next five years and this is a [560] very different question and it can be [562] pretty dang difficult to commit to but [564] when you do it your life gets a lot [565] easier a good example is um I just moved [568] apartments and there reason why I moved [569] Apartments is because there was some [571] construction occurring next door and I [573] looked at my schedule and I realized [574] that construction was going to be [575] occurring for the next 6 months or so [577] there's some balcony project basically [579] in the condo next door to me now I [581] bought my apartment so you know it's not [583] as easy as me just packing up and and [585] leaving uh but that's exactly what I did [587] I looked at the math behind um how much [589] money I was making and then how much [591] money um you know like the friction that [594] this would add to my life knowing that [595] there's some construction in the [596] background preventing me from doing my [597] daily recording at the time that I want [599] to do [599] and I said oh that doesn't make any [601] sense I'm going to move to a place where [602] I can do this uninterrupted and quiet [604] and so I found an apartment within two [606] days and I packed my up and then I [607] moved and that's why you know the [608] background's a little bit different if [609] you've been following me for quite a [610] while I changed my environment because I [613] didn't want to have to deal with the [614] constant willower of being like oh [617] you know dang that construction the [619] Jackhammer and I got to re-record my [620] videos or whatever for me it was worth [622] the time energy and the money it was a [623] logical decision that made me more [625] effective right another example is uh I [628] don't know maybe you want to take [628] vitamins more well if you want to take [630] vitamins more construct your lifestyle [632] and your environment in such a way that [634] it's very low friction put your vitamins [636] first place you see when you wake up the [637] second you get up the very first place [639] your eyes go to make a note of it and [641] then put your vitamins there put a Big [644] Chill nice glass of water with a bunch [646] of ice in it so literally the first [647] thing that you want to do when you get [648] up is oh my God that looks great you [650] reach over you pop your vitamins and [652] then done you're going to do that every [653] morning do you want to work more make [656] your workstation or the place that you [657] are spending your time working more [659] attractive more appealing more [660] comfortable um if you find yourself [663] constantly wanting to get up and go for [665] a walk or something buy yourself a [666] freaking walk and treadmill right those [667] are pretty big um find a way to put your [670] workstation in a place that gives you [671] more things to look at more scenery [672] whatever stimulates that need that [674] wanted to make you leave in the first [676] place do you want to exercise more well [678] minimize the friction between you and [680] the gym either move somewhere where you [681] have a gym in your building get a home [683] gym right um if you live far enough that [687] you can't walk you know uh uh minimize [690] the the driving friction call a friend [692] that's going to the gym and have them [693] pick you up on their way every morning I [695] mean I guarantee you if somebody's [696] downstairs waiting for you with the car [697] running you're not going to say oh maybe [699] I should skip the gym today these are [701] all real examples for my life which is [702] why I'm telling you [704] them I used to really struggle with [706] getting out of bed in the morning and so [708] let's actually dive into the the first [709] part of my schedule I used to really [710] struggle with getting out of bed in the [711] morning I used to spend half an hour 45 [714] minutes rolling around and most of the [715] time I'd just be staring at the ceiling [718] or I'd be thinking about the various [719] goings on earlier um you know the [721] previous day and that's okay you know I [723] think you should have time that you're [724] bored where you're just thinking but I [727] know that for me it wasn't just about [729] rolling around and like enjoying sorry [732] it wasn't just about like planning my [733] day it wasn't just about thinking it [734] wasn't it wasn't about meditating I was [735] just wasting my time so my little hack [738] now which is super controversial and [739] tons of people are like you should never [740] be doing this uh you know even some [742] members in my community bunch of my [744] close friends my parents for sure is I [747] just put my laptop right next to my bed [750] when I wake up the first thing I will do [751] is I'll just roll over and then work on [753] the first thing on my to-do list and [755] it's just so much easier that way [757] because if you think about it my [758] computer is way more engaging than [760] staring at the ceiling if the only [762] effort I have to expend [764] is and then you know pick up my laptop [766] and open it that's basically no effort [768] at all my brain is willing to do that [769] every morning and then since I'm usually [772] groggy in the mornings and waking up [774] takes me around 45 minutes anyway you [777] know before I'm at like Peak cognitive [778] capacity [780] I basically reclaim my whole my whole 45 [782] minutes and that in that way I get to [784] add time that is wasted or sunk or dead [786] for most other people and then I get to [788] and then I get to work the reason why I [790] think this is silly or the reason why I [792] think so many people think this is silly [793] is because by you staring at a screen [795] first thing in the morning or whatever [796] it's like uh constructing your day in an [798] unhealthy way but I think about you know [800] my health not necessarily is it's not [804] that I don't think my health is [805] important I do I think my health is [806] really important but I think about my [807] goal and my goal right now is growing my [810] business so if my goal is growing my [812] business in order to be as effective as [813] possible why shouldn't I spend all my [815] time doing it or should shouldn't I [816] structure my day in a way that allows me [817] to spend more time doing it this is the [820] first thing that I do every morning [821] because this the most important thing [823] that I have to do every morning a lot of [825] people try and meditate and they take [826] cold showers and they do um tons of the [829] these these very healthy things that I [830] think are great holistically for their [832] life but don't really Drive Roi in the [834] place that they probably want to see the [836] most success which is their business um [838] so I can just all that later you [840] know when I'm not just rolling around in [842] bed wasting my time I can bang out the [845] highest Roi part of my day first and [846] then I can meditate I can take my cold [847] showers and that's sort of that's sort [849] of how I structure my day I focus on the [851] high Roy stuff that drives [852] Revenue because that's what's the most [854] important to me so being clear on what's [856] most important to you is obviously a [857] prerequisite for this do some thinking [859] if you have to but um yeah that's just a [862] little example of how I do things also I [864] know I said I was going to talk about a [865] schedule and here I say no schedules I [868] just mean I don't really have like [869] defined start and end times to the [871] various tasks in my day um you know a [874] lot of people have like defined I take [875] lunch every morning every afternoon at [877] 12 for instance I I I don't have that my [879] day is still a little bit more flexible [881] and I find that flexibility is really [882] important because I do have some days [884] where I deviate in terms of my cognitive [886] output some days where I don't sleep too [887] well or whatever I want to be able to I [891] want to give myself a little bit of [892] slack and a little bit of buffer room so [895] uh my natural rhythm is good to me so I [897] just listen to my natural Rhythm and and [899] the reason why I can't really have a [900] schedule is because I just don't use an [901] alarm I just wake up around the same 30 [904] minute intervals or so which is about [905] 6:00 a.m. and then I get light first [907] thing um this guy called Andrew huberman [908] if you guys are familiar talks a lot [910] about the benefits of um light first [911] thing in the morning and uh that's [913] another reason why I moved I wasn't [914] really getting a lot of light early in [916] the morning and I I structured my day [918] and my lifestyle in a way now where like [919] the first thing I do is I just sit right [920] here I have these huge floorless ceiling [922] Windows where light just poures in which [924] is quite nice all right let's actually [926] talk about my average day so this is a [929] screenshot from um a Time tracking [931] platform that I usually recommend called [933] rise you guys are unfamiliar with rise [935] it's basically the most invasive privacy [938] killing tool on planet Earth it uh [941] constantly tracks literally everything [943] you do on your computer all day long and [947] I love it I use it all the time what I [950] use it for is so that at the end of the [952] day when I go man I did a lot of work [954] today I can actually open up my thing [957] and it can confirm whether or not I [958] actually did a lot of work work that or [959] spent a lot of time on work because what [961] I was Finding is a lot of the time that [963] I thought I was doing work I was really [964] just spending it on Mindless silly [966]  that didn't add to my bottom [967] line like meetings for the most part or [969] I took very long breaks and I didn't [971] really consider them breaks or that sort [972] of thing so um I I have an affiliate [975] code Belo if you guys want to sign up [977] I'm not pushing you to I just really [978] like their platform there's probably [979] four or five other ones that do [980] something quite similar rise to me is [982] just the most consistent because they [983] also have a little coach now where if [985] you um if it finds you on social media [987] or something it'll just say hey man like [989] are you sure you want to be on social [990] media right now you said that you wanted [991] to work today and I'm like ah yeah [992] you're right click you know it's just [994] like a passive lifestyle thing that [996] slowly guides your behavior back to [998] where you want it to be and sort of [1000] fights against your inbuilt human nature [1001] to just procrastinate and be lazy and [1004] whatnot so yeah you know my my actual [1007] schedule looks like this basically every [1008] day and uh look like this today I'm [1010] currently a deep work in the midm [1012] morning hours 2 to three but yeah I wake [1014] up and then I'll work in the early [1015] morning immediately I'll just roll over [1016] grab my laptop open it start chugging [1019] away I have a little to-do list that I [1020] set up the day before that to-do list [1022] just contains two or three high priority [1024] tasks that I want to do that day um and [1026] then after I do my first hour I'll just [1028] have a little coffee break I don't [1029] actually drink coffee anymore um but uh [1031] you know it's usually some type of Warm [1033] Morning beverage like tea or or [1034] something I'm drinking a chai these days [1036] which is quite nice then I have some [1038] deep work in the midm morning deep work [1040] for those of you that are unfamiliar is [1041] just where you have no distractions it's [1043] just where you cut out um you cut out [1045] your phone you cut out all the [1046] notifications that you're getting and [1047] you just focus on tackling this big [1049] thing that you have to do in the day um [1051] this is really the measure of how [1052] productive you are if you can focus on [1054] deep work tasks for prolong period of [1056] time uh you're going to do quite well in [1057] today's very busy distraction filled [1061] day uh the reason why um I do this for [1065] so long is because I worked up to it the [1067] very first few times that I tried doing [1069] deep work I can only really focus for 20 [1070] or 30 minutes at a time before something [1072] would neverly distract me or I'd get [1074] derailed or defocused uh but the more [1077] that you do deep work it's almost like a [1078] muscle right you get better at focusing [1079] and attending to things while inhibiting [1082] all the rest of the BS that isn't super [1083] important so yeah I do that for two [1085] hours and then I will usually have a [1087] little breakfast shake um the reason why [1090] I have a breakfast shake is I just don't [1091] really want to go through the rig roll [1093] of calling somebody to either deliver me [1095] food making food on my own I don't want [1098] to have to deal with meal prepping the [1099] day before so I just have a little [1101] breakfast shake which takes me less than [1102] three minutes to whip up and then it [1104] allows me to get back to doing work [1106] immediately afterwards which is quite [1107] nice um I'll then do deep work in the [1109] late morning so this is right before the [1111] afternoon hours 4 to 5 and then by that [1113] time the vast majority of my work is [1115] done as you see it's 1 2 3 4 fiveish [1119] hours and that's that's completed uh [1121] sorry three hours is now completed I'll [1124] then knowing that I have to sort of take [1126] a break and my mind's kind of whining [1127] down anyway I'll go to the gym after I [1129] get back from the gym I'll have a huge [1131] fat lunch and this is what like provides [1133] me the majority of my calories for the [1134] day honestly uh and then I will do some [1136] deep work in the mid-afternoon hours 6 [1138] to 7 [1139] after I do that hour 6 to 7 deep work [1142] block I'm done I don't really focus too [1144] much on work after then because I don't [1146] structure my day in a way where it's [1147] like work is off work is on um like if [1150] something comes up later on in the day [1151] that I want to attend to that I'm [1153] interested in if I have some really [1154] interesting comment on my community or [1156] something I will go on and I will answer [1157] it but just because I want to not [1159] because I have to the only work that I [1161] quote unquote have to the stuff that's [1163] highy and drives my my day forward are [1165] those deep work blocks and I don't [1168] always get this right I don't always [1169] finish all of these deep work blocks but [1171] I do most of the time and I don't beat [1172] myself up if I don't I just say all [1174] right well I'll do it tomorrow you know [1176] better luck tomorrow if I couldn't do it [1178] today it's like all right you know what [1180] I need to start doing this a little [1181] better but I'm going to I'm going to [1183] work on it tomorrow and in that way I [1184] don't really feel super guilty I don't [1186] really beat myself up over not being [1188] able to achieve some sort of time goal [1190] because again while the time is a good [1191] proxy for the amount of output that you [1192] have time isn't the the actual output [1194] right it's the output that matters some [1196] days I'm a lot more productive than [1197] others simply because I do harder more [1199] High effective more High Roi more [1201] effective tasks and that's fine now in [1204] terms of what I actually work on this is [1206] a point of I think a lot of controversy [1209] uh because some people consider some [1211] tasks effective other people consider [1213] other tasks effective I'm almost blessed [1215] because I'm in the automation industry [1217] where I realize how much of the work [1219] that most people do on a day-to-day [1220] basis is automatable and so as a result [1223] I've been sort of forced to by my own [1225] work life focus on things that are not [1228] very [1229] automatable so my deep work sessions [1231] will consist of the following three [1233] things the first honestly is just [1235] brainstorming I spend an inordinate [1237] amount of time brainstorming at least an [1239] hour hour and a half every day this is [1241] literally me just sitting on my chair [1243] and just thinking I'm just thinking H is [1245] what I'm doing right now right is there [1246] some way that I could be doing what I'm [1247] doing now better H what sorts of tasks [1250] am I doing right now that I could take [1251] off my plate what I usually do is I'll [1254] take my current revenue and I'll break [1256] it down into buckets service lines CL [1258] clients businesses so you know exactly [1261] what I did at the very beginning of this [1262] video where it said Community Revenue um [1264] automation agency Revenue that sort of [1265] thing I make a big [1267] spreadsheet you know I make this like [1269] once or twice a week [1270] honestly and then using that breakdown [1273] I'll look at the things that are driving [1274] me the most money then I'll think H you [1276] know what this thing's driving me the [1277] most money what do I think the potential [1279] is that this could drive more right or [1281] less or how risky is this or uh how much [1285] time and energy would I need to make [1286] double this right and then I'll just do [1288] a bunch of brainstorming to see what I [1290] think the shortest line paths are to to [1292] doubling my revenue for each of these [1293] service lines clients or businesses [1295] essentially what I'm doing is I'm [1296] identifying the largest contributors and [1298] then I'm identifying the bottlenecks in [1300] each contributor I'm identifying hey [1301] what's stopping me from moving forward [1303] and then I'm I'm eliminating those [1304] bottlenecks or I'm thinking about how to [1305] eliminate those bottlenecks once I have [1308] sort of a grandiose top level plan H I [1310] should do this right um I think about [1313] how to convert my action item into just [1315] a bunch of sub goals which are a lot [1316] more straightforward to tackle then then [1319] I figure out how to work on or delegate [1321] those sub goals effectively and then I [1322] just rinse and repeat this process and [1324] then voila I usually have a big like [1325] to-do list with just 30 things that I [1327] need to do uh which will allow me to [1329] achieve the highest Roi that day and [1330] then that week and then that [1333] month another deep work session item is [1336] a videos or Community material so that's [1338] what I'm doing right now this is in the [1339] middle of one of my deep work sessions [1340] what I'll do is I'll write I'll record [1343] or I'll at least like idate um one video [1345] or asset per day um I was unfortunately [1348] unable to do do that last week which is [1349] what really kind of annoyed me and got [1351] me down um but now that I'm living in a [1353] new place I don't have that friction [1354] sort of at the back of my mind it's a [1355] lot easier to do so um it's my highest [1357] leverage action at the moment so I do [1359] make a ton of time for it uh and you can [1361] think of this as stuff like YouTube [1362] videos um videos that I'm post into my [1364] community Whimsical charts I'm starting [1366] to make lead magnets now so I'm doing [1368] some of that gamma slideshows just like [1370] this one that sort of deal the last [1373] thing that I do in my deep work sessions [1374] is I do client management so I have a [1376] fair number of Automation and uh and and [1379] clients for one second copy this [1380] requires some management every day I [1382] don't necessarily have to do this but I [1383] do this because I think it's a big [1385] Levert that drives forward my my [1386] short-term revenue and I think that [1388] short-term Revenue while not the most [1389] important thing is still quite important [1391] so this is like client systems which is [1393] super high leverage work they usually [1394] spend an hour or two doing it and I can [1396] make several thousand dollars I'll do [1398] development um I'll do delivery videos [1400] this is just like recording videos just [1401] like I'm doing now just I'm going over [1403] my projects and I'm explaining [1404] documentation wise how to do the project [1406] for the client now yours will obviously [1409] differ um I already have Revenue so I'm [1412] focused on scaling it if you are [1414] watching this video and you don't have [1415] Revenue your focus isn't on scaling your [1417] focus is on Bridging the Gap from zero [1418] to one so your day-to-day is most [1420] definitely going to look different in [1422] fact if I could give you a [1423] recommendation if you're watching this [1424] video and you don't have maybe more than [1425] three or $4,000 a month under your belt [1428] it would be to eliminate everything [1430] else except for customer acquisition and [1433] just focus on customer acquisition with [1435] all of your time every day it's [1437] uncomfortable it's it's annoying but [1439] that's exactly how you're going to get [1440] your first few customers and the second [1442] that you have Revenue it's a very very [1444] different conversation to have to scale [1446] it getting it for the first time [1449] completely different problem than than [1450] growing it I would say um and personally [1453] I think growing it is a lot a lot easier [1455] so I'm always encouraging people that [1456] don't have too much of this [1457] entrepreneurial Revenue too much of this [1459] internet [1460] free you know internet money that's [1462] coming into their bank account every [1463] month uh to focus on acquiring customers [1465] first and foremost now my non work [1468] sessions this is just stuff where you [1470] know if a little task crops up during [1472] the day or or you know a first hour of [1473] the morning I'll deal with it um usually [1475] consist of three things calls um YouTube [1478] comments Community comments and then [1480] administrative work like emails and that [1482] sort of thing so I don't really need to [1484] be in deep work mode to do a call a call [1486] to me is just a conversation most of the [1488] time you know it takes a little bit of [1490] an additional work if it's like a sales [1491] call or something like that but it's not [1492] so much that it actually I I would [1494] constitute that as deep work I [1496] constitute it as high leverage if I [1497] don't have money but at this point you [1498] know I have a little bit of money I [1500] don't necessarily need to sell as much [1501] as it's just a nice to have sort of [1503] thing but a lot of these calls are also [1505] very friendly they're just very [1506] enjoyable I almost treat them as breaks [1507] from the rest of my day YouTube comments [1510] and Community these are both very high [1511] leverage but they're less directed work [1513] than than when I'm deep into a [1514] brainstorming session I don't [1515] necessarily need to be on to them it's [1517] just a Leisure activity I can have while [1518] I'm eating some popcorn or some so [1521] I do this during non- dework sessions [1523] and then these administrative tasks [1524] these emails that sort of thing these [1526] are high urgency low importance that [1528] just just means that they need to be [1529] dealt with now but they're not very [1530] important so I like to do them at the [1532] end of my day or I like to just like [1533] backload them to the end of my uh my [1535] first uh work hour session in the [1537] morning simply because there's some [1538] things that just need to be done some [1540] client will ask you for a refund or [1541] something and it's like well like you [1543] know I need to do this even though it [1544] takes me five minutes I just have to do [1545] it now because you know I have to give [1547] them a refund or somebody will send you [1549] an email saying hey you know this [1550] account is locked because you haven't [1552] updated your password or whatever it's [1553] like well I have to unlock that [1555] account right you could of course get an [1557] assistant to do all this stuff for you I [1558] just don't really think that that's [1559] super necessary for me as of yet and [1561] this doesn't really take me too much [1562] time so I don't really worry about it in [1565] terms of my average week my average [1566] workl output uh workl output rise tracks [1570] all of my time it monitors my activity [1571] in the background 24/7 and then it [1573] categorizes these tasks based on [1574] predefined bins stuff like productivity [1576] stuff like entertainment stuff like [1578] business coding um I think I even [1581] created a category called No code I I [1583] don't know if I actually did for this [1584] one yeah I don't know if I have that no [1586] code category but anyway you can make [1588] make your own categories as well and [1590] what I've realized is my average work [1591] week is about 60 hours of work um you [1595] know 60 hours not all of that is deep [1597] work I spend maybe about 25 to 30 hours [1599] a week in deep work I work [1600] disproportionately the longest on [1601] Wednesdays um usually because I have a [1604] weekly call for my community and then I [1605] have to do just a little bit of an an [1607] admin work managing the community [1609] therein um on top of all the rest of the [1611] work that I have I also have a couple of [1613] client meetings on Wednesdays that [1614] usually add a few hours I take usually [1617] and this isn't because I force myself to [1619] or I have some structure but what I [1620] found is after doing this for a few [1622] months I take half of my Sunday off [1624] usually and then you know a lot of [1627] people will look at this and then [1628] they'll say 60 70 hours a week like [1630] aren't you worried about burning out I [1632] think burnout a lot of the burnout [1633] problem is really just mental um I don't [1635] burn out because I make my work really [1637] enjoyable on a nice day I'll work from [1639] my balcony I will play Pleasant music in [1641] the background I will call friends [1642] during mindless administrative tasks to [1644] catch up I basically don't really see it [1647] as like work work work as much as I see [1649] it just like something that I'm I am [1651] doing today I think the problem is when [1653] you start focusing on it and being like [1654] I'm working so much I'm working so much [1655] I'm working so much and then it just [1657] like starts becoming this feedback loop [1658] in your head and I could be mistaken who [1660] knows maybe I'll be burnt out in the [1662] freaking er uh in a couple of months but [1664] I feel I feel fantastic and I I [1666] personally don't think that it's an [1667] issue for me it's not an issue for a lot [1668] of the people that I know that are [1669] making a ton of money because yeah we [1671] just aren really conceptualize it like [1673] that it's all about just considering [1675] what you're doing play as opposed to [1676] work and it really is play I mean this [1678] is super enjoyable to me because this is [1680] still relatively new in my business [1681] career recording I get to record from [1683] different places I get to like do uh you [1686] know I don't know like learn how to edit [1687] stuff I got to learn how to best present [1689] my material all this stuff is just like [1690] daily improvements that I really really [1693] grow addicted to and on that note um [1696] there's a book that I think most people [1697] here should read and it was recommended [1699] to me by one of my best friends just [1701] about a few months ago honestly um it's [1704] called the infinite game it's called [1706] finite and infinite games by James P car [1708] and then there's a more modern version [1710] created by Simon s who just took the [1712] concept and then sort of wrapped it in a [1714] more modern way of looking at it but the [1716] original is fantastic I read the [1717] original and it was it was a great great [1719] book I never really thought of the [1722] business work that I did growing up as [1724] work like I mean I'm calling it work now [1726] but I they have different connotations [1727] it's just the work it's like it's like [1729] that the practice of working right it's [1731] just like the the thing that I'm doing [1733] but it doesn't necessarily mean that [1733] it's hard work it's work you know it's [1735] like really pushing through it every day [1738] if you think about it it is my business [1741] I conjured up my business out of The [1743] Ether like a wizard that's [1746] incredible people pay me for it and I [1748] receive money through tiny little wires [1751] like is that really like hard work or is [1754] that like amazement it's like yeah I [1756] literally feel like a Dungeons and [1757] Dragons character sometimes it's crazy I [1761] do think that 9o FES a lot of the time [1763] can be work and can be very hard work [1765] not necessarily hard because you're [1767] pushing the lever or you're you're [1768] moving the needle but hard because [1770] you're playing by somebody else's roles [1771] you're a slave to their decisions when [1773] they screw up it becomes your fault [1776] inevitably but if it's your own business [1778] I think the only way you can really [1779] describe what you're doing is sort of [1781] play right it's like a game it's just [1782] something that you're getting better at [1783] every day and even if you don't see the [1785] successes that you're looking for [1786] immediately if you just play this game [1788] long enough if you make this game [1789] infinite you inevitably will so yeah if [1792] you view your business as play I don't [1794] really think it's possible for anybody [1795] to burn out because business then [1797] becomes very reach charging as opposed [1799] to something that's constantly draining [1800] your little HP bar in the [1802] background all right that is my schedule [1805] and my day and how I think about making [1807] money in a nutshell um if I could [1809] summarize this it would be that I care [1811] more about environment design than I do [1812] willpower I care more about identifying [1815] bottlenecks and systematically widening [1817] those bottlenecks than doing some [1819] mindless tasks that may or may not [1820] actually drive my revenue and the last [1822] thing is I care more about playing than [1824] I do necessarily working and that's why [1826] I think I've never burned out up until [1828] now and I don't think that you really [1830] have to I hope you guys appreciated this [1832] video had a lot of fun putting it [1833] together if you guys have any questions [1835] about the day-to-day of myself in more [1838] detail or maybe some other entrepreneurs [1839] feel

Title: This mindset made me $1.2M in 18 months
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here and [1] in this video I'm going to share with [2] you probably the most important and [3] impactful concept that I have ever [5] learned in business it's called [7] bottleneck thinking and it's helped me [8] reach about $70,000 a month for the last [11] three months um I make that money [13] through a few different sources I have a [14] community setup where I teach people how [16] to use automation to make more money I [19] have an automation business setup where [20] I actually use automation to make people [22] more money and then they pay me uh I [24] have a Content writing company where our [26] team writes books blogs magazine [28] articles uh that sort of deal [30] and then I also get ad revenues from [32] YouTube and then some affiliate sales as [34] well now when I was first starting out [36] on this big vast Journey we call [38] entrepreneurship I spent a lot of my [39] time watching YouTube videos naturally [41] uh trying to learn more about how [43] entrepreneurs that were where I wanted [44] to get to thought the various things [46] that they did with their day um sort of [48] like the concepts that they were using [49] their mind the mental models because it [51] was always both very interesting to me [52] and moreover not just interesting [54] effective to me uh to take what other [56] people had already spent years of their [58] life figuring out and then up deploying [60] it or using it in my own business so I [62] thought that I would do the same thing [63] for you guys and I would share with you [65] probably the most impactful way of [66] thinking that I have found in order to [68] solve problems in business ever hoping [71] that you guys could take the good parts [72] from this the stuff that makes a [73] difference to your bottom line and maybe [75] leave some of the stuff that isn't super [76] relevant to you so it's called [78] bottleneck thinking and you know I'll [81] touch more on this in a moment but [83] essentially I read this in an old [84] project management book from the 80s and [86] uh I read it when I was in a pretty dark [88] place in my life and just looking for [89] some concept to cling on to and [91] basically ever since I read it it's [92] completely changed everything about my [94] businesses so in order to understand [97] this I'm not just going to throw a book [98] at you and force you to read it I'm [99] going to try and explain it from first [101] principles and then sort of work my way [102] up to this book uh explanation if that [105] makes sense the first thing I want to [107] talk about is pipelines I talk about [108] pipelines a lot because I'm in project [110] management crms and that sort of thing [112] but you can actually view literally [114] everything that you do in a business as [116] just a pipeline that goes from left to [119] right and it's a very simple concept and [121] if you just fix that in your mind a lot [123] of things just instantly become clear [125] for instance I talk a lot about [127] automation agencies right well an [128] automation agency is basically just a [130] pipeline that goes from left to right [133] where at the far most left side you have [136] leads that come in prospects that come [138] in people that you haven't really talked [139] to and then your pipeline is like a [141] process that will guide people from [145] sales to marketing to onboarding to [149] fulfill [150] to delivery to retention to advocacy [154] like however the stages are set up that [156] you want to set them up totally up to [158] you but essentially you are guiding a [160] person through the pipeline that is your [162] business from left to right now like [166] most things you can make it as [167] arbitrarily complex as you want you can [169] divide up specific parts of that [171] pipeline into their own steps so for [173] instance if we had some broad pipeline [174] left to right that's just the agency [176] Pipeline and then there was a sales [178] section all the way on the left and we [179] zoomed into this the sales section the [181] sales section might have different steps [183] for the sales process it might have [184] steps like inquiry received proposal [187] sent invoice paid right these are all [189] subdivisions of that earlier pipeline [191] for the agency that we talked about your [193] fulfillment pipeline might have like a [195] kickoff call it might have I mean if [197] you're an automation agency like many [198] people here are attempting to start it [200] might have steps like uh flow mapping [202] maybe you make a big flowchart might [204] have steps like development might have [205] steps like testing might have steps like [207] delivery QA iteration that sort of thing [210] right the big question that I receive [212] often is why do you view everything as a [215] pipeline and the reason why is because [217] it makes it remarkably easy to start [219] improving every single step using [221] bottleneck thinking which I explained [223] and referenced in the title of the video [224] and I'm going to talk about a little bit [225] more next but before you proceed just [228] make sure you understand that concept of [230] pipeline like close your eyes and try [231] and visualize whatever your business is [233] as a pipeline that goes from left to [235] right and uh it'll it'll help the future [238] parts of this presentation a lot [241] more now that you understand pipelines [243] we need to understand a little bit about [246] basically fluid mechanics um in a [249] pipeline the fluid inside of the [251] pipeline like if this were an oil [252] pipeline or water pipeline or something [253] like that the fluid inside could only [255] ever go as fast as it goes through the [258] narrowest part that's just how a [260] pipeline works that's just how fluid [261] dynamics go I learned all this in physic [264] Class A Million bajillion years ago and [265] I've promptly forgotten everything [267] except for this one thing but if you [268] remember one thing remember that [270] if for whatever reason there's a [271] narrowing in the pipeline the entire [274] content of the whole pipeline all the [276] fluid will only go as fast as it goes [278] through that narrow point this narrow [280] point is termed the bottleneck and it [283] establishes the speed of the rest of [285] that [286] pipeline what I mean by this is it [289] doesn't matter how big or wide or fast [293] moving steps are through other parts of [295] said pipeline if your bottleneck is I [298] don't know X lers per minute the entire [301] pipeline will only ever go as fast as X [304] lers per minute never more I have a [307] little picture over here and it looks [310] like this picture was created by Forte [311] Labs thank you Forte Labs only an [314] improvement here will make a difference [317] in your pipeline for instance if this is [319] your Sal step this is your fulfillment [322] step and maybe this is your retention [323] step clearly your Sal step and your [326] retention step they're pretty good [328] they're going pretty fast [330] but the Fulfillment step slows the [333] entire process down so it doesn't matter [336] how fast your cell step is and it [337] doesn't matter how fast or good your [339] retention step is everything in your [341] whole company that whole pipeline [343] analogy that we had earlier from left to [345] right is now subservient it's basically [348] a slave to this step right here and if [351] you understand that then it makes it [354] very easy to build a super simple [356] process that helps you um system [359] systematically streamline and improve [361] different parts of your business um I'm [364] going to call it a four-step process the [366] book that I'm um you know thankful to [369] have taught me how this works uh from [372] has called it I think a five or six or [374] seven step process I've eliminated a lot [376] of the complexity in my own life and [377] this is how I see it [379] personally if I could go back in time [380] and teach myself the ability to think [382] about things as a bottleneck from day [384] one I would be making 10 times the money [385] if I went back to my cold call door [388] knocking days and I thought to hm what's [390] the bottleneck in my business it would [391] obviously be the door knocking and you [394] know I I'd sort of look at it and I'd [395] say well I got a couple of ways [396] that I can make this better I could just [398] knock on doors faster but I'd realize [400] that doesn't matter how fast I knock on [402] the doors that would still be a really [403] tight bottleneck that would have forced [405] me to think differently about different [407] lead generation approaches and different [409] ways that I could have made money [410] instead of just knocking on about you [412] know eight doors an hour or 10 doors an [413] hour like I was doing before um and that [415] would have you know shaved as I [417] mentioned in many videos years off of my [419] life [420] in a positive sense and uh a lot of gray [422] hairs as well so that's how bottlenecks [426] work now from this idea of a pipeline [429] from left to right and from this idea [432] that the fluid in a pipeline can only go [433] as fast as whatever it's doing through [435] its narrowest step like your business [437] can only operate as quickly and as [438] powerfully as that narrowest step [440] basically you can build a very simple [443] process that I'm calling the business [445] Improvement [446] flywheel here's how you build and scale [449] basically any business in four steps [452] first you will identify the bottlenecks [454] I call them constraints here because [455] that's what the book uses constraints [457] are a more general term for bottleneck [459] but identify the bottleneck is number [461] one first you just look through your [462] business and you say okay man I'm [464] currently not making a lot of money why [467] is that how many projects can I do per [469] day how many leads am I getting per day [472] how many deals Clos am I getting per day [474] uh how many clients am I retaining uh [476] you know just look at your whole Revenue [478] generating Pipeline and ask yourself [480] what is the slowest part of this puppy [483] and once you've identified what the [485] slowest part of it is you just have to [487] widen it which obviously sounds simple [490] in practice is a little bit different [491] but if you just spend a few moments [493] thinking about this you will realize [495] that this is the most straightforward [496] way to conceptualize business if your [499] lead generation is slow well then your [501] entire business will never go faster in [503] that lead generation so in order to [506] improve the speed and the effectiveness [507] of your entire business all you have to [508] do is just improve the speed or [509] effectivess of your lead generation [511] everything else benefits and it becomes [513] very easy then to start justifying all [515] right well if my business is been at [517] 3,000 bucks a month it's at 3,000 bucks [519] a month because of my Legion if I double [521] my leg gen I'll be making 6K a month if [522] I triple it I'll be making 9k a month [525] how much money time energy and resources [527] should I be investing in Leen to make [528] this happen and the second you do that [531] your your feedback cycle instead of you [533] spending months to arrive at that [534] decision it's now a few days and then [536] you go and you actually do it and you [537] widen that constraint [539] next is you just look for new ones after [542] you've widened a bottleneck a sufficient [544] amount you'll find that other parts of [546] your process will become bottlenecks for [548] instance that lead gen example if you're [549] making 3K a month and your lead gen is X [551] and you double it now you're making 6K a [553] month but if you try and triple it and [556] you don't make 9k a month well now [558] something else is the bottleneck [559] logically right because if it wasn't the [562] bottleneck it would just be a direct [563] correlation between the lead gen and [565] your project management now what usually [567] happens in practice is your lead gen [570] become is is the bottleneck first then [572] you widen your lead gen and you uh [575] provide substantially more leads and [577] then your project management quickly [578] becomes the bottleneck because now you [580] have enough leads but now you have so [581] many leads and you don't have an [582] established process for doing project [584] management that you know that starts [586] being the part that slows you down that [587] starts being the narrowest part of your [589] pipeline and then you start optimizing [591] project management once you've optimized [593] project management well then lead [595] generation becomes a bottleneck so you [596] widen that the project management [597] becomes a bottleneck and this is how the [599] majority of agencies work that said it [601] takes the vast majority of agencies [603] years to do even one of those cycles and [605] if you understand this you can do the [606] exact same thing in a couple of months [609] maybe the last step is repeat identify [613] widen um look for new ones repeat it's [616] this four simple process four simple [619] step process um that substantially [622] improves your ability to tackle these [624] sorts of problems [626] systematically as I mentioned this is [628] first documented in a book on [630] manufacturing process Improvement [631] actually and no I don't just like [633] reading books on manufacturing process [634] Improvement for fun uh this was [636] recommended to me by a good friend who I [638] am uh forever indebted to for sending me [641] down the path of that book The reason [644] why I really like this book and why I [645] recommend everybody here read it is [647] because it's written not as a [649] non-fiction book it's written as a story [650] it's written as a story about a man who [652] essentially runs a plant and he is given [655] a very unrealistic deadline but by using [658] this business approvement fly wheel he's [660] able to look for constraints widen them [662] look for the new constraints that were [663] generated widen those and something like [666] 10 or 15x is revenue in a matter of few [668] months um I've applied this to my own [670] agency and I've also applied this to the [672] Consulting space with much success and I [673] think it's one of the reasons why my uh [675] my businesses tend to grow faster than [677] other people's just because my feedback [678] loop is a lot [679] shorter so I have a bunch of examples [681] here you know for most people less than [683] 10K amount through bottom neck is lead [684] gen therefore you should spend all of [685] your available time improving lead gen [688] if you spend time on anything else but [690] lead gen it's a strategic error um I [692] mean this it's 100% true if you spend [694] any time on anything that is not the [696] bottleneck you are wasting time energy [698] and resources because the output of the [700] bottleneck is directly proportionate to [702] Output of the entire business now I [705] mention here that for most people that [706] are greater than 10K but less than 25k [708] your bottleneck is usually fulfillment [709] these are rough numbers they're not 100% [711] accurate some people are more effective [712] so they can do more money without having [714] this be a bondene and people are less [716] but essentially what you have is you [717] have a business that's not scalable due [719] to Logistics so you should be spending [720] all of your time improving your ability [722] to fulfill improving your ability to [724] deliver after 25k a lot of the time your [727] bottleneck becomes hiring you have a [729] business that's ready to scale but you [730] can't because of people for whatever [732] reason so you should be spending all of [733] your available time hiring and improving [735] that hiring process I mentioned that [737] multiple of these can be true Nothing in [738] life or business is like mutually [740] exclusive it's it's never 100% or zero [742] two absolutes um you could have a few [746] you could have a few of these apply to [747] you at the same time and these numbers [749] aren't 100% set in stone in my specific [752] case um my bottleneck was Leen up until [755] something like 30k a month and then it [758] stopped being leg gen it started being [759] project management so I had to look for [761] better ways to do projects I had to look [762] for better ways to fulfill things um so [765] I started poking around with different [767] methods and that sort of deal and uh I [769] ended up attempting to hire a variety of [771] people and build a big Workforce and I [773] made a few of these people work but I [774] realized deep in my core that that's not [776] what I wanted out of business and so I [777] ended up improving these two bottleneck [779] and scaling my my automation agency to [781] about 72k a month but I I did not [786] improve the hiring bottleneck much more [788] because I considered it I I didn't [790] really want to continue growing my [791] business past that point essentially I [793] wanted to be able to run a business that [795] I managed most of the revenue myself [797] because it was more enjoyable to me I [798] tend to work a lot faster and because it [801] allowed me time open to pursue other [802] things like YouTube uh my Consulting [805] business now my coaching com uh my my my [807] community I should say and that sort of [809] deal so there are also business uh [812] bottlenecks but in addition to business [814] bottlenecks there are also life [815] bottlenecks too so how exactly do you go [818] about widening a bottleneck I've talked [819] about widening constraints for a little [821] while now but how do I actually do it in [823] practice [825] well I'm going to give you three or four [828] or five or six here and they're going to [830] apply to different parts of the business [831] and if you are struggling with this [833] exact problem just try doing what I'm [834] about to show you and I'm I'm confident [836] that at least one of these will work to [838] widen and set bottom [840] so uh we're going to break this down [841] into two parts the first is if you have [843] something that's working but it's just [845] not working fast enough so this might be [847] a lead gen process which technically [848] generates you one new lead every week [851] but it's not working fast enough to fill [853] up that constraint and widen in it as [855] much as you can so you just need to do [856] more of it all that I would recommend [858] you do is just 10x whatever is going [860] into that process 10x your inputs um it [863] really is that easy I shouldn't write [865] easy here but it really is that [866] straightforward um it's logical it might [867] not be easy but it's very logical [870] for instance a lot of people here for [871] some reason a lot of people that are [872] watching my videos they're sending 100 [874] 200 300 cold emails a day and they're [875] finding success with it they're they're [876] they're making money but they're not [878] making as much money as they want to and [880] they haven't really thought to [881] themselves well why don't I just [883] multiply the number of cold emails I'm [885] sending by three if all us remains equal [888] then I should be making three times the [889] money no and to be honest it is [892] approximately that simple if you just [894] send more of the inputs if you have a [895] system that's working you will get more [897] of the outputs it's never one to one [898] there's always diminish returns but this [900] is usually the simplest way forward to [902] to improve the volume um of of the [904] results you're getting how about PPC I [906] mean if you're getting certain results [907] with th bucks a month um why don't you [909] multiply it and try $5,000 next month [912] yeah it's a little bit scary it's a [913] little bit risky but there's no inherent [914] reason for you to believe that that that [916] relationship will not apply um at least [919] for the most part right maybe you won't [921] get 10x like if you 10x your adbd you [923] might not get 10x the results maybe [924] you'll get 8X the results and that's [925] sufficient to widen your bottleneck to [927] the point where something else becomes a [928] problem make sure you're profitable of [930] course but it is as simple as this you [932] could build automated systems that 10ex [934] your ability to project manage or to [936] fulfill if your company is writing one [939] article per week for a client well if [941] you build some automated systems that [943] eliminate the work of your writing staff [944] by 90% they should be able to do um you [946] know 10 of those right Etc um that sort [950] of deal that's what you do if you have [952] something that's working this is [953] obviously the much simpler approach [954] right if you have something that's [955] working just do more of it no problem [957] now if you have something that's not [959] working which is really what I want to [960] focus more time and energy on then you [963] have to get creative what I've done in [965] the past is if I have a system that I [967] really want to work but that is not [968] working is I will set aside a specific [971] number like a specific dollar amount [973] every month and I'll invest that in what [975] I consider research and development [977] research and development these are [979] basically just either moonshots or [980] they're things that I don't really have [982] any like I don't know for sure whether [984] these will work I just have a feeling [985] that they will so for instance if you [987] are not cap capable of growing your [989] automation agency because of whatever [991] approach that you've tried um and you [993] have no leads coming in you're going to [994] need to invest a certain amount of money [995] time or energy every single month in [998] ideas that you're not 100% sure will pay [1000] off that's just how business works until [1002] you find something that works right so [1004] I'd spend money every week on previously [1006] untried lead generation methods I'd [1007] experiment with novel approaches I'd [1009] experiment if I've never done PPC I'd [1010] experiment with PPC I'd experiment with [1012] cold calling on experiment with cold [1014] emailing I would invest a dedicated [1016] amount of my [1017] money basically exploring the problem [1020] space big mature companies they might [1022] spend anywhere between 5 to 10% of their [1024] annual budgets on R&D uh if you're a [1026] young new business you might be spending [1028] anywhere from like 30 to 40% of it on [1030] R&D because you need to find something [1032] that works quickly or obviously you're [1033] going to run out of steam right the [1035] point that I'm making is what you're [1036] doing now isn't working so you need to [1037] consciously commit to experimentation in [1039] R&D or you will flounder and that is the [1042] simplest way to widen a bottleneck if [1043] you don't know what what works some [1046] other miscellaneous ways uh if you want [1048] to improve everything you can just add [1049] more staff to bottleneck areas it's [1050] really simple obviously you need to be [1052] smart about how you assign the staff you [1053] need to be smart about how you hire them [1055] and about how you project manage them [1056] but you could just add more staff if uh [1058] your a current sales team of two people [1060] and they're doing prospecting and [1061] they're doing everything for you is [1062] yielding uh I don't know two new clients [1065] a week if you had another three people [1067] well now you're at five salespeople you [1068] could be somewhere around five clients [1070] per week and if you're not at five [1071] clients per week well then you know that [1073] there's probably some additional issue [1074] in your sales [1075] process um if you want to improve [1077] everything you could just invest in [1078] better technology and systems if you're [1080] using like a really outdated project [1081] manager and your project management [1083] stuff is the bottleneck and you buy a [1087] better project manager invest in [1088] training invest in resources invest in a [1090] consulting company to like set it up for [1092] you the right way well now maybe you two [1094] or 3x your project management side of [1096] things that's no longer the bottleneck [1097] these are active decisions they are not [1099] things that you just sort of organically [1101] lead into these are things that you have [1102] to sit down think about consciously and [1104] say okay it's worth it for me to spend [1105] money on this because this is my [1106] bottleneck but that's why bottleneck [1108] thinking is so powerful and so [1110] important um if you want to improve [1112] everything you could redistribute your [1113] workload across team members you could [1115] identify team members that have certain [1116] skills might be better than other team [1117] members at certain things and you could [1119] redistribute the work that they do um [1122] you know over the course of a week or so [1123] and just see how they perform the next [1124] week if you want to improve your [1126] fulfillment a simple lever to do so is [1128] you document all of your processes so [1130] every single job in the company that [1131] your team is doing you say hey I want [1133] you to document it I want you to record [1134] a video of you doing it you take all [1136] those videos and then you use them to [1137] create standard oper procedures you say [1140] hm I like the way Stephanie did that [1141] okay great let me you know make a little [1143] text St maybe she makes the text STS for [1145] you I don't know and then you add that [1146] to a big uh documentation library and [1149] then you as a business owner you go [1150] through the documentation you're like [1151] hey is this step required no not really [1153] is this step required no not really that [1154] one I feel like we need an additional [1155] step you rewrite those Sops based off [1158] what you know about the tasks or you get [1159] somebody else to do it and now you have [1161] a whole doc library that makes your [1163] fulfillment a lot more efficient your [1165] Sops are lean everybody uses them [1167] henceforth that means that everybody's [1168] now going to per per form at the level [1169] of the best staff member not necessarily [1172] 100% but maybe like 80 90% of the best [1174] staff member because they're going to [1175] follow their process this really [1177] drastically improves fulfillment just a [1179] way that you can if you want to improve [1181] fulfillment another way you could cross [1183] Trin your employees for flexibility so [1185] they could overlap job duties if needed [1186] was cross trainining it just means [1188] making sure that the staff member that [1190] does I don't know your graphic design or [1192] something can also maybe do some web [1193] Flow Design or something just training [1195] them a little bit so that if your web [1197] Flow Design person is off that day one [1199] now you can get the graphic design [1200] person to come in continue the project [1202] continue it moving forward without [1203] necessarily um you know completely [1205] ruining or stalling the the job that you [1207] are [1208] doing fulfillment you could Outsource [1210] non-core activities if there are some uh [1212] extraneous activities that your company [1214] is currently doing as part of your [1215] service offering for whatever reason if [1217] you're offering content writing get a [1218] Content writing company to do it for you [1220] um you know allow this to just eliminate [1222] the content as a bottleneck completely [1224] as a step in your pipeline just send it [1226] off to somebody have it done for you [1227] instead maybe you pay a little bit more [1229] money but by you paying a little bit [1230] more money you widen your bottleneck and [1232] by you widening your bottleneck um now [1234] that's not that's no longer the [1235] bottleneck something else is you've [1237] essentially just increased the [1238] effectiveness of your whole organization [1240] consider if your bottleneck gets you I [1243] don't know 5K a month or something right [1245] you're at 5K a month you have a [1246] bottleneck if you widen that bottleneck [1248] by 10% you just added $500 a month to [1250] your bottom line if you double your [1252] bottleneck you've now added $5,000 a [1254] month to your bottom [1255] line that is the entire company [1257] essentially that is growing because you [1259] focused on this one tiny little area and [1261] that's the power in it if you want to um [1264] improve your sales you could in invest [1266] in a CRM just get organized right um you [1269] could add some dashboards monitor your [1271] kpis you could make visibility [1273] companywide to encourage employees I'm [1275] just throwing a bunch of ideas at you [1276] here that I've employed at many of the [1278] companies that I've consulted and [1279] coached with but these are all ways that [1281] you can W widen a bottleneck and there [1282] are others but these are very quick and [1284] easy ones to [1286] implement okay so now that we've talked [1288] a little bit about that I want to just [1289] quickly cover some common pitfalls to [1291] bottleneck thinking and common pitfalls [1292] approaching this sort of idea you know [1295] um the first is that efficiency is not [1297] the most important thing Effectiveness [1298] is the most important thing what do I [1300] mean by this I mean like uh I've [1302] mentioned this in a previous video and [1303] I've mentioned this a few times [1305] efficiency is just how quickly and you [1307] know how how quickly and with as few [1310] resources you can do one task but [1312] Effectiveness is how basically powerful [1315] your entire stream of tasks is your your [1317] whole organization [1319] efficiency is about how quickly you [1320] could do something and Effectiveness is [1321] about your ability to pick what thing to [1323] do right in the first place so [1325] efficiency doesn't actually matter if [1327] you have a team that's technically 100% [1329] efficient and every single waking minute [1331] of their time is spent doing something [1333] but the things that they are doing suck [1335] and they don't yield anything to your [1336] company if they're just I don't know uh [1337] writing up reports all day then you're [1340] not going to make any money and you're [1341] not going to move the the the meter [1342] forward instead even if your team is 20% [1345] efficient but they spend that 20% of the [1347] time working on core bottl NE activities [1349] well now you've you've elevated your [1351] entire business by at least 20% [1354] right another thing that I would say is [1356] beware of creating new bottlenecks when [1358] solving others bottleneck can be cash [1360] flow cash flow is absolutely a [1361] bottleneck it's hard to visualize that [1363] on a pipeline but cash that comes in at [1364] the beginning that could be your bottl [1366] to the rest of these processes right so [1368] just be careful that the decisions that [1370] you are making to say spend money on [1371] solving lead generation or spend money [1373] on solving project management um that [1376] this does not your ability to do [1378] other parts of your business right if [1380] you have a certain monthly subscription [1382] to a sauna or something and the real [1384] example AA was costing a company I [1386] worked with like 950 bucks a month and [1388] hypothetically because you quadrupled [1390] your lead gen you don't know if you're [1391] going to have enough money in your [1392] software budget to cover that well maybe [1394] don't quadruple your Le gen maybe double [1395] your lead gen instead leave a little bit [1397] of money behind to do that project [1398] management payment the last thing is [1401] don't neglect long-term strategy in [1403] pursuit of short-term gains but also [1405] don't lose the trees for the forest most [1408] people say don't lose the forest for the [1409] trees I say don't lose the trees for the [1411] forest most people think a little too [1413] long term uh before they have business [1415] success then once they have business [1417] success they think a little too short [1418] term most people that are watching this [1419] you know they're not making a ton of [1420] money online uh from the internet so try [1423] not to lose the trees for the forest [1425] like have a long-term goal and a [1427] long-term Vision but also consistently [1429] pull yourself back to the short term and [1431] say okay like how can I make more money [1432] today I say down here if you're at the [1435] starting line you can safely screw the [1436] long term and just get your first [1438] customer cust by whatever means um I [1440] would agree with that and that's [1441] basically what I always encourage people [1442] to do um in my community and throughout [1444] all of my [1446] material now as I mentioned previously [1448] you could also apply Balck thinking to [1450] your personal life you don't just have [1451] to do this in business and I've applied [1453] this to a large portion of the different [1456] stages of my life it's hard to [1458] conceptualize your life as a pipeline [1459] but you can and basically what I've done [1461] is I've identified a bunch of personal [1462] bottlenecks in my life like time [1464] management gaps in my skills [1466] relationships that I'm having and I've [1468] system atically tried to improve them [1470] for instance um relationships can [1472] bottleneck the rest of your life if you [1473] have a poor relationship or series of [1474] poor relationships that can [1476] substantially impair your ability to do [1478] the things that you need to do whether [1479] it's a partner a girlfriend a boyfriend [1482] uh spouse uh family members friends if [1485] you have relationships like that that [1486] are bottlenecking your life you can do [1489] things to improve them there are [1491] obviously limited things that you can do [1492] directly to improve a relationship in [1494] terms of the effort that you put in and [1496] stuff like that you could do a little [1497] bit there's some Rel relationships that [1498] you probably just don't need to have and [1500] that if you eliminate those [1501] relationships or maybe restructure the [1502] way that they work you you can yield [1504] substantial [1505] benefits games apps time sucks all these [1508] can be big bottlenecks you can widen [1511] said bottlenecks by implementing [1513] blocking practices by implementing some [1515] type of self-control procedure by uh [1518] doing the the friction reducing things [1519] that I mentioned in previous videos uh [1522] maybe your diet is a bottleneck to your [1523] ability to lose weight um visualize that [1526] as a pipeline right the stuff that [1527] you're doing every day to try and [1529] improve your weight loss maybe your [1530] diet's the big problem your day job [1533] could be a bottleneck to 10x in your [1534] income maybe in order to grow your your [1537] your your side hustle or grow your [1539] bottom line you need to make some [1541] sacrifices at your personal job because [1543] that's currently the bottleneck right [1545] all of these are just ways that you can [1546] apply bottleneck Thinking Beyond [1547] business although I will say bottleneck [1549] thinking for me is is very much a [1551] business thing and I make a ton of money [1553] um just thinking about my day in terms [1555] of bottlenecks constantly like after [1557] this video I'm going to go and [1558] brainstorm what the bottlenecks are in [1560] my current Revenue generating process [1562] and I'm going to go through that exact [1563] same four-step process because I do that [1565] every day some closing thoughts here [1568] everything is a pipeline Business [1570] Development you can conceptualize it as [1572] the process of identifying bottleneck in [1575] your business pipeline and then widening [1577] those bottlenecks [1579] systematically I will say that all that [1582] the biggest successful most successful [1584] and most the highest revenue generating [1586] companies in the world think about is [1588] how to widen bottlenecks a lot of them [1590] will not explicitly say that that's what [1592] they're thinking about a lot of them [1593] will not be able to like conceptualize [1594] it in that matter but all they think [1596] about all day long is how do we widen [1598] this bottleneck how do we widen the [1600] bottleneck in shipping how do we widen [1602] the bottleneck in sales how do we widen [1603] the bottle neck in fulfillment how do we [1605] widen the bottom neck in advertising [1607] entire departments are set up whose [1609] directors have a sole job of just [1611] thinking all day and widening said Bal [1614] necks so if you can employ some of that [1615] higher level strategy into your company [1618] right now where you are uh you will find [1620] great success with it good luck I hope [1623] that you guys enjoyed this video if you [1624] guys have any questions about bottleneck [1626] thinking about the goal about anything [1627] that I mentioned here just drop a [1628] comment down below more than happy to [1630] help and if you have any recommendations [1631] or suggestions for future videos I'd [1633] love to hear them otherwise like [1635] subscribe do all that fun YouTube stuff [1637] and I will catch you in the next video [1638] thanks

Title: How to Create No-Brainer Offers for Your Automation Agency
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here and [1] in this video I'm going to show you how [2] to build no-brainer offers for your [4] automation agency let's get into it so [7] first and foremost this isn't the only [8] process you could use but it is my [10] process and it got me to over $72,000 [12] per month with my automation agency I'm [14] confident that if you guys attack what [16] I'm about to show you systematically in [17] this video you guys can scale way past [19] 72k uh so take what makes sense to you [22] if something doesn't make sense to you [23] if you're employing like a fundamentally [25] different approach and you think mine's [26] garbage that's fine just take the good [27] parts leave the bad and uh make yourself [30] a little better because of it last thing [32] is there's no gatekeeping I just show [33] you everything in this video because [35] every time I've ever done this on [36] YouTube I tend to be rewarded [37] disproportionally by both the algo and [39] uh you know personally and [41] professionally so a big thing that I'm [43] getting a lot of questions about right [44] now in both my community and then on [46] YouTube is this term Leverage What does [50] high leverage mean I use it all the time [52] throughout all my course materials [53] throughout um any blooms that I send [55] people and it's a very particular [57] definition essentially High Leverage [60] means that once you have a client in [64] automation the money that you make per [66] additional unit of your time like the [68] marginal unit of your time I believe [70] it's called in in economics is so [73] ridiculously high that you should be [76] willing to do whatever it takes to land [79] that client in the first place and so [81] this is a really really important [83] fundamental concept here not all [84] Industries are high leverage I used to [86] run a Content writing company and our [88] content writing company would routinely [89] sell articles for anywhere from 5 to [91] maybe 15 cents per word on average [93] somewhere around there you can imagine [95] if you got like one person sending you [96] two articles per month and each of them [98] are a th words that's 2,000 words times [101] let's just say 10 cents that's about 200 [102] bucks a month right that is an [104] extraordinarily low leverage industry [106] automation on the other hand is the [108] exact opposite you can make a ridiculous [111] amount of money for such a small unit of [114] your time because the vast majority of [116] the work that you do in this industry uh [118] you've actually done already you've done [120] it through the weeks and the months that [121] you've learned how to build these [122] systems you've done it developing the [124] blueprints you've done it sort of [125] developing the process Frameworks for [127] other people and so essentially the [129] reason why it's so high leverag is [130] because you just get to like make more [132] money per unit time with every [134] successive client and if you guys have [136] just finished the introductory course uh [138] on my YouTube you'll know more than [139] enough as well as be armed with more [141] than enough of the blueprints and [142] templates and stuff like that that you [143] can go out and start building these very [144] high leverage systems for clients [146] basically from day one now the issue [149] with a a is that the systems that you [152] can sell are actually extraordinarily [154] diverse and automation can be pretty [156] expensive right like it's not high [157] leverage for no reason it's high [158] leverage because it's pretty expensive [160] for the client you know clients might be [161] spending three four 5 10 15 30 $50,000 a [164] year who knows on maintaining your [167] servic uh on on hiring you and then on [170] maintaining your services as well so a [172] lot of the time it's actually very [174] difficult to get your foot in the door [175] which is why I always say you know just [176] do whatever it takes to get that client [178] worry about the rest of it after you [179] have have them that's exactly where what [182] I call a no-brainer offer comes in and [184] what a no-brainer offer is is it's a [186] simple productized deliverable that you [188] can fulfill for the client one super [190] fast so you can do this usually in about [192] a week maybe two weeks two at really low [195] cost so this allows you to get your foot [197] in the v uh in the door um three it lets [200] you demonstrate value very quickly and [202] then four it naturally leads into to the [205] rest of your more expensive Automation [206] Services it's sort of like uh naturally [209] organically onboards the customer and [211] has them saying well now that I have [212] this system might as well have that one [214] too that's where you get them on a [215] retainer and that's really where the [217] leverage uh starts multiplying and comes [219] in so what exactly is a no-brainer [223] automation offer I'm not like an offer [225] expert I'm not an offer God right that's [227] why I've only gotten to 72k a month with [230] this there are plenty of other people [231] out there that have gotten that have [232] added a few zeros to that number and [234] they're a lot better at defining offers [235] but what I do know a lot about is the [237] automation industry and so I've combined [239] my sort of like average offer knowledge [242] with my super deep knowledge of the [243] automation industry and and this is [245] essentially what I consider to be a very [246] high quality automation offer you need [249] to First be able to do it quickly then [250] you need to be able to do it cheaply [252] then you need to minimize the risk for [254] the client and then bonus it needs to [256] logically lead into an upsell into a [258] retainer into a subscription product [259] whatever you want to call it now because [262] automation platforms like make.com make [264] gratuitous use of templates whether or [265] not this is zap here whether or not this [267] is make NA A10 literally any platform [269] here but you know I sort of uh uh Rose [271] on YouTube through make so I'm going to [273] talk about make here um you can do this [275] super super easily in terms of the [277] product eyes like in terms of the [278] Fulfillment because all you really have [280] to do is you just take a set of [281] templates that you've had and then you [283] duplicate those for the new client and [285] then you make a couple minor little [287] adjustments at the interface level so [288] meaning the uh like the the end or the [291] very beginning right so either you get [293] their data in with a new Trigger or then [294] you send the data somewhere else with [296] like a new um HTTP call or something [298] like that in the back end so essentially [299] the point that I'm making is all you [301] really have to do is just like slightly [302] touch the outsides of these templates [304] that you've already built the meat and [306] the bones of it they're all done for you [308] and this is something that you don't [309] necessarily have to even do yourself you [311] know if you want to build a company [312] doing this you can imagine how it's [313] actually much more cost effective for [315] let's say a senior engineer or something [317] to be developing Blueprints and [318] developing templates and then the [319] Juniors to be actually responsible for [320] the implementation because they just [322] take what's already built and then just [323] kind of connect that like little Lego [325] blocks uh to the person's company so I [327] have some examples down here I've talked [329] about the cold Outreach lead gen system [331] um it's like an endtoend uh AI lead [334] sourcing then um Outreach through [336] personalization and then you can even do [338] like automatic lead nurturing and stuff [339] like that uh you can find that on my [341] channel anytime that you want there are [343] industry specific CRM templates so maybe [346] you want to work specifically with [347] photography companies well you can [348] easily make a photography CRM oneclick [351] template that out and then sell that to [352] people as your low simple introductory [354] offer uh social media posting systems [357] that's super straightforward I've built [358] probably three or four of these and then [359] like a Content generation system more [361] generally maybe you want to write [362] articles maybe you want to write posts [363] uh the point that I'm making is you know [365] if you can make a blueprint of it you [366] can basically productize it and then [368] sell it as part of your offer so anywh [371] who uh let's start diving into the four [374] requirements that I mentioned above are [375] really the three requirements plus like [376] a bonus requirement down here um and I [379] this bonus requirement can make a really [380] big difference so uh while you don't [382] need it I'd highly encourage you to have [383] it so the first requirement that I [385] mentioned was that you have to be able [386] to do it quickly right you have to be [387] able to do it fast um so you know in [391] order for it to be a no-brainer [393] essentially if you think about it from [394] their perspective a client anytime they [396] decide to work with a new service [398] provider whether it's automation whether [399] it's I don't know content writing [401] whether it's graphic design whether it's [403] you know photography they're taking a [405] risk on you and in order to maximize the [409] quality of that client uh maximize the [411] retention of that client and Etc you [413] basically need to minimize what's called [415] buyer [416] remorse basically you need to minimize [419] that sort of like negative reciprocal [421] feeling that they that they're expecting [423] after they give you a little bit of [424] money and you still haven't given them [425] anything this is a little bit different [427] when you're selling a product like if [428] you were selling I don't know some [430] widget maybe like a fidget spinner or [431] something and you're at a store and you [433] give somebody money and then they give [434] you the fidget spinner immediately well [435] your bios remorse is a lot less because [437] you literally have it in your hands [438] right but when you're doing a service [440] like we are doing right now uh it takes [442] a lot longer to fulfill that service and [444] as a result you know buyers remorse can [445] be a pretty big sticking point in the [447] industry so you have to be able to do it [449] fast to minimize the time between them [451] giving you money and then them receiving [453] that fidget spinner in their hand in [455] order to do this you should generally [457] minimize the number of steps involved in [459] delivering your offer which is always [461] good practice generally whether you're [462] designing crms or project management [464] systems or product ised offers way too [467] many people make systems seem way too [469] complex they try and break a process [471] down into 500 steps when realistically [473] they could do it in four or five instead [476] um what you should be aiming for in [477] terms of your time is about a onewe [478] turnaround time um maybe a little bit [480] less there are some exceptions like you [482] can imagine how with a cold email system [483] a big chunk of the time that you spend [486] delivering the service is an actually [487] you working on the service you're just [489] warming up the emails so you could [491] theoretically deliver the product ahead [493] of that onewe turnaround time and just [495] have an understanding with them that hey [496] this is now scheduled to go right that [499] way you get to minimize buyers remorse [500] while you also get to take into account [502] like email warm-up you could also have [504] different business models or maybe you [505] just have a bunch of emails ready to go [507] they're all already warmed up and then [508] all you do is just take a client on [510] redirect the domains I mean there's like [511] dozens of different uh business models [513] but the goal is you should be able to [514] turn this stuff around very [516] quickly what you should also do because [519] we're doing a service is you should [520] include a few scheduled progress updates [522] to the client to provide the impression [524] of momentum that you're pushing forward [526] this offer very very quickly what do I [528] mean by that I mean if you're delivering [530] um a CRM system you know schedule [533] updates on day one on day three and then [535] day five and then day five is your [537] delivery date well now the clients are [539] already had three touch points with you [540] they've gotten a bunch of positive juice [542] the dopamine's flowing they're like wow [544] these guys are on top of it I can't wait [545] to see the end result if you were to [547] just do nothing get the project on and [549] then deliver it on day five you're [550] missing a lot of like additional [552] leverage that you can build for yourself [554] um through Goodwill and through you know [555] the client feeling like they're a part [556] of the process the last thing is make [559] sure that whatever you're doing does not [560] actually have too much client [561] involvement or input um if you build [564] something that requires the client input [565] every five minutes it's just uh the the [568] the scope of these projects and [570] automation specifically and software [571] development these more complex um [573] Services they tend to blow up really [575] fast because the client isn't always [576] 100% on board and you have to explain [578] what you're doing and it just ends up [580] being a nightmare so if you want a [581] introductory no-brainer offer to really [583] crush it you just need to make sure that [585] it has not very much client involvement [587] with a cold email system for instance [588] you only need a few pieces of client [590] involvement in order to to make that pie [592] really good you need hey what are the [594] domains that we want um hey what's the [596] offer and then hey double check this cop [599] but trust me it's going to work anyway [601] like this takes maybe 10 minutes of the [603] client's time to determine it's not [604] something where you know you have to [606] have them do it all um through [607] throughout the process you just do it at [609] the beginning maybe you could do a form [610] something like that so that's [611] requirement number one it's it's how to [613] do it quickly require requirement number [615] two is that you have to be able to do it [617] cheaply internally because the thing is [619] and what I'm about to show you in a [621] minute is in order for this stuff to [622] work you have to make it not just [624] emotionally palatable to the client you [625] don't just have to make them think wow [627] this is so great I can't wait to I can't [628] wait to do it you you you can't just [630] focus on their heart but you really have [632] to focus on their mind and you have to [633] make this logically no-brainer like you [635] have to have them say hm you know this [638] appeals to the emotional problem I'm [639] having but this also appeals to like the [641] literal logical issue that I'm having [643] you know when you when you mitigate risk [644] for instance when you provide a money [646] back guarantee when you um say that you [648] know you don't pay unless you see these [650] results uh if your internal cost of [652] delivering this service is very high and [653] then you do a bunch of these your [655] business isn't really going to work so [656] you have to make sure that whatever you [657] can do you can do it cheaply the good [659] news is automation lends itself really [661] easily to that because usually the time [663] that you are spending or the money that [665] you are spending is either time for [667] yourself if you're a freelancer that's [668] fulfilling this on your own and that [669] times usually really small if you're [671] just copying and pasting templates or if [673] you're hiring somebody because you're [674] doing templates you could usually just [676] hire a junior developer or something [677] like that junior make.com or or n10 [679] engineer and then pay them some pittance [681] of an hourly rate just to have them [683] touch up your scenario right generally [686] speaking my recommendation if you're a [687] solo try and have your offer be [689] something that you can fulfill in two [691] hours so you could theoretically do [692] three or four of them in a day if you [693] were willing uh and then if you're [694] delegating work try and have it be [696] something that you can do for less than [697] 200 bucks if you have a make.com [699] developer for instance you're paying him [700] 40 bucks an hour should take them maybe [702] five hours max realistically it's [704] probably going to take them a little [704] less than that super possible if you're [707] using templates um the term reasonable [710] pricing depends on your market and who [712] you're targeting of course uh but I'll [714] give you a personal example from my [715] agency um the cheapest templated leaden [718] system that cold email system I [719] mentioned above was [721] $1,300 which is definitely much on the [723] cheaper end I've seen people sell the [725] same system for 7 8 10 [727] $15,000 it took us less than 45 minutes [729] to fulfill and collectively as a whole [731] company it cost us less than 50 bucks so [734] even though the absolute value of this [737] deal is quite quite low right it's [739] $1,300 the internal cost of $50 means [742] that uh what's my math on this 126 [745] though our margin on this uh like our [747] our cost of good sold essentially was [748] like % less than that um 96% gross [752] margins is pretty damn good in any [753] industry let alone a service industry so [756] yeah pretty stoked about that um that [758] was a pretty fun [760] project uh but make sure that whatever [762] you're doing you do it cheaply and um [764] you know that's just part of your core [765] offer if you're selling crms one-click [767] template you can do that super cheaply [769] if you're selling um some other hiring [771] system or something oneclick template [773] you can do it pretty [774] cheaply Okay the third requirement is [776] something that if you're unfamiliar with [778] service um agencies is sort of like a [780] model it may be a little bit tricky for [782] you to understand um so if you have to [783] play this back a couple times to really [785] get it then then please do but [787] essentially in order for this to work [789] your service needs to provide as little [791] risk as humanly possible to the client I [795] personally like to think of my [797] conversion rate as this formula it's [800] cost times ease times desire all divided [804] by risk what do I mean by this well if [807] it's really really cheap [809] I should have called this cheapness or [811] maybe I don't know affordability or [812] something but because it's sort of the [814] opposite but if your if your product is [816] really cheap then this number is big if [819] your product's really really easy to [820] implement then this number is big and if [822] the client really really really wants it [823] and solves their problem then this [825] number is Big right and if these three [827] numbers are big then your conversion [829] rate is going to be high but risk [832] divides that and so depending on how big [834] your risk is this sort of like the [835] biggest factor that can sort of impact [837] your total conversion rate because a [838] little bump up in this or a little bump [840] down in this can just have a massive [842] massive impact later on in the line so I [844] mean I don't know this is just a formula [845] you don't actually have to like this an [847] example formula you don't actually have [848] to use these numbers I'm not uh you know [851] telling you guys to all try and be like [852] mathematical sants and determine the [854] cost times ease times desire times risk [857] but it's just a thinking tool it's a way [858] to mentally model how best to structure [861] your offer make it affordable make it [863] easy to implement make that really [865] really solve their problem and then [867] minimize the amount of risk [869] so um you know it's a very simple lever [872] that you can pull to do the risk [873] minimization and let me get into the [875] different types of risk and and how you [877] could actually do this in practice [879] generally speaking and there are many [880] more types of risk than just this um one [882] of my friends out here is uh Matthew [884] Larson who runs a program called 1000x [886] leads he talks a lot about like the 17 [888] or 20 or 25 different forms of risk and [891] he's really like figured all this stuff [892] out so if you guys are curious on um [894] what other ways you can break down risk [895] definitely check his channel out um but [898] essentially I I like to break break [899] things down very simply and I see risk [901] as I think these four levers there is [904] monetary risk which is the risk of the [907] client losing their money that they are [909] investing with you now this is very very [912] easy to solve and I'll talk about it in [914] a second there's the time risk of them [917] wasting weeks on your service as opposed [920] to others this is also very easy to [922] solve there's like an exclusivity thing [924] you could easily be non-exclusive say [926] Hey try 10 people out there's the inform [929] risk where you learn about their [931] business and their proprietary Sops and [933] then you just off right you just [935] disappear and that's a big risk for a [936] lot of people that think that their IP [938] is super valuable and super important [940] which you can obviously minimize by not [942] asking a lot of information like I [943] talked about and then there's effort [945] risk where the client has to spend time [948] managing your project and micromanaging [950] you and then that actually pulls away [951] from all the rest of their [952] responsibilities uh which you can also [954] very easily mitigate just by not [956] involving the client that much and just [957] being as hands-off as you can [959] so there are a bunch more and there are [960] different ways to frame it right [962] reputational risk is another one but I'm [964] not going to get into those because [965] these are the ones that are very easy to [966] solve just in the wording of your offer [969] and these are the ones that we're going [969] to focus on to win you need to mitigate [973] as many of these as you can note that [975] you cannot completely eliminate risk and [976] if you could completely eliminate risk [977] you should well win a Nobel Prize for [979] sales I don't know if they do that but [980] they definitely should I want to win one [982] um as long as you decrease all of these [985] forms of risk as much as humanly [987] possible um your offer is going to be [989] solid right and just just the fact that [991] you are spending time thinking about [992] what you are selling is already massive [996] massive advantage over basically every [997] other service provider the vast majority [999] of service providers they never think [1000] about like this if you could spend [1002] just a few minutes thinking H how can I [1004] minimize the effort risk well I guess I [1006] need to do X even five minutes can 5x [1009] your Revenue over the course of the next [1011] few [1011] years okay so let me actually work down [1014] and show you how I would write these [1016] offers and you don't necessarily just [1018] have to write the offers this is like uh [1020] you know you could you could memorize [1021] these you could say these on a sales [1023] call um you can frame these on on your [1025] on your ad creative whatever you want [1027] these are just the the core offers the [1028] core ways to frame your service or your [1030] offer I should say um here's some [1032] examples for the monetary risk that I [1034] mentioned earlier a very simple way to [1036] solve this is hey we'll deliver X for [1039] you or you pay Z I.E you get your money [1042] back you can phrase this however you [1044] want we could say We'll deliver X for [1046] you um if we don't you're going to get [1047] 100% of your money back you could say [1049] We'll deliver X for you if we don't [1051] you're going to get 100% of your money [1052] back plus we'll pay you $500 you could [1054] say we deliver X for you and until we [1057] deliver X for you you don't pay a cent [1059] basically the purpose of this is you [1061] have to be very confident in what you [1062] sell obviously in your ability to [1063] fulfill it but if you like make this [1066] very clear to the customer they [1068] logically have no reason not to say yes [1070] I mean even you could be the worst [1072] salesperson and the whole wide world but [1074] if you literally just say hey we're [1076] going to do all this stuff for free and [1077] then even if we don't like even if we're [1079] like 1% off of our desired Target we'll [1081] even give you 500 bucks for your time [1084] the the ability to say no there is so [1087] damn hard that you're going to close [1089] deals like it's a slip and slide going [1091] straight into your bank account right [1093] and that's where you have to be good at [1094] your service that's obviously where you [1095] have to be confident in what you can [1096] fulfill but even if you're not very good [1099] at it consider that the refund rate on [1101] projects like this might be less than [1103] 10% or something but the impact to your [1105] conversion rate is like 10 times so so I [1109] mean if you think about it you're uh [1110] losing 10% of your profit for like a 10x [1114] increase in your Revenue which is [1116] basically always worth it so that's [1118] monetary risk uh we'll talk about time [1120] risk now basically the way that this [1121] works is we'll deliver X for you in [1123] exactly y days y weeks y months whatever [1126] time period and our service is [1127] non-exclusive so you bound it you say [1129] this isn't going to take more than this [1131] time also our service is non- exclusive [1133] so feel free to like hire 20 people here [1135] like we're going to show you that we're [1136] better but we're we're not here to take [1137] up your time we we just want to be as um [1140] straightforward with you as possible and [1141] if it if it works for us if it's a fit [1142] then we'll do it informational effort [1145] risk where people are like divulging [1147] their Sops and stuff like that you could [1149] simply solve it we don't need anything [1150] from you to start except for a three [1152] question type form that type form might [1153] take five minutes it might be like hey [1156] um I don't know like what are you [1157] comfortable like for a cold email system [1159] what are you comfortable guaranteeing um [1162] could be like a breakdown of like your [1164] past three biggest customers so you [1165] could use them for social proof during [1166] your copy could be uh uh you know Gmail [1170] or or Outlook right like you don't need [1172] a lot of information in order to make [1174] this work if you can get the client to [1176] give you that data in a few minutes and [1177] it's just like a simple um public facing [1180] form that they fill it out on you'll be [1182] totally [1183] fine now you need to make sure that this [1185] is feasible of course no risk mitigation [1187] will ever be 100% if you offer to give [1189] people your money back as I mentioned [1191] earlier 10% of the time 5% of the time [1193] whatever you are going to have to do it [1194] but the rate is usually much lower than [1196] you think and then the benefit to this [1198] too is um and I mentioned this a couple [1200] times with Grant Cardone talks about [1201] this a lot like once you've gotten the [1203] customer you're a lot more motivated to [1205] just figure it out so even if you're not [1207] super confident in your skill or your [1208] ability to deliver your guarantee you [1210] rest assured that if you have to give [1211] back $3,000 if you screw it up you're [1214] not going to screw it up you're going to [1215] figure out a way to make it work of [1217] course sometimes it'll fall through [1218] anyway but that's the mindset that you [1220] should have if you want to succeed in [1221] any agency or service-based business you [1224] you you're going to figure it out you're [1225] going to get the job you're going to [1226] make it freaking work and the next time [1227] you do it it's going to be million times [1229] easier even if you're not very confident [1231] and even if you don't really know what [1232] you're doing so I mentioned this uh [1234] monetary risk strategy about refunding [1236] 5% of your customers but what if it [1237] increases your conversion rate of 300% [1239] if you just do the math 5% of 300% more [1241] deals means you'll still make 285 per. [1244] so that is a no-brainer not just for the [1245] customer but for [1247] you the last thing I'll talk about and [1249] the last sort of like requirement is [1250] that this will logically lead into your [1252] upsell um remember you're going to make [1254] the vast majority of your money through [1256] your service not your no-brainer offer [1258] when I say service here I usually mean [1259] like a recurring sort of service like a [1261] retainer product a subscription product [1263] something where you see the client every [1264] month um the reason why is because this [1267] is the highest leverage service you [1269] might sell five of your tiny little [1271] offers at 2K a month and then make away [1273] with $10,000 in Revenue right but let's [1275] hypothetically say you have a recurring [1277] service at 3K a month and then the [1278] average customer lasts 6 months 3 * 6 is [1283] uh you know1 18,000 and then if you land [1285] five customers per month you're now [1286] making $90,000 of Revenue not cash [1289] collected but Revenue per month it's the [1292] exact same number of customers it's [1294] substantially more work of course but [1295] it's not like uh nine times the work to [1298] make nine times the money you know the [1299] benefit there is you also tend to get in [1302] bed with your customers in this industry [1303] um which is what makes it so high [1304] leverage they one usually don't want to [1306] lose you you're very sticky uh you know [1308] everything about their business you uh [1310] basically run all their services so [1311] there's a little bit of that risk on [1312] there and it's like you know even [1314] if Nick isn't providing me the best [1315] service I don't really know if I want to [1316] let him go which is positive of course [1318] depending how you view things um uh and [1321] the next is you just have so much so [1322] much leverage because sure they may be [1324] the service provider and they might be [1325] good at what they do um but if they're [1327] already good at what they do and you can [1328] build a system that like multiplies what [1329] they do by three I mean how else are [1331] they going to get a 300% increase in [1332] throughput without somebody like you [1334] it's basically impossible right they're [1335] not going to get 300% better at their [1336] service but you can make a system in a [1338] few M moments that allows them to [1339] deliver 300% as many right so yeah um [1344] you know if you can make your offer [1346] logically lead into you providing that [1347] service you're going to improve the rate [1349] at which people convert from your offer [1351] to your service and it's just going to [1352] help you go very far you're G to make a [1353] ton of money how do you make offers lead [1355] into your upsells well here are a couple [1357] examples uh let's say you're selling [1358] Leen which a lot of people in my [1359] community are you know we just had um [1361] brilliant guy sod make $15,000 I think [1365] in one month uh and he went from zero to [1367] $155,000 a month in like 35 days or [1370] something like that the way he did it is [1371] he sell he sold Leen um Leen will [1374] naturally lead to your crms or project [1377] management systems are onard systems if [1378] you just think about it because now [1380] you're generating leads but what the [1381] hell do they do with the leads right um [1384] the whole point is well now we're [1385] generating you 20 leads a month but [1386] you're kind of wasting 10 of them [1387] because you're not responding to them [1388] you're not organized you're not getting [1389] back to them you're not nurturing them [1391] so why don't we build you a CRM and then [1393] a project management system to ensure [1394] you can stay on top of that we can do [1396] that as part of our retainer very very [1397] simple sell a lot of people naturally [1399] see the value alternatively um CRM [1401] systems they'll naturally lead to hiring [1404] you on for the automation of the service [1405] fulfillment or if somebody brings you on [1407] for building a CRM so you know that [1409] crm's looking pretty empty why don't we [1410] fill it up I have a lead gen system that [1412] I can build for you over the course of [1413] the next month or two as part of our [1414] retainer uh and and we can you know [1416] start generating 5 10 15 20 leads a [1418] month um to start actually using this uh [1421] there are hundreds of other possible [1422] offers I just wanted to show you those [1423] two examples just to give you an you [1425] know insight into how this works [1427] logically if you're thinking about it [1428] right like what sort of related things [1430] can you sell that logically lead from [1433] your offer spend a few minutes make a [1434] little Whimsical board write a little [1436] mind map on a piece of paper and just [1438] try and and see what makes [1440] sense okay why don't we put it all [1442] together now um and I'll give you a [1444] couple of example offers the very first [1446] one that seems to work very well for our [1448] industry right now is I will build you a [1450] worldclass no risk cold email Outreach [1453] system in 14 days for [1456] $1,325 we'll Source 5,000 prospects for [1459] you we'll write your campaigns for you [1461] industry besting class copyrighting [1463] you'll get positive responses directly [1465] in your email inbox you'll own [1467] everything we're not going to have our [1469] fingers in any pie it'll be 100% you all [1472] you have to do is fill out a simple [1473] three question form it's going to take [1475] you less than 5 minutes and we'll do the [1476] rest and if you don't get at least 20 [1478] leads as I qualifi as I uh Define as [1481] qualified booked meetings in your [1482] calendar in the next two months I'm [1484] going to give you all of your money back [1487] this is an offer that works it's an [1488] offer that I've sold um well actually [1490] yeah I sold it for about the same amount [1491] of money once but I usually sell it for [1493] even more uh and it works [1495] extraordinarily well tons of people that [1496] I know in the automation industry making [1498] money off off this tons of people in my [1499] community are making money off this this [1500] is something you literally just take and [1502] then maybe tweak a little bit for the [1504] specifics of your own service provider [1506] however you want to like uh what [1507] platform you want to do the cold email [1508] stuff on or what AI you want to use to [1510] do some of the the personalization [1512] whatever this works um people are using [1515] it right now here's another one I'll [1517] build you the same photography pipeline [1520] that other $5 million year photography [1522] companies are using to make uh 500k a [1525] month for just [1526] $1,225 I'll do it in 7 days from start [1529] to finish if you're not completely [1530] Satisfied by the end of it you pay [1532] nothing Zar will then migrate all of [1534] your pre-existing projects from wherever [1536] the hell they are to the new system will [1538] then build documentation and record [1540] videos that train your team on how to [1541] use this your system will be organized [1543] professional High Roi it's going to [1545] eliminate chaos and then all you have to [1547] do is just fill out a short form which [1548] will take you less than 5 minutes and [1549] we'll do the rest again this is [1552] something that works it's something that [1553] I've sold it's something that a lot of [1554] other people have sold this is a [1556] oneclick clickup [1559] monday.com I don't know Trello template [1561] that you just you just freaking copy and [1562] paste a template essentially make a [1564] couple of minor changes and then you [1566] could hire I don't know a virtual [1568] assistant or something like that to do [1569] the migration of the projects which may [1570] cost you $100 you know it's like $100 of [1574] um labor for $1,225 a result that's [1577] cheap as hell and these are so [1579] incredibly affordable that when the time [1581] comes to pitch them on the retainer the [1583] client won't feel like you're price [1584] gouging them or anything they'll just [1585] think wow you know that guy delivered a [1586] lot of value for $1,300 [1588] let's see how much value he can deliver [1590] for 3,000 bucks a month in which case [1591] you'll be able to deliver a ton more [1593] value because you've now provided two [1595] offers which naturally lead into these [1597] other things that I'm mentioning so [1599] super logical um you don't need all of [1601] these points there are just selling [1602] tools of course but the more you have [1604] the easier the top of the funnel is [1605] going to be essentially the higher the [1607] conversion rate to is going to be at the [1608] very top and then you know you can [1610] optimize the the bottom and stuff like [1611] that [1612] later and then I mentioned down here [1614] that a bonus to providing guarantees is [1616] that it will force you and your team to [1617] maintain an incred incredibly high level [1618] of service which is obviously super [1620] valuable um you know once you get the [1622] deal you'll figure it out no matter what [1625] so that's that uh if I could give you [1627] some closing thoughts it would be that [1629] no-brainer offers are a no-brainer to [1630] implement if you just follow the [1631] step-by-step guide um if you take only [1634] one thing from this video Let It Be This [1636] formula that cost time ease times Desir [1639] divided by risk is equal to your [1641] conversion rate that alone is going to [1642] make you a ton of money and just make [1643] you and your automation agency very [1645] happy and aside from that get out there [1647] and go start making some of your offers [1649] I hope you guys appreciated this video [1650] um I had a lot of fun putting it [1652] together if you guys like this sort of [1653] stuff please like the video subscribe [1655] leave a comment down below with some [1656] suggestions or requests for future [1658] videos I'm really diving deep into like [1660] the theory of automation agencies [1662] recently because that's what a lot of [1663] people in my community are struggling [1664] with but if you want me to do something [1666] more specific to automation or make.com [1668] or zappy or whatever just let me know [1670] down below I take most of my requests [1671] from my comments thanks so much have a [1673] lovely rest of the day bye-bye

Title: How to Hire Devs For Your Automation Agency
[0] what's going on guys Nick here and in [1] this video I'm going to show you how to [2] hire devs for your automation agency [4] this is going to be a master class where [5] I cover literally everything that I know [7] not only about hiring developers but [9] also just hiring in general I'll show [11] you templates I'll show you forms I'm [12] literally just going to give you the [13] secret sauce this is not the only way to [15] get there it's just how I scaled my [17] writing agency to 92k a month and then [19] my automation company to 72k a month uh [22] take whatever makes sense to you of this [23] video and then leave whatever isn't um [25] but I am going to show you everything [27] here it's going to be no holds bar and [28] I'm just going to talk about the process [31] as well as my own view on it so first [32] things first I have sort of a [33] controversial take on the whole hiring [35] thing I don't think that you should be [37] hiring or delegating ever until you [40] absolutely have to so the very first [42] thing I'm going to talk about is the [43] concept of delegating being the answer [45] to all your problems the vast majority [47] of people are going to try and hire as [49] quickly as humanly possible because [51] everybody in business all the guru A's [53] and influencer bees all they say is like [55] man the second you got yourself a [57] problem you should be delegating so that [59] ends up with people hiring as quickly as [61] they can and not really putting much [63] thought into it they don't really have [64] much experience when they get to that [66] point where they think that they need to [67] hire um and then in practice what ends [69] up happening is you actually end up [70] having more work as opposed to less [72] because not only are you now doing the [74] exact same job that you were doing [75] before because odds are this person [76] sucks at it now you also have to manage [78] and train and then you're also paying [80] somebody several thousand dollars a [81] month to waste your time that's [83] opportunity cost plus the fat amount [85] that you are paying them uh what usually [87] happens is because you don't have any [89] good management practices because you've [90] just been like trained to delegate as [92] quickly as humanly possible your new [94] hire will leave because they are not [95] feeling like this is a place where they [97] have growth potential and they're also [98] not being treated right because you're [99] probably frustrated at them meaning [101] you've now wasted all the time and [102] energy that you invested plus the [104] opportunity cost to your Capital plus [105] the opportunity cost of your time if [107] you're unfamiliar with what opportunity [108] cost refers to it just means like what [110] you could have been doing with that if [111] you weren't doing this so the [113] opportunity cost your Capital means H I [115] wonder what else I could have been doing [116] with the $3,000 a month that I was [118] paying this person to be my junior [119] developer [120] uh yes I could have invested in [121] marketing I could have uh you know uh [124] built some more systems I could have [126] bought this software right the [127] opportunity cost your time is a similar [129] idea it's just like what I could have [130] been doing with the hours that I was [132] spending managing this person the end [134] result is you start from square one [135] again your business never grows I mean [137] how many people that are watching this [138] video right now have gone through that [140] exact same thing I'm willing to bet a [142] sizable percentage of them because I [144] myself when I was in a lot of your your [146] shoes um was in that period for at least [148] a year if not more [150] so there are a couple of other things [152] here um hiring for an agency is actually [154] really hard it's not anywhere near as [156] easy as I personally think hiring for [158] like a construction gig or something uh [160] where the person is just going to stand [161] around the vast majority of the time and [162] maybe not necessarily be utilized it's [164] not like hiring for a brick and mortar [165] shop it's not like hiring for an [166] e-commerce company it's not even like [168] hiring for a coaching company hiring for [170] an agency is a very specific process it [172] is a service fulfillment role and so you [175] need to verify that the person is good [177] at the service that they do but a lot of [179] the time it's also very communicative [180] role so you need to make sure they're [181] also communicative and they they're a [182] culture fit uh which makes it very damn [185] hard and you know hiring is thus the [187] most involved part of the average agency [190] second only to customer acquisition to [192] actually getting money in the bank so if [194] getting money in the bank is here and [196] then hiring people to take care of the [197] money in the bank is here you can kind [198] of see that the issue right I've talked [200] a lot about how to make money but I [201] haven't really talked about how to scale [203] that money and that's the purpose of [204] this video the the question is why and [207] there are a couple of reasons the first [209] is because of in Ines people are driven [211] to lie through their teeth to get that [213] job and it's just how the modern hiring [215] and application process works many of [218] you have applied for jobs before and you [219] probably either lied through your teeth [221] or grossly exaggerated your performance [222] or position it's simply how economic [226] incentives work and I'm not making a [228] moral judgment on it I'm simply saying [229] that the vast majority of people that [230] are going to apply for your job are [232] going to grossly exaggerate their [234] qualities and their capabilities which [235] makes it very difficult to take a resume [237] or a CV or even a video app application [240] and face value resumes tell you jack [242]  they basically tell you nothing [243] there just a list of places that people [245] have worked at and just stuff that [247] they've made up to be completely honest [249] I'm saying this because I've hired for [251] agencies which are a particular price [253] point maybe if you're in the software [255] Dev world or in a very particular Niche [257] or something like that you can expect [259] some more Integrity but you definitely [261] can't in the agency uh world it's a very [262] very big world there are you know [264] Millions not tens if not hundreds of [266] millions of people that are working in [267] it and so that uh High competition tends [270] to drown out um any honesty and and you [272] know uh incentive to care about your [274] reputation the other thing is that [276] interviews AK the way that most people [277] approach you know job uh hunting and [279] that sort of thing are very deceptive [281] they're not usually an indicator of a [282] good fit they're just an indicator on [284] whether or not a person can tell you [285] that they're a good fit which is [286] certainly a skill in and of itself if [287] you're hiring for a sales role but it [289] doesn't really mean that much if you're [290] just hiring for your agency um so yeah [293] I'm I'm going to I'm going to walk [294] through all of this in a moment Talk The [297] Talk versus walk the walk right somebody [299] talking about what they do is very [300] different from them actually doing it um [302] and then yeah in order to do hiring well [304] you do need to put a lot of thought into [305] it it's not something you can solve in 5 [307] minutes with an upwork job post I've [310] tried to solve this problem in five [311] minutes with an upwork job post hundreds [313] of times it does not work you need to [315] spend time and energy thinking about [317] what you're going to do before you do it [319] there's a 1% chance that you will find [321] somebody exceptional enough that they [322] will build their own structure so you [324] need to build a structure for them and [326] I'll show you how in this video I'll [327] show you the forms that I use and that [328] sort of thing so this takes me to one of [331] my main Concepts here and this is really [332] is the controversial part is that you [335] should hire last you shouldn't hire [337] first most people think you should hire [338] first I highly disagree you should hire [341] last don't hire until you absolutely [344] have to until you've explored literally [346] every other option that you have because [348] odds are hiring a person isn't actually [350] like the highest Roi decision that you [352] can make in a particular time the number [354] one reason why people will hire is [356] because they cannot any longer [358] reasonably fulfill the work that they're [359] promising to clients on time and if [362] you're suffering from this problem there [364] are a variety of other ways you could [365] solve it without bringing in that [367] additional complexity into your [369] organization and then you can set it up [371] so that when you do hire somebody they [373] end up being a lot more effective what [376] do I mean let's say I'm agency owner a [379] and I'm at $112,000 a month and I'm [381] super excited but I'm finding I'm buried [383] under amountain at work and some client [385] obligations are falling through and I've [387] received some grumblings and some [388] frustration in last month I'm thinking [391] damn man I got a hire I got to take some [393] of this work off my plate so that I [394] could focus more on that high Roi [396] activity well my recommendation to that [399] agency owner and I've made this a [401] million times is don't hire Instead try [404] productizing your service is your [407] service as simple and straightforward as [409] humanly possible to deliver is it [411] basically the same thing every time or [413] is it customized every single time you [415] get a new project because if it's the [416] same thing every time it's not going to [418] require anywhere near much of your hours [421] and realistically you could probably [422] deliver the same thing that you're doing [423] now two or three times as fast meaning [425] you have two or three times the capacity [427] why deal with the hiring problem at [429] 12,000 when you could deal with it at [431] $30,000 instead you'd probably be able [433] to hire somebody better for more money [435] and you'd probably all just be a little [436] bit better at business as well not to [438] mention with a product IED service it's [439] so much easier to hire people for it [441] because all they need to do is basically [442] be monkeys and just go down a list of [443] steps right so don't do that until [446] you've tried productizing your service [447] don't do it until you've tried [448] automating fulfillment I mean we're an [449] automation agency or you know I'm [451] talking about automation agencies so we [453] obviously have a leg up on this but you [455] know how much of the average service [457] agencies work can be automated like [460] graphic design you could automate 70% of [462] the manual labor in that the vast [464] majority of people are doing like 17 [467] steps in figma to I don't know maybe [469] they're doing website design figma to to [471] web flow to I don't know uh some [474] copywriter like like you don't need [476] anywhere near that many steps and you [477] can have ai do large portions of this [479] this work for you too as long as you're [481] careful about how you make it modular so [484] how how much better would it be if you [486] hired somebody on not to just do all of [488] that work but if you automated 80% of it [490] first and then hired a person on to do [491] the last 20% well now they can do five [493] times more work mathematically right um [496] if you haven't tried building a better [497] project management process before you [499] hire you should definitely try that if [500] you haven't tried patching holes in your [502] delivery maybe it's not the best [503] experience maybe some clients are [505] falling through and so because you're [507] not getting as much retention now you [508] have to juggle more new clients and [510] that's what's leading to you being [511] bottlenecked maybe you're just not [513] targeting the right people to start with [514] maybe if you found some nicer easier and [516] better clients in a different audience [518] they'd be way less demanding and you [520] yourself would be way less bottlenecked [521] so instead of capping out at 12K maybe [523] you can cap out at 20 30 or 40K instead [526] you guys kind of see what I'm what I'm [527] saying here um all of these steps that [529] I'm talking about they're delivering a [530] higher Roi than just [532] hiring this might deliver a 30 times Roi [535] this might deliver a 15 times Roi maybe [537] this delivers a 15 times Roi I this [539] might do like a 25 times Roi hiring is [542] not going to give you that much of an [543] Roi hiring could realistically probably [545] give you like a five times Roi so do [548] everything that you can before you hire [549] because hiring should be relatively low [551] on the priority list if you're a [552] competent and and capable service [554] professional once you've done all of [556] these steps and then you're ready to [558] hire well now you have systems which [560] lets you hire the right person for Less [562] because more of their intellectual [564] capacity is no longer them it's like in [566] the system that you built which you've [567] done ahead of time and then it also [569] allows them to do their job better [570] faster and then they can do more of it [572] as well or you could as I mentioned [574] earlier just hire a better person now [576] because you have all these systems you [577] can afford more and maybe this person [578] now instead of just doing the job can [580] actually be like more of a more of a [581] partner sort of role maybe they can work [582] with you to improve or business [585] develop okay so that's my whole uh [589] philosophy on hiring last as opposed to [590] first you have to be very good at what [592] you're doing of course and I consider [593] myself very good at what I'm doing which [595] is why this has worked for me if you're [596] not you either got to brush up your [598] skills or maybe yeah maybe maybe hire a [600] little faster but I would highly [602] encourage you guys go through that list [603] before you do any sort of hiring [605] assuming that we now are actually hiring [607] though how do we actually go about [609] hiring the most effective way possible [611] well I've hired several hundred people [612] at this point I've also fired basically [615] several hundred people at this point um [617] the only way that I found to evaluate [620] how somebody will do at your job and [621] have that be a very good litmus test of [624] whether they're going to do your job [625] well is to actually have them do your [627] job like to actually have them go go [629] through and do the thing that you are [631] going to be paying them to do assuming [632] that everything works out everything [634] else is just noise it's just [637] interviews total I would only [640] ever have an interview if I've already [641] decided to hire somebody and I'm just [643] looking to make sure they're not like a [644] sociopathic serial killer that's going [645] to like you know Murder my cat or [647] something of course if something doesn't [649] add up don't hire um you know like there [653] are some situations which I've really [656] liked a person and they looked good on [657] paper but then when I talked with them [658] there was just some weird like feeling [660] deep down in my bones that I don't know [662] I don't think this is going to be a fit [664] and I tend to listen to my intuition [665] quite a bit um I know not everybody does [668] but I tend to listen to my intuition [669] quite a bit it's been quite good for me [670] so um what I've realized is if I have [673] that feeling I should just not hire that [675] person because finding another person [676] only takes five or 10% of the time I [678] would have spent if I just like hired [680] the wrong person like if you think about [682] it like when you hire somebody you're [684] really committing to that person you're [685] you're committing um money obviously but [687] you're also committing your time to do [688] onboard training you're investing in [690] that person and then you also have to [692] offboard them too which is another [693] process right um so like the time that [696] you the money the Total Resource that [698] you would spend if you were to just say [700] all right I'll find somebody else um you [702] would have to spend more money because [703] you'd be passing up on that person and [704] hiring as expensive which I'll get into [706] uh but it would only be about 5 10% of [708] the cost of actually hiring the wrong [709] person so if you think about it like [711] mathematically like if if your intuition [712] tells you that that's the wrong person [714] even 10% of the time you're good right [715] you should let them go this doesn't mean [718] that you should demand perfection in [719] every way shape and form it just means [721] trust your gut uh the best predictor of [724] job success after um you know somebody [726] knowing how to do the thing and doing it [727] well is an internal locus of control if [730] you guys are unfamiliar with the concept [731] of an internal locus of control that [733] just means that um let's say you're [735] driving and then somebody cuts you off [737] in traffic there are two types of people [739] the first person will say man why is [740] that guy why does this always happen to [742] me why does that guy cut me off in [743] traffic what the hell is wrong with them [744] man this always happens at 4:30 p.m. on [746] Rush Hour man I hate my job I hate this [748] I hate that this second uh type of [750] person will say hm that guy cut me off [752] again I wonder why that keeps happening [753] I wonder what I could change to prevent [755] him or other people like that from [756] cutting me off the first is an external [758] locus of control where everything [760] happens to you and the second is an [762] internal locus of control where you [763] happen to the world and if you want [766] somebody that's competent capable and [767] that's going to grow with you you need [769] them to have an internal locus of [770] control you should also have a internal [772] locus of control yourself of course um [775] but this is the the whole concept of [776] like taking fate and destiny and [778] wrangling with your two hands uh to to [781] make something out of it that those are [782] the types of people that are going to [784] improve the next thing is skill is [786] important but raw talent is much more [787] important like you know um if they don't [790] have too much experience doing the job [792] it's their first or second time doing [793] the job and then they go and they [794] actually do it do it well when you give [795] them a test which I'll get into um that [798] demonstrates that they they probably [799] have a lot of raw talent and so you can [801] actually mold that quite a bit so I look [803] for intelligence I don't do IQ tests or [805] anything like that but I certainly do [806] look for [807] intelligence beware overp specialization [809] when you're hiring too many people um [811] hire these super narrow roles like um [814] it's not just a graphic designer it's [815] like a figma designer who can only [817] design things in figma and the second [818] that they have some other need where [821] it's like oh well you know you need to [822] make something at Google Slides instead [823] they just they put their hands up like I [824] can't I can't do it in Google Slides I [826] don't know how to do it I suck right [827] don't look for people like that look for [829] people that they know the thing they [832] don't necessarily only know how to do [833] the thing with a particular approach [835] like I consider myself an automation [836] engineer I could build out the exact [838] same flows that I've shown you make in [839] literally anything including code it's [841] not necessarily that I'm wedded to make [844] it's that it's just easier for me and [846] that's that's what I use it for so [847] beware over specialization especially [849] over tool specialization um your graphic [852] designer should still be able to write [853] the titles they should still be able to [854] like do some very introductory basic [857] copy on the pamphlets that they make [859] right uh that sort of thing the last two [862] are um you should be aligning incentives [864] wherever possible so you should be [865] paying them either a percentage a [867] commission percentage uh a bonus based [869] off their performance in addition to [871] some base salary usually um and the [873] reason why is because if you only pay [875] people like an hourly rate a lot of the [876] time they end up just being like clock [878] Watchers and uh they click the they [880] click the time track button or or [882] whatever your project management system [883] looks like and then they just sit there [884] for a little while go make themselves a [885] cup of coffee drink it uh that's fine [887] and some of that's going to happen no [889] matter who you hire and you have to be [890] willing to take some of that like people [891] are only really going to work like 70ish [893] per of the time that they say that [894] they're going to work but that said if [896] you align your incentives with them and [898] you say Hey listen I actually care less [899] about how much you work versus how much [901] you can deliver for me um then they're [903] going to be more likely to deliver for [905] you obviously because you're [906] compensating them for that right the [908] last thing is you absolutely need an [910] onboarding sequence to kick off your [912] staff work right if you don't have an [913] onboarding sequence you're just playing [914] yourself don't play yourself um staff [917] members are nowhere near as structured [918] as you are as a business owner uh you [920] have had to basically form your own life [923] structure from the inside out from the [924] ground up a lot of these people because [927] they're used to working for other people [929] obviously they're used to structures [931] being given to them so it's very very [933] rare that you're going to find somebody [934] that can effectively onboard to your [935] company unless you have a super easy [937] defined onboarding sequence all [940] right I hope I covered more or less all [943] of those principles from the top down [945] now what I'm going to do is I'm going to [947] cover them from the bottom up and I'm [948] going to talk very deeply about how to [950] actually go about and do all of these [951] things and then after I'm actually going [954] to show you how I verify all this [955] information as well as what my own [957] hiring pipeline looks like both that [959] left click which is my automation agency [960] and one second copy which is my content [962] writing agency as I told you I'm just [964] going to give you guys everything here [966] so uh let's just talk about each of [968] these points in a little more detail the [970] only way to evaluate how someone will do [972] at your job is to have them do the job [974] so what you should do if you want to [975] hire somebody is get them to literally [977] do the job that you're hiring them for [979] before you hire them while they're still [981] in the interview stage give them a real [984] project scope and say hey um you know I [986] want you to build this out for $100 you [988] know and time yourself see how long it [990] takes yeah you are going to have to pay [992] the money it's going to cost you [994] something but it's going to cost you 1% [997] of the money that you will lose if you [998] don't have something like this just in [1000] terms of the time energy opportunity [1002] cost the years off your life and the [1004] freaking inches off your hairline that [1006] you're going to have if you don't give [1008] people like if you don't hire the right [1010] people and then you end up just [1011] floundering for several years like [1013] happens to a lot of people that I know a [1014] lot of my fellow business owners that I [1016] came up with floundered for years [1018] because they just figure this out a good [1021] example of this is yeah you know um you [1023] have some very simple project scope you [1026] want to somebody build a very simple [1027] system maybe in in in make.com pay [1030] people money to do that test and just [1032] take it as a sunk cost like hey if I [1034] want to evaluate how people are going to [1035] do I'm going to pay $50 per evaluation [1039] person per participant and then maybe [1041] one and four of those participants are [1042] going to do it right so really I'm only [1044] paying $200 to hire somebody that $200 [1047] is saving me $155,000 over the course of [1049] the next six months take a real project [1051] scope from a client omit the names [1053] obviously be privacy conscious give us [1056] to them have them recreate it all they [1058] need to do is insert their time and then [1059] maybe ask them a brief retrospective in [1061] the form like hey how did you do um have [1063] them add their payment info PayPal [1064] wise.com whatever you're going to get [1066] dozens of hours save they're going to [1067] get a little job it's going to be a [1068] win-win they might even be able to use [1070] in their portfolio I don't know um but [1072] this is a very positive and like [1073] mutually beneficial way of doing things [1076] if you're incapable of doing this like [1079] if you don't do this it's probably [1081] because you are worried about the money [1083] and if you're worried about the money [1084] your company probably isn't big enough [1085] for you to hire yet so just keep that in [1087] mind if you're looking at this and [1088] you're saying man $50 per test [1090] maybe if I do 10 tests a month that's [1092] 500 bucks I don't know if I can afford [1094] it I hate to break it to you but you [1096] probably haven't done everything that [1097] you can before you hire um because the [1099] vast majority of even Freelancers even [1101] before you have a second person in your [1102] company can easily do $10,000 a month um [1105] or more you know with with the right [1107] systems um you know I yeah I got all the [1109] way up to I think like solo I probably [1111] done at least 40 $50,000 a month um but [1115] you know that's because I'm in [1116] automation which is super high [1118] leverage okay so the next is interviews [1120] are obviously mostly only have [1122] one if you've already decided to hire [1123] them most agency hiring pipelines are [1126] hey I'm going to put up a job post on [1128] upwork or indeed or whatever hey then [1129] I'm going to read some resumés hey if [1131] there's an interesting candidate I'm [1132] going to give them a ring then I'm going [1133] to book an interview then I'm going to [1134] have an interview and then I'm going to [1135] hire them but this is fundamentally [1137] broken because many people are great at [1139] talking and shitty at working or vice [1140] versa my recommendation is only have an [1142] interview if they've already done your [1143] job above right and then you're [1145] convinced that you're going to hire them [1147] already so as you see this hiring [1149] pipeline is sort of crystallizing right [1152] you have some introductory like I'll [1153] show you my hiring pipeline in a minute [1155] but you have some sort of um application [1157] they fill out the application then you [1159] short list them based off their their [1160] qualities and then they fill it a a like [1162] they actually do a small little project [1164] for you and then assuming that they do [1165] the project well then you give them a [1167] call that's a much more effective [1168] pipeline than what the vast majority of [1170] other agencies do this is about the gut [1172] feeling um it takes at minimum about one [1174] week for somebody to get up and running [1175] in your company it also takes your time [1177] your team's time your clients's time Etc [1180] so my rough rule of thumb is the cost of [1182] hiring in the first month is the [1184] person's salary times three what I mean [1186] by that is let's say you're saying [1187] saying spending $5,000 a month if you're [1190] spending $5,000 a month on somebody [1191] assume that the cost of hiring them for [1193] month one is actually $115,000 worth of [1195] your time and your team's time in the [1197] first month uh you can just find [1199] somebody else it takes one tenth of the [1200] time and money if something isn't adding [1202] up just don't hire that person you're [1203] going to save yourself a [1204] lot I talked about the internal locus of [1207] control before but um it's basically to [1209] change I must change myself I don't uh I [1211] don't change other you know like I'm the [1214] problem here not everybody else it's an [1216] extraordinarily rare ability I think to [1219] all of my friends and all of the people [1221] in my life that I enjoy spending time [1222] with and every single one of them has an [1224] internal locus of control if I think [1225] about all of the people in my life that [1226] I don't like spending time with whether [1228] it's staff members employees friends or [1229] family members it's all because they [1230] have an external locus of control so [1233] having an internal locus of control in a [1236] staff member is fantastic you should [1237] also be having an internal locus of [1238] controlling yourself um some examples [1241] here business isn't succeeding oh it's [1242] the market too hard haven't lost weight [1244] oh it's the weather I can't go outside [1246] and run poor relationships oh it's it's [1249] my girlfriend's fault it's my [1250] boyfriend's fault right most of the [1252] stuff is most things in life [1254] are your fault um it also means that [1255] most successes in life are yours to [1257] claim uh one of my my best friends once [1259] told me something and it really hurt me [1261] at the time because I wasn't making very [1263] much money but he said something along [1264] the lines of people are paid exactly [1266] what they deserve to be paid and so if [1268] you are not being paid more it's because [1271] you don't deserve it yet and that really [1273] that really with my head at the [1274] time but um it ended up being one of the [1276] most valuable things I think that I [1279] could have heard at that time because it [1280] motivated me to push harder and become a [1282] person that was deserving of both like [1283] very very high compensation and [1285] renumeration um relatively to most [1287] people on planet Earth but also um you [1290] know just the sort of person that says [1292] yeah if I'm not happy in my life it's [1293] probably up to me to make myself so so [1296] look for those people you can add a few [1298] sample questions to your job form you [1299] could ask hey you know somebody cuts you [1301] off in traffic like what do you do right [1302] so something along those lines you just [1304] want a person to be clear that they are [1307] capable of developing their positive [1309] skills skills important raw talent's [1311] much better so again search for people [1313] with an internal locus of control that [1315] are smart even if they don't know 100% [1316] of the job skills that you're looking [1317] for they'll learn it in about a tenth of [1319] the time is the people that are an [1320] external locus of control that aren't [1322] smart and their pension for work will [1323] balance the scales in the first month or [1325] two I just mean like um ambitious people [1326] like being around ambitious other [1328] ambitious people intelligent people like [1330] being around other intelligent people um [1332] if your company is full of intelligent [1333] people um they're they're really going [1335] to enjoy it and they're going to want to [1336] work [1337] more the over specialization part is a [1340] lot more nuanced than what I initially [1341] talked about um and I you know the worst [1344] agencies I will ever see are the ones [1346] that have like 50 hires for one project [1347] or one task like uh an example from an [1350] actual company that I I worked with that [1352] I actually used to um own a portion of [1354] just uh four or five months ago I guess [1357] is they had a process for website design [1359] where they had um a website that needed [1360] to be designed and so then they had a [1362] figma designer that was responsible for [1363] creating mockups and then they had a web [1365] flow designer who would take those [1366] mockups and then make a website with [1368] them Pixel Perfect then a copywriter [1370] would write copy in a Google doc give it [1372] to the webflow designer who would then [1373] add that copy to the web flow site [1374] manually and then the account manager [1376] would take those webflow mockups and [1378] show them to the client the client would [1379] then send revision requests then we'd [1381] literally start all the way back here [1383] the number of steps required to get from [1385] like a website like the the website [1387] request to the actual website at the end [1389] of the day was probably like over 40 um [1391] when I came in I I eliminated that so it [1393] was only two steps there was a webflow [1394] designer who knew how to do design [1396] anyway so they just did it all [1397] themselves and then there was a [1399] copywriter that used web flow's edit [1400] mode to come in and then just do the do [1402] the copy uh editing themselves so you [1405] can do you can do a lot of this um the [1408] the issue is you know when you hire [1409] somebody that only knows knows how to do [1411] figma design obviously then you're like [1412] a well now I gotta hire somebody [1413] else that does this just don't even get [1415] yourself into that problem at the [1416] beginning um every task has a small [1418] fixed cost to it so every time you start [1420] a new task every time you wind down [1422] every time you you have to tell somebody [1424] what you did or deliver a status update [1426] all these are small incremental costs [1427] that add up and then that ends up being [1429] like 20 or 30% of the person's total [1431] work um so you want to minimize the [1433] number of steps involved in a project [1435] maximize the number of things that one [1436] hire can do for you [1438] you know I give you an example here from [1441] yeah anyway like my my flow for that [1443] agency that I used to work with I'll [1446] give you some examples about incentives [1448] um what you could do is you could have [1449] 7% Commission on cash collected you [1451] might have a 10% end ofe bonus if your [1453] Milestone is met maybe as an agency you [1455] want to hit a million dollars a year if [1456] you hit a million dollars a year you'll [1458] give uh I don't know 10% of that [1460] person's sale commission to them at the [1462] end of the year or something as a bonus [1464] when you combine this with the internal [1465] locus of control that we talked about [1466] with the raw talent that we've talked [1468] about [1468] um you end up getting fantastic results [1470] and the people are usually very [1471] motivated they're sort of killers um and [1473] you are willing to invest a lot of money [1475] in them because you don't want to let [1476] them go I talked about the clock stairs [1479] um it's not that you can't pay people [1480] hourly I'm just telling you to throw [1482] something else in there on top of the [1483] hourly um and then the last thing this [1485] is kind of important um there was a lot [1487] of research done in the 70s and 80s [1488] actually where I went to University [1490] believe it or not um they were like [1491] super famous for all of their rat [1493] behavioral tests um but it showed the [1495] influence of variable reward or variable [1497] incentive bonuses on performance and on [1499] motivation and on um I think even like [1502] uh I don't know like [1504] cognitive I don't know the term but the [1506] ability to complete a task um when you [1508] give somebody steady increases in some [1511] stimulus versus if you give them a [1512] variable increase in some stimulus some [1514] positive stimulus and they found that [1516] when you give variable increases in a [1517] stimulus performance was like night and [1519] day better so it's a it's a variable [1521] incentive that tends to perform the best [1523] what I mean by that is instead of [1524] raising their base salary by $1 every [1526] year or something that they're with you [1528] um just start giving them variable [1529] incentive bonuses like 10% end of your [1531] bonus 7% Commission on cash collected [1534] some additional performance thing that [1535] you throw in maybe every quarter some [1537] competition something like that there's [1539] a reason why so many companies do it and [1540] they can be very very [1543] powerful okay so let's actually talk [1545] about this um onboarding sequence here [1546] and then let's actually cover my own [1548] step-by-step hiring process so just like [1550] you onboard uh clients like if you run [1553] an automation agency or really any any [1554] agency and then you bring new clients on [1557] and you have some defined sequence with [1558] a kickoff call and some documents that [1560] you ask them for and all that stuff you [1562] actually need to onboard your new staff [1563] members as well what this means in [1565] practice and a lot of people talk about [1567] this but they don't actually show what [1568] it means what this means is you need to [1569] have a documentation Hub you need to [1572] have defined daily tasks for the first s [1574] to 14 days then you need to have a clear [1576] organization chart and the person needs [1578] to know who they're reporting to or [1579] talking to there is no better time to [1583] set expectations high and then kick off [1585] a new hire with this there is the this [1588] is the highest point of Leverage in the [1590] entire hiring process that initial [1592] onboarding sequence because you've [1593] already found somebody that you think is [1594] good maybe they're 90% of the way there [1596] if you do this right you can get them [1597] like 150% of the way there you can [1599] multiply what they're capable of doing [1601] what they believe themselves are capable [1603] of doing how long they stay with your [1604] company if you give them a good [1605] experience in those first two weeks [1607] they're going to be with you for a very [1608] long time so um you know with the three [1612] things that I mentioned here above what [1613] an example might be is you might have a [1615] clickup documentation Hub that welcomes [1617] the team member [1619] G gets everything they need to be paid [1621] so you get their payment info maybe [1622] their direct deposit form whatever then [1624] you have a list of Sops and all the [1625] tasks that they're going to be doing and [1627] then you have a simple daily schedule [1628] over the course of the next s to 14 days [1630] to ease them into the week as well as [1631] specific contacts that they can and [1633] should reach out to for assistance or [1634] questions you assign them a mentor a [1635] buddy whatever you want to call they do [1637] some shadowing they sort of increase in [1638] job duties and responsibilities until [1640] they're fully on their own a couple [1641] weeks [1642] in a way to be clever and sneaky about [1646] this too um which will save you a little [1647] bit of money is position this as their [1649] onboarding trial or their onboarding [1652] sequence or their trial period I don't [1653] like using the word probationary [1655] personally but you know it's basically [1656] what it is because at the end of that [1658] 14-day sequence you then have a very [1660] defined start and finish time to be able [1663] to say Hey listen I don't think this is [1665] working out and then you can let them go [1666] gracefully this minimizes how long you [1668] need to hire or have shitty hires on for [1671] and then as a team you guys can all sort [1673] of like make a decision after the seven [1674] or 14 day sequence however long you want [1676] to make it um so this ends up being one [1677] of the one of the more positive ways to [1679] save money um on the hiring process and [1681] just ensure you don't end up in this big [1682] loop of [1684]  all right so let me actually [1686] cover my step-by-step hiring process and [1687] then I'll show you a bunch of my uh my [1689] forms um what this actually looks like [1691] in practice in a modern-day 21st century [1694] you know digital agency is you will [1697] first make a job post you'll do a job [1699] post on indeed or you'll do it on upwork [1701] or wherever your desired job lives top [1703] tow I don't know some some coding [1705] platform but you're going to make a job [1706] post the job post is Sol not hyper [1708] relevant nobody really reads your job [1710] post these days sorry to say uh but what [1713] you want to do is you want to you want [1714] to make this job post you you have chat [1716] gbt right I mean that's 99% of them [1718] nowadays you want to funnel all the [1720] people that apply to that job into a [1722] general hiring form that asks questions [1725] looks for locus of control takes maybe [1727] five minutes to fill Max you don't want [1729] people to like you know really have to [1730] spend too much time energy on this or [1731] your conversion rate is going to be low [1733] um and then you know once they filled [1734] all that out you want to funnel that [1735] into some you know uh project management [1738] system somewhere I I use clickup [1740] obviously because I adore that platform [1741] it crushes it I love it but after then [1745] what you do is you call these your first [1747] round hires these are people that are at [1749] stage one of your hiring process right [1751] they filled out your form what you do [1752] then is you go through that form and [1754] then you basically short list candidates [1756] based off of how valuable uh their skill [1759] set is and based off how much they hit [1761] those various criteria that we talked [1762] about [1763] earlier what you do after that is for [1766] every person that you short list you [1767] will send them a link to a testing form [1770] where you will actually pay them money [1771] to do a test the way these numbers break [1774] down is you might hire or have 200 [1776] people fill out your application form [1778] then you might short list 10 people and [1780] 10 people will do your test after those [1783] 10 people do your test you're going to [1784] want to hire maybe three of them okay [1786] maybe 30% something like that from there [1789] you call this your second round hires [1792] and then anybody that makes it past that [1795] you know um that second filter he'll [1797] just give them a call and it'll verify [1798] that they are who they say that they are [1800] if you're hiring somebody in person [1801] which I don't recommend that you do [1802] remote is basically always going to be [1804] better in in today's day and age just [1805] too much cost involved with having [1807] people on Prem for an agency that's [1809] making less than like 500k a month um [1812] call the short listed applicants just [1813] make sure they don't sound like serial [1815] killers you can do a video call with [1816] them if you want I personally don't even [1817] frame it as an interview I just frame it [1819] as a just getting to know each other hey [1820] I loved your test I think you're perfect [1821] for the role why don't we just like jump [1822] on a call and get to know each other um [1825] and then once you have selected those [1827] from that group of three maybe have one [1828] or two once you've selected them give [1830] them the onboarding sequence have them [1832] come in and then at the end of the [1834] onboarding sequence you can decide [1835] whether you want to hire them or let [1836] them go this system is at least 10 times [1840] more efficient really 10 times more [1842] effective than the average hiring funnel [1843] that most other agencies use and this [1845] will save you millions of dollars over [1846] the course of the next couple years if [1847] you just use it just like I talked about [1850] just have them do the thing that you [1851] want them to do evaluate them on their [1854] ability to do that thing culture fit is [1856] important of course but you're just [1857] trying to make sure they're not a [1858] freaking serial killer so just leave all [1860] that stuff to the end evaluate the [1861] highest Roi parts of their skill set [1866] first all right let me actually show you [1868] an example of what this looks like and [1870] I'll run you through just a bunch of [1871] type forms that we've created for this [1873] purpose so remember how earlier I said [1875] that we're going to take an indeed or or [1877] upwork job post and funnel it into a [1879] form right so this is what an example of [1882] that form might look like you don't have [1884] to design it with a mountain I don't [1885] really remember why we did that um nor [1887] do you have to to do a cool sexy space [1889] background which just makes me want to [1890] take my pants off cuz how cool it is [1892] just kidding I designed most of this if [1894] you couldn't tell uh but uh it just it [1898] it asks a bunch of questions it runs [1899] people through sort of a funnel so for [1901] instance what is left click um it talks [1903] about what our company is How We Do It [1906] um the work involved uh we talk about [1909] exactly what our business does as I [1911] mentioned to you earlier the job post [1913] itself isn't really important because [1914] you're just going to reiterate most of [1915] this information here we talk about what [1917] the opportunity [1918] is we talk about um you know uh we get [1922] their contact details we get their [1923] LinkedIn profile we get them to give us [1924] their location their start date their [1926] weekly availability what's really [1927] interesting too is we'll actually ask [1928] them to give us their hourly rate so we [1931] say what's your desired hourly rate as [1932] opposed to you know this position will [1934] pay $25 because people then get to sort [1937] of like compete with themselves um to [1939] offer lower hourly rates which [1940] ultimately allows us to save a little [1942] bit of money if we're hiring hourly [1944] we'll give them an opportunity to upload [1945] their resume um then they'll be able to [1947] send us some comments here and then we [1949] actually feed them into a second form [1951] called The Experience form the reason [1953] why we do this is because we just like [1954] to give them the impression that this is [1955] only going to take a few minutes and [1957] then if you've already filled out [1958] everything all the way down to like here [1960] you spent like four or five minutes [1961] already you're like all right cool [1962] what's another few minutes right so you [1963] click continue and in this way we get [1965] more information from them and we also [1967] give them a more positive experience the [1969] second form is just like a like a [1971] workflow automation checklist we just [1973] want to see what sorts of skills they [1974] have so most of the time we're hiring [1976] for a particular job like skill set [1979] right so we will say make.com we just [1980] want to verify see if they have anything [1982] else we'll ask them for their CRM [1984] experience we'll ask them for their [1985] project management experience their [1987] documentation software right dashboard [1989] software programming language other [1990] tools process workflow examples those [1992] are like portfolio pieces here and then [1994] some comments and then what what happens [1996] here is we will take all of this [1998] information and we will feed it into a [2000] big pipeline here now this is a pipeline [2002] for Content writing this isn't a [2003] pipeline for um hiring simply because I [2005] no longer have that hiring pipeline set [2007] up because I haven't needed to use it in [2008] quite a while but this is a good example [2010] of what this ends up looking like in [2011] clickup you end up with uh the name over [2014] here on the left hand side which I will [2015] blur and post um the date that the [2018] person applied the status of that hire [2020] new applicant versus you know I'll show [2022] you in a sec the pipeline um their [2024] portfolio so we asked them a a portfolio [2027] their rate the minimum number of hours [2029] that they could work this is one second [2030] copy specific the place they came from [2032] and then a rating [2033] field and what ends up happening is we [2036] get to move them automatically using [2038] automation through these fields um so [2041] you know after we've reviewed them we [2042] review um if we want them to fill out a [2045] trial or do that test will request a [2047] trial right this is sort of how we move [2049] people through the process from start to [2050] finish so that's what this would look [2053] like actually like practically and then [2055] the really cool part is you can automate [2057] the majority of the hiring process to [2058] give your HR people or you even more [2060] leverage over this um you know you take [2063] these forms and you link them with [2064] make.com and or alternative when a [2066] candidate submits you add them to set [2067] hiring Pipeline and then use automations [2069] to adjust based off of the statuses you [2071] can also do things like template the [2073] emails template the welcome sequences [2075] template messages from from team members [2076] and that sort of thing an example of how [2080] we might automate this is um when we go [2082] from New applicant to request trial [2084] right it will then send an automatic [2086] email to them saying hey uh Peter you [2089] know thanks so much for filling out that [2091] application we really love your skill [2092] set we want to jump on sorry I we'd love [2094] for you to fulfill a quick little trial [2096] for us we're going to pay you for that [2097] trial it's going to be equivalent to you [2099] doing a small job on like a freelance [2101] platform it's going to take you on [2102] average less than two hours if you're up [2104] for it this is a link to a form where [2106] you can go and you can actually do it [2108] what the form looks like is it looks [2109] like something like this well uh I don't [2112] have the form for left click so I'm just [2113] showing you the one from my content [2114] writing company one second copy but we [2116] will ask them to track their time using [2118] clockify or another time tracking app we [2120] then um give them instructions on what [2123] the article should be like so word count [2125] um title uh a brief right formatting and [2130] then we actually have them like give us [2131] the article they they add a link to a [2134] Google doc essentially um and then you [2136] know that's sort of how we take them to [2137] the next step and then what ends up [2139] happening in the hiring pipeline here is [2140] you see the request trial is done and [2143] that moves them to review trial and then [2144] somebody in our team just marks them yes [2146] or no and then if it's a yes then they [2147] move to onboarding what happens once [2149] they're being onboarded uh we will send [2151] them a welcome email welcoming them to [2153] the business giving them a link to a [2155] slack they'll accept the slack link and [2157] when that happens we have an automation [2159] that will add them to an onboarding [2160] Channel and then automatically send them [2162] like four or five messages all from [2163] different team members just welcome them [2165] to the team like I'll say hey thanks so [2167] much for joining really looking forward [2168] to having you my partner will say Hey [2170] you know I saw your trial I thought it [2172] was great um our manager will say Hey [2174] you know super looking forward to having [2175] you on the team we've been needing [2176] somebody with your skill set for a while [2178] and basically you just give them a huge [2179] hit of dopamine in the first like few [2181] minutes of them joining which is [2182] obviously super valuable um there's more [2185] that I could say about this process we [2186] have a couple of additional form [2188] um like we'll do a daily standup for [2189] their first 7 to 14 days where they'll [2191] fill it out they'll figure out they'll [2193] they'll let us know what they worked on [2194] yesterday what they're working on today [2196] whether or not there are any blockers um [2198] and then we'll also like ask them for [2199] their payment information and stuff like [2200] that using a form but I think most of [2202] that is self-explanatory and if you guys [2203] are at this point you probably yeah you [2205] probably get what I'm trying to [2207] say uh the last thing is you could use [2209] AI hypothetically to check resumés [2211] although I personally find all that [2212] stuff very silly I don't really think [2214] that you should be using AI for a point [2215] of high leverage like this when a single [2217] goal shitty hire can cost you10 or [2219] $15,000 a year um but yeah is what it is [2223] in terms of my closing thoughts I have [2225] three the very first one is you should [2227] be hiring last not first the second [2230] thing is you should have people do the [2232] job that you're hiring them for in order [2235] to win your job so before you hire [2237] somebody actually have them do the thing [2238] that you're hiring them for I know it [2240] sounds simple but the vast majority of [2242] agencies don't do this and that's why [2243] their hiring process sucks and the last [2245] thing is just make sure that they have [2246] an internal locus of control ask them a [2249] very simple question um I don't think we [2251] had that on that specific form but we'll [2253] usually ask something like some guy cuts [2255] you off in traffic what are you thinking [2256] and what do you do such a simple [2258] question but it gives you a ton of [2259] insight into their mindset how they deal [2261] with problems and ultimately how they're [2263] going to work with you and your company [2265] who realistically should be full of high [2267] leverage internal Locust to control [2269] people anyway thanks so much for [2271] watching this video guys hope you had a [2272] blast learning how I do hiring and how I [2274] would do hiring in your shoes if you [2276] have any questions about this process [2277] just feel free to leave a link down [2279] comment down below asking me I also take [2281] most of my requests from my YouTube [2283] comments at this point so if you want me [2284] to do a video on a related topic maybe [2286] something a little different just let me [2287] know and uh we'll take it from there [2289] otherwise like subscribe do all that fun [2291] YouTube stuff and I'll catch youall in [2293] the next video peace

Title: How to Onboard Clients for Your Automation Agency In 41 Minutes (No BS)
[0] hey Nick here and in this video I'm [1] going to show you how to nail onboarding [2] for an automation client let's get into [4] it so first things first this is just my [6] personal process it's not the only way [8] to do onboarding for automation but it's [10] what I did and what I managed to scale [12] to a little over $70,000 a month doing [15] uh take what makes sense to you out of [16] this video and then just throw away [18] whatever is not relevant um and the last [20] thing is there's no gatekeeping I'm [21] actually going to build some of these [22] onboarding automations in front of you [24] I'm going to show you everything that [25] I've done and I'm going to give you just [27] all of my my thoughts behind it so this [29] is going to be a pretty chunky long [30] video but I anticipate that it'll be a [31] lot of value for a lot of people here [33] that are looking to start their [34] automation career okay so first things [36] first the three big problems that [39] onboarding solves there are more than [42] just three problems that onboarding [43] solves but here are the three big ones [44] and here is how I want you to think [46] about onboarding essentially onboarding [48] is a tool that lets you solve the main [50] problem of buyer remorse it lets you [52] solve another main problem of client [54] expectations and it also allows you to [57] essentially like frontload a lot of the [59] BS and inoculate yourself against [61] problems with Logistics later on what do [63] I mean by Logistics I mean stuff like um [66] not having credentials to a software [67] platform I mean stuff like you know not [71] fully outlining the timeline where [73] you're going to be delivering stuff and [74] then the client ends up like calling you [76] rushed two weeks later being like Hey [77] where's the project I needed it by today [79] essentially this is another form of [81] Leverage if you just spend a few minutes [83] upfront dealing with this problem now [85] you will save dozens if not hundreds of [87] hours and hundreds of thousands of [89] dollars over the course of the next [90] couple years of your career so it just [92] makes sense to figure this out like [93] ASAP essentially what I'm going to do [96] here is I'm going to discuss every [97] problem in detail just that you guys [99] understand the problem space um so that [101] you understand sort of like my own [102] mindset here when I came up with these [104] solutions to these problems and then I'm [105] actually going to show you how to solve [106] every one of these problems um as I [108] mentioned including building a few [110] simple systems I'm also going to provide [111] you some templates I have a few little [113] assets and documents here as well as [115] just a couple of step-by-step checklists [116] that I personally used quite heavily [118] when I was first starting out obvious [120] the better that you get on the stuff the [121] less you need these Assets in front of [122] you while you're selling while you're [124] closing or while you're building stuff [125] but they tend to really decrease the [128] learning curve or I guess your ability [129] to get out there close your first couple [131] of clients and and get up and running so [133] highly encourage you guys make use of [134] them all right so problem number one [137] that home buring solves is buyer remorse [139] now if you're unfamiliar with just sales [141] in general um or you know the concept of [144] buyers or Mor here's basically how it [145] works somebody just sent you a bit of [147] money no matter how good the process [150] that you use to sell them is the fact [153] that the money is no longer in their [155] wallet or I guess their bank account [157] nowadays will create buyers remorse [160] there's going to be some sort of remorse [161] some sort of Doubt at the back of their [163] mind essentially like did I make the [165] right decision partnering with the [166] service provider instead of you know [168] other service providers or instead of [169] doing it myself or instead of finding [171] some other solution so if you think [173] about onboarding from sort of like a [175] sales perspective um it's an additional [177] tool that you get to use to to [178] streamline uh the next steps immediately [180] after the sale and your goal running an [183] automation agency is to minimize buyers [184] remorse as soon as humanly possible good [187] onboarding helps you do this great [189] onboarding helps you turn this buyer [191] remorse into like buyer gratitude [193] essentially for being super uh super [195] stoked to start with you and when you [197] have projects that are like that when [198] people are extremely extraordinarily [200] excited to get started with you uh and [201] you also have like very strong and clear [203] expectations put out uh those clients [206] tend to be the ones that retain for a [207] very long time where you start getting [208] to take advantage of the multip of this [210] business right like your first project [212] with a client it's a small one and [213] you're selling Automation Services might [215] be like 1 2 3K let's say if you um nail [218] onboarding and nail everything that I'm [220] going to show you in this guide uh you [222] essentially have the opportunity to turn [223] that 2 or 3K client into like a 5k a [226] month client for the next year and [227] that's 20 times more money if you think [229] about it that way then you'd be able to [230] get immediately so very very big point [232] of Leverage and something that you know [233] I I I wish more people would think about [236] in advance the second big problem is [238] client expectations [240] and this is like one of the biggest [241] issues just in all service businesses [243] not necessarily automation one thing [245] I'll mention here is automation is [246] particularly terrible for it because of [249] the presence of scope creep like um if [251] you think about it right I used to run a [253] Content writing company called one [254] second copy and what's really involved [256] in content writing well there's like two [258] or maybe three subservices here there's [260] the writing there's the editing U maybe [262] there's like the outlining right very [264] simple and easy sort of business model [266] um comparatively whereas with automation [269] if you think about that that way there [270] are like 5 million subservices there's [272] obviously like the scoping there's like [273] the process flow charting there's like [275] the make.com scenario building there's [277] like API Integrations there's like your [279] ability to like drag and drop modules [280] and know how that specific platform [282] works but also understand programming [283] principles to be able to like put [284] something together you have to know like [286] I don't know let's say you're working [287] with a pipe drive you have to understand [289] pipe drive you have to understand padoc [291] you have to understand all this and [293] honestly when you have all of this stuff [295] going on um client expectations uh and [298] their scope can can blow up and that [301] tends to happen pretty often especially [302] if you don't really know what you're [303] doing so if you're just getting start [304] with automation maybe you've got like [306] your first couple of clients you you'll [307] probably understand what I mean by this [308] intuitively but having a good onboarding [310] process can inoculate yourself against a [312] lot of that stuff it's sort of like a [314] vaccine or something against you know [315] some some virus if you just like deal [317] with it right now you eliminate that [319] from ever being an issue you eliminate [321] all of the time energy and money that [322] you waste um later on dealing with it [325] here's the fundamental Paradox of client [327] expectations in order to grow your [329] business business you have to win [331] clients in order to win clients the [334] simplest and easiest way to do so is to [336] increase your expectations so sorry [338] increase the client expectations what I [341] mean by that is sort of the whole [343] process of selling is incentivizing you [346] to blow up this project and make it look [348] even better than it probably really is [350] in reality right that's just how sales [352] works but in order to grow your business [354] you also have to deliver projects and if [357] you think about the way that delivering [358] projects um Works through incentives it [361] all involves reducing expectations [363] turning a complicated project into as [365] simple a project as humanly possible and [368] so essentially what you have here is you [370] have two like incentives that are [371] butting each other right in the head um [374] the first is sort of the sale incentive [375] which is sell them the dream sell them [377] this you know super big complex [379] comprehensive project we can get as much [381] money as humanly possible out of them [382] and then the second is sell them [384] something small something packet [386] something manageable that I can do in [388] you know a weekend [390] the issue here is that most people will [391] always do the former a little too well [393] because they want to get the deal which [395] is totally understandable and I've done [396] this a million in one times myself and [398] what that means is when it comes time to [399] deliver the project they are screwed [402] right because now it's like oh okay um [404] sure we might have made an additional [406] $110,000 or something like that but the [408] cost of that additional $10,000 is now [410] our delivery team has to spend another [412] three weeks creating all these [413] additional systems right it's a paint [415] yes excuse me what oper what onboarding [418] does is it provides you the opportunity [420] to frame those expectations ASAP and [422] upfront and by doing this it lets you [424] inoculate yourself against dozens of [427] common gotches and by gotches I mean [428] just like things that most service [430] providers deal with like uh [432] Communications being an issue timeline [434] being an issue your working style being [436] an issue not knowing what the wind [437] condition of your project is like when [438] do you actually know when your project [439] is done you got to talk about this with [441] the client otherwise what are you going [443] to do do all the work and then deliver [444] the project and the client's going to be [445] like well it's not really done right why [447] not just do it immediately and save [449] yourself that [450] stress basically what your goal is um [452] with client expectations is to give the [454] client all the info that they need up [455] front so they never have to bug you [457] later and so that they'll be satisfied [458] when you deliver what you said that you [459] were going to deliver uh which sounds [461] pretty easy um you know theoretically [463] but in practice it can be a lot more [465] difficult and I'll show you how to solve [466] all [467] that now the last part here is very [469] specific to automation uh and it's sort [472] of like Logistics this is what I call [474] automation is a lot of moving Parts by [476] Nature at its core what automation is is [478] it's like juggling 5,000 different [480] platforms and gluing them all together [481] with an automation platform like [483] make.com or something like that and you [486] know when you're juggling all these [487] different platforms you can imagine how [490] uh in order to like logistically manage [493] the work you need to gain access to all [495] of them you need to deal with two-factor [497] authentication concerns you need to deal [500] with the right subscription plans you [501] need to have good credentials your [503] customer needs to know the credentials [504] you need to go the credentials you need [505] to deal with sub accounts and all that [507] stuff this is sort of like the the the [509] nitty-gritty dirty part of doing [511] automations and if you don't have all of [514] this up front and I meant to write you [516] uh you end up having like a much more [517] difficult time later because then you [518] have to drip this stuff out over time [520] every time you ask a client for some [521] information it'll take them some time to [523] get back to you sort of like this cat [525] and mouse stuff that a lot of beginners [526] unfortunately fall prey to especially [527] with tofa stuff because you need to like [529] be in the same time zone as your client [531] or whatever at like the same time and [532] they need to be available and all that [534]  and it ends up just like really [536] hurting your professionalism and not [537] only does it hurt your professionalism [538] it very negatively impacts your ability [540] to deliver on the schedule that you said [541] that you were going to do so your goal [544] in solving this problem is to minimize [546] friction and get access to everything [548] ASAP you should not need to ask the [550] client for any sort of credentials [552] accounts two Factor auth authentication [554] codes change the subscription plan none [556] of that stuff um after the first day [558] basically just because it really really [560] hurts your ability to get that client [562] again in the future and if you solve all [564] this upfront the client will think that [566] you're super prepared you're super [567] professional and that like you know you [568] know your your business really well uh [570] which will obviously allow you to retain [571] them super easily later [573] on all right so how do you actually [575] solve these three problems well each of [576] these three problems um I solved in [578] three ways so the first buyers remorse I [581] solve byas by basically front loading [583] the dopamine and front loading um [585] notifications front loading gratitude [587] and basically just filling up their [589] email inbox as quickly as possible after [590] they make the payment um so that they [592] think that essentially the perception of [593] process sorry perception of progress and [596] I'll show you how to do each of these [597] three in a moment and I'll build out [598] systems for them as [600] well the second to to manage client [602] expectations um there are three [604] solutions here the first is that you [605] need to Define your communication style [607] as well as the frequency with which you [608] will be communicating UPF front the [610] second is you need to set a timeline [611] which is basically how long every step [613] will take and what sort of deliverable [614] you have at every step and the third is [616] you need to define the wind condition [617] the wind condition you know sounds super [619] fancy but it's basically just like hey [621] how are we going to know when our [621] project is done right like if I'm [623] delivering you a lead generation system [625] how do I actually know that that lead [626] generation system is finished and I can [628] like take a step back [629] um when do we start on my retainer for [631] instance like like what's the next step [633] after the project is [634] done the problem number three which is [636] the logistics and the moving parts and [638] all that stuff you solve them in three [639] ways the first is you itemize all the [641] platforms and you basically provide them [642] a list that they can use in order to [644] sign up to them for you uh the second is [646] that you have an onboarding call that [648] just front loads all of the [649] that you otherwise would have to drip [650] out over time and you know tons of [652] people have tried to do the the [654] logistics step uh through forms and [656] whatnot they're like oh well I got to [657] automate this because I'm an automation [658] engineer but you really shouldn't this [660] is like the highest leverage point of [661] you being in front of your client and [663] then um you can use secure credential [665] management essentially to to solve the [667] problem of password sharing and and all [668] that fun stuff so yeah we're going to go [671] into detail and build all of them uh [672] right now so first and formost let's [675] talk a little bit about um the first [677] solution here which is transactional [678] alerts this is going to sound really [680] simple and really basic for a lot of [681] people but if you pay somebody and you [684] pay somebody a fair amount of money [685] let's say $4,000 or something like that [687] and you don't receive like a receipt of [689] that purchase um basically immediately [692] you're going to have a very very bad [693] taste in your mouth and that buyer's [694] remorse is going to sort of snowball [696] into uh like who the hell am I working [698] with here is this person professional [699] like like what's going on basically [702] there needs to be some type of [703] transactional alert or notification [705] immediately after the person pays you [706] all this money and they just need to [708] have like a receipt for it so um this [711] depends on your payment processor a lot [712] of payment processors do this [713] automatically thankfully in stripe uh [715] which is the payment processor that I [716] personally use and that I recommend for [717] a lot of people uh you need to [719] specifically go into customer emails [720] enable receipts um and then you know [723] have those receipts sent basically [724] immediately after the the purchase is [725] done so what you would do um here if you [728] doing this for yourself is you'd have to [730] open up the stripe homepage and then go [731] to settings up here in the top right and [734] then go to business and then you'd have [736] to go more uh customer emails I believe [739] and then under payments you'll have to [741] go successful payments and turn that on [743] and essentially what this is going to do [745] is uh every time that somebody sends you [747] or sorry every time you send somebody [748] money [750] you're going to get something that looks [752] a little bit like this right over here [754] um so every time sorry you send somebody [756] money you get a receipt um and obviously [758] make sure that the experience that they [759] have when they get a receipt from you is [761] as high brow as possible make sure that [763] you've done all like the strip BS of [764] like adding your logo and making it look [766] all pretty having your brand colors [767] whatever your payment processor is [768] obviously this will differ uh but I [770] personally always recommend um anybody [771] in my community or anybody watching my [773] videos just to like use strip it's super [775] simple it's very well supported and it's [776] super integratable which is an [777] automation specialist makes a lot ofense [779] sense so you're going to want something [781] like this um basically to happen within [783] 30 seconds of somebody working with you [785] or choosing to work with you or paying [786] you money and this is just sort of like [787] a quick little hit it's like yeah you [789] did make that payment um and you know [791] all of the logistical stuff is like [792] taken care of on our end don't worry [793] your receipts here uh we're we're [795] professional about it I know it sounds [797] super simple but you'd be surprised at [798] how many people don't do this all right [800] the next thing I want to talk about is [802] gratitude what do I mean by gratitude [804] well I mean expressing sincere gratitude [808] to your client cents for choosing to [811] spend time energy and money with you I [814] know this sounds simple again but turns [816] out that most things in the agency space [818] are very simple you can go very far [820] simply by remembering to thank your [822] client for doing things for you what do [825] I mean by this uh every time a client [827] sends me a message I uh I thank them for [829] reaching out every time they follow up [831] with me after I haven't heard from them [832] for a while I thank them for doing so [834] every time I jump on a call with them I [836] thank them every time I get a payment [837] from them I thank them this makes you [839] look extremely professional but not only [841] that I've worked with enough clients at [843] this point in my life to definitively be [844] able to say that the situations in which [846] I've consistently Express gratitude for [848] being able to work with somebody um tend [850] to yield me substantially higher rois [853] like our relationships go way way [855] further and I'm still not 100% sure if [857] it's just the professionalism or if it's [859] just the fact that you know I I'm just [861] like I'm I'm acting like a human being [862] when I do it and people tend to pick up [864] on that and they think that I'm a lot [865] more genuine but it works now the great [867] news about gratitude is if you are truly [870] gracious so you can build a very simple [871] system that just watches events or uses [873] a web hook and when you receive a new [876] payment transaction notification uh you [878] can just send an email uh that's like [880] you know like a one sort of I don't know [883] three or four line email which I'll show [884] you in a second uh that just thanks them [886] and you can do it within about five or [887] five or so minutes of receiving the [889] payment and by doing it this way um it [891] tends to be it tends to seem a lot more [893] like handwritten and customized and that [895] sort of deal uh which obviously C [897] customers or clients tend to like a lot [898] more more and that tends to seem just a [900] lot uh you know a lot more genuine so [903] again the goal is basically and I do [905] this in separate email but the goal is [907] we want to provide people the perception [909] of like customized highquality care and [911] I actually send them a bespoke email [914] with a thank you on it in addition to [916] the receipt and here's what my personal [918] one usually looks like I mean you know [919] it's evolved over time and I used to do [921] all the stuff manually but um you know [923] now I now I automate the vast majority [925] of it it's just high neck thanks for [926] taking care of that invoice so promptly [927] I'm beyond happy that we get the chance [928] to work together and excited to nail [929] this for you I'll send you some [931] onboarding instructions plus a calendar [932] in a moment and we can then book a call [934] to kick off our project looking forward [936] to chatting and I appreciate your [937] business so that's it doesn't have to be [940] super magical you're literally texting [942] or you're sending somebody an email as [943] if you would text them thanking them for [945] doing something for you and on a more [947] General note I find that that's just the [949] best way to proceed with all client [950] Communications just proceed with them [952] like you're texting a friend of yours [953] because um clients tend to pick up on [955] that and treat that as substantially [956] more genuine than what a lot of other [957] people do which is they write these big [959] fancy long email sequences that just [961] seem like uh just seem like you are [964] treating them like another Cog in in in [966] your machine if that makes sense but [968] yeah so my goal is I want them to get a [970] bunch of emails simultaneously to [971] minimize buyer remorse to just make it [973] feel like shit's happening like they [974] just gave me their money I want to give [976] them something too and the number one [977] thing that you can give a client is just [978] the impression of of progress and things [981] are moving in the direction that they [982] want them to and then the last thing is [985] indeed that perception of progress and [986] what do I mean by this I really just [987] mean like next steps um now that they [990] paid it's essential that you provide the [991] perception that you are getting their [993] project started like immediately like [995] within 5 minutes of them getting paid if [997] you do this the clients that you provide [999] the impression of progress within five [1000] minutes are going to go much much [1002] farther for you than the clients that [1004] you don't do this for I don't know like [1006] several hours or days as mentioned [1008] previously tons of situations where I've [1010] hired a service provider and I haven't [1011] heard back from them for like 48 Hours [1013] frankly if I'm being honest I think that [1015] sort of thing is unacceptable especially [1017] given that like basically everybody on [1018] planet Earth has hired a service [1019] provider for something at some point and [1021] so they at least understand how it feels [1022] from the other point of view the fact [1024] that you know a lot of these business [1025] owners can't put that together I think [1027] it's the primary reason why you can [1029] crush it in this industry so easily so [1032] yeah um again we can build a very simple [1034] system and we can have the system just [1035] watch events or use a web hook and then [1036] send an email from you I'll do that [1038] right now in a second um and then I [1040] would encourage it you do this within [1041] five minutes at this point they've [1043] received three or four emails in a very [1044] short period of time and which makes [1046] them feel really good it also makes them [1047] feel like you're on top of things you [1049] have a very defined streamline process [1051] for this and they've done this multiple [1052] times before which eliminates a lot of [1054] like the perceived risk of working with [1055] service providers and is basically the [1057] most straight line way of maximizing the [1059] uh the customer experience but okay how [1061] do you actually build this out super [1062] simple and super easy um I personally do [1064] this in make.com an automation tool that [1066] uh I'm quite uh I mean I popularize a [1069] little bit but I'm definitely famous for [1070] like the make.com stuff not the zapier [1072] stuff or the na10 stuff if you are using [1074] another automation tool it's very simple [1076] just follow along sort of the process [1077] logic that I'm doing here we're going to [1079] pretend that there is some event that is [1082] occurring U maybe some type of [1084] booking and then uh what do we do when [1086] we uh receive that booking well if you [1088] have a CRM or something like that you're [1089] going to have to pull data from the CRM [1091] what I'm going to do is I'm just going [1093] to set a bunch of [1094] variables and I'm basically going to [1096] pretend that I'm pulling them from my [1097] CRM so one will be like name we'll just [1099] say [1101] Nick we'll say email address we'll say [1105] my email address right over here Nick a [1106] left click. and then we just use the [1109] mail module here to send an [1114] email you will create a connection up at [1116] the top right hand corner uh in make.com [1118] and you'll use that to sort of um this [1120] will be your from email and then the to [1122] email I'm just going to map this as the [1124] email address the subject line I'm just [1126] going to use thank you and welcome [1128] aboard and I'm going to do it in HTML [1130] but you don't necessarily have to you [1132] could do this in a plain text if you [1133] wanted [1135] to the way that you do it in HTML is [1137] HTML uses um some tags uh specifically [1140] this one tag called BR and so basically [1143] every time you do a br it's a new line [1145] so I'm doing two BRS between every um [1147] piece of text here so that there's two [1148] new lines between [1150] them and then between this one I'll do [1153] one so when you know somebody receives [1155] this email well we can actually test [1157] this right [1158] now when I run this module and then I [1161] type in the email address and I think [1163] this is going to work I mean I am sing [1165] this to myself so maybe there'll be an [1166] issue of some kind [1168] oh sorry I need to reauthorize my [1170] connection just give me one [1172] second we'll just add a new one call it [1175] Google and we'll go Nick at left click. [1177] a we'll go July 19th 2024 this is what [1179] you have to do if you've never set it up [1180] before it'll um open another window that [1183] allows you to select your Gmail [1187] account and once you connect to the [1190] two it'll verify once it's verified this [1193] little button will go purple then you [1195] can go ahead and send it and I think you [1197] can send it to yourself not entirely [1199] sure yeah you can okay great um and you [1201] know at this point I've just automated [1203] this this email um the benefit here is [1205] you know the way that I've written this [1206] copies just seems very incidental and it [1208] seems very like hey how's it going I [1209] totally just wrote this myself which is [1211] great um you can imagine how you could [1212] do the exact same thing for our other [1214] piece of [1216] copy and uh what else you could do is [1219] you could add a little bit of a sleep [1223] module and you can say that I don't I [1226] want to delay let's say 200 and 40 [1229] seconds so I want to delay 4 minutes [1231] basically and this is going to be wait [1233] four minutes I'm going to call this grab [1236] data from CRM right if you're using [1238] clickup or Monday or pipe drive or [1240] whatever you would just use like the [1241] retrieve record uh module here and then [1244] what we want to do is we need to use a [1246] router uh because we just want to send [1248] this to two [1250] places so this is going to be route [1251] number one and this is going to be route [1253] number two this is going to be send [1255] thank you email and then this one's [1258] going to be send onboarding [1262] email and then all I'm going to do is [1265] I'll go over to next steps and then I'm [1267] just going to change um the email copy [1269] so that instead of what I had before now [1272] I have this and because I'm going to be [1274] doing two BRS in a row I'm just going to [1276] copy paste copy paste copy paste [1280] copy paste and then uh because it's HTML [1283] if you want to embed a link you need to [1285] use this format this a tag with an [1287] ending a tag [1289] and this needs to go to where you want [1290] it to go I'm just going to pretend this [1291] going to this calendar right over here [1292] which is my like Discovery sales call [1294] calendar um and the last thing is I'm [1296] just going to write an email here call [1299] it next [1300] steps um make sure that you know the [1303] connection is correct and everything [1305] this looks good to me let me just make [1306] this a little sexier and then what I'm [1308] also going to do is I'm going to add one [1310] more sleep [1311] here so that when I do ultimately send [1314] the email um there's some like offset [1316] between the first one up here and then [1318] the second one over here make will run [1319] these um one after another so it'll [1321] start up here and then it'll go down [1322] here afterwards so let's say it'll take [1324] me another 3 minutes or so to to write [1326] the email or something hypothetically [1328] and now what'll happen is um we'll grab [1330] the data from the CRM when the new event [1331] comes in we'll wait four minutes we'll [1332] then send the first email and then we'll [1334] go into the second route wait another uh [1336] what's this three minutes and send the [1339] second email now just for testing [1340] purposes I'm just going to turn the [1341] delay here to one because I don't [1343] actually want to wait that long and then [1345] uh I'm going to pretend that there's no [1347] event here and I'm just initiating the [1348] flow from this but we'll just call this [1350] onboarding [1353] emails I'm just going to give this thing [1355] a little run we're going to send that [1357] first email going to wait three minutes [1358] send the other email if we go back [1361] you'll see that essentially we've [1362] replicated the same event or the same [1364] idea that we had previously where uh [1366] they'll get a receipt um you know with a [1368] stripe transaction and then they'll get [1369] a thank you and welcome aboard and [1371] they'll get a next steps email uh which [1373] is very very simple as you can see this [1375] is really one of those automations that [1376] I should you not it takes you like less [1378] than 5 minutes to set up and then it's [1379] one of those automations that if you [1381] spend that five minutes to set it up [1383] this will make you thousands of dollars [1385] tens of thousands of dollars over the [1386] course of the next 12 months simply for [1388] having the foresight to put that [1389] infrastructure in place obviously you're [1391] going to have to connect the beginning [1393] part here with this web hook to your [1394] payment processor so that's something [1395] that I'm leaving out because I don't [1396] know what payment processor you're using [1398] if you're using um [1400] stripe here you would go to the stripe [1403] module go to the watch events module and [1405] then you have to configure it to watch [1406] payment intent events essentially what [1408] ever the payment uh is that you're that [1410] you're getting if you're using something [1412] like I don't know QuickBooks [1414] hypothetically um you could watch a new [1416] event you know anytime an invoice is [1418] sent or received you could you know have [1420] that run a variety of different ways to [1422] do it but what I'm going to do is I'm [1424] going to export this blueprint and I'm [1425] just going to um use this in my [1428] materials as sort of like a sort of like [1430] sales materials um sorry sort of like as [1433] a as a lead magnet and then I'm going to [1435] put this inside of the YouTube video so [1437] that you guys can just you know copy and [1438] paste this if you need [1440] to all right so that's for that's it for [1443] gratitude and perception of progress um [1444] at this point as I mentioned they've [1446] received through for emails very quickly [1447] and it's just super straightforward and [1448] easy for them to get started um which is [1451] nice the second major problem as I [1453] mentioned before is client expectations [1455] now client expectations unfortunately in [1457] the automation world are very very [1459] difficult to get right and and I mean if [1460] you haven't done a lot of projects [1462] before you will basically always screw [1463] this up the simplest way to make some [1466] serious progress you know on this [1468] problem is just to spend like 2 minutes [1470] thinking about how much you want to [1473] communicate and how you want to be [1475] communicated with in a client [1477] relationship most agencies and service [1479] providers will never even spend like two [1481] minutes just thinking about this and [1482] it's why you know they're very um they [1485] they they tend to struggle with scaling [1486] their businesses and doing good things [1488] but as I mentioned here it's the [1489] simplest lever you could pull to [1490] eliminate 90% plus of problems all [1493] you're doing is you're telling the [1494] client hey this is how often I'm going [1495] to communicate with you this is where [1497] I'm going to communicate with you [1499] for instance hey I'll be available 12: [1501] until 2 p 2m PT on slack every day if [1504] you have any questions and you're going [1505] to get progress updates on Tuesdays and [1506] Fridays EOD hey I'm going to send you an [1509] email at the end of the day every day [1510] Monday to Friday just going to summarize [1511] where we're at if I have any blockers if [1513] I need your help on something or [1514] whatever we'll deal with it then and the [1516] goal here is just to ensure we [1517] consistently make progress towards your [1518] delivery there are dozens of more uh [1521] dozens more examples that you could pick [1522] from I'm just choosing a couple of [1524] random ones uh that you can use as [1527] inspiration whether you're slack whether [1528] they prefer email how some of them might [1530] even prefer a call uh and it's really up [1532] to you to determine whether or not [1533] that's something that you're willing to [1535] do so I acknowledge here that there is [1538] an optimal communication style and [1539] probably an optimal communication [1541] frequency um but you can probably [1543] deliver more than 90% of the results [1545] here by literally just telling them how [1546] often you're going to communicate with [1547] them and then just sticking with it so [1549] maybe you communicate with them once a [1550] month or something I don't know if you [1552] just tell them you're going to [1553] communicate them once a month and then [1554] you give them that expectation and then [1556] you hold to your expectation um you're [1558] going to do much better than somebody [1559] that communicates with somebody 30 times [1561] a month but they never really tell them [1562] when and why they're doing it my own [1565] personal sop for this um in the past I [1567] did once per week and I thought once per [1569] week was good because it would you know [1570] allow me to be very autonomous and I [1571] wouldn't have to communicate with them [1572] often and I don't really like jumping on [1574] all these silly calls just to give [1575] progress updates and that sort of deal [1577] but I did occasionally run into a few [1579] issues and the specific issues where [1581] clients felt like I wasn't keeping them [1582] in the loop they tended to wonder when [1584] things were going to be delivered um [1586] even though I told them before and [1588] essentially they just sort of forgot [1590] about me and uh it led to a couple of [1592] client blowups from every now and then [1595] it was nothing major but you know if [1596] we're trying to be as efficient as [1598] performant as possible obviously that's [1599] something that I could have changed [1600] right so now what I'm doing is two times [1602] per week and I give them a defined slack [1604] availability where they can expect me to [1606] respond to them within 10 or 15 minutes [1608] um and that tends to be you know about [1609] an hour or two hour slot what I do is I [1611] just batch all of my clients for that [1612] hour or two hour slot and then I just [1614] know okay like I got to be by the [1615] computer for you know 2 hours 12: to 2 [1617] p.m. PT for instance [1619] in practice clients will rarely ask me [1620] questions um and usually what I do is I [1622] just work on other during that time [1624] anyway and I'm just like buy my computer [1626] so that adds a ton of value this Define [1627] slack availability although obviously [1629] you know you have to make sure that your [1630] client is the type of client that wants [1631] to work on slack a lot of clients don't [1632] like slack a lot of clients use teams [1634] instead or they use email or whatever so [1636] just make sure whatever your offer is is [1637] sustainable essentially okay problem [1640] number two um that you can easily [1643] eliminate is kind of the stress at how [1645] the project is proceeding and when the [1647] project will be completed [1648] and the simplest and easiest way to do [1650] this is to spend another 2 minutes up [1651] front just setting the [1653] timeline as most of us probably [1655] unfortunately know the vast majority of [1657] projects that any service provider will [1659] ever do for any client uh will be behind [1661] schedule their project timelines are [1663] almost always optimistic and as a result [1666] uh there's always some things that they [1667] didn't really account for that uh crop [1669] up during the project they end up being [1671] late for simpler automation projects [1673] especially some of the ones like what I [1675] was just showing you back here I mean [1676] this is like what not even 10 mod mod [1678] here it took me 5 minutes um it's [1681] absolutely ridiculous that you would be [1683] behind schedule for something like that [1685] like that is something that you should [1686] be able to do in a few minutes you [1688] probably shouldn't do it in a few [1689] minutes because you do want the client [1690] to feel as if there was some work that [1691] goes into it of course we need some [1693] social you know we need some Nuance here [1695] U but it's not something that you know [1697] you should set a timeline for three [1698] weeks for and then deliver in five right [1700] you can realistically do most of the [1702] work that you're going to be demanded in [1703] a few hours if you're smart about it and [1704] if you work with software platforms that [1706] you know and if you take advantage of [1707] templates like I've talk talked about in [1708] previous videos so one of the simplest [1711] ways to retain your automation clients [1712] and to basically multiply your revenue [1714] is to set a reasonably generous schedule [1716] not super generous but reasonably [1717] generous and then just exceed the [1718] Expectations by delivering ahead of it [1721] so for instance if you wanted to set up [1722] some big email system let's say we had [1723] like 10 of these scenarios or something [1725] hypothetically uh 10times 5 minutes [1727] takes me about an hour to do I'd [1729] probably set like a three to five day [1730] turnaround time for that and then I [1732] deliver it by like the second day or [1733] something and I'd say hey how's it going [1735] you know had a lot of additional time I [1736] wanted to make sure that we could deal [1738] that I could handle this and give it to [1739] you ahead of schedule to see if there's [1741] any more work that you needed or [1742] something like that very very simple [1744] thing to do uh but you'd be surprised at [1745] how much money that it leaves on the [1747] table when you don't do it okay another [1750] thing is this doesn't have to be [1751] complicated I give a quick example here [1752] of some AI scenario where you're doing [1755] some prompt engineering um July 19th to [1757] 22nd I'm doing prompt engineering July [1758] 23rd to 26 I'm doing the make.com [1760] scenarios July 27 to 3D I'm doing [1762] testing and delivery and then when you [1764] deliver your final project on July 27th [1766] as opposed to 30th the client will be [1767] really impressed right I give you a [1769] quick example of just some little [1770] Snippets that you can write to them um [1772] in order to to drop [1774] that the last thing that you could solve [1777] very easily with onboarding uh is the [1780] wind condition and what I mean by wi [1782] condition is I mean the set of [1785] conditions that a client needs to see [1788] before they consider the project [1789] completed and [1791] done so a lot of the time we'll never [1794] just have that conversation and if you [1795] think about it it's a very logical [1796] conversation hey when am I going to be [1799] done like what sorts of boxes do I need [1801] to check before our project is [1803] over the problem with not doing this is [1805] a lot of the time the client's internal [1807] win conditions will be different from [1808] your win conditions and so you will [1810] deliver a project that you think is done [1811] and that you know delivers the win [1813] condition and they'll be like huh I [1814] wonder why I didn't deliver X Y and Z [1816] hey man when are you going to do x y and [1817] z now you're doing more work than you [1819] were initially banking on the client is [1820] unhappy and this is just a sort of way [1822] that you know um um projects lead to [1825] unfortunately so a quick example of this [1827] is you know a lot of the guys in my [1829] community right now are starting to sell [1830] lead generation projects because I've [1831] shown um you know I've provide an ample [1833] amount of material showing people how to [1834] sell lead generation projects and it's [1835] quite an easy and producti offer but if [1838] you are selling a lead generation [1840] project what is what are you actually [1842] giving to the client like what are they [1843] actually getting at the end of it [1845] they're not just getting leads right [1847] your deliverable is a lot more specific [1849] than leads your deliverable is [1851] hypothetically on July 30th you will [1854] have a completed air table that [1855] automatically populates with new [1857] positive responses from your smart lead [1859] campaign your campaign will operate [1860] Monday to Friday from 7:00 to 7: using [1862] our best-in-class copyrighting formula [1864] and you'll also get slack notifications [1866] every time a new one comes in to [1867] minimize the response time you'll get an [1869] sop sheet that you can use yourself or [1871] to hire an Outreach manager to do the [1872] response management for you and I'm also [1874] going to give you a video walking you [1875] through the system from start to finish [1877] okay that is a perfect example of a win [1880] condition if you check all of those [1881] boxes the project is completed if you [1883] leave some of those boxes unchecked your [1885] end of the bargain is still not [1886] completed [1888] just have that conversation with the [1889] client ahead of time and if you do the [1892] vast majority of the problems that most [1893] other service providers have like with [1895] repeat revisions over and over and over [1896] again or with client scope creep going [1899] out of control they're not going to be a [1901] problem for you and all of the other [1902] people that are in your industry are [1903] going to be looking at you being like [1904] how the hell does that guy deal with [1906] this this super unscop difficult [1907] projects I have no idea what sort of [1910] magic witchcraft he's doing um because [1913] you know I get a lot of people asking me [1914] that okay so that is the second problem [1917] which is client expectations right first [1919] problem was um buyer remorse second [1922] problem is client expectations the third [1923] problem is uh the logistics and [1925] basically how do we deal with all the 5 [1927] million moving parts that automation [1929] contains well there are three very [1932] simple ways to do so the first is by [1935] prepping for so what I always do is I [1937] always do an onboarding call and I [1938] realized now I probably should have had [1940] this before this but uh anyway I [1943] normally do an onboarding call and you [1945] know that's why the person books uh an [1947] event in the calendar link that I sent [1948] over right and on that onboarding call I [1950] will have them sign up to all the [1951] platforms that I need them to sign up [1953] for in order to do the job and make sure [1955] that it's all done and the simplest way [1957] to streamline that onboarding call is [1959] simply to itemize all of the platforms [1961] that they're going to need access to in [1962] advance and then build them a list of [1964] very simple instructions they can follow [1966] on that onboarding call in order to sign [1967] up for all those platforms that they [1969] need you can send this in the above [1971] email um like if you wanted to create a [1972] PDF and like you know attach something [1974] you could do that but either way you [1976] just need to know what they they need to [1977] know what they need to do in order to [1979] make your onboarding call success it's [1981] sort of like the win condition of the [1982] onboarding call right a quick example of [1984] what I mean by itemized platforms is [1986] literally just let's say they need to [1987] sign up for make.com it's super simple [1989] this might take you like 15 minutes to [1990] put together for all platforms you just [1992] give them instructions on how to get [1994] going hey head to this thing sign up [1996] with this for hosting region select us [1998] click register right a bcde e FG the [2001] fact that you have all this preferred [2003] will make a very big impression on the [2004] clients and they'll tend to think that [2005] you know you've done this again tons of [2007] times before and you know you're very on [2008] top of your it'll also just make it [2009] very easy for them and um make the [2011] onboarding call a lot less uh basically [2013] you're going to mitigate a lot of [2014] friction on onboarding [2016] calls there's also some situations where [2019] the client has signed up to a platform [2020] on their own using ooth or similar um [2023] meaning they'll have two-factor [2024] authentication and if you guys have [2025] built any automation projects up until [2027] now you'll know two-factor [2027] authentication is like the bane of an [2030] automation engineer's existence it's [2031] freaking terrible uh because you know in [2033] order to bypass it you need to the [2035] client needs to get a text message and [2036] they need to send you the response and [2038] then you need to plug that response in [2040] within a certain amount of time if they [2042] don't do it within a certain amount of [2043] time the code is wrong so it resends it [2045] and it's just very difficult to [2046] coordinate you know when that occurs [2048] some platforms also require you to do [2050] this multiple times which can be massive [2051] pain in the ass and uh generally [2053] speaking you know that's really where [2055] like a lot of the value in an onboarding [2056] call comes from because you just get to [2057] sidestep all like the logistical [2059]  that typically plagues most [2061] automation specialist the other Edge [2064] case here on onboarding calls is clients [2065] don't understand the underlying [2067] Technologies and they struggle with [2068] things like giving you access with the [2069] username and password giving you [2071] credentials that sort of thing so um you [2074] know having an onboarding call where you [2075] are just physically present and you [2077] screen share with them essentially uh [2079] solves so much of this because now you [2080] can just like guide them through hey you [2082] don't remember your password for that [2083] well let's see here do you mind sharing [2085] your screen okay great why don't you [2086] click on this button and then click on [2087] that button and then go there right or [2089] if it's two Factor authentication H okay [2091] you just got a text message all right [2092] that makes sense yeah sure what's the [2093] code and then you just deal with it [2095] right then and there this usually takes [2096] about 15 minutes and the benefit to this [2099] that not a lot of people talk about is [2100] it lets them feel in control of their [2101] data and their security like a lot of [2103] automation Specialists um will just sign [2105] up to all the platforms for them that's [2106] is what I used to do uh because it just [2108] you know moved me a lot faster if I'm [2109] honest but by doing this I've noticed [2111] the clients just tend to respect our [2112] relationship a lot more they tend to [2114] realize and understand the value that [2116] I'm providing because to a lot of them [2117] like all this Tech stuff is super [2119] intimidating right and then it also [2120] makes them feel a little bit more secure [2122] which is nice they're not like sending [2123] their credentials and plain text over [2125] email or something um they're doing it [2127] you know directly through um through [2129] through like a call and I'm there to see [2130] it uh which is quite nice and you know [2133] again it's not necessarily the most [2134] secure thing is just we're providing the [2136] impression of security which to the [2137] client is the thing that matters the [2138] most by the end of the onboarding call [2140] you'll have everything that you need in [2142] order to finish the project and the [2143] client is also going to be really [2144] excited to kick off but the big question [2146] is obviously Nick what the hell is the [2148] onboarding call and don't worry I put [2150] together a lovely template for you that [2151] I used I used to use in basically every [2153] onboarding call now I don't actually [2155] really use this template anymore just [2157] because of like memorized all these [2158] steps um and I sort of have fun with it [2160] um as needed but let me just jump over [2162] here this is what the template looks [2164] like it's very simple and very straight [2165] forward as you can tell literally just [2167] hey thank you very much for joining so [2169] we're you know giving them some [2170] gratitude and then I just um explained [2172] to them the schedule of the call and [2173] like what I'm going to be doing and why [2175] I'm doing it so um I'll always just say [2177] hey so thanks so much for jumping on the [2179] call uh you know the biggest issue in [2180] this space and I work with dozens of [2182] people hundreds of people on projects at [2183] this point is logistics um if you've [2185] ever had a project on automation you'll [2188] know that two Factor authentication is a [2189] massive pain in the ass passwords are a [2191] massive pain in the ass all of this [2193] stuff ends up being a massive Nightmare [2195] and can really prevent projects from [2196] moving forward so I just sidestep all [2198] that by frontloading the onboarding call [2200] and uh it's just the most effective and [2201] simplest way I found of doing this so [2203] that makes sense everybody's like yeah [2204] of course and then you know I outline [2206] the call by giving them my road map what [2208] are we going to do in the next 20 [2209] minutes well first we're going to cover [2210] timelines I'm going to show you or uh [2212] we're going to talk about how best to [2213] stay in touch with each other what you [2215] can expect basically at every part of [2217] the project [2218] and that sort of deal then we're going [2219] to sign up to all the platforms listed [2221] I've already prepared a bunch of [2222] detailed instructions which I just sent [2223] you in the chat um this will enable you [2226] to literally just go from top to bottom [2227] sign up to all these platforms and then [2229] I'll have access before the end of the [2230] call and then if any of these platforms [2233] require two Factor authentication I'll [2234] be able to like request a code [2235] immediately right in front of you you'll [2236] get it on your phone and you can just [2237] tell me what the code is that way I [2239] don't need to like I don't know borrow [2241] you for 15 minutes randomly at 800m on a [2244] Tuesday right we can just streamline all [2245] of that right now um the last thing [2248] we'll do is we'll just have a little Q&A [2249] period And if you have any questions [2250] that you've been wondering about um [2252] before we actually start the project I [2253] can just answer them then does that make [2255] sense great all right let's get started [2257] and you just proceed from top to bottom [2259] it's a very simple process of course and [2261] there are better onboarding procedures [2263] out there to be sure but this is one [2264] that I've used and it's one that worked [2266] for [2267] me from there all you have to do is [2269] actually go out there and do the [2270] freaking project which is obviously the [2273] more complicated part but the good news [2275] is you have everything that you need in [2277] order to thrive um at this point you [2279] have every platform access piece of [2281] credential two-factor authentication you [2283] have all that stuff taken care of the [2284] client also understands the timeline [2286] they have Great Expectations in place [2288] for when you're going to be [2288] communicating with and you've [2290] essentially inoculated yourself against [2291] the major issues in providing Services [2294] right on the good onboarding process uh [2296] makes for a good project and ever since [2299] I started implementing like a consistent [2301] onboarding I found that the value of my [2304] projects and like the I guess uh reten [2307] rate on the clients that I get [2309] especially initially because I usually [2311] do like a small onetime project to start [2312] and I do like a repeated um retainer [2314] afterwards is like five or 10 times [2316] higher it's [2318] stupid last thing I'm going to say to [2319] this before I jump off here is that you [2321] can do this with yourself or with a [2323] small team you don't have to do this [2325] with like a big giant like you don't [2327] need a giant team in order to do [2328] onboarding right one uh unfortunate [2330] thing that I've seen a couple of [2331] companies do is for whatever reason like [2334] I was actually just working at a company [2335] that did this like two months ago they a [2337] team of uh maybe six or seven people and [2339] every time they onboard a new client [2341] they got all of their people on the call [2342] to like say hey hello how's it going [2344] thank you very much for signing up and I [2345] kind of get the idea of this but uh it [2347] was it was massive Overkill you don't [2348] need to do this at all as you saw [2350] earlier you can do the automations in [2352] less than five minutes and that's [2353] including the receipts um all you have [2355] to do is you know you can use some of my [2356] copy borrow it if you want or you can [2358] just come up with your own um all you [2360] need to do is just think for another 15 [2362] minutes about how best to Define your wi [2364] conditions how best to set a timeline [2365] and how best to Define your coms and [2367] frequency [2367] that's something that all of us here can [2369] uh can do within a few minutes which is [2370] quite nice and then uh you know you just [2372] follow a simple onboarding call sop do [2374] it a couple times and you'll know like [2376] the back of your hand by the third or [2377] fourth so it's very very simple and very [2380] straightforward and automation is the [2382] leverage here um you know this isn't [2384] something that requires really more than [2385] just a few maybe an hour of thought Max [2389] as I mentioned a couple times throughout [2391] the call onboarding just provides a lift [2392] to everything else your attention your [2394] relationship the ticket sizes that you [2395] can charge and that sort of thing um [2397] and the number one thing that it's [2399] actually done for me that I did not [2400] include here is it's really improved my [2401] reputation this is a much smaller market [2404] and a smaller world than most people [2405] think I mean technically you know if [2407] you're in automation you can work with [2408] anybody because you're just improving [2409] their margins and you're improving their [2411] Topline and increasing the efficiency of [2413] their processes and that sort of thing [2414] but I find in practice my name gets [2416] around quite a lot more and it has been [2417] not just because of this YouTube channel [2419] um but because of just the way that I [2420] work with clients so if you're looking [2422] for a type of business where you know [2424] you have like very high referral rate [2426] you know for every one client you uh 10 [2428] clients you get they refer you to an [2429] average of five or something like that [2431] the best way to do it is with a very [2432] strong onboarding process um and just [2435] setting yourself up for Success if you [2437] guys want something more Hands-On uh [2439] just check the bio I have a community [2440] and also have a website where I'm going [2441] to be starting to uh provide resources [2444] uh at cost to people that want to shave [2447] several hours off of the process of [2449] building like a CRM for a specific [2450] industry or doing a specific template or [2453] getting a cold email system up and [2454] running that sort of deal otherwise I [2456] sincerely wish you the best best of luck [2457] and I hope that everything that I've [2458] talked about in this video made sense [2460] again this is just one way that you can [2462] do it but I hope that I provided you [2464] guys the knowledge so that it's not that [2467] I'm just like talking at you and telling [2469] you to do it this way it's that you guys [2471] understand why this is being done that's [2473] the sort of thing that will give you [2474] guys autonomy and agency over being able [2476] to create this process for yourself and [2477] maybe even improving on my process too [2480] if you guys have any questions feel free [2481] to drop them down below as comments [2482] otherwise please like subscribe do all [2484] that fun YouTube stuff I'll catch youall [2485] in the next video thanks so much

Title: How I Hit 18K Subs On YouTube (+ Finance Breakdown)
[0] hey my name is Nick I'll show you how I [1] got to 18,000 YouTube subscribers on [3] this video as well as how much money [4] it's made me um how my day-to-day [6] lifestyle has changed and I'll give you [7] a whole road map and behind the scenes [9] look at what you need to do if you want [10] to get there too so first and foremost [13] uh the word need is a little strong this [15] is just my own personal process that's [16] how I got to 18K Subs you don't actually [18] have to do it my way I just thought that [20] I'd give you a look at you know what I [22] do on a day-to-day basis to get this [24] what no guru is going to tell you is [25] that there are many roads to success [27] because when um they sell you on their [29] road to success obviously that's how [30] they make money but in reality there are [32] hundreds thousands of different ways [34] that you can achieve 18K YouTube Subs so [36] just get what you can out of my video [37] and if something doesn't apply to you [38] discard it um last but not least no [40] gatekeeping I'll just show you [41] everything because every time in my life [43] on YouTube I've ever showed people [44] everything I tend to be rewarded [46] disproportionately so first and foremost [48] how much money does 18,000 subscribers [50] on YouTube make you well it all depends [52] on your monetization potential when I [54] started I didn't monetize my Channel at [55] all because I wanted to provide a stupid [57] dummy amount of value to the people that [59] were watching and I knew that the money [60] would come eventually I didn't really [62] care too much about that um eventually [64] after five months or something like that [66] four months maybe um I think the demand [68] for a community product was so big that [70] I ended up launching like a community [72] product to my audience and uh now I make [74] about $35,000 a month off of it um last [78] month I made let's see $ 26,7 40 from [82] June the 1st to July [84] 2024 and then this month so far I've [87] made a 22,400 dat um the Mr here is [91] about 35k so that's about how much it's [92] going to average out to um you know over [94] the next 14 days or so um so that's [97] pretty sick obviously very enjoyable but [98] that's not the only money that I get to [99] make directly from my YouTube I also [101] make about $2,000 a month from my ad [104] traffic so uh this is one of my YouTube [107] videos here but if I go back to my [109] channel [110] analytics I pull out the last 28 days [113] you see in the last four weeks I've [114] generated about 1,900 so I don't know [116] how to do the last 30 days but whatever [118] it's about 2,000 bucks uh which is also [120] pretty awesome and then I also generate [122] about another $800 a month from [124] Affiliates Affiliates are you know like [127] the bottom of all my videos I will put [128] tiny little links where I um get a [130] kickback if people buy stuff so like [132] make.com that's the number one thing [134] that I obviously talk about so most [135] people that sign up to make.com link [137] will give me a kickback um apify web [140] flow risetime track and ton of different [142] ton of different stuff which is all very [144] lucrative and all very fun um if it's [146] not clear the main Revenue driver at [148] least from the YouTube channel has been [150] the community so far so $35,000 a month [152] I mean that's like 17 times whatever [154] this stuff is so this definitely [156] overshadows everything and uh makes [158] sense because it's a it's a big point of [159] value for a lot of people but I actually [162] care a lot less about this than what I'm [163] about to tell you next and that's [165] because the number one most beneficial [167] thing that I've gotten as a result of [168] this YouTube channel is I now have [170] basically a warm lead generation funnel [172] on autopilot that delivers people that [174] want to throw money at me Non-Stop and [177] it's such a change from the life that I [179] used to live before before this back in [181] the day before all this I used to sell [182] cold so I kind of come from like a cold [184] call Background door to door background [186] so I mean I had to push like crazy in [188] order to get every sale and uh even when [190] I eventually transitioned out to like [192] very effective systems that sold through [193] cold email and personalized stuff and [194] that sort of deal it was always a little [196] bit more of an upill battle um but with [198] a warm Le genen funnel it is insane just [200] how much trust and authority and [201] reputation you get to build with people [203] because they watch you talk for an hour [205] and if you watch somebody talk for an [206] hour like at the end of the hour you're [207] like yeah I feel like I know that guy so [209] this has been great um I get about 10 [211] per month and they're all super [212] lucrative most of these people make at [214] least $200,000 a month if not more um [216] some of them are like eight figers so [218] between 10 to 99 million although most [219] of them are like at the 10 to 20 million [221] Mark and as a result I received some [223] dummy offers when I say dummy offers I [225] mean like one company um was like a [227] private Equity company and they owned a [229] portfolio of 10 or 15 other businesses [232] and the business owner looked me point [233] blank in the face was like hey do you [234] want to run all of these companies for [236] me like every single one of these [237] companies they're all reasonably similar [239] all we need all we would need you to do [241] is to build systems for the these [243] businesses and then operate these [244] systems within the businesses you'd [246] receive a massive Equity cut you'd [247] receive like big Revenue payouts [249] targeted Milestone goals and all that [251] stuff so that's a really dummy offer a [253] single one of these could make like you [254] know one to maybe $5 million a year um [257] and 35k a month I mean if you do the [259] math on that that's uh I don't know 400k [262] or something like that a year right yeah [265] 420k a year um so this is really where [267] like the the juice is I also received [270] another offer just anecdotally to [272] partner with an eight figure consultancy [273] that does a lot of financial transaction [275] stuff in Asia uh and that could have [276] been uh that could have been a very big [278] offer as well unfortunately I was busy [279] so I was unable to take that um as well [281] as a bunch of just like small retainer [283] offers for a bunch of seven and probably [286] some of them were eight fig businesses [287] as well I just didn't really like pry [288] into their revenue as much as I usually [290] do um so you know this has just been [292] like guaranteed stability guaranteed [294] income and really just guaranteed um you [298] know like guaranteed scale of my [299] business which has been freaking awesome [301] there are obviously some additional [302] benefits which uh you know I'd love to [304] talk about the biggest is that I feel [306] like I have much more impact now than I [307] ever did before I feel like uh reaching [309] 18,000 subscribers on YouTube and [312] realistically like I think over 600,000 [314] people have watched my videos in the [315] last few months that's really big [317] because my average watch time is like [318] five minutes or six minutes or something [320] so like on average if 600,000 people [323] watch six minutes of my content like [325] that's a really really big amount of [327] impact especially because I like to [329] think that I actually put provide value [330] during the content that people watch so [332] you know if it was just like silly meme [335] brain rot stuff maybe not but like 6 [337] minutes times whatever the value is [339] times 600,000 views like I I feel like [341] I'm actually impacting the world in some [342] way which is freaking cool um I also [345] have a lot of uh warm friendships now [347] with ambitious High income earners I [349] don't say that because I'm only friends [350] with high income earners just that they [352] tend to have similar traits to me you [353] know they're very conscientious [354] obviously they tend to care about things [356] like frugality um performance that sort [359] of so I've been able to develop a [361] lot of great friendships with these [362] people as a result um and I maybe maybe [364] like a dozen of them now and I also have [366] a much more enjoyable work day um when [368] people come to you instead of the other [369] way around um it's just way nicer [371] because as I mentioned to you earlier [372] like if people watch a lot of your [373] content when they come to you they'll be [375] coming you with a small they'll sort of [376] feel like they know you already it [378] alleviates a lot of like the minor [379] communication BS that I had to deal with [381] when I was doing cold email um so [383] definitely prefer this as a lead [384] generation method and I'm not knocking [387] cold email or cold Outreach like cold [388] Outreach is amazing and that's what's [390] really allowed me to live a very [392] comfortable life here uh but um you know [394] it's just different and I personally [396] just wanted to see if there was another [397] way to go about it the last thing is I [399] feel like I found my calling this is the [401] thing that I was meant to do in life and [403] the Japanese have a concept for it uh [405] the eeky guy which is where basically I [408] feel like this is at the intersection of [410] what I love um what I'm good at what I [413] can be paid for and what the world needs [414] so I want to get more High agency [416] ambitious people out there into the [418] world Building Systems using these super [420] high leverage um tools because by doing [422] so I'm going to be improving the world [424] and I love that I do it um pays me [426] really well and uh it's yeah just very [428] enjoyable all in so that's more or less [432] you know what it does for you [433] financially anyway which I think most [434] people care about and then just in terms [436] of like my my quality of life let's [438] actually talk about the timeline let me [439] show you how how I would do this exactly [441] if I were like dropped in the past with [442] zero YouTube subscribers and how to do [444] it all over again so first things first [446] I'll give you a brief little timeline um [448] I started my first like major I want to [450] say somewhat successful business called [451] one second copy back in 2021 we were [454] just like writing uh blog articles [455] magazines that sort of thing and the way [457] that this whole business worked was we [458] leveraged artificial intelligence to [460] pre-draft large portions of the pieces [461] so that uh we could save money on like [463] the writer cost and then ultimately have [465] higher margins so that was really [466] awesome and I learned a lot about [467] automation as a result and uh you know I [470] saw the industry changing when chat GPT [471] came out and started like murdering my [473] uh my margins obviously because nobody [474] really gave a crap about content anymore [476] if you know they can just have a robot [477] do like 80% as good of a job and so I [480] lost a lot of like you know the [481] Arbitrage that I was doing there where I [483] knew about the tech but other people [484] didn't um and I started selling [486] Automation Services to try and stop that [488] um or at least you know get ahead of [489] that in early 2023 my biggest month uh [492] to date was 72k selling that um as I [495] mentioned earlier most were cold leads [497] which can be lucrative but cold leads [498] are really really hard to sell so I [500] decided and I kind of thought to myself [502] I was on um I was in Mexico actually [503] with a really good friend of mine his [504] name is Zach um Zach is one of the [507] smartest men that I know I have a call [508] with him later today actually love this [510] guy to death anyway I was uh basically [512] bitching to him about these cold emails [513] and I was like man like like so many [516] people are skeptical and like why is it [517] that when I get on the call with them [518] they kind of like look at me like this [520] right and I really have to prove myself [522] and after that it's fine but like you [523] know the first like 5 10 minutes like I [525] don't know if I can keep doing this man [526] I think I've been selling cold for too [528] long and he was just like you should [529] really try you know you should really [531] try YouTube you should really try [532] creating content and so I went for a [535] long walk that day on the beach of a [537] small community and um off the coast of [539] Cancun called ILO mues which also stands [542] for uh that means like island of women [544] apparently which my girlfriend was not [545] too happy about did not realize that I [548] was going to the island of women with uh [550] with my bro but uh anyway I uh I just [553] thought about it and I like was like H [554] you know K can I do this do I have the [556] skills that are necessary to like you [557] know create content that people would [558] like and then leverage that for a warm [560] funnel and the answer to that question [562] ended up being yeah obviously but uh you [565] know when I got back from my trip in [567] February 2024 I started making my [568] YouTube videos [570] so from February 2024 until now I think [573] it's like five months or so I believe [574] this is the seventh month so yeah it's [576] been about 5 months I took two months [578] off completely um my channel continued [580] growing in that time during the two [582] months that I took off but I did take [583] two full months off completely and I [585] still managed to hit about 18,000 [586] subscribers which I personally think is [588] crazy it's over 3,000 subscribers a [590] month AK I've averaged over 100 [591] subscribers a day and that's what two [593] months off from there um how I actually [596] went about doing this is I just realized [600] that I have not actually been sharing my [601] screen so there we go uh from there in [603] terms of like how I actually went about [605] doing this is uh my initial videos were [608] just whatever the hell I decided to talk [609] about that day so I had zero theme I had [611] zero Direction I didn't even really [613] think about it I just clicked record on [615] my camera and then I started talking um [618] and I talked for usually about half an [619] hour a day or so on to the camera topics [622] that I focused on were just like you [623] know business successes that I've had in [625] the past and that sort of deal so my [628] goal here was just to build as much [629] momentum as possible not momentum on [631] YouTube mind you but just momentum in my [632] own life like I really needed that [634] momentum in my own life I needed a daily [636] Habit in order to like continue doing [638] this sort of thing and I figured YouTube [640] would uh respond with uh you know with [643] with value if I approached it with value [645] and also I figure that like if I just [647] like have enough inputs the outputs will [649] sort of smooth out any day-to-day [650] quality issues so in terms of the [652] timeline um you know I started right [654] around here where the first three is and [656] then uh that was like February the 3D [658] looks like or maybe February the 1st [660] actually I think it might have been my [661] birthday which is February the 1 [662] interesting and then I didn't get any [664] real traction or anything like that for [667] I don't know like about 14 videos so I [669] did like 14 videos in a row and I got [670] like I don't know two subscribers maybe [672] no probably like 100 subscribers or so [674] and then right around this time um I [676] started noticing that uh every time I [678] put the term make.com in the title of [680] the video um I'd get a lot more [682] subscribers and so I instantly pivoted [684] and I started recording videos on all [686] the make.com automations that I built [688] for one second copy and also for my own [689] business and the second that I started [691] doing that I took off quite quickly um [694] and so I attribute this to just the fact [696] that I you know I was testing the market [698] basically with every video that I was [699] doing and I was constantly monitoring to [700] see you know which videos uh performed [702] better than other ones to try and tell [703] me like okay like does the market like [705] this sort of stuff am I talking about [706] this the right way do they prefer when I [708] screen share all these minor little [710] optimizations and then I ended up having [711] a really big spike um that ended up [714] dying down quite a bit and the reason [715] why I think it's died down since then is [717] because I actually think that I'm just [718] like the big guy now on make.com I don't [720] think that this Niche actually has any [721] more people that I can like really fully [723] um fully fully get to to be honest if [725] you just go on YouTube right now well [728] actually I don't know if right now maybe [729] if you're watching this video in four [730] years or something that's won't apply [731] but if you go on YouTube right now you [732] type make.com I'm probably somewhere in [733] the top few results right um like when I [736] did it myself I was like the second [737] result a couple of my friends did it [739] they said like n I'm pretty sure you're [740] the first result which is stupid um but [743] since then you know I've had this [744] Decline and that's just because I don't [746] really feel like there are any more [747] people I think realistically all the [748] subscribers are getting are like all of [749] the people that are learning make.com [751] every day like entering this Market [753] which is pretty great but it's also a [755] double-edged sore right anyway uh that's [758] the timeline there I took a big month [759] off here um because I went to Prague to [761] do uh like a PR Company this was one of [763] the offers that I had received that I [764] was mentioning to you guys before um [766] unfortunately it didn't pan out anywhere [767] near as lucratively as some of the other [768] offers probably would have but whatever [770] it's just business um and yeah I ended [772] up taking a big a chunk off there and [774] then I ended up taking you know [776] collectively another month or so off um [778] over here um but ever since then it's [780] been reasonably steady this accruit over [782] 60,000 watch hours which is pretty cool [783] as I mentioned before and then about [785] 18,000 subscribers um with an estimated [787] revenue of $ [789] 74269 so you know about $2,000 a month [792] or so um obviously I'm very happy with [794] that but this is more or less the [795] timeline and I've just been producing [796] similar sorts of videos since then [797] although now I'm definitely pivoting [799] more into like the thought space like uh [801] you know like here's a road map to help [803] you do XYZ as opposed to like here here [805] here's me building some make.com [806] automations in terms of the kit I think [809] a lot of people are probably going to be [810] really interested in this but I have a [811] very simple and basic kit uh obviously I [813] have like a pretty nice camera that's [814] why the background behind me is probably [816] a little bit blurred um I think my [817] lighting is okay it's not amazing to be [819] honest I have like these weird shadows [821] in my face when my finger crosses over [822] my cheek uh which is something that you [824] just shouldn't really be doing you [825] should be using soft lighting not like [827] really tiny lights like I have um but [829] the camera itself is a Sony a6300 [831] mirrorless with a sigma um 16 mm f1.8 I [835] think it's an f1.8 actually let me just [837] double check sorry it's a f1.4 my B I [840] knew that sounded wrong um and this is [842] like kind of like a it's almost like a [843] fisheye sort of like landscape I think [846] it's a landscape lens it's sort of like [847] a fisheye thing so I don't actually you [849] know what interesting I don't actually [850] look like this this sort of warps my [852] face so if you look at a picture of me [854] um those taken with like a different [855] camera it won't look like this but the [857] reason why I did this and I bought this [859] lens even though it warps the hell out [860] of my face is because it's very [862] convenient and it allows me to record on [865] my desk so my camera is right over there [867] I don't have to like have a big setup [869] where my desk is like halfway like [870] basically the um the higher this number [873] is uh the further back you have to be to [875] like be in the frame of the camera right [877] so um I just bought whatever was the [879] most convenient for me I didn't really [880] give a about how I looked a lot to [882] be honest and this is in line with just [884] the rest of my methodology and really [885] just the theory behind behind my YouTube [887] growth I would say which is that I just [889] care about the inputs I don't really [890] care about the quality anywhere near as [892] much as I care about just showing up [894] consistently every single day for a very [896] long time and if I can make my life even [898] 5% EAS easier or if I can make the [900] ability to record even 5% easier then I [902] know I'm going to record at least 5% [904] more so I should do it uh and this is a [906] you know very conscious decision I made [907] to do so so I don't know I might upgrade [909] my camera I mean obviously I'm making [911] enough money now that I could buy a [912] really bougie camera um but part of me [914] thinks that it would just like generate [915] more headache than it would solve so I'm [917] I'm not really sure what I'm going to do [918] there uh various microphones I started [920] with an anchor Bluetooth lab mic um it's [922] just like this little thing that you put [923] right on your neck and then um you know [926] it's like through Bluetooth and stuff [927] and it was really convenient really cool [928] to get started I just had way too many [929] issues kept on dying halfway through my [931] recordings and So eventually I just [933] threw that away and I didn't really use [934] it anymore afterwards I bought one [936] called the fify a6t um but I found that [939] every single person that was watching my [941] video could hear the inside of my mouth [943] and what was going on in my stomach and [944] what I mean by that is uh I don't know [946] if I just screwed up with like my [947] microphone stuff I didn't have like a [948] pop filter or whatever they're called I [950] still don't really know too much about [951] this maybe somebody that's watching this [952] right now can uh can leave a comment and [954] tell me why this sounded like you could [956] hear the inside of my mouth but it was [957] very lip smacky and it was very annoy [959] now I use the Samsung q2u uh which I [962] think is better I think it still has [963] some issues but you know it's definitely [964] like verging towards the ideal [966] microphone and uh yeah that's that setup [969] um in terms of how I record I use OBS [971] studio so OBS studio if I just drag this [973] in from the other window here uh looks [975] like this and um I can jump back and [977] forth between scenes just like I'm doing [978] right now and I have a little hotkey [980] that allows me to do it so I don't have [981] to do it in post I can just do it here [982] and the benefit of that is I just get to [983] like export this video basically drag it [986] into a template and then voila I'm done [987] I don't have to spend all day long [989] editing like a lot of other people do it [991] allows me just to add lib which is quite [993] nice I have a couple of custom things [995] set up here um if I double click this [997] you'll see that it's a rounded corner [999] and this is something that not a lot of [1000] people do which I think just like one of [1002] those tiny little hacks that's added a [1004] ton to my perceived uh the perceived [1006] production value of my videos but [1008] basically I um I don't know there's like [1010] some mask Shadow layer thing that you [1012] drag over here I I wish I knew more [1014] about this yeah there's like a filter [1017] called rounded corners and I basically [1019] drag and dropped a rounded Corner [1020] filters so just makes it looks nice and [1021] then it has like some shadows and then I [1023] also have a what's called like a let [1024] filter which changes the um the [1026] background for me so I don't have to [1027] like do all that work in post again um [1030] so yeah it makes the quality look a [1031] little bit higher it allows me to do so [1033] in real time which is obviously what I [1034] care the most about um yeah and it's all [1037] you know in line with what I'm talking [1038] about before which is that you know all [1039] I care about is minimizing friction okay [1042] in terms of how I do the thumbnails I [1044] use [1044] canva so the way that I do this [1046] thumbnail literally I'll show you guys [1048] exactly how I a thumbnail is um I have [1051] these two templates this left template [1052] and the right template I've talked about [1053] this before for anybody that's watched [1055] my previous video but basically I will [1057] take a screenshot of me recording a [1059] video so I was recording a video here [1061] and then I just stopped and I smiled at [1062] the camera or something and then I was [1063] like oh it'll be a nice screenshot so I [1065] take a screenshot and then I take my [1067] template which is this other one where [1069] I'm looking dashing my you and then I [1071] paste in this um and then what I'll do [1073] is I'll copy the style of the big one [1077] then I'll paste it in the little [1080] one then I um just drag it like this and [1084] then I go like this I go down like that [1087] basically and then I don't know [1089] sometimes I go over sometimes I go under [1091] just however I'm feeling that day to be [1092] honest um I'd probably go over now that [1094] looks kind of cool and then um I just [1097] have like two different colors I have [1098] like a white and then I have a yellow [1100] the font that I use is called League [1101] Spartan I know a lot of people really [1102] like these thumbnail so just trying to [1103] give you guys everything here um sorry [1106] there's some construction going on next [1107] door I hope I I hope they do not pull [1109] out the uh the drill that would suck uh [1112] and then sometimes I just like change [1114] the I don't know I'd go like YouTube [1116] road map or something and then I change [1119] the font size of them so that they're [1121] about the same size I want to say this [1124] is a crappy example because they're both [1126] like about the same length of text but I [1129] do something like that and then I would [1132] uh decrease the spacing on this to [1135] something like that I want to say and [1137] then if I'm using a specific like [1139] platform or something let's say this is [1140] about Loom and not YouTube I would um [1142] drag one of these assets that I've [1144] generated i' put it somewhere right over [1146] here and then I'd go to share uh [1149] download and then I'd go page one and [1152] then I would download this and then [1154] that's what I would upload to to YouTube [1155] later um so as you can tell it's a very [1157] streamlined and very simple process this [1159] whole canva thumbnail creation thing [1160] takes me about a minute and a half which [1162] is why I personally do it myself I think [1164] that I could probably hire somebody to [1165] do like a qualitatively better job than [1167] me but I think that it would just add so [1168] much friction to me to like have to wait [1170] for them to do the thumbnail and [1171] that I would just never actually want to [1172] do it in practice so yeah that's the [1175] process uh this is what I mentioned [1177] about the Sigma lens making me look ugly [1179] but uh [1181] whatever okay great now um yeah let's [1184] talk about the actual like YouTube and [1185] recording workflow so how how do I [1187] actually go about like getting an idea [1189] how do I actually go about um you know [1191] turning that idea into a video how do I [1192] go about recording and whatnot well at [1195] the very beginning of this I had no plan [1197] as I've mentioned before all I would do [1198] is I just record and then I talk for a [1200] while um so in a way that's kind of what [1202] I'm doing now although I had a little [1203] bit more work obviously because I made [1205] uh this this uh slideshow now what I [1207] have is I have a very minimal content [1209] calendar and this is what it looks like [1211] and if you guys have watched my systems [1213] videos you'll probably be like Nick why [1214] the hell does this look so bad why don't [1215] you use clickup for this or something [1217] well the reason why is because I didn't [1218] want to spend any time on this at all I [1221] wanted to continue making the super low [1223] friction I didn't want to add any [1224] complexity into it so what I have is I [1226] have a column called content idea I have [1228] a column call description I have an [1229] outline question mark and then I have a [1231] Post-It and an outline is where I will [1233] write a very quick and easy um you know [1237] outline basically with a few bullet [1238] points um showing you guys how I do all [1240] of this stuff um and you know usually [1243] I'll like try and do the intro so I [1245] don't know this is like a very brief [1246] intro on this video I'm going to cover [1247] nine ways and then I just end up not [1249] doing the intro um and then this outline [1251] I don't actually like look at it or [1252] anything this just like helps me know [1253] ahead of time for a video like this I [1255] probably would look at it because it's [1256] like you know 10 things long or whatever [1259] um that should be 14 but yeah that's my [1261] very simple content calendar process um [1263] I literally just have a giant list and [1265] you'll also see that some of these have [1266] um the person's name here like Jason [1268] guest 3447 n [1270] m527 um the reason why I included these [1272] these YouTube handles is because these [1274] are people that asked me um to create a [1276] video on a specific topic on another [1278] YouTube video so um the reason why [1280] that's important is because this is my [1281] whole process I actually go and I scrape [1284] my own YouTube comments I feed all of [1287] the YouTube comments into GPT before [1288] using a prompt like extract all of the [1291] questions here and video suggestions [1293] because I'm making YouTube videos and I [1295] need ideas it'll then spit out a ton I [1298] then add those to a Google sheet okay [1300] this Google sheet and then I will [1302] manually filter for the ideas that I [1304] think are doable within about an hour or [1306] so and that are possible with [1307] technologies that I use daily so if you [1309] ever wondered why at the end of my [1310] videos I say stuff like hey if you have [1311] any ideas for future videos you want me [1313] to do whatever just leave a comment down [1314] below it's because I actually Source my [1316] ideas from you guys because you know a [1318] while ago just like why am I spending [1319] all this time and energy coming up with [1320] ideas that people may or may not want to [1322] see when I could just ask them what they [1324] want to see and then I'll just make the [1325] videos about that like that's probably [1327] way more Market sensitive right and the [1330] answer to that is Hell yeah all the [1331] videos that I've sourced from real [1333] people tend to do way better than the [1334] ones that I just kind of make up on my [1335] own so yeah this is a video that was [1337] sourced by a real person by the way [1339] unfortunately I do not remember who the [1341] person was uh for whatever reason the [1342] gp4 thing did not like output their [1344] their channel name but to whichever [1346] viewer uh request of this video know [1348] that I did it for [1350] you okay if the idea is a little bit [1352] difficult if um you know I don't know it [1354] too much about the the request or [1356] something like that I'll actually go [1357] through and then I'll just think about [1358] it like in my head um just just ahead of [1361] time to make sure that it's possible um [1363] you know and if it's you know uh [1365] something that I haven't validated or [1366] done before I'll test it ideally I [1368] wanted to be capable using the tool [1370] stack that I've sort of grown really [1371] used to because then I can make the [1372] video really easily and obviously then I [1373] seem like more of a professional um but [1375] there are some instances where I've just [1376] like dove into a new technology and I've [1378] just spent like 20 or 30 minutes reading [1379] up about it and be like hm how do I do [1381] this H how do I do that and then once I [1382] know enough I can just make a video on [1384] it then I just go until the end so in [1387] terms of the um that's the recording [1390] workflow right so that's basically [1391] everything I'm doing like currently as [1392] we speak but what am I going to do when [1394] I export this later um from OBS and then [1396] drag it into Premier Pro well the very [1398] first thing that I do is I have a [1399] Premier Pro template with some intro [1400] music and some outro music so I'm going [1402] to try and open up Premier Pro right now [1404] try not to burn my computer it is [1406] overwhelmingly hot up in my loft [1408] unfortunately I'm at the top third [1409] flooor of uh like a [1412] three-story apartment and it's the [1414] summer and it's an older building and [1415] there's just no air conditioning [1417] whatsoever so it's probably 30 degrees [1419] and my camera sometimes overheats when I [1420] go for a little too long uh okay great [1423] so here's my Premier Pro template I'm [1424] using the wrong one it's called weekly [1426] office hour template for whatever reason [1427] but whatever and then what I do uh [1430] myself is I will zoom in [1434] here and I don't know how to turn off [1437] the audio [1439] maybe [1440] mute there we go oh nope I got one more [1444] channel to mute great um and I just [1447] recently started experimenting with some [1449] little cute Zoomin as you can see that's [1451] very underwhelming Nick that's very [1453] underwhelming anyway uh yeah so I will [1456] drag and drop the video here sometimes [1460] very rarely I will do this kind of cut [1463] here because um it's kind of zoomed in [1466] right now as you can see like notice [1467] where it's cutting off the microphone [1468] just right up at the top here and then [1470] over here like the microphone is shown [1471] so I have to make a cut and then I have [1472] to like change the effects or whatever [1475] but it's not that big of a deal um and [1477] then I'll just drag it all in and then I [1479] have little music at the very beginning [1481] which is here and then I have another [1482] thing of Music at the very end which is [1483] over here and then this whole process [1485] will take me literally like 30 seconds [1487] or so which is awesome and then I don't [1489] have to like deal with editing which I [1490] hate and then I just do the intro music [1493] the outro music because I find it [1493] improves engagement if I have like some [1495] happy thing and I like seem kind of [1496] happy at the beginning people tend to [1498] watch for a little bit longer okay and [1500] then while editing if I make a minor [1501] mistake I will leave it um because I [1503] don't really care about that and it's [1505] just going to interrupt with my my flow [1506] but if I make a major mistake and when I [1508] say major mistake I mean like I spent 15 [1509] minutes calling the wrong API last week [1512] and it was brutal I was like why isn't [1513] this working what the hell and then like [1515] 15 minutes went by I was like oh [1517] and then I you know called the right API [1519] uh I now cut those out because I [1520] received a few comments that are [1521] basically like hey man we just spent 15 [1523] minutes like trying to build the wrong [1526] thing and then you were like oh this is [1527] how you do it and then you we had to go [1528] back and like double over um so just for [1531] I guess your guys' benefit and like you [1533] know keeping you guys as efficient as [1534] time effective as possible I just I I do [1536] cut those out now if they're like you [1538] know more than five minutes I want to [1540] say and then I talk about how I [1541] prioritize output which I do um then [1544] during exporting I'll go through that [1545] canva thumbnail process that I talked [1546] about which takes you know about two [1548] minutes or so um so I screenshot me [1550] seeming funny and happy and making all [1552] these weird faces in the camera and then [1554] uh yeah that's that and then when I [1556] actually like upload the video we'll do [1559] what I'll do is I'll go to [1560] YouTube and then click on this create [1565] button let me [1567] oh let me actually go and like see if I [1570] could do it I want a very short clip [1574] here H that's not [1576] one we'll go over here to OBS show the [1580] recordings okay having two monitors is [1583] [Music] [1585] crazy um I think this was me testing my [1589] camera a moment ago so the clip is [1590] probably one minute long or something so [1592] it'll allow me to do this quickly okay [1594] great and then when I actually like post [1596] the videos um this is what my my [1598] workflow looks like so as you can see I [1600] already put the word make.com in because [1601] I have some details from previous videos [1603] that I've templated um you can just do [1604] that in YouTube just going to settings [1606] and then pressing upload defaults and I [1608] have a bunch of My Links here that are [1609] sort of by default all my Affiliates and [1611] stuff like that and then I just click on [1612] upload file and then I'll upload the um [1615] thing that I just created here and that [1617] I would probably fix that because it [1618] looks like it's almost cut off so i' [1620] probably make the text smaller move it a [1621] little over to the left and maybe move [1622] myself over to the left but whatever and [1624] then in terms of the actual work that I [1626] do I go down here to altered content I [1628] always click no and then tags I will um [1630] just add in about a 100 characters of [1632] tags specific to whatever I'm doing so [1634] this would be like YouTube subscriber [1636] like how to get YouTube subscribers [1639] YouTube strategy I don't know like [1641] YouTube BTS or something like that right [1644] and I get to about 500 and then I stop I [1645] don't really care about this I just bang [1646] it out in a second and then I scroll [1648] down here and then I always pick English [1651] U my take is that you know most people [1652] watch videos in English so most people [1654] probably have their language set to [1655] English so if I do that they'll probably [1657] be more likely to see it and I'm not [1659] actually going to upload this video but [1660] that's that's exactly what I do every [1662] single time um there's no magic here [1663] whatsoever um that's just 100% it I just [1666] do it a lot which is why I'm pretty fast [1668] at it the last thing is um when I when I [1670] go I click publish but YouTube tells you [1672] not to click publish if you're monetized [1674] because they say Hey listen what if we [1676] um like disable your video or something [1678] what if it ends up being that like uh [1679] you're not legible you're not eligible [1681] legible for monetization um just in case [1684] you should click unlisted so you could [1685] fix your problems before you publish I [1687] don't really care about that or worry [1688] about it because uh to me that that [1690] doesn't matter I mean like the ad [1691] Revenue that I'm making is so small in [1692] the grand scheme of things that I'd [1694] rather just like the benefit to me to [1696] just click publish and then get on with [1697] my life is higher than like the few [1699] dollars a day and AD Revenue I'd be able [1700] to make from a video if it were [1702] magically not to be monetized so that's [1705] just my mindset I mean I know it's not [1707] super optimized IED or whatever um but [1710] it's worked really well for me okay this [1713] is sort of a thought experiment that [1714] I've had and the thought experiment was [1715] Nick if you were dropped on a random [1716] remote island uh with a bunch of hot [1718] blonds no if you were dropped on uh some [1721] uh you know remote island that magically [1723] had internet connection and uh you had [1724] zero YouTube subscribers and you had to [1726] like build it all up from scratch what [1727] would you do and uh I went through and I [1731] compiled the exact steps that I would [1733] follow and this is exactly what I would [1734] do uh no at all this is 100% [1737] what I would do because I did most of [1739] this for my first run this is just a [1741] more optimized and compressed version of [1742] my workflow so the very first thing I'd [1745] do is I would first consider what is [1747] impressive about myself what was [1750] impressive about me was that I ran a [1751] Content marketing company that I knew [1753] how to build automations that you know I [1755] was making about 20 $25,000 a month on [1757] upwork at the time um that you know I [1759] had a bunch of just a bunch of other [1761] things about me and my business life [1763] that was impressive I then list these as [1765] bullet points and then using those [1767] bullet points I would brainstorm now I [1770] brainstorm 30 things but I would [1771] recommend you brainstorm just seven [1773] things that you can confidently talk [1775] about that also uses your like Authority [1778] basically that you know demonstrates [1780] that you're an authority in a subject [1781] demonstrates that you know what you're [1782] talking about you're worth listening to [1783] you're not just some like Trump on [1784] YouTube that doesn't know what the hell [1786] uh you know he's just making a video in [1787] his mom's basement to procrastinate [1789] getting a job or something just [1791] brainstorm seven things that you could [1792] talk about and then create a low [1795] friction recording setup so just like my [1797] recording setup if you want to just [1798] borrow what I have instead of using um [1800] the you know a6300 or maybe like a more [1802] expensive DSLR mirrorless you could just [1804] use your phone if you wanted to instead [1806] of using a microphone like this you [1807] could just use like a phone microphone [1808] maybe pass it through some like noise [1810] filter reduction or something but just [1812] make a very low friction recording setup [1813] that enables you to just turn the camera [1815] on and then talk for a while and then [1816] what I do is every day for the next [1818] seven days I would just record long form [1820] videos just like I do and then just post [1822] once per day um what I would not do and [1825] what a lot of people do unfortunately is [1827] they try and bat a bunch of them ahead [1828] of time AK they'll try and record like I [1831] don't know seven videos in a day because [1832] they have like a free day in their [1833] schedule but I would highly recommend [1835] that if you want to do this and if you [1836] want to succeed on this platform you do [1837] not try and batch instead of cramming [1840] like you cram for an exam or whatever [1842] right remember back when you were at [1842] school all the teachers like don't cram [1844] you should study ahead of time I crammed [1846] but [1847] uh uh don't do this because the thing [1850] that's most important is not your [1851] ability to bang out seven videos in 3 [1853] hours or whatever it's your ability to [1855] take small repeated daily actions that [1857] inch you closer towards your goal the [1859] benefit to this is by doing just a [1861] little bit every day you actually get [1862] very good at recording videos and [1864] talking on camera and doing all that fun [1865] stuff very quickly um which is what I [1867] credit to my 18 thou which is what my [1869] 18,000 subscribers what I credit my [1871] 18,000 subscriber growth to so yeah [1874] that's what I would do and I would do it [1875] for seven days and I wouldn't worry [1877] about the thumbnails I wouldn't worry [1878] about like the titles I mean you know [1879] try your best but don't like beat [1881] yourself up over it and then what I do [1882] is after the seven days I just perform a [1884] little retrospective hey which videos [1886] perform better than average I would go [1888] back to my YouTube [1889] analytics I go to the content page here [1892] and then I would go through and see [1894] which videos had the highest retention [1895] which people liked um the videos the [1897] most which ones had the best numbers [1899] what were my top videos how did people [1901] find my videos if you click on any one [1903] of these videos it actually breaks it [1904] down and you can see like the specific [1905] stats of the video like this video made [1908] me almost 500 bucks which is pretty cool [1911] um you know the impression click through [1912] it was about 4% average view duration [1914] was uh you know looks like it jumped up [1916] to seven minutes yesterday [1918] interesting I wonder why or maybe oh [1921] sorry this isn't just one video this is [1922] my whole Channel yeah so that that's [1924] what I would do um and then once I know [1927] which ones are successful I would repeat [1931] the same process I did before where I [1932] brainstorm my seven ideas I would just [1934] brainstorm those seven ideas using that [1937] as inspiration so instead of like the [1939] list that I made previously as [1940] inspiration I would say h get people [1942] clearly like when I talk about make.com [1944] or zapier or apathy or whatever platform [1948] doesn't even have to be technology right [1950] I'm obviously in like the make money [1951] with make.com space I'm like the the [1953] automation agency space but um whatever [1956] space you're in whatever space you want [1957] to dominate uh the point that I'm making [1958] is you you can't stay stagnant and just [1960] make a bunch of content on that [1961] people don't care about because your [1962] YouTube channel won't really be able to [1963] grow um after you reach a sufficient [1965] point then you can start making uh [1967] videos on what people want to talk about [1969] and stuff but at the beginning you know [1970] you should be iterating you should be [1971] trying to figure out the format that [1973] works the type of content that works the [1974] copy that works because every Market is [1976] a little bit different right and then [1978] what I do is I just like repeat that [1979] process over and over and over and over [1981] and over again I repeat that process [1982] every week for at least two months and [1984] at the end of those two months by God if [1986] you've been consistent about it you [1988] should have at least a few thousand [1989] YouTube subscribers um and all that it [1992] really took for me in order to like [1993] completely changed how my life worked uh [1996] was about 60 days from start to finish [1999] um because after maybe five or six weeks [2001] I started receiving some inquiries after [2003] like seven or eight weeks those [2004] inquiries started turning serious and a [2005] little bit bigger and then after eight [2007] weeks maybe nine weeks um I started [2009] making like some good money off of all [2011] this [2012] stuff while you're doing all this make [2013] sure to respond to every comment make [2015] sure to build as deep uh relationship as [2017] you can with everybody that that views [2019] your audience that views your stuff [2020] rather um because you know these are [2022] these are like the people that are going [2023] to make up your quote unquote a thousand [2025] true fans later on and also um you know [2029] every time you respond to a comment and [2030] you take a little bit of additional time [2031] and energy it may seem like you're just [2033] I don't know wasting your time right now [2035] but consider that people are going to [2036] see those comments for the next like 5 [2038] years realistically so every time you [2040] take a little bit like a little moment [2042] to produce a little piece of content for [2044] the people that are going to be watching [2045] over the next five years it's actually a [2047] massive um leverage multiplier uh so [2050] take those opportunities wherever [2051] possible until you can anymore like I I [2053] can't really do this anymore [2054] unfortunately because there just so many [2055] comments so um you know I get one every [2058] couple of minutes and then if I did that [2059] I really wouldn't be able to continue [2061] working um and you know creating content [2064] what I wouldn't recommend is never hire [2065] somebody to do this I've seen some [2066] YouTubers that like hire people to [2068] respond to their comments for them it's [2069] terrible I mean that like just defeats [2070] the whole purpose why would you hire [2071] somebody to like you know people watch [2074] you because of your voice right they [2075] don't watch you for somebody else's [2076] voice so personally I would never ever [2078] do that but uh whatever um the last [2081] point I'll make on number seven is never [2083] gatekeep uh people are really tired of [2085] that stuff so just be yourself just talk [2087] about stuff that you want to talk about [2089] um what I've come to realize is there [2090] really are like no secrets on the [2091] internet maybe API keys are one [2093] exception I don't know but uh you know [2095] they're basically no secrets out here um [2098] just just tell people exactly how you [2099] did something and they'll respect you a [2100] lot more for it you know the the [2102] feedback you're going to get will be a [2103] lot better as a [2104] result and then after you know a month [2107] or two um that's when I'd start [2109] optimizing the fine stuff like my [2110] profile images my thumbnails my assets [2112] my copyrighting uh but I wouldn't worry [2114] about it before because the whole goal [2115] is we just want to be able to do this [2117] with like 45 minutes to an hour of your [2119] day we don't want to spend you know five [2121] hours a day becoming a full-time [2122] YouTuber that's just a waste and it's [2124] not uh it's not optimal I would say make [2126] sure you're still living your life and [2128] doing the other that you [2129] do now why exactly does this work uh the [2132] reason why is twofold number one a [2134] YouTube disproportionally rewards long [2136] form content all of my videos that are [2138] longer perform way better when I started [2140] my videos were maybe 30 minutes then I [2142] started experimenting with hourlong [2143] videos they performed way better then I [2144] started experimenting with two hour long [2146] videos they performed even better um [2148] that became a little bit infusible so [2149] I've had to dial it back air it to [2151] between the 30 minute to an hour mark [2152] but they really really like long- form [2154] content might be because they get to [2156] show so many ads I don't know but uh [2158] they love it and uh if they love it you [2159] should love it because you know if the [2162] platform rewards you then you'll be [2164] rewarded it'll validate your effort [2166] you'll be able to reach more people as a [2167] result you'll be able to do better and [2169] that's just a flywheel effect that takes [2170] you to that next [2172] level the second is that YouTube [2174] disproportionately rewards daily [2175] consistency um you could see it on [2178] anybody that I've gotten to do YouTube [2179] I've probably gotten like maybe five 10 [2181] of my friends now to get on YouTube to [2183] start posting consistently most of them [2184] have achieved at least a thousand [2185] followers in the last few months um [2188] anytime that they're consistent they [2189] post every day for a certain amount of [2191] time like a week or something uh the the [2192] stat the statistics are so different [2194] than if they like space it out and post [2196] like once every two weeks or whatnot or [2198] maybe like three times in a day and then [2199] like once uh the next month YouTube [2202] really doesn't like that stado stuff [2204] they they just really want you to post [2205] consistently and that doesn't mean you [2207] have to become like a YouTube brain rot [2209] like a for the platform or [2210] whatever it just means that you know the [2212] more consistent that you are with the [2213] posting um the higher that they'll [2215] probably rank you they probably have [2217] some like internal SEO score that ranks [2219] you based off of how many videos you [2220] post in the last like seven days divided [2222] by some momentum metric or whatnot [2224] that's what I would do anyway so yeah uh [2226] the last is that seven days is a very [2228] short feedback loop because you learn [2230] what works quickly and discard what [2231] doesn't my feedback loop before was a [2233] little bit longer than this so s days is [2235] actually even better um but you know [2237] you'll basically constantly be able to [2238] iterate and this is going to avoid the [2239] penultimate problem that I see a lot of [2241] channels fall into um which is that they [2243] don't understand the idea of like a [2244] local Maxima versus like a global Maxima [2248] um this is just like math class and so [2250] I'm taking us all back here uh we're [2253] doing a little throwback it's throwback [2254] Wednesday not Thursday but uh what a [2257] local Maxima is is it's where you know [2259] you you go along a graph and let's say [2261] like your whole function your whole [2263] existence uh you operate by the rule [2265] like hey move in the direction that [2267] yields me the biggest result so you move [2269] in this direction yields you result move [2270] in this direction yields your result [2272] move in this direction move in this [2273] direction and then you go over here and [2274] then if you want to move again you're [2275] like that doesn't yield me a result [2276] anymore that actually like pushes me [2278] down a little bit so I'm going to stay [2279] right here uh well if you do this and if [2282] you don't constantly iterate what you've [2283] done essentially is you've deprived [2285] yourself of this potential benefit [2288] because you haven't really experimented [2289] you haven't really iterated you just [2290] like constantly played by the same roles [2292] essentially this here is called a local [2294] Maxima this is like the locally highest [2297] point on some function this is the [2299] global Maxima this is like the highest [2301] point in the entire uh graph basically [2304] and so constantly you should constantly [2306] be looking for the global maximum and [2307] ensuring that you're not falling into [2308] one of these local Maxima like for [2310] instance this is the global Maxima of [2312] all of these Maxim I think that's what [2314] it's called English is such a silly [2316] language sometimes um but yeah you know [2319] uh they get one great clip that works [2320] and then they just try and repeat that [2321]  over and over and over and over [2322] again but don't do that just constantly [2323] be experimenting even if uh your next [2325] video isn't very good for instance [2327] that's okay you've at least validated [2328] that that is not an effective [2330] approach all right the last thing I'm [2332] going to mention here is that uh you [2333] don't actually need a team to do this [2335] like a lot of YouTubers um they have [2336] massive production teams and whatnot I'm [2338] of the mind that if you just set up your [2340] life to take advantage of Leverage you [2342] can do it basically all yourself or with [2344] just one or two people so for instance I [2346] mean up until 18,000 subscribers I've [2348] done it entirely myself I haven't needed [2350] anybody else in my team it's just been [2351] me me and me I don't have any editors [2353] right now I don't really have any help [2355] I've experimented with a couple very [2356] early on in my career and I found that [2357] it just added way too much friction and [2359] logistical BS to my process so I don't [2361] use them um it takes me around 1 hour a [2363] day now so an hour a day to get the [2365] results that I was getting previously [2367] like um I mean would you work an hour a [2370] day [2371] for I don't know $35,000 a month [2373] probably like I don't know if there'll [2376] ever be a time when I won't maybe when [2377] I'm super loaded like Bill Gates level [2379] loaded yeah but um that's like crazy [2382] leverage right an hour a day for I don't [2384] know five months and then you make uh [2385] $35,000 a month dumb uh and then it only [2389] took me 60 days for my life to [2390] completely change if you follow this [2392] compressed road map which is really just [2394] a selection of the the highest Roi parts [2396] of what I did uh you can and way less so [2399] yeah if this stuff sort of interests you [2401] and if you've always wondered about [2402] building a YouTube channel I'd highly [2403] recommend that you start now if you [2405] start today I mean before right at the [2408] time of this video recording is July the [2410] 17th if you start today then by [2413] September uh you could already have a [2415] completely changed life I mean how many [2418] other things in your day-to-day allow [2420] you that opportunity very few and [2422] whether it's YouTube or whether it's [2423] another content medium doesn't really [2424] matter I guess the point that I'm just [2426] making is uh person branding has been [2428] disproportionately valuable to me and I [2430] highly recommend that everybody here [2431] that has something useful to say [2433] something valuable that that that is an [2434] authority on some topic just get out [2436] there and give it a try because if not [2438] you'll always be left wondering any who [2440] I really appreciate you guys watching my [2441] video and having me blab on for quite a [2443] while I'm going to include this gamma [2444] Link in the description that's the [2445] slideshow tool that I use to do this [2447] little presentation so that if you guys [2449] want to just like look over this sort of [2450] as notes for your sake uh you can feel [2452] free if anybody has any questions feel [2454] free to drop them down as comments below [2456] if you have any video suggestions for as [2457] I mentioned I Source a lot of them from [2458] my YouTube comments so please do that [2460] too otherwise just like subscribe give [2462] me that thumbs up help me out with the [2463] yo and uh yeah I'll see you on the next [2465] video thanks so much

Title: How I Hit $25,000/mo Selling Automation Services (Roadmap & Guide)
[0] hello if you haven't met me yet my name [1] is Nick and in this video I'm going to [2] show you exactly how I got to $225,000 a [4] month selling Automation Services let's [7] get into it uh first things first this [9] is just my personal step-by-step process [11] I have to make this disclaimer because a [13] lot of people sort of take this as [14] gospel this is not the only way to get [16] there one thing that I think is really [18] unfortunate is that a lot of these like [20] internet gurus make their process it to [22] be the only process and in reality what [24] I've come to find that the more money [26] I've made the more successful I've [27] become is that there are multiple roads [28] and paths to achieving you know [30] Financial Freedom and whatever you you [32] constitute success not just mine right [35] so get what you can out of my video uh [37] apply to your own life and then you know [39] do with that what you will um but [41] hopefully there there going to be some [42] gems in here that'll help I'm also not [44] going to gatekeep at all I'm just going [45] to teach you everything um that you know [47] I personally did uh because personally I [50] find that when I just tell people [51] exactly what I did and how I did it they [52] tend to like me a lot more so um yeah [55] diving in why Automation in the first [57] place well this is probably one of the [59] highest Leverage Industries in 2024 that [61] you can get into um if you guys remember [63] like 5 or 10 years ago there were all [64] these trends that were just coming out [66] in um in online business there was like [67] Drop Shipping and like uh social media [69] marketing agencies and all that jazz and [72] at the time these are also quite High [73] leverage automation is like the current [75] very very high leverage thing and it's [77] probably one of the easiest ways to make [78] money um even if you're not you know [80] extraordinarily technically competent so [82] that's number one um basically it's just [85] like a massive leverage [87] multiplier what's cool is that you get [89] to use automations the same ones that [90] you sell to other people to make your [92] business better too so it's sort of like [94] you know mutually synergistic um the [96] second is that it's a very new and [97] growing industry uh it's like trending [100] like crazy right now I just pumped this [102] into Google Trends and you can see how [104] interest over time in AI automation [106] which I would say is like a more [107] Representative term for what we're doing [109] than just automation is blowing the hell [111] up right now especially since chat GPT [113] came out right around uh you know [114] November December or whatever actually I [117] think it came out in 2022 which be right [119] around here and that's really where you [120] see that big spike um so you know it's a [122] new and growing industry it's exciting [124] uh there's a very low barrier to entry [126] the tools that you need in order to do [127] this like you don't actually have to be [128] a like super crazy programmer or [129] anything like that most of the time it's [131] just no code tools that are drag and [132] drop and you know if you if you're [134] younger and you've grown up during the [135] internet or even if you're a little bit [136] older and you understand some [138] programming fundamentals um that makes [139] it very easy to get started you're just [141] dragging and dropping instead of writing [142] code and uh the benefit to that too is [144] that the customers and your clients tend [146] to like drag and drop Builders a lot [148] more than they like code because they [149] can actually do something with it they [150] can interpret it the fourth main reason [153] is uh because everybody needs it in some [155] way shape or form um like automation is [157] not going anywhere it's going to be [158] around for a while basically until we [160] like make the economy obsolete or at [162] least we make humans obsolete in the [164] economy uh so you know although it's a [166] new and growing industry it's not going [167] to be one of the short-term Trends [169] automation is going to be around for a [170] while because it just refers to the [171] process of uh basically systematizing [174] business and then the fifth is that it's [177] very sticky and what I mean by sticky is [179] uh if you start providing Automation [180] Services to clients one of the massive [182] benefits to this industry is that you [184] tend to get in bed with them you tend to [186] put your fingers in every part of their [188] business if that makes sense um and and [190] essentially you tend to be very hard to [192] get rid of especially if you work with [193] people on a monthly basis and this may [195] sound bad just the way that I'm pitching [196] it but it's really not because you also [198] provide a a stupid amount of value to [200] these customers as well by doing so and [203] so you know if you're part of every [204] aspect of somebody's business the [206] likelihood that they're going to want to [206] you know replace you if they see a shiny [208] new object down the street is very low [210] and so the people that you tend to get [211] on retainers or longer term [212] relationships they tend to stay with you [214] for a long time and you can make a ton [215] of money off of them you can easily make [217] over $50,000 a year per client and you [219] can have five to 10 of them at a time so [222] some obligatory background information [224] about me um I started a Content writing [226] agency called 1 second copy right around [228] the time that um gpt3 came out sort of [230] like back in 2020 and uh you know we [233] basically provided content writing [235] services for small to midsize businesses [237] like uh magazine articles obviously blog [240] posts uh Journal articles some eBooks [243] that sort of thing and uh you know I I [246] learned a lot of no code just building [248] that business um and and we peaked at [250] 92k a month right around the time that [252] chat GPT came out actually and that [255] business was extremely informative [256] because it it basically just provided me [257] all of the the knowledge and the [259] fundamental and sort of like the base [261] that I would later use to to sell [263] Automation Services and it was also just [264] a great testing ground for make.com [266] Content writing is a very high [267] throughput or high volume industry and [269] so you know you tend to have like a lot [271] of Articles right and when you have a [273] high volume of Records in like a project [275] manager or a CRM or something you tend [276] to want to automate them because there's [277] little fixed costs with every single one [280] so it was a great baseboard that I used [281] to to later learn a lot about Automation [283] and then launch an automation company um [286] and I started selling Automation [287] Services in Earnest like as a business [289] in May 2023 I was selling them a little [291] bit before U but this is the first time [292] that I was like all right like let's [293] systematize the hell out of this let's [294] turn this puppy into a business and then [297] between May to 2023 and then July to 202 [299] 3 I hit $25,000 a month and the way that [302] I did it was I just used everything that [303] I'm about to talk about here basically I [306] didn't have a road map at the time you [307] know I didn't have like some big master [309] plan I sort of just developed it [310] organically as I went along but looking [312] back this is what I did my biggest month [314] so far is [315] 72k uh in 30 days and that's net I [318] mentioned that it's net uh because it's [319] quite important most people on the [321] internet will tell you about the revenue [322] they're not going to tell you about [323] their profit so revenue is Vanity profit [326] is sanity my biggest month so far is [328] 72,000 and profit and I think that's [330] quite important and ultimately um the [332] other really important thing is that [334] automation is by far the most consistent [337] most enjoyable and probably the most [339] passionate thing that I've ever done in [340] my life it's fantastically interesting [344] every single day that I get to wake up [346] and work on somebody else's business and [348] I get to learn the ins and outs of a [349] completely new industry is a massive win [351] in my books and the fact that they also [353] just happen to pay me a lot of money to [355] do it um you know that's just the cherry [357] on top that's just the icing on top of [358] the cake any who let's get into some [361] core ideas here um what you're going to [363] see over the course of the next I don't [365] know 15 20 minutes however long I'm [366] going to be talking about this um are a [369] couple of of things and they're going to [370] crop up again and again and again and I [372] do a lot of Consulting and coaching [373] nowadays with my community and then you [375] know I do one-on ones and and there are [377] also issues that I see come up a lot [378] that I just want to get ahead of the [380] first big issue is that most people [382] spend their time on very low Roi [384] activities that are not directly [386] correlated with Revenue what do I mean [389] by low Roi activities I mean this is my [392] website here uh one thing that I tended [394] to do quite a lot when I started was I [396] would spend 30 minutes here an hour [398] there just touching up how my website [400] looked I would change the colors of [402] those little borders around the the [404] elements here I'd add my Twitter and [406] some days I'd add my LinkedIn and I [408] Chang the way that my book intro call [409] Button looked and you know I change the [411] social proof and and all that I'll [413] be real that stuff doesn't matter I [415] could have done absolutely none of that [417] saved myself 100 hours and spent it on [419] acquiring customers and I'd be much [420] further ahead uh now than I would have [422] otherwise um there are so many things so [425] many potential time sucks in business [427] that other people will try and tell you [429] that are important and that are [430] necessary but in reality the number one [433] thing that actually matters and [434] basically the only thing that matters in [435] any business such as automation is uh is [437] acquiring revenue and so if you can get [439] in the habit of just saying screw it to [441] everything except for acquiring Revenue [443] you will go very far very quickly and [445] that's one of the the main core [447] principles that I want to talk about [448] today [450] the quickest paths the quickest paths to [452] doing this in our business model in [454] automation um are three there are [456] communities cold email and then platform [458] sales uh communities are like groups of [461] people that band together to I don't [463] know discuss like a particular Niche [465] topic a lot of the time they're pay [466] walled or gated so you know sometimes [467] you have to spend a little bit of money [468] to get in they charge you on a monthly [470] or an annual basis or whatever um and [472] communities are awesome because there [473] are a group of people typically in your [475] target Niche that just talk about the [477] problems that they're facing all [478] freaking day and if you think about it [480] from your perspective as an automation [481] expert let's say it's like an agency [483] Community they do like marketing agency [484] stuff you just have an entire group of [486] people that are like your target [487] audience and all they're talking about [489] is like oh man this business process [490] sucks and oh man I'm suffering from this [492] problem and and that sort of thing it is [494] the perfect place for you to swoop in [495] solve their problems and then get [496] rewarded monetarily for it so you [498] basically have like a captive audience [499] of customers there which is awesome the [502] second is cold email and the reason why [503] Cold email is such a high leverage uh [505] lead generation method for for uh for us [507] anyway is simply because uh we get to [510] personalize a lot of the the Outreach [512] with AI like basically the fact that you [514] know how to automate stuff using Ai and [516] and no code automation tools provides a [518] tremendous leverage here because you can [519] just achieve much higher like levels of [521] personalization customization and then [522] ultimately results with C email than [524] most other people can in different [525] industries that don't know this so [527] that's a big point of Leverage there and [529] then the last is platform sales which [530] I've received some flak for in the past [532] um but let me just say um as I mentioned [534] earlier the only real thing that matters [536] here is that you make money as quickly [537] as possible worry about everything else [539] l later just make sure to acquire your [540] first customer sooner rather than later [543] the best way that I found to do this is [545] with platform cells like upwork Fiverr [547] top tow and a bunch of other ones you [549] just type in like upwork or fi or [551] Alternatives there'll be dozens the [553] reason why this is so important um is [556] because of a concept called like the [558] buying temperature like the buying [559] ladder if I were to just type like [561] ladder like an image of a [563] ladder here um the way that I think [566] about buying ladder is you know this is [569] a bunch of prospects okay there are a [571] bunch of prospects on this ladder and [572] there are prospects at different parts [574] of the ladder and the prospects that are [576] at the highest end of the ladder these [577] are people that are very easy to sell [578] the prospects are that are at the bottom [580] of the ladder are very difficult to sell [582] so basically the way the buying uh the [584] buying ladder works is let's say you're [586] selling Automation Services the people [588] at the bottom of the ladder they don't [590] know what their problem is they don't [592] know what the solution is and they don't [594] know um that you're the best pick for [596] the solution the people at the second [598] round of the ladder they know what the [599] problem is but they don't know what the [601] solution is and they don't know why [602] you're the best pick for the solution [603] the people on the next step of the [605] ladder they know what the problem is [606] they know what the solution is but they [607] don't know that you're the best pick for [608] the solution the people next up on the [610] ladder know what the problem is they [612] know what the solution is and they know [613] that you're the best pick for them on [614] the you know on on the ladder the point [617] that I'm making is basically the the the [619] more problem aware your customer is the [622] way easier it is to sell them and these [624] platforms ook five or toptw by Nature [626] only let you interface or the vast [629] majority of the customers you will [630] interface on these platforms are problem [632] aware so they already understand the [634] problem they already know the solution [636] which is that they need to hire somebody [638] and the only distinguishing factor that [639] they're making is between service [641] providers that provide that solution so [643] it's a much easier sell much much easier [645] sell than um some people that maybe [647] don't know the problems or don't know [648] the solutions and uh they're also very [650] structured which allows you just to get [651] up and running quickly and make your [652] first buck um so I I usually recommend [655] these um and I I get some Flack for it [657] sometimes because you know sometimes you [658] lose a little bit of money [659] um for marketing acquisition sometimes [661] they're expensive sometimes the clients [662] on these platforms are I never [664] cared about that the only thing I cared [665] about was making money as quickly as [666] possible and I'd recommend that you know [668] aot a lot of the people that are [670] watching this video are probably [671] suffering from the same problems that [672] I'm outlining here I'd recommend that [674] you guys um do that first the last thing [676] I want to mention is that you don't [677] actually need as much knowledge as you [678] probably think the distance between you [681] and like an automation specialist so to [683] speak it's probably realistically only [685] maybe 50 to 100 hours it's really not [687] that much if you know how to operate [688] like a computer computer if you I don't [690] know know a couple of keyboard shortcuts [692] then you stack on 50 to 100 hours of [694] learning you'll probably be fine [696] everything after that you should be [698] learning by building projects directly [699] for customers that's the only real thing [700] that matters um Building Systems for for [703] customers alleviate so much of like the [704] unconscious stuff that you know I would [707] never be able to teach you it it just [709] teaches you so much of like the the the [712] non like verbal uh knowledge here um [716] that it's it's just super super high Ry [718] and when I say 50 to 100 hours I just [720] mean that I have a YouTube tutorial um [722] up here called make.com but for people [724] who want to make real money that you can [726] take a look at um and it's probably I [728] don't know 20 or maybe maybe 30 hours [731] now realistically Jesus this playlist [733] got pretty long um but if you just watch [736] that um whole tutorial series you you'll [739] know basically everything you need to [740] know about like automation Platforms in [742] general uh and then you can actually [744] just go out there and then start selling [746] so you have all of the knowledge and the [747] tools that are available to you you [748] don't actually need much more in order [750] to get out there and and start making [752] money okay now that I've finished that [754] lengthy introduction let's actually get [756] into the road map um as I mentioned this [757] is my personal step-by-step process to [759] get to 25k a month it's not the only way [760] to get there it's just what I did uh and [763] there are many roads and paths to [764] success my patented five-step process no [767] the the five things that I did are first [769] I learned the tools of the trade then I [771] created some templates using the tools [773] of the trade that I just mentioned [775] earlier then I started generating leads [777] for my offer immediately I tried doing [779] this as quickly as humanly possible and [781] then once I acquired leads and later [782] clients I retained them by providing [785] good services and then I ascended them [786] to larger packages and these larger [788] packages um are were ultimately [791] recurring uh and then because they were [792] recurring I was able to make so much [794] money so so much faster than most other [796] people um and you know I'll go into [798] detail about each of these here I hope [800] it's clear that they're not magic uh you [802] do have to put in the work it's not like [803] you can just I don't know watch a [805] YouTube video of some guy explaining [807] things on on a slideshow and then all of [809] your your your work is going to be done [810] for you um so you do have to do a little [812] bit of work but it's actually not that [814] much work in hindsight there are way [816] worse ways to make money and there are [817] very few better ways to make money I [819] would say than this so yeah let me talk [821] a little bit about the specific steps [824] the first is to learn the tools of the [825] trade um you know if you don't know [827] anything about automation it's going to [828] be quite difficult to sell it it's also [829] going to be quite difficult to um like [831] fulfill projects uh so you know you're [833] obviously it's one thing to acquire [834] projects another thing entirely to [835] fulfill it you need to know how to do [836] both in order to scale an automation [838] business but you don't need to be that [840] competent I have a YouTube course that [842] you can watch in a couple dozen hours I [843] was very confident when I said a couple [845] dozen hours maybe it's like three dozen [846] hours I don't know um I chose all of [849] these topics specifically because I [850] wanted to give you guys a broad overview [852] of different Industries different [853] problems that these industries are [854] facing and different potential Solutions [856] and also because I wanted to make a big [858] library of um make.com blueprints [860] basically that you guys could just like [861] copy and paste and put into your own [863] business really easily um so you know a [865] lot of them are linked Down Below in um [867] like a gumroad or something like that um [869] and you know I'm giving them away for [870] free you don't need to give me any money [872] or or or whatnot I love how my [874] productivity tool rise anytime I go on [876] my own YouTube to like do work it's [877] always like are you distracted and I'm [879] like yes I'm distracted by myself uh any [882] who if you follow along and build these [885] scenarios just as I did uh you will have [887] everything that you need so the learning [888] the tools the trade you know a lot of [889] you guys have probably already watched [890] that that course or some of the videos [892] in the course if you just finish that [893] you'll know everything that you need to [894] know trust [895] me step two is uh we're going to create [897] templates now templates are simple [900] repeatable systems that get you 80% of [902] the way there as I mentioned earlier um [905] you know I have a bunch of blueprints [906] available on my YouTube videos these are [908] the sorts of blueprints that you will [909] need to be creating for yourself or I [911] mean you could just copy mine make a [912] couple of small adjustments to them but [914] these are the sorts of templates that [915] I'm talking about there are really only [918] a few like a a a preset number of [922] problems that people in your industry [923] are going to be facing they're probably [925] going to have issues with sales they're [926] probably going to have issues with [927] marketing they're probably going to have [928] issues with like Administration they're [930] probably going to have issues with [931] hiring right there are a few preset [933] problems that they're going to have and [935] then after you've created templates that [937] solve all of those problems there's [939] really not too much work left to do um [941] you can just modify these templates a [942] tiny bit per customer and this is where [945] you get the insane amount of Leverage so [947] I always say there're simple repeatable [948] systems that give you 80% of the way [949] there because um by you having 80% of [953] the work done for you your job is no [955] longer to go from Z to 100% it's to go [956] from 80% to 100% And that's 5 times [959] leverage just sort of like [960] mathematically sometimes my templates [962] get me 98% of the way there I'll get a [965] client project and the client project [966] will be to I don't know create like a [968] proposal generator system and that's one [970] of my systems right that you know it's [972] quite popular on YouTube it's one of my [973] most popular videos actually um but but [975] that's one of my very simple [976] straightforward systems and then they [978] want all the same platforms that I use [979] and I literally just copy my blueprint [980] and I paste it into their thing I make a [982] couple of adjustments for language and [984] now I have like 50 times leverage on my [986] time right now it's a project that pays [988] me $2,500 or something which maybe [991] doesn't seem like that much money up [992] front but if you consider the fact that [993] it took me an hour and a half to do it [995] from start to finish that starts being [996] very silly um and that's you know [998] ultimately the The Leverage that I'm [999] talking about now I want to talk about [1003] another thing here and that's the idea [1004] of productization um if you're [1006] unfamiliar with productization what it [1008] basically is is it's turning what is [1009] traditionally a service um and services [1011] are messy they're complicated they're [1013] difficult to scope they're really [1015] annoying to handle honestly into a [1017] simple step-by-step process process that [1019] you are packaging sort of like a like a [1021] product like a physical thing um all of [1023] the steps therein are you know laid out [1026] in advance you know exactly what you're [1027] going to do in advance you can delegate [1029] them to somebody there are standard [1030] operating procedures for everything uh [1032] you can do it for usually like a few [1033] hundred bucks of of uh of internal cost [1035] productization is like the the the [1037] process of turning the super fuzzy [1039] service provider thing into like a very [1042] simple step-by-step um step-by-step [1044] checklist essentially and that's [1046] basically what our templates are doing [1047] we're turning previously what is like [1050] sort of an ambiguous task like create me [1051] a proposal generation system it's okay [1053] well how do I do this what sort of [1054] modules am I going to use what sort of [1055] platforms I'm going to use um into just [1057] like a oneclick template that is 90% of [1059] the way there that you just then make [1060] some adjustments into and if you really [1062] want to achieve a lot of money in the [1063] service space so you got to you got to [1064] figure out productization um I talk a [1067] lot about one of my mentors and people [1070] that I look up to quite a bit um he runs [1071] a company called Fat Joe which is an a [1073] fig SEO agency and fcho is a perfect [1075] example of like product eyes service um [1077] so if you're curious about what that [1079] might look like uh you know just just [1080] check out their website check out the [1081] way that they pitch their products and [1082] frame them um and that'll that'll help [1084] you get quite a way there so anyway I [1087] mentioned that automation is high [1088] leverage because of the general template [1090] um the real benefit to this too is it [1092] allows you to deliver a very quick win [1094] very fast and so instead of it being [1096] like a project that might take you [1097] realistically like a month or something [1099] like that of like complicated it stuff [1100] before the customer sees a benefit you [1102] can realistically get the project today [1105] do a few things over the next couple of [1106] days whatever and then within maybe like [1108] a week or so have like a completed [1110] system that's very high quality that [1111] like starts delivering an Roi super fast [1113] and the benefit to that is you obviously [1115] have a much higher perceived client [1116] experience and then when the client [1117] experience is really good then they're [1119] more likely to to want to work with you [1120] again which makes them ripe for [1122] upselling them on a a longer term [1124] retainer which is what I did a lot of so [1126] a lot of the time I just have like my my [1127] first quick win my templated system [1129] which the hourly rate would be very very [1131] silly it be 500,000 $1,500 an hour um [1135] and then you know they'd be happy with [1136] it and then I'd say okay great like why [1137] don't we work together on this project [1139] um and then that would allow me to uh [1141] you know upsell them um to a monthly [1142] retainer that you know might be three4 [1144] $5,000 a month or obviously you can make [1146] a lot more money some examples of these [1148] one-click templates um my cold email [1151] lead generation system is a great [1153] example uh there are just a few [1154] automations that you know will take [1156] let's say like a cold email response [1157] dump it into a slack um obviously the [1159] the actual process of setting up a cold [1161] email system is pretty templated at this [1162] point I have a bunch of checklists for [1164] instance and you can find these [1165] everywhere automated proposal generator [1167] as I talked about earlier that's a great [1169] example of like a a one-click template [1171] one-click CRM template to the client [1172] industry maybe you're working with [1173] lawyers lawyers tend to you know have [1175] projects occur in in four or five steps [1178] you create a CRM template for those four [1180] or five steps and then you sell that CRM [1181] template sort of as your as your um [1184] system AI content generation system [1187] basically anything from any of my [1188] YouTube videos um in in the make money [1190] uh make.com before people want to make [1192] real money course um will will suffice [1195] here and basically I just recommend you [1197] you set up five don't worry too much [1198] about like you don't need a 50 or 100 or [1200] something just set up five it might take [1202] you an hour and a half and then once [1204] you've set up those five you are good [1205] and you can start selling and speaking [1208] of starting selling the next step is to [1209] start generating leads for your offer [1211] and listen if I could have put this [1212] first I absolutely would have obviously [1214] you do need to learn how to you know [1216] work with this business model and you [1217] need to set up some templates for the [1218] leverage but honestly if you could start [1220] selling from like day one uh you should [1222] and I'd highly recommend it because [1224] nothing will teach you more about how [1225] this business model Works than actually [1226] getting in front of customers as I [1227] mentioned before [1229] so to start generating leads for my [1230] offer these are sort of like the the [1231] three main steps that I'd [1233] recommend the first is to set up cold [1235] email infrastructure um which lets you [1237] test any offer with just half an hour of [1239] work cold Emil infra is incredible [1241] because it allows you to basically like [1244] oh I mean probably the simplest way to [1246] do it is it it just like it's it's like [1247] a doorway into Narnia where you now have [1249] the potential to to like uh test any [1252] offer test any product sell any service [1255] and do it all in like an [1256] hour my patented five-step process is uh [1260] to buy three domains um for instance if [1263] my domain is left click. a um I would [1265] buy three domains one like go left [1268] click.com i' usually do do always focus [1271] on com top level domains for cold email [1273] but I go like go left click.com start [1275] left click.com get left click.com then I [1277] create three mailboxes for each um a [1280] good uh Habit to do with this is to do [1282] like first name at and then first name. [1285] first letter of your last name at and [1287] then first name. last name at [1289] so that's three mailboxes per domain or [1290] nine domains total then connect them to [1292] instantly smart lead or some other cold [1294] email alternative warm up for 14 to 21 [1296] days and then just start sending I mean [1299] you know you do have a 14 to 21 Day lead [1300] time here but realistically the the [1302] actual work involved here to buy the [1303] three domains 5 minutes connect create [1305] the three mailboxes each 10 minutes [1307] connect these maybe another 15 minutes [1309] and a lot of the time these platforms [1310] just do it for you nowadays you could [1311] pay a little bit of extra money for it [1313] so like this whole process realistically [1314] might take like an hour or two of work [1316] it's very very straightforward but the [1317] second that you do that hour work and [1319] then you know you finish your warm-up [1320] you could test anything that you want in [1322] minutes because it's so fast to Source [1324] leads and then personalize them using [1325] the systems that I've shown you guys [1326] before um that is just like one of the [1328] highest leverage things that you can do [1330] and you should also always be sending [1332] constantly no matter what because having [1334] emails going out in the background um [1336] it's just like a passive revenue or [1337] passive opportunity generator for you [1339] there's basically no downside to it [1341] because the marginal cost of sending an [1342] additional email is like0 it's not like [1344] pay-per-click ads where every time [1346] somebody Clicks in your thing you'll [1347] have to pay 20 bucks it's like you spend [1348] money basically once and then just on [1350] the infrastructure which is I don't [1351] knowbe like 100 bucks a month or [1352] something very little and then it just [1354] works for you constantly non-stop in the [1356] background which is incredible so i' do [1358] that first and then I'd also join three [1360] communities in your target market what [1362] do I mean by communities well as I [1364] mentioned earlier there like groups of [1365] people that band together to talk about [1366] specific things I have a community [1368] called makemoney withm make.com [1371] here uh that's not the one I wanted to [1373] go to yeah I have a community here [1376] called makemoney withm make.com for [1377] instance and this is just a group of [1379] people that get together and talk about [1380] automation specific stuff right so this [1382] community is specifically for people [1383] that are like looking to build their [1384] automation business but there are tons [1386] of other communities out there that are [1388] for people that run legal businesses for [1390] people that run marketing agencies [1393] people that run graphic design companies [1395] right what I would do is I would uh [1398] search for the name of the niche so [1400] maybe lawyer or something and then the [1402] word Community or I'd search up graphic [1404] design company Community or whatever [1406] type of business Drop Shipping community [1409] I do it on Facebook on school on [1411] LinkedIn on Discord on slack basically [1413] on any platform out there um this isn't [1415] an exhaustive list and there are [1416] definitely some more I then join at [1418] least three of these communities and [1419] then I just make a daily habit of [1421] posting how-tos that address my market [1423] need what do I mean by this well as I [1425] mentioned earlier it's literally a group [1426] of people that band together to [1427] about their problems so just learn five [1430] or 10 of those problems and then solve [1432] five or 10 of those problems using your [1433] systems make a quick post just like hey [1435] guys I know a lot of people here are [1436] struggling from X Y and Z so I thought a [1437] little bit about system that might be [1439] able to solve it step one do this step [1441] two do this step three do this if you [1443] just do this every single day and you do [1444] this to these three communities you'll [1446] have a lot of people that are going to [1447] like your comment assuming that you know [1448] how to do it DM you um and then uh you [1451] know post a reply and all you do at that [1453] point is you just DM everybody that [1454] likes or comments on your post asking [1456] you can help and then use that as your [1458] lead generation top of funnel right set [1460] up meetings with these people and then [1461] sell them on services so that's sort of [1463] step two then step three is to create [1465] profiles on upwork uh Fiverr top talent [1467] and any other platform that you think is [1469] relevant um and this is sort of a simple [1471] three-step process I mean I make it out [1472] to be quite simple but obviously you can [1474] be as comple complex or complicated here [1476] as you want basically you just uh [1478] research all of the other freelance [1479] accounts or businesses on the platform [1481] and then dissect them try and figure out [1483] what like high earners are doing well [1484] and low earners are doing bad and then [1486] just make a list of things and make your [1487] profile better in every way you know [1489] make your photos better make your copy [1490] better make your pricing better make [1492] your offer better make your value [1494] propositions better the benefits that [1496] you write better just make it better and [1498] then a lot of these platforms like [1500] upwork for instance has a daily job [1502] application um opportunity I would just [1504] apply to 10 to 20 jobs every single day [1506] and just make sure that I do that the [1507] first thing uh when I wake up in the [1508] morning if you set up these three lead [1510] generation things realistically it might [1513] take you like five hours total to get [1515] everything done here and then there'll [1517] just be some ongoing Daily Time cost of [1519] like an hour or something maybe two [1520] hours if you do this every single day um [1523] I would be it would basically be and and [1525] you know you're not completely [1526] incompetent or I don't know you just uh [1529] you know a little bit about the industry [1530] you've watched my videos on automation [1532] it would be virtually impossible for you [1534] not to get your first customer within a [1535] couple of weeks I might go as far as to [1537] say within a week and there are many [1538] such examples of this in my community um [1541] the second that people have these three [1542] lead generation methods set up their top [1544] of funneling it's so huge so [1545] ridiculously packed that they're having [1546] at least a meeting a day um and it [1548] becomes the highest Roi part of their [1550] day so you know this is really the juice [1553] here start generating the leads for your [1554] offer and this really applies not just [1556] for automation businesses but for most [1557] service or agency based businesses so [1560] maybe if you are a graphic designer just [1561] watching this for shits and giggles or [1562] because you think that I have a nice uh [1564] I don't know an extremely rugged [1566] handsome [1568] jawline then this is uh this is the same [1570] process that you can apply on your end [1572] in order to achieve what you want to [1573] achieve the last step here is to retain [1576] and Ascend your clients and this is sort [1578] of like uh you know retaining and and [1580] ascending like what exactly does that [1581] mean retaining just means when you get a [1583] project from a client that you didn't [1585] necessarily have to pay to acquire [1586] anymore so if you spend a little bit of [1589] money let's say on your cold email [1590] system for the very first um client and [1593] then you acquired that client you [1594] technically paid a little bit of like [1595] like you paid money for that if you paid [1597] like $200 and you paid I don't know two [1599] hours of your time to get that client [1601] you could figure out like a monetary [1603] cost and that cost there is the cost per [1605] acquisition um to retain a client just [1607] means to get another project from that [1608] client without having to pay additional [1610] cost per acquisition and you can imagine [1612] how this is basically like where all of [1613] the leverage in this business model is [1615] if you retain a client you're no longer [1616] paying that onetime cost of like the [1618] upward connects or the the cold email [1620] time and energy or the money or the time [1622] you're spending messaging people in [1623] communities um you basically paay that [1625] money once and then they just come back [1627] to you for more right and that's that's [1630] very valuable ascending your clients [1632] just means uh when you start somebody on [1633] a lower package and then you increase [1635] their commitment with you and move them [1636] to a higher package and it's similar to [1638] retention except Ascension um in [1640] addition to getting another project for [1641] them you actually increase the price [1642] that they're paying you for and usually [1644] concent the the responsibilities is in [1646] your end so retention in a ition are [1648] very very important and um understanding [1650] these will will help you make a ton of [1651] money the reason why is because the vast [1653] majority of like actual like if you [1655] think about like gross revenue in this [1657] industry is not in one-time projects [1659] it's in recurring relationships I have [1661] tons of examples of quite lucrative [1663] clients that started with a 1K project [1666] um but then when I counted up how much [1667] money they paid me over the course of [1668] the year because I transitioned them to [1669] a recurring relationship it was over [1671] $50,000 so to start with like a 1K foot [1674] in the door thing and then ultimately [1675] make over $50,000 on a clan is pretty [1677] sick right uh I even remember this one [1680] guy from upwork where I think his [1681] project was less than five or maybe $500 [1684] or something like that and that guy [1685] ended up paying me over $4,000 per month [1688] every month for for quite a while you [1690] know $500 to $4,000 that that's a ton of [1693] money right if you think about like my [1695] margins on a $500 project maybe if it [1697] cost me like $100 to acquire um I spent [1699] 20% on the first on the first [1701] acquisition but then 100 and let's just [1703] say I made $20,000 off him that's less [1706] than like 05% which is ridiculous [1708] so the margins um on on on on your [1711] marketing just become stupid if you get [1712] people in recurring I mentioned here [1714] that if you want to achieve that goal at [1716] 25,000 a month you really don't need [1717] that much you just need a few um five [1719] clients at $50,000 per year plus $50,000 [1722] from onetime projects equates to $25,000 [1725] a month annualized which is super easy [1727] to do some months you'll probably do a [1728] little more maybe one month you'll have [1730] like a 35k month and then the other [1731] month you might have a 15K a month uh it [1733] just depends on how consistent these [1734] clients are with you obviously but to [1736] actually achieve the $25,000 month [1738] anyway is not not very difficult at all [1740] the work that you're doing for these [1741] clients on recurring a retainer [1743] relationship I mean it's it's basically [1744] up to you uh the way that a lot of [1746] people will pitch this to start and the [1747] way that I pitched mine to start was I [1748] just pitch it as an alternative to [1749] working with me on an hourly basis I had [1751] some hourly basis of like [1753] $110 an hour or something and I said hey [1756] you want to work uh longterm if you do [1758] I'll give you 20 hours and 90 bucks an [1760] hour instead and so in that way I was [1762] able to you know lock in a much higher [1764] quote unquote package price but I was [1766] able to do it um by also providing them [1768] an incentive to want to work with me [1769] which was a discount what I'll find in [1771] this industry is very few people [1772] actually count the hours very few people [1774] care as long as you're delivering value [1776] so do with that what you will um I've [1777] since transitioned to a model that [1779] doesn't really require hours at all or I [1781] basically just very transparent about [1782] the fact that like hey guys this is a [1783] very high leverage industry and the [1784] thing that matters to me isn't how much [1786] time I spend working on a project but [1787] how much value I provide to you at the [1788] end of it all it's like that old plumber [1790] analogy where a woman has some big leak [1792] and then a plumber comes over he makes [1794] one knock for 5 seconds and then says [1796] that'll be $500 and the project is is [1798] completed and the woman's like how the [1799] hell why would I pay you $500 for 5 [1802] minutes or 5 Seconds um and then he says [1804] you're not paying me for this time that [1806] I'm spending right now you're paying me [1807] for all the time and energy that I spent [1808] learning how to do that knock which you [1810] know I've done over the course of the [1811] last five [1812] years last thing I'll mention there is [1814] that uh yeah it's it's very high [1815] retention because it's very sticky you [1818] get your fingers in basically every part [1819] of the pot once you run every aspect of [1821] a person's business when you run their [1823] hiring when you run their sales when you [1825] run their lead generation when all the [1826] systems depend on you most business [1829] owners would be stupid to say hm that [1831] new guy over there that you know he [1833] charges me $10 an hour less maybe I'll [1835] work with him instead and this is a big [1837] problem in the service industry um [1838] people are always you know pining for [1840] the best deal in automation at least [1842] from my experience you don't really have [1844] that because people aren't really [1845] willing to deal with a downside of [1846] letting you go in order to um acquire [1849] somebody else that might be a little bit [1850] marginally cheaper this also gives you a [1852] ton of Leverage if we were purely evil [1854] here you're running basically every [1855] aspect of somebody's business means that [1857] you have a lot of Leverage you get [1858] increased prices whenever you want [1860] there's very little that they could do [1861] with it I don't really encourage you to [1863] be evil or super Mony Alan like that [1865] because this will eventually bite you in [1867] the ass and ruin your reputation and I [1869] always care more about like the [1869] long-term money than the short-term [1871] money um but you know some people are [1873] going to see that as a benefit so I [1874] figured I might as well point that [1876] out okay the second last thing that I'm [1878] going to mention is you can actually do [1880] all of what I've mentioned today uh [1882] yourself um or with a very small team so [1885] I managed the $25,000 a month with just [1887] one virtual assistant um it was just a [1890] bunch of like silly little minor tasks [1891] they weren't extraordinarily utilized [1893] either it's not like I was intelligent [1894] about the work that I was assigning to [1895] them or anything like that um and then [1897] as I mentioned my uh my best uh month [1900] was over $70,000 net um which was just [1903] very stupid there's also a very high [1905] margin industry if you do things most of [1907] the stuff yourself obviously because of [1908] the leverage um you know I every [1910] originally get margins of over 90% on [1912] this work granted I'm still doing it [1913] myself right but because it's so high [1915] leverage I really don't mind putting in [1916] an hour or two every day in order to [1918] like make sure these projects are taken [1919] care of if I get to make $70,000 you [1921] know I'm obviously pretty happy with [1922] that my next goal is to scale from the [1925] $70,000 and I would eventually like to [1927] make about $2 million a year um net [1929] profit um I don't know if I'll exactly [1931] be able to do that using this business [1933] model because you do eventually cap in [1935] terms of what you are capable of doing [1936] yourself um but that's a conversation [1938] for another day um considering making [1940] videos on you know how to scale past [1942] $25,000 a month so if you're interested [1943] in that just drop a comment down below [1945] and let me [1946] know the very last thing that I'm going [1948] to say here is um if you are here and [1951] you've made it to the end of this 35ish [1953] minute video or so start now um don't [1957] wait if you want to do this know that [1960] this isn't like a big ask you could [1962] actually do all of this stuff probably [1963] within a few hours if you already know [1965] automation then you don't even need to [1968] do that first step which is to you know [1969] learn the tools to trade and [1971] additionally if you're smart um about [1973] how you approach this stuff you can save [1975] so much time like I I took you know [1977] three months to get to $25,000 a month [1979] you don't have to take three months you [1980] could realistically do this in one month [1981] if you follow this road map and you were [1983] very smart about it you can start [1985] selling automations literally tomorrow [1987] if you think about it I mean how long [1988] does it take to I don't know join some [1990] communities make some posts and DM some [1992] people you know if you're constantly bu [1993] your computer and if you're active and [1994] if you're committed to it if you put in [1996] like 8 10 12h hour days for the first [1998] bit you could actually start making [1999] money like in a couple of days it's [2001] really not that big of a deal obviously [2002] there are some minor more logistical [2004] things that are brushed over here like [2005] setting up a payment processor setting [2007] up maybe like a business uh website sort [2009] of like your business card online um [2010] stuff like that but the reason why I [2012] didn't mention it because this stuff's [2013] like super low leverage it's not super [2014] important what's more important is that [2016] you just get up and running talking to [2017] customers and you can worry about all [2019] that after if somebody says yes to [2020] you well then you can worry about the [2022] payment processor right and on that note [2025] I just want to talk about um one last [2027] concept which is the figure it out once [2029] you've got it concept I heard this first [2031] from Grant Cardone um who now I don't [2034] actually find super valuable but when I [2036] was you know first get starting business [2038] I thought he was the bees nie and he had [2040] this great quote and I forget what it [2041] was but it was basically like figure [2043] figure it out once you get it don't [2044] worry about it all until you actually [2046] get it um so he was talking about some [2048] examples where he was like I don't know [2050] he was being flown all over the world [2051] for some TV interview or something like [2053] that maybe some TV show and then he [2056] would sell the person on the idea of [2058] this TV show before he had any of the [2060] stuff dealt with for the TV show and the [2062] second that he got it the fact that he [2064] got it was motivation enough to go and [2065] actually finish it what I mean mean by [2068] that is like he would sell this big TV [2069] package or whatever he was doing at the [2070] time and then when the person was like [2072] yeah sure I'll do it you know let's [2073] shake hands on it and then let's sign [2074] the paperwork and I'll send you the [2075] money that to him was like oh now [2078] I'm locked in now I have to figure it [2080] out I have no choice and that sort of [2083] mindset is stayed with me for quite a [2084] while even if you're not 100% on any of [2086] this stuff if you're not an automation [2087] professional Lord knows if you sold [2090] somebody in a project and they said yes [2091] to you and you have their money in your [2093] pocket you're going to find a way to [2094] figure it out because you have to you [2096] know if you're conscien you're [2098] intelligent if you're ambitious like [2099] most the people that are watching this [2100] video that are somehow on YouTube [2102] instead of watching cat pick they're [2103] watching a video on how some guy got to [2105] $25,000 a month so obviously you're you [2106] know pre-selecting for conscientiousness [2108] if you're that kind of person um you're [2110] not going to you're not just going to [2113] let something like that slide right [2114] you're going to provide um you're going [2117] to provide like uh like work ethic in [2120] direct relation thank you thumbs up to [2122] the responsibility that you've taken on [2124] and you know by by getting somebody's [2126] money you've taken on a lot of [2127] responsibility [2128] so yeah that's uh that's just to figure [2130] it out once you got a concept the last [2131] thing I'll say is good luck uh I'm [2133] really excited to hear how things go if [2136] anybody here was on the fence about [2137] automation or maybe starting this sort [2139] of business model saw this video and [2141] said this is what I'm going to do [2142] from now on i' be really really curious [2144] to hear how it goes if you could provide [2145] me some updates down below leave a [2147] comment on you know what you're going to [2148] do how you're going to do it um what you [2150] think about this video more generally [2152] I'd absolutely love to see it otherwise [2154] if you guys could just please do that [2155] fun YouTube stuff um like subscri [2157] subscribe and if you guys have any [2158] questions drop it down below and I'll be [2159] more than happy to answer thanks so much [2161] for taking the time looking forward to [2162] talking to you guys again bye-bye

Title: How I'd Automate a Plumbing Company in 15 Steps (AI & More)
[0] hey everybody Nick here and in this [1] video I'm going to show you exactly how [3] I would automate my Plumbing business if [5] I ran one I've worked with probably [7] three dozen local service businesses [9] over the course of the last couple years [10] uh Plumbing being uh one of them and [13] what I've decided to do is to create a [14] video series where I basically go from [16] top to bottom and show people exactly [18] what I would do in their shoes the goal [20] being at the end of this video you will [22] get a giant whimsicle with a list of [24] steps that you could take to start [26] automating your business and taking [27] advantage of some of the really cool [28] technologies that are available to us [30] like AI automation chat gbt and that [32] sort of thing so if you've never used [34] whimsicle before what this is is this is [36] called a mind map and I use this mind [38] map just as a visual representation of [40] my ideas I'm going to make a couple more [42] edits to this I mean I've already done [43] most of the heavy lifting here but I'm [44] going to make a couple more edits to [46] this and then talk you guys through um [48] basically every step and at the end of [49] it you will know what you need to do in [51] order to make way more money uh by [54] leveraging your time more effectively [56] and you'll see that there's a very [57] common thread between all of these uh [59] different steps and different things [60] that you can automate and that's [62] ultimately just multiplying your [63] leverage uh technology you know we we [65] like to talk all day about how technolog [68] is taking over our lives and stuff like [69] that and I think to some extent it is [71] but you can use technology intelligently [73] to work for you and that's what uh [75] basically my whole YouTube channel is [76] about about how to best apply human [78] leverage to points that technology [80] cannot currently do for you um while [82] letting technology take care of all the [83] rest of the stuff that's like really low [85] leverage or really low Roi or really [86] pointless so yeah I don't run a plumbing [89] business but I've worked with a few and [91] I've worked with many just like General [93] local service businesses so um [95] regardless of of you know whether you're [96] an HVAC company or whether you're I [99] don't know even if you're like in a [100] wedding photography business a lot of [101] what I want to talk about here applies [102] to you too okay so the very first thing [105] that I would to focus on automating is [107] project management basically so much of [110] a business um so much of the time and [112] energy that you spend on a business is [113] time and energy that you are currently [115] wasting on silly unimportant project [118] management tasks that a project [120] management system if you just set it up [121] right like literally once um can just do [124] for you forever and so what I mean by [127] this is you know you get a new Plumbing [128] inquiry you usually have to like you [130] know keep track of the job you got to [132] know when your employees are taking off [134] or if you're hiring subcontractors when [135] you're subcontracted plumbers are going [137] out there uh you got to be able to [138] schedule them you got to be able to do [140] shift assignments you got to be able to [141] track the time you know there there's a [143] lot that basically um the average [146] service business owner especially in [147] plumbing needs to keep track of at the [149] back of their head and unfortunately the [150] vast majority of them just do it all [151] through email so it's 2024 um let's put [154] the email away and let's start using [155] like you know dedicated project managers [157] to do most of that for us um my [160] recommendation is that you use a project [161] management system like clickup clickup [164] is just one of many there are probably [165] 20 or 30 different ones you could use [167] some of which are actually dedicated [168] specifically for plumbing and so out of [170] the box are sort of put together I [172] prefer clickup just because it's a lot [173] more automatable and if you want to get [175] into using AI for stuff later on down [176] the line uh clickup is very very [178] powerful for it but what I'll clickup [180] really looks like is I'll give you an [182] example here from my content writing [184] business it's just like a big pipeline [187] essentially where are we [189] here uh it's just a big pipeline [191] basically where like a new job will come [194] in and then you will assign the job to a [197] particular person you will have statuses [199] that reflect where your job is in your [201] pipeline you'll have dates and times [203] that maybe subcontractors are sent out [205] you have a way to track the time and [206] that sort of thing and then you get to [207] customize all the stuff for you so like [209] you can every single column here you [211] don't really have to worry too much [212] about um uh it not being set up right [214] out of the box for you because you can [216] just change it however you want the [218] benefit of this is this ends up being [220] your single source of Truth in a service [221] business and the second you have a [223] single source of Truth you can automate [224] the hell out of your company you can [226] generate automatic assets generate [228] proposals generate quote forms generate [230] PDFs you could create invoices [232] automatically uh you can store all of [234] your communic with a client there using [236] like email Integrations so that every [237] time that they send you an email or you [238] receive an email it's like embedded in [240] the thread um you can do so much and I I [243] would recommend you guys if you guys are [245] always feeling disorganized always [246] feeling behind that you just get on [247] project management of some of some kind [249] because it just eliminates 99% of the [251] issue anytime you're sharing information [253] between people um and in a business you [255] should basically be using a project [257] manager so once you have a project [258] management system set up um what I would [260] then focus on is streamlining the [262] appointment scheduling or booking [263] process however much you can and the two [265] biggest levers that I would say for this [267] are appointment scheduling and then [269] reminders and the good news is just like [271] clickup was sort of a solution to the [273] previous problem there are a few [274] platforms here that basically solve [276] appointment scheduling and appointment [277] reminders just out of the box you know [279] as a plumbing business you usually get [280] two kinds of bookings uh the first are [282] emergency bookings and the second are uh [284] sort of like I'm just going to say [287] regular bookings or maybe you can book [288] somebody like a week or two out [289] depending on availability um the main [292] issue with appointment scheduling [293] especially for that second Camp is it's [295] just like really laborious um if you [297] think about the okay they're two issues [300] the first is that um sometimes let's say [302] you have a secretary or somebody in your [304] in your office that's just like your [305] office manager that takes these calls or [306] maybe it's just you uh you know the [309] conversation usually goes like hey how's [310] it going um you know I need X Y andz [312] service done okay great like you know [314] maybe you're you're quoting process is [316] already done maybe you do it just over [317] the phone right then and there how much [319] this is how much okay great that sounds [320] good to me um can we book in sometime [322] next week okay what days you available [324] next week Monday and Saturday okay well [326] I have Monday after 1 H I can't do after [328] 1 I can do before 12:30 [330] this is just complete unnecessary [332]  basically and it's a a total [334] and utter waste of time we've already [335] solved the appointment scheduling [337] process like 10 times over and you just [338] use a calendar service instead so what I [341] would do is I would sign up to either [342] cenly cal.com or an alternative maybe [345] something specific to H um Plumbing or [347] HVAC or local service businesses that do [349] these sorts of things um and then I [352] would uh just send out the link probably [353] through SMS um unless you're [355] communicating with them over email and I [357] do it just while I was right there on [358] the call with them so i' have have like [359] a clipboard on my phone or my office [361] manager would anyway and then anytime [363] somebody is calling and it's like hey [364] this sounds great uh what I would do is [366] I would go to that contact and then I [367] would just send them the calendar [368] booking link and I'd say okay great just [370] sent you over a calendar booking link do [371] you mind booking right now and this just [372] has all of our availability for the next [374] month and then voila you know you turned [376] in this laborious process where there's [378] a lot of opportunity and room for error [380] into one where just both parties know [382] that they're available at such and such [383] time and it's basically like perfect [384] every time which is great so this is [387] basically a solved problem [389] um and the cool part is every time you [390] get a booking you can then integrate it [392] with your project management system and [394] you can create you know a new record in [395] your project manager basically that [397] represents the booking that has the [398] start time end time the address the [399] person all that stuff okay reminders for [402] customers this is in the same vein U but [404] essentially most calendar Services [405] nowadays have reminders built in um and [408] what a reminder is is like let's say you [409] book a 100 appointments or 100 calls um [412] like 100 service calls like maybe 10% of [414] them are just not going to be there or [416] there'll just be some miscommunication [418] and you know the customer won't be home [419] when they say they would what reminders [420] allow you to do is basically avoid this [422] from ever happening again so you don't [423] have to pay your subcontract [424] subcontractor costs you don't have to [426] pay hourly plumber costs you don't have [427] to do any of that stuff uh if the person [429] isn't there they're going to let you [430] know ahead of time and so the way this [433] works usually is they just have these [435] really shitty templated messages that [436] are like service reminder for X date um [440] and then the customer sees it and it's [441] like all right yeah yeah and then that's [442] how they're reminded but what I would [444] actually do is I'd go one step further [445] instead of like using the default [446] service reminders for Kenley or cal.com [448] or whatever I'd make my my own and the [450] way that I do it is I would try and [451] customize it and make it seem like I [453] just wrote this for them just to double [454] check that you know I'm everything is [456] good with the appointment and a very [458] simple language shift is just pretend [460] that you're talking to the dude next to [461] you with the bar as opposed to like you [462] know having a formal business [463] communicate um you could very quickly [465] set up an Automation and a lot of this [467] is built in as I mentioned where you [468] just say hey first name just letting you [470] know that we'll be there tomorrow at [471] blank time as discussed thanks and then [474] whatever your name is um this usually [476] leads to just much better reviews much [477] better client experience uh you know [479] from like a reputation POV is just way [481] better so I would do that wherever [482] possible but at the least you need to [484] have some type of service reminder and [485] you can do the service reminder however [487] you want um I I would just make sure to [489] like have at least one but if I were [490] like to do this like perfectly optimally [492] I'd probably have a service reminder for [493] a week out if you booked it over a week [494] out um a day before and then I'd have it [497] like a couple of hours before before [498] your plumber or whatever actually takes [500] off and this way if they have any issues [503] you'll know ahead of time before you [504] actually spend that sunk time energy and [505] cost uh you'll get to save time energy [508] and money and then your your mer will go [510] up a little bit also your customers will [512] just like it they appreciate it no more [513] misunderstandings about dates or [515] whatever okay so sales this is probably [517] one of the big ones um but in order for [520] that to go well you need these which is [522] why I put this [523] forth basically um the name of the game [526] that a lot of service providers I think [527] don't fully understand is um the the [529] idea of like Leverage multiplication and [532] so what multiplication of your leverages [534] is it's just like hey like if I spend [536] five minutes doing something and then I [537] get one unit of output um you know if I [542] have like a 3X multiplier on that then [543] if I spend 5 minutes I get three units [545] of output if I have a 50 times [546] multiplier it's 5 minutes and 50 units [548] of output and basically your goal is to [550] multiply your leverage however possible [551] and whenever possible and in sales there [553] are a couple really easy ways to do this [555] the first is um focusing on acquisition [557] methods that by default multiply your [559] leverage what I mean by this I mean [561] paperclick um ads uh bark.com is a [564] really big one I'll run you through that [566] right now umal these are all services [568] that you basically have a sunk cost [570] usually like once or maybe like once a [571] month or something and then you get to [573] benefit from that cost every single time [575] that somebody calls you it realistically [577] might take you or somebody in your [578] company like an hour to make an ad but [581] then that ad might get you 15 calls or [584] something like that um if you think [585] about like the the other ways that you [587] could acquire those calls I mean like [588] back in the day back when I was working [589] B2B which doesn't really super apply [591] here but I had to go cold calling I had [593] to go door knocking right and I'd knock [595] on God 80 doors a day in order to get a [597] few appointments it was brutal that that [599] took me all 8 to 9 hours of my day to to [601] to get the appointment right these [603] systems basically just advertise for you [605] to people that are already looking for [606] services and thus you could spend one [608] hour one day setting it up and then [610] benefit from it for the next six months [612] that's hyper leverage and it allows you [613] to use your time on things that are more [615] important anyway bark.com is basically [617] um paperclick ads but it's one that a [619] lot of people don't know about I I use [621] this when I ran my own videography [622] company and basically anytime somebody [624] was interested in videography within my [626] region which at the time was Vancouver I [627] could buy that lead for I think like 20 [629] or 30 bucks so services like bark.com [632] and they're a bunch they're basically [633] lead aggregators um I would try using [635] these I'd try using paperclick ads I [637] tried using SEO um you know and I just [640] focus on these as my lead generation [642] methods because uh again they they [643] multiply your time now in terms of what [645] to do when somebody's actually generated [647] when a new lead calls you know if I were [649] setting up my own plumbing company I [651] would ask them for all of the specific [653] info that I need before the end of the [654] call and I'd like go like ahead of time [656] I'd make a list of all the that I [657] need from them so realistically you're [659] going to need their address if it's a [660] house call you're going to need their [661] first name their last name you're going [663] to need their phone number you should [664] also have their email to send them [666] receipts invoices communicate that way [668] and then maybe you'll need some more [669] information about the specifics of their [670] problem like a on line description or [672] whatever um the reason why I'd make this [674] list ahead of time is so that I could [676] then create a form and then while I'm on [678] the call with the customer what I would [680] do is I would say hey okay great let me [681] just get your info into the system here [683] what was your first name what was your [684] last name what was all this stuff [686] because then now you can add them into [687] your project management system and as I [689] mentioned earlier the second that [690] they're in your project management [691] system you can automate the hell out of [692] it what I would do is I would use all of [694] this information to template out a quote [696] and I would send it to them immediately [698] over SMS so that they could see it while [700] they're on the call with me um you can [702] do this using a variety of platforms you [704] do this using pandadoc if you wanted to [706] you could do this using another five [708] million like proposal automation [710] platforms but just type in pandadoc or [712] pandadoc alternative and you'll find a [713] bunch um you could also look up like [714] plumber proposal system or something and [716] there'll probably be a few and then [719] basically what what they do is they just [720] look at it while they're on the call [721] with you and if they agree to it they [723] click a button they maybe do some [724] signature analog with their thumb um and [727] then you can tie that into them having a [728] calendar booking and just dealing with [729] all that immediately ahead of time [731] and not having to worry about the back [732] and forth and not having to worry about [733] the follow-up not having to worry about [734] like 99% of the issues that usually [736] plague the sales process in your average [737] plumbing company uh so you you can do [740] this very easily you don't need to be a [741] no code or automation Pro in order to do [743] so um but you know this ties in with the [745] calendar system that I mentioned earlier [747] and then the calendar system um feeds [749] into the project management system I [750] mentioned earlier as well and this is [752] just the way that like a modern plumbing [753] company would do it okay then we go to [756] customer billing and invoicing uh what I [758] would do is I would like stop using [760] payment processors that like uh a lot of [763] the time local service businesses have [765] specific payment processors that they [766] use because it saves them a tiny bit of [767] money like uh I don't know it charges [769] them 2% instead of 3% or something I [772] would I would just use stripe stripe is [773] just the simplest and easiest to [775] integrate um payment management platform [777] out there it's usually for internet [778] businesses but but um stripe for for [780] in-person businesses makes perfect sense [782] as well and uh the reason why I would [784] use it is so that I can automatically [785] invoice people so when my project [787] management system has statuses and one [789] of those statuses changes to job done I [791] would then automatically use the [792] customer information that I have on that [794] person's file to send them um a stripe [796] invoice to their address that would then [798] be due today the next day or whatever [800] your payment terms are and then when [802] somebody pays then I would change the [803] status of the record to like you know a [805] payment received or payment completed [808] that way at a glance anybody in your [809] company would be able to see in seconds [812] what payments are still outstanding and [813] then if you have like a salesperson or [815] if you're I don't know sufficiently [817] motivated to do it yourself you now know [818] who to follow up with so you can get [820] your money you can obviously do those [821] follow-ups automatically by the way and [823] you probably should be striped as that [824] by itself um but yeah you know very [827] simple and transparent way to do things [828] and the cool benefit there uh as well is [830] then you can start tracking this data [832] adding it to dashboards and visualizing [833] your Revenue cash collected your margins [835] that sort of [836] stuff okay subcontractor billing an [838] invoice this is pretty similar um I mean [840] I said subcontractor here but really I [842] should have said like staff or payroll [844] or whatever um you know for in-house [845] employees you're going to want to use a [846] payroll platform that's already [848] developed for you so I don't know [849] payroll platform here there's like 20 [851] probably uh you could use QuickBooks if [853] you want a deal is very popular ripling [855] is reasonably popular Gusto I didn't [857] know they had a payment platform [858] associated with them but they probably [859] do uh if you're in Canada you know use [861] wage Point that's probably the most [863] popular one if you're doing [866] subcontractors basically every time they [867] finish a job uh you can automatically [870] send them a templated invoice um that [873] they can then sign off on and then when [874] they sign off on it you could send them [876] money uh there are a variety of ways [878] that you could do this but basically I'm [879] just trying to approach this from like a [880] highest Ry perspective working my way [882] down um staff billing and stuff is such [884] a pain in the ass most plumbing [886] companies and local services companies [887] that I know of actually have full [888] departments that they call their Finance [890] or accounting department that deal with [892] this how cool would it be if you could [893] just do it all automatically and [895] eliminate your department entirely or at [897] least instead of having three people uh [899] have like one person that's at least [900] $100,000 a year in your pocket and in [903] addition to that you're probably going [904] to get paid more often and more on time [905] because you're now sending and receiving [906] funds immediately as opposed to Super [908] delayed so yeah I do that um social [912] media marketing and stuff like that I [913] don't really care too much about social [914] media marketing with them honest I think [915] social media marketing is kind of [916]  uh for most businesses but what [919] what it does do is it it shows [921] prospective customers that you are a [922] real company and a lot of the time [923] people just need that in order to feel [925] safe and secure and actually want to [926] work with you so it's not like going to [928] change a game you're probably not going [929] to get too many Plumbing customers that [930] are like hm that plumbing company has [932] great design on their canva thumbnails [935] or something but uh you will get a [938] little bit of perceived legitimacy and [939] that's what matters so what I would do [941] is I would just have somebody on my team [942] like an office admin create 30 posts a [944] month using Ai and then I'd cycle them [945] using a tool like buffer which just [947] allows you to schedule your posts a [948] buffer is pretty cool because it um [950] allows you to go I think like a year out [952] or something but basically it's a way [954] that you just you know add your images [956] and design and the the text and whatnot [957] and then you can just schedule it for [959] next week let's say which is pretty [962] cool [963] okay um customer feedback collection [966] review management um on the same vein as [968] social media one of the number one [969] places people will go uh before they [971] they decide to work with you especially [973] if you're like a physical business where [974] people will like see the service [976] provider face to face shake their hands [978] and walk them through a job is uh is [980] your reviews Google my business reviews [982] your Yelp reviews your Facebook reviews [984] your um you know trust pilot reviews [987] that sort of thing and so a very simp [988] simple and easy way to solve this not [990] completely obviously like to solve it [992] you would just want to do an amazing job [993] every time which you're unable to always [994] do but a great way to like mostly take [997] care of this is use your project [998] management system and whenever a project [1000] is marked as completed um send the [1003] person a request through SMS or email [1005] and basically just ask them for an [1006] honest review on one of your social [1008] media platforms and then imply or you [1011] could just say directly although I think [1013] that's against the terms of service for [1014] a few of these platforms that they get a [1016] discount if they um if they fill out [1018] like an honest review uh if they want [1021] the discount then they're going to want [1022] to automatically work with you anyway so [1024] if they want to work with you anyway [1025] odds are they're happy with the [1027] job um and then you know the review [1029] you're going to get it's going to be [1030] amazing um and then you could also gate [1032] this based off how the subcontractor [1033] felt about the job or your um your your [1035] plumber felt about the job you could ask [1037] your plumber or something and say like [1038] hey like did that person like the work [1039] that they got where they angry at you if [1041] their answer is no you could like have [1042] them fill out some other column in your [1044] project manager and then trigger this [1045] whole flow uh but yeah this basically [1047] just ensures that you're always going to [1048] have like roster of constantly cycling [1050] reviews you could feed this into like [1052] some SMS sequence something like active [1054] campaign to like make sure that they [1055] leave a review but it's not super [1056] important just make sure that like you [1058] know 20% of the people that you work [1059] with leave a review and you'll probably [1060] be fine okay data entry and [1063] recordkeeping this is again another one [1064] of those really big annoying things and [1066] a lot of the time like plumbers or local [1068] service businesses will literally hire [1069] somebody to do this for them like [1071] your whole job for I don't know usually [1074] like two or three k a month like $36,000 [1076] a year is just to like make sure your [1078] data is good uh if you just use clickup [1080] or some centralized project manager for [1082] everything out of the gate um you're [1084] you're fine and most of this is going to [1085] be taken care of for you um you just add [1088] all of the info using a form just make [1090] sure that you know if you want to add [1091] info to your system use a form what do I [1093] mean by this let's say you got a new [1094] employee or a new staff member um the [1097] staff member has to fill out a form and [1098] that form will ask them all the [1100] information that you need in order to [1101] make sure that they're paid on time and [1103] that they're now added to your system [1104] stuff like um you know their their home [1107] address their bank account information [1109] their first name last name the social [1110] insurance number employee identification [1112] number whatever it's called wherever you [1113] live um maybe every time you get a sales [1115] call as I mentioned you'd have a form [1117] that allows you to input their [1118] information in um basically just make [1121] sure the way that you communicate with [1122] your system is through forms the reason [1124] why is because forms um you can make [1125] fields are required in forms um and then [1129] using the required form data um you then [1133] have all the information that you need [1135] there's no like missing data in your [1136] system so uh whoever fills out the form [1138] it's their job to get the data right [1140] then and there you don't need like a [1141] separate high or a separate role for [1143] that which is sort of a pain in the ass [1145] all right so Inventory management for [1147] parts and supplies this honestly doesn't [1148] apply to most Plumbing businesses [1150] probably the vast majority of businesses [1151] that are watching this to be honest it's [1152] not going to apply for you but I thought [1153] I'd throw it in anyway the vast majority [1156] of like local service businesses will do [1158] just in time order management or when um [1161] an order comes in and the order involves [1162] like a specific part or something like [1164] that they will then go ahead and buy it [1165] right then and there and then there's [1167] usually some lead time on the order [1169] coming from the manufacturer maybe like [1170] a week or something like that uh and the [1172] the downside there is obviously the [1174] customers to wait more but the upside on [1175] your end is like you don't spend money [1177] that you don't necessarily have yet [1178] which is like a win um but if you scale [1181] up or if you find that the vast majority [1183] of your jobs are coming from a very [1184] particular service like I don't know [1187] what any Plumbing tool is but let's say [1190] it's like a pipe fitting it's like a [1191] very specific pipe fitting and you work [1193] in an area where like most of the homes [1196] had these pipe fittings installed like [1197] 40 years ago and this is like the end of [1199] their lifespan so a lot of them are [1200] screwing up and breaking um you know you [1202] could buy a bunch of these ahead of time [1204] um so that when you get a call you can [1206] one of your value propositions can now [1208] be um hey I can go do that call in the [1210] next three days instead of like two [1211] weeks right which will then obviously [1213] make you seem better and uh will [1215] increase demand for you it'll help you [1217] stand out the market essentially because [1218] turnaround time for local service [1220] businesses is one of the main value [1221] props it's like hey I can do this for [1222] you today right that's pretty big a lot [1224] of the time people are calling a plumber [1226] it's because they need a plumber not [1227] just because they think a plumber is [1228] nice to have [1229] this also allows you to anticipate [1230] demand like if it's a seasonal thing [1233] every season X problem happens in your [1235] area so you just know okay well why [1237] don't I have a few of these things on [1238] hand um basically how most plumbing [1240] companies do inventory management is [1242] they just like I don't know they have [1243] like some office with like a bunch of [1244] tiny little bims bins with fittings and [1246] parts and like that and uh they [1248] don't really keep track of like how much [1249] they have they just sort of like eye it [1251] and when it gets to like zero left over [1254] they'll um like when they no parts in [1255] the box or bin or whatever they'll like [1256] go buy a bunch more um but you can use [1259] an inventory management platform [1260] assuming you're at that size like sortly [1262] or like service Titan or like one of the [1264] other ones um that are pretty big uh and [1267] these will basically make it so that [1269] whatever the number in the computer is [1270] is the piece of inventory that's that's [1272] in your back end and you can integrate [1274] it with the project management system [1275] that I talked about earlier or you know [1276] if you wanted to really nerd out you [1277] could just build your own inventory [1279] management system but I I wouldn't [1280] really recommend it so most of you will [1283] not um have to deal with that most of [1285] that probably won't apply but I just [1286] wanted to put that in there for [1287] companies that may be a little bit [1288] bigger or might have specific use cases [1290] that I hadn't considered okay so [1292] automated follow-ups and service [1293] requests and completed jobs um one of [1295] the number one issues with local service [1297] businesses especially plumbers is uh [1300] they leave so much money on the table by [1302] not like following up or checking in on [1303] the client X weeks or X months after um [1307] you know when I purchased my apartment [1310] uh my real estate agent um sorry not [1313] when I purchased my apartment when I [1314] helped my parents sell their apartment [1317] um my real estate I had a couple real [1319] estate agents my the real estate agent [1321] that I recommended to them so I referred [1323] one of my friends he um is is very [1325] famous in the town that my parents sold [1328] their apartment for like once a year um [1330] baking a bunch of pies and then handing [1332] them out and I think it's him and his [1333] wife that bake the pies and they hand [1335] them out like to people there in person [1337] uh and you would not believe the amount [1339] of business that this guy gets from just [1340] like handing out hand-baked pies to his [1342] old clients it's stupid um he spends [1344] probably like a, $1,500 on the pie and [1347] like a day of his time time driving out [1349] uh but he probably gets at least like 20 [1351] or $30,000 a work every time he does [1353] that so local Services business can [1355] really benefit from some type of [1356] automated follow-up system because most [1358] of them don't do like that right [1360] what I would recommend is X days after a [1361] project is completed you send an email [1363] or SMS that seems very customized asking [1366] how things are going and offering a [1367] follow-up job um I would offer some [1370] discount on the follow-up job I would uh [1372] have some specific information about [1374] that job that I would have my [1375] subcontractor plumber have filled out [1377] you know X days before when they did the [1379] job like oh you know there uh I don't [1381] know these fittings seem a little bit [1382] old and then I'd actually like reference [1384] that in the automated email that I would [1386] send out so the person thinks that it's [1387] like some dude that's there texting on [1389] the phone being like hey how's how's [1391] everything going with that J fitting [1392] yours whatever the heck they're called [1393] forgive me plumbers um but but basically [1396] I would just make sure this is automated [1397] because if you don't automate this [1399] you're not going to do it because you're [1401] uh you're going to be focused on the [1402] work that's in front of you not the [1403] potential could be Dream Work that uh [1405] isn't and by doing this you basically [1407] like instantly double your margins maybe [1409] not double maybe like time and a half [1411] your margins because most of your uh [1413] money in a in a local Services business [1415] is going to be spent on the lead [1416] acquisition using ads honestly it's [1419] going to probably be like 15ish to 20% [1421] of of all of your money is going to go [1422] in there so if you can make money from [1425] somebody that you didn't have to pay for [1427] that time AK like a repeat retained [1429] customer uh you are you are golden [1433] baby internal reporting I would ensure [1435] that you have like either a built-in [1437] dashboard using click UPS built-in [1439] dashboards or uh whatever your project [1440] management system is you can also [1441] integrate it with looker studio um most [1444] most usually or you can just use a [1445] Google sheet or something like that and [1447] the benefit there is you're going to [1448] want to be able to see your Revenue [1449] you're going to want to be able to see [1450] your cash collected you're going to want [1452] to be able to see your margins both [1453] gross and then um net and then you're [1455] going to want to see your profit and if [1457] you just know this at all times it'll [1459] eliminate like so many issues that you [1461] otherwise would have had come up uh [1463] companies that like see this on a [1464] day-to-day basis typically perform way [1466] better because they know how much money [1467] that they're making and uh there's [1469] nothing that drives you to make more [1470] money than seeing how little money you [1471] are making uh cash collected is an [1473] important determinant of obviously your [1475] cash reserves revenue is like a bigger [1478] determinant of you know how healthy or [1479] successful your businesses margins are [1481] obviously how much um is left over at [1483] the end of the month some percentage [1484] wise figure of that then profit is like [1485] your your actual um but I would I would [1487] have at least these and then I would [1488] customize them specifically uh for a [1491] plumbing business I probably do [1491] turnaround time and I'd also do [1493] conversion rate on on the calls that [1494] come in for sure find a few additional [1496] metrics that you think are high Roi um [1498] but th those are definitely the ones [1499] that I'd recommend so make sure you have [1501] a dashboard some sometimes you have to [1503] pay for this if you want like a [1504] dedicated dashboard that uses your [1505] particular Plumbing Service that you're [1507] using for project management other times [1509] you can just whip it up yourself using [1510] clickup or something but yeah consider [1512] yourself a business architect more so [1514] than like a plumber at this point [1515] because what you're doing is you're [1516] setting up architecture that any [1517] business can run and not necessarily [1518] just a plumbing company I do some [1521] reputation monitoring for sure I would [1522] just set up some Google Alerts at the [1523] beginning of my business um for my brand [1526] um for my name for maybe some of my [1528] plers names whoever's like big in your [1529] company your partners that sort of thing [1531] uh that way if somebody posts like a [1532] shitty review for you or a shitty Reddit [1535] post or something about oh I hate XYZ [1537] Plumbing they screwed up my whole house [1539] you'll know instantly and uh the sooner [1540] that you know the quicker you'll be able [1542] to take it down and take some type of [1543] action to solve it this is one of those [1545] higher Roi things that like it literally [1547] take you three minutes to do right now [1549] uh and then who knows it might save you [1550] $50,000 over the next year because [1552] you'll spot a really nasty review on a [1554] platform that you didn't really [1556] realize seasonal promotional offer of [1558] email or SMS um this is basically like [1561] every time there's [1563] some SE like you know seasonal holiday [1565] or something um which you know I think [1567] there's about like four to six a year or [1568] something I would just use that to send [1571] everybody on who has worked with you in [1573] the past some type of email just [1574] checking in and offering some discount [1576] or offering some service or or whatever [1579] um you know if your business is [1580] particularly seasonal if you're not [1581] plumber but you're like gutter cleaning [1583] or whatever you know this this is this [1585] makes a lot more sense if you're like [1586] snow plowing or something um but I just [1588] make sure that like you're keeping in [1589] contact with your customers cuz uh the [1591] the downside of this is basically zero [1592] there's no downside at all it's only [1594] potential upside even if less than 1% of [1596] your customer base takes you on this if [1598] over five years you work with a thousand [1600] customers let's say that's still 10 [1602] additional jobs done and if I don't know [1603] your average job size is 500 bucks you [1605] basically just made five grand [1607] realistically your numbers are going to [1608] be way better than that um so it's like [1610] five grand at the minimum but it's [1612] probably going to be closer to like 10 [1613] 20 30 40 50 that sort of thing and it'll [1616] only take you a few hours to set up [1618] and then the last thing I'll say is [1620] automatically managing subcontractor [1622] plumber relationships um most of these [1624] jobs um like most of these uh uh project [1628] management platforms are going to have [1629] an assign [1630] field the benefit to having an assign [1633] field is um you basically just get to [1635] like if I go here you see how in the [1638] assign field here for my own company my [1639] my content writing company which is not [1641] a local Services businesses at all but [1643] you can you know apply similar [1644] principles this assign field allows you [1647] to see who is responsible for doing that [1648] job what you can do in your plumbing [1650] company is you know um you can have that [1652] be related to uh tons of things you [1654] could have that be related to their pay [1656] you know you could use that to trigger [1657] the automatic invoicing that I was [1658] talking about earlier you could have [1660] that be linked to [1662] their um their score so maybe you send [1664] everybody a review or something [1666] afterwards you know as I mentioned a [1667] week afterwards and then you could see H [1669] you know Samantha usually gets a three [1670] out of five but Peter gets a four out of [1672] five and that might be able to inform [1673] you as to like how good they are on the [1674] job or how much people like them uh [1677] basically you're just going to want to [1678] make use of like the assign or the [1679] people column as it's sometimes referred [1681] to uh because that has a ton of built-in [1684] Integrations and then that usually [1685] allows um automatic notifications to [1687] that ensure the person that's assigned [1688] to the job actually does the job when [1690] they said that they were going to do it [1692] so yeah that is my bird's eye view of [1695] how I'd automate a plumbing business [1696] obviously there are multiple different [1698] ways that you can automate a plumbing [1699] business this is just my preferred [1701] approach uh but what I'm going to do is [1702] I'm going to take all of the info that [1704] I've just provided and then I'm going to [1706] um share the whimsical with you just [1708] underneath in the uh in the description [1710] here and then you or anybody else that [1711] runs a plumbing business an HVAC [1713] business just one business in the [1715] similar local Services Niche I can use [1717] this as just like a checklist of things [1718] to go through and if you have any [1720] questions about particular steps in this [1721] process just leave a comment down below [1723] and I'll get to it when I have time um [1725] but yeah this is this is basically [1726] everything that I would do keep in mind [1728] there are a few specific things here [1729] that I did not include because I don't [1731] think that they're worth it for your [1732] type of business I did not include AI [1734] voice agents I did not include um AI [1737] callers or anything like that uh this [1739] stuff just does not make sense for most [1741] businesses yet it might in like a year [1742] or two but it definitely does right not [1744] right now and I also didn't include too [1746] much on like AI personalization um [1748] although you can certainly AI [1749] personalize all of this you could once [1751] you have a project management system [1752] just feed all of their information into [1754] the AI every single time that an event [1756] occurs like a new booking or whatever [1757] and have that generate you a oneline [1759] Icebreaker to then insert into your SMS [1761] text email or or whatever um the thing [1764] is most plumbers you know you don't [1765] really necessarily need to be super [1767] crazy customized any can usually just [1768] get away with some simple quote [1769] templates and whatnot um so just depends [1772] on how far you want to take it any who [1773] really appreciate you guys watching this [1775] video I'm looking forward to reproducing [1776] the same sort of video for all of the [1778] different niches in the world if you [1779] guys have a specific Niche you want me [1780] to do leave a comment down below [1782] otherwise like subscribe do all that fun [1783] YouTube stuff and I'll catch you on the [1785] next one bye-bye

Title: Advanced Make.com: Breaking Up Scenarios
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here and [1] in this video I'm going to run you [2] through an advanced make.com technique [4] called breaking up your scenarios I've [6] had a lot of people ask me when and why [8] I break up my scenarios and in this [10] video I'm going to show you everything [11] you need to know to master this [13] admittedly uh quite Advanced make.com [15] skill without further Ado let's dive [17] right into it all right so I'm going to [18] show you exactly what I mean by breaking [20] up a scenario in a few minutes I'm going [21] to jump into the editor and I'm actually [23] going to like do it live for you with an [24] example before I do I just want to cover [27] sort of like the conceptual basis for [28] why I'm talking about this and first of [30] all a lot of you guys are probably [31] wondering like what does mean by [33] breaking up a scenario and what I mean [35] by breaking up a scenario is basically [36] where you use web Hooks and the HTTP [39] module to feed the output of one [42] scenario and make that the input of [44] another scenario this allows you to [47] chain together tons of different [48] scenarios especially ones that have [50] variable run times and especially ones [52] that use AI because sometimes AI modules [55] Take 5 Seconds to finish sometimes they [57] take 30 usually this involves some sort [59] of naming convention some type of [61] numbering some type of folders or or [63] whatnot and if you don't have a good [64] structure for this this can get pretty [66] complicated in and of itself and [68] generally it's useful when your average [69] number of modules in a scenario starts [71] running above 15 to 20 so what do I [73] actually mean by this well when I said [75] that we are feeding in the output of one [78] scenario and and turning that into the [79] input of another scenario I have sort of [81] an example scenario over here and I'm [83] just going to call this like example [86] output and what I have is I have a basic [88] trigger set up for scen area number one [90] and this basic trigger this is just like [92] a you can just click this plus go to [93] tools and just do basic trigger this is [94] sort of just like a set variables module [96] if you guys aren't familiar with it what [98] I'm going to do is I'm just going to set [99] the output of this to five so we have um [101] an an item or an object or I mean [103] collection if you want to call that with [104] a parameter where the name uh has a [107] value that is equal to five if we run [109] this you'll see that the output of this [111] is five right that's as expected all [115] breaking up a scenario really means is [117] you know hypothetically that's say we [118] have a very complicated this isn't just [120] one basic trigger this is some big 20 [122] module step flow and then you know the [124] output of it is five um all this really [126] means is you take this and then you feed [128] it into an HTTP request module and then [130] what you do is you call a web hook in [132] another scenario to continue the flow [134] and you do this outside of the first [137] scenario you do this in literally like a [138] fundamentally different scenario um [140] because it allows you to shuffle data [142] back and forth allows you to stay a lot [143] more organized and allows you to do um [145] quite a quite a number of like Advanced [147] make.com flows so I'm actually just [148] going to build out the simplest example [150] for you right now um if this scenario [152] number one is called example output [153] we're going to call this number two [155] example input what I'm going to do is [157] I'm going to create my own web hook I'm [159] just going to call this [161] example um breaking up scenario web hook [165] just so I know to delete this later then [167] I'm going to copy this address to my [168] clipboard and then I'm going to paste [169] this in as the URL to my HTTP request [172] module a lot of people don't realize [173] that you can you can do this you can [174] send data to another make.com scenario [177] in your flow just by using HTTP requests [180] so the very first thing I'm going to do [181] is I'm just going [183] to um I'm going to run this just so you [186] guys can see how this works just like we [188] call a server you can also call a [190] make.com scenario so as you see here I [193] called the scenario and I'm just jumping [195] back to the example input here and then [196] I received a request now granted the [199] request had uh had had no data [201] whatsoever it was a completely empty [202] request but that doesn't mean that it [204] has to be an empty request we can do a [206] lot of things with this we could feed [207] query strings in we could say output [209] equals 5 if we run the same thing oops [213] sorry we're going to have to use the [214] existing data of that run you'll see we [216] now have an item that has a variable [218] name called output and then a value [219] called five we don't even have to do a [221] get request if you want you can also do [223] a post request you could feed the data [225] in as um raw [228] Json and you could have output and you [231] could do [231] five I'm going to remove this query [233] string go here I'm going to run this [236] example then I'm I'm going to send the [237] data back we get the same thing the [240] reason why I'm showing you all this is [241] because there are basically like a [242] million in one ways that you can use um [244] HTTP requests with web hooks in make to [247] create like very complicated and complex [249] infrastructure you could have uh tons of [252] different scenarios all running uh [254] interactively between one another and [256] the really cool and really valuable part [258] about this is um this this basically [261] allows you to eliminate the issue of [264] where you have like tons of bundles [266] coming in as an input uh and then you [268] know you like hitting the the make.com [270] timeout limit which I'm going to talk [272] about next but any I hope it's clear [274] that's basically what by what breaking [275] up a scenario means in this instance um [277] I'm just referring to using a web hook [278] and an HTTP module to kind of [280] communicate and shuttle data back and [281] forth between one scenario and the next [283] so it's pretty cool the obvious main [286] question is okay why would I break up a [287] scenario like Nick aren't you all about [289] just making money extremely quickly and [290] not having to worry about all this [291] academic and the answer to that [293] is yes I certainly am but there are many [295] situations in which you actually do want [296] to break up scenarios um even if you're [298] trying to be a scrp happy and hacky as [300] possible like I usually am the four main [303] ones here are it's less messy messy less [306] messy I'm the messy of make.com baby uh [309] it's less messy and more visually uh [311] pleasing the second is it lets you avoid [313] make.com like 40 I think it's 40 or 45 [316] minute timeout um and that just means [318] like a scenario can only run for 40 to [319] 45 minutes before make.com will actually [321] say hey stop the scenario and it it [323] Force stops it so you can imagine how [324] like if one of your tasks is to iterate [325] over 5,000 rows and every row run takes [329] like 2 seconds or something that's 9,000 [332] seconds which I believe is what 150 [333] minutes or something my math ain't so [335] good but the point that I'm trying to [336] make is you wouldn't actually be able to [337] go through every single one of those [338] rows um so what you can do uh with this [340] is you can actually run a you can you [343] can call a web hook basically HTTP [345] request send the data somewhere else and [347] then you don't have to wait for the data [349] to process you just like deal with all [350] the processing time in the other [351] scenario and that scenario just run was [353] once every single time uh you call it [356] it's also more modular and more [358] maintainable later on uh this does [359] necessitate that you have good naming [361] conventions good folder structure all [362] that fun stuff that I mentioned earlier [363] if you don't it can actually be a little [364] bit more complex but I'll show you guys [365] a very simple naming uh scheme that I [367] personally use and then it also lets you [369] implement more robust error handling and [371] this is something that a lot of people [372] probably don't know about I haven't [373] covered it in my make.com course up [375] until now um but you can send responses [378] to web hook requests like um make up [381] your own status codes basically you [382] could say like 200 means good you know [384] 400 means no you know 401 means [386] unauthorized or whatnot I think it means [388] one unauthorized [390] yeah okay good means one unauthorized um [393] you can basically do this and then in [395] the main scenario you can do a bunch of [397] things with the the response to that [399] information which is pretty cool and [400] then you can have some pretty pretty [402] robust error handling and you basically [403] just made it all yourself um and then [405] one other reason here that I think it's [407] good to at least start understanding how [409] to break up scenarios and why you might [410] want to break up scenarios is because [411] this also just like turns you from more [413] of just like a make.com no code script [415] junkie into like a like an application [418] developer essentially like you learn [419] learn that you know you're basically [421] making several endpoints you're [422] shuttling data to and from these end [424] points um you're starting to basically [425] like build an an app essentially like a [427] like a almost like an API like your own [430] API so that's why I would break up [432] scenarios um there's certainly a couple [433] of other reasons here and um you know [436] I'm sure there are other people out [437] there that have broken up scenarios in [438] different ways maybe not with the HTP [440] module but maybe using some different [441] apps or whatnot uh but this is how I do [443] it and this is one of the the most [444] scalable ways I think you can quickly [446] transition from just like a make.com [448] script junkie into like an actual [449] developer which is pretty [451] neat and that takes me to the most [453] important part of this video which is [455] when the hell should I actually go out [456] and break up a scenario uh and I will [459] show you four or I will talk about four [461] instances and then I'm actually going to [462] dive into a scenario that I've set up [463] here called my contents indication [465] scenario I I created this one in a [467] previous video and then I'd show you [468] what this might actually look like in [469] like practical terms um and and you know [471] how how we'd eliminate the uh the [474] make.com like timeouts and how we do a [476] bunch of other things so first reason to [478] break up a scenario or when to break up [480] a scenarios when the modules have [481] variable run times so basically [484] anytime you're using Ai and then you're [486] iterating through a large number of [487] bundles you're going to want to do [488] something like this the second is [490] obviously when you're iterating over a [491] large number of bundles say 100 the [493] third is when you have many routes with [494] many modules and it's getting [495] disorganized and then the fourth is when [497] when you're running a module with a [498] callback URL this is sort of a fancy [500] programming term but um there are tons [502] of modules out there where you basically [504] you'll you'll you'll run it in one [506] module like you'll run the process in [508] one module and then it's like sent over [510] to the cloud or to the service and then [512] you set a call back URL and you [513] basically have to wait for the results [515] of that module in another so I'll show [517] you guys what that looks like as well [519] but yeah these are the four reasons that [521] you might want to break up a scenario [523] four ways um to know when it's a good [525] time to break up the scenario and now [527] what I'm going to do is I'm going to [528] show you like a practical example of me [529] breaking up a scenario and actually like [530] what I would do and what this would look [531] like realistically thank you rise much [534] appreciated all right so without further [536] Ado uh this is a scenario that I set up [538] a little while ago that essentially we [540] have an air table over here and this air [543] table just has a couple of columns this [544] is an example scenario I'm not actually [546] using this for my business but you know [547] you guys wanted me to do something like [549] this uh a few weeks ago or maybe a month [551] ago and then I I whipped this up we [552] basically just have a Content calendar [554] with a date column here a copy column an [557] image URL column and then we have a list [559] of platforms we're not actually using [560] this list of platforms so we could [561] actually just delete [563] this um so we have a date column post [566] copy column image URL column and then [568] why is this not there we go uh and then [569] image URL column and basically this is [571] just meant to be like a social media [572] calendar where we have post copy like [574] hey you think recycling is just about [575] saving cans it's more than that [577] recycling does blah blah blah blah blah [579] then we have an image URL over here [580] which is just like an image of I don't [582] know I guess some some dirt and some [584] plants and stuff uh and then what this [586] make.com scenario does is it takes this [588] data okay it downloads the file that's [590] what this HTTP module does and then what [593] it does is it actually goes out and then [597] um it creates [600] and publishes social media posts to [603] different [604] platforms by using AI to customize the [608] copy and you know ideally like the image [611] resolution and stuff although I don't do [612] it here um to those different platforms [614] for instance if it's a Twitter post what [616] we'll do is we will take in the copy and [619] then inside of this right Twitter post [620] it we say um not that convert the [625] following post copy into formats for [626] Twitter don't include any backlinks use [628] and in place in new line since it's [630] Twitter make it short and Punchy the [631] input we feed in is some long post copy [634] and then the output is like some very [635] short Twitter copy with Emojis and stuff [637] like that the idea is we basically like [639] the motivator here is you just want to [642] um I don't know your team to be able to [643] to write one post once maybe a short [645] little piece of copy here have an image [647] and then have that automatically kind of [649] fit to like five different social media [650] platforms all you need to do is just [652] click a button then we actually go [653] through and we we'll upload the media [655] we'll create the post we'll we'll do all [656] that fun stuff now um one thing to keep [660] in mind is let's say I mean in this [662] example we're only using three rows [664] right we have like uh one two three but [666] let's say hypothetically um we for [668] whatever reason wanted to post you know [670] 50 posts today [672] okay 50 posts today times five gp4 [677] modules is 250 GPT 4 runs right if every [681] GPT 4 run hypothetically let's just say [683] took 15 seconds um now we're at 3,750 [687] total seconds for this whole scenario [690] uh which is 62.5 minutes which is more [692] time than our scenario would basically [693] be able to run make would have to time [695] it out now this is a very contrived [697] example obviously you're probably not [699] going to try and post 50 times in a day [700] or something like that maybe you will I [702] don't know um but the motivator here is [705] you know we have a lot of modules with [707] variable run times and it'd be much much [709] more efficient If instead of worrying [711] about all of this stuff we could just [712] send it off to a different scenario with [714] an HTTP request which would take like [716] 0.1 seconds and then iterate to the next [719] one essentially and so um the reason why [722] I picked this is because there are four [723] different routes so we basically have to [724] create four scenarios to to sort this [726] out and you see here we have one run [728] here which is this like creates a an [730] article in medium this one here creates [732] a post in LinkedIn this one here creates [733] a post in Twitter and this one here [734] creates a post on Facebook so how would [736] I actually go about like breaking up the [738] scenario first and foremost I would have [740] some content syndication onto Twitter [742] Facebook Instagram LinkedIn medium I'd [743] have some very descriptive title which [744] I've already set up and then I'd have uh [746] I'd use a numbering scheme then what I [749] do is I add this to a folder so I'm [751] actually to go to my scenario tab here [753] and then I'm going to say content [755] syndicator [757] flow I'm going to look up my scenario [761] here I'm going to drag this to my [763] contents indicator flow keep in mind [765] I've renamed this in this tab but um I [767] haven't actually oh uh if this ever [769] happens to you by the way it's just [770] because you've selected some text [771] Elsewhere on the page um so this is just [774] a like if I do this and then I save I'm [776] going to get this every single time but [778] if I just exit that out of this and then [779] save then I I don't get that anymore [781] just in case one of you guys got this um [784] I'm I'm going to name it so I don't know [786] let's say trigger Twitter Facebook [788] Instagram I don't have an Instagram one [789] here so Twitter Facebook uh [792] LinkedIn and [794] medium post flows let's do that I'm [798] going to refresh this so I have it and [800] then what I'll do is I'm I'm just going [801] to create scenarios for Twitter Facebook [803] LinkedIn and medium and then I'm going [805] to use web hooks to tie them all [806] together so I'm going to create um some [808] scenarios here [809] I'm just going to do this one at a time [811] because then uh or I'm going to do one [813] fully and then that way I can just copy [815] it to the next one but what we want is [817] we want a custom web [819] hook we're going to say example breaking [822] up scenario uh let's do Facebook [826] first save this I'm going to copy this [829] address to my clipboard and then I'm [830] going to go back over here and basically [831] what I want to do is I'm just going to [832] unlink [834] this and then instead of a [839] um instead of these modules what I'm [840] going to do is I'm going to send a [842] request make a request here go back here [845] and I'm going to call this call Facebook [849] post [850] flow [852] scenario maybe let's just remove flow [855] let's just make it [856] scenario easier for you guys to [858] understand I would say the URL I'm going [860] to feed in is this and then what I'm [862] going to do is I'm going to have um let [864] me think [866] uh I need to feed in the data obviously [869] so I could use a get I think in my case [870] I'm going to use a [872] post and you don't need to like use [874] different ones every time just pick one [875] format and then use it all the time um [878] and then what I need is I just need the [880] post copy and then I need the image URL [882] so I'm going to put um a variable here [884] called post copy and then I'm going to [887] feed in my post copy and we may have to [889] deal with a new lines here and then I'll [891] go image [892] URL and then I'm going to feed in the [894] image [895] URL okay great this looks good to me um [898] and what I'm going to do is I'm going to [899] unlink the rest of these just so we [901] could test this one fully and once we [903] know that this works we can go back and [904] then copy and paste and do all that fun [906] stuff let me just delete the rest of [907] these example [909] scenarios um and then I can use this [912] fully and what I'm going to do is I'm [913] going to call this um [915] Facebook post [918] scenario receive trigger and run [922] Facebook post scenario let's do that and [925] then good I'm going to run this and then [927] what I'm going to do is I'm just going [928] to [931] um let's just do this on one post for [933] now so I'm just going to like change [934] these dates again back to 678 that way [937] my air table flow is only going to [938] select the one with uh whatever the the [940] date [942] is actually you know what um sorry I'm [944] using a formula here let me just grab [946] the first result let's just run this and [948] make sure we got it okay great yeah we [950] have the first result here so what I'm [951] going to do now is I'm going to run this [952] I'm going to go through the flow and [954] then I'm going to call my Facebook post [955] scenario which is why I have this [956] testing it's uh currently a waiting [958] input I click run [963] once and then it looks like there was a [966] 400 yeah so uh there was a 400 and the [969] reason why there was a 400 was because [971] uh we ended up adding a bunch of new [972] lines in between the Jason here uh this [974] is actually not like uh and you know [977] what I just had a question come up in my [979] community you can't actually pass like [980] new lines like this to Jason so what you [983] have to do is when you pass the copy you [984] have to replace all instances of a new [987] line character here and if you have to [989] replace that with a back sln and then [990] you can just regenerate the new line [992] later but anyway so I'm going to run [993] this [995] again and then let's see why there was a [999] there was a 200 [1000] here and for whatever reason uh this did [1003] not actually take it at the time I'm not [1004] sure why that didn't happen but [1006] obviously we we did end up getting the [1007] data which is nice let me run this again [1010] and run this again okay there we go must [1013] have just been a little bug and now you [1014] can see we've actually regenerated the [1016] new line here um so despite the fact [1017] that we removed the new line character [1019] and then we just had like a back SL in [1020] we we now have the the new line [1022] character in again for for our post copy [1024] which is cool okay great now all we need [1027] to do is we're just going to copy these [1028] two all right these were parts of our [1030] Facebook post flow and then we're just [1032] going to map the modules and the uh the [1036] data so I'm just going to feed in my [1038] post copy [1039] wonderful then all this Facebook stuff I [1042] need to feed in um download photo from [1046] URL so I'm just going to feed in the [1047] image URL here [1049] I'm not going to add a caption although [1050] you could very easily generate a caption [1053] right um so I don't actually want to [1055] post this on my Facebook profile for one [1058] second copy [1060] um let me see why don't I actually just [1062] do this once just for brevity and then [1065] after I'm not going to post in any other [1067] Facebook or Instagram or Twitter [1068] profiles I'll just do this to show you [1070] guys how this [1072] works okay so uh now let's actually run [1075] through this whole scenario and then [1076] let's actually post this data so I'm [1078] going to run this now we're awaiting our [1079] input I'm going to run this here we're [1081] now we're sending our input we received [1083] our input we're now writing the Facebook [1084] post now we're creating the Facebook [1086] post and posting it on my [1090] profile and I'm going to jump over here [1092] give it a [1093] refresh looks like we have pasted it in [1098] um we posted the Json looks like oh yeah [1101] we posted the Json my bad we're going to [1104] have to jump back here and change this [1106] uh because the output is is a message in [1108] Jason it's because I told it to write in [1112] Json so we don't actually want it to [1114] write in Json I just want it to write [1116] the copy okay there we [1118] go all right let's do that one more time [1121] let's just eviscerate my Facebook [1126] profile and now I am going to [1132] refresh [1135] refresh and [1140] we have our lovely post over [1143] here um well with the back slash ends as [1147] well that's [1148] funny so we can't actually just post [1150] this we need to replace the back slash [1154] NS with um new [1157] lines characters there we [1160] go okay third time's the [1163] charm we're going to delete this and [1166] then rerun [1171] and then okay great looks like we posted [1173] it again now I'm going to refresh the [1176] page if it doesn't work I am eating a [1179] shoe okay great yeah so it worked we [1181] have the new lines and everything looks [1182] nice and sexy um so that's what that [1184] looks like um you know in my case [1186] because I run the page as it's published [1187] by make um and that's how you know that [1189] you know make.com was responsible for [1191] that flow I'm going to delete that and I [1192] think it's pretty clear at this point [1193] how all of this is going to work [1195] essentially now that we've done this for [1196] one all we really need to do is we just [1197] need to repeat this for a few more [1199] scenarios so I'm going to go into my [1201] scenario [1202] editor I'm going to refresh this and [1205] then open up the folder that I created a [1207] moment ago called contents indicator [1208] flow and I'm just going to create a new [1210] scenario [1212] here and then what I'm going to do is [1216] I'm just going to paste this [1218] in and then why don't I use the same [1221] naming convention we'll say three and [1224] we'll say run Twitter post scenario now [1228] oh and then uh because I copied in the [1230] web hook I already have a a web hook URL [1232] here so I need [1236] to um create a new one and then assign a [1238] new URL which is right over here I'm [1241] going to go back over here and then I'm [1243] going to move all this stuff copy and [1245] paste this in we are going to get the [1249] web hook address from the first paste it [1252] in and then instead of Facebook post [1255] scenario I'm going to rename this to [1256] stay organized we'll go Twitter post [1257] scenario [1259] then I'm going to copy all of my work [1261] here and keep in mind this is specific [1264] to Facebook so I'm going to post in my [1265] Twitter [1266] one um I now know that there are a [1268] couple changes I need to make to this to [1270] make it [1271] work um I can't say output in Json okay [1274] so it doesn't look like I said output [1276] and Jason for this one which is [1278] nice um I need to feed in the post copy [1281] variable um if you don't know what the [1284] variable is called you can map it still [1287] uh you just have to the variable name um [1290] and then if it's not like currently [1291] available in the selector you're just [1292] going to get this little outline uh this [1294] little red outline whatever the module [1296] color is so that's what I'm doing here I [1297] know this is the post [1299] copy and [1301] then um I also need to download this [1304] specific one so I'm just going [1306] to exit this out and then get the file [1310] from [1313] HTTP I'm going to feed in um image URL I [1317] believe that's called image URL [1319] and then I'm going to get the output of [1320] this image URL [1323] module feed that in all right great so [1325] now we have our Twitter um scenario up [1327] and running which is pretty cool um why [1329] don't I do everything except for upload [1331] the thing to Twitter just to show you [1333] guys how that might [1334] work so I'm going to go back to my [1336] initial scenario here and then I'm going [1337] to remove this Facebook route just to [1339] show you guys what it looks like if I [1340] call the Twitter post route just to [1341] verify that works so we sent the request [1344] we received 200 if we go back to our [1346] Twitter scenario we see we got the data [1348] with the post copy image URL we wrote [1351] the Twitter post the result of that was [1354] this and then we got the file and now we [1357] have a bunch of binary data so we can [1359] kind of connect this to the rest of this [1361] flow that's what that looks like this [1364] what this looks like oh sorry I selected [1367] the text again and now we can do the [1369] same thing for LinkedIn we can do the [1370] same thing for medium so I'm just going [1372] to follow the exact same process that I [1373] had [1375] before for both of these [1378] this is going to be call medium uh sorry [1382] call LinkedIn post scenario and this [1383] one's going to be called medium post [1386] scenario beautiful um and then I need to [1390] go and create another scenario let's do [1393] two more scenarios really one for [1396] medium and then one [1398] for [1400] um uh LinkedIn so we're going to do a [1404] web hook here we'll go custom web hook [1406] I'm going to go web hook here custom web [1408] hook H this is the first web hook for [1411] the LinkedIn so example breaking up [1413] scenario LinkedIn [1415] flow let's go okay and then I'm going to [1417] add this paste this in we'll go medium [1421] flow okay and then um this naming [1425] convention here is really good I really [1427] like this so I'll go four receive [1428] trigger and run medium post scenario and [1430] then we're going to go five um sorry [1434] LinkedIn post scenario and then five run [1436] a medium post scenario and then I'm [1438] going to going to copy these addresses [1439] and then I'm just going to um feed them [1441] into these HTTP modules so LinkedIn post [1444] ER is going to go here and the medium [1447] post scenario sorry is going to go over [1451] here paste that in okay great now we [1454] have four uh flows basically I mean just [1457] look at this this is much shorter and [1458] much sexier I would say than what we had [1460] previously and we can also just hide all [1462] the complexity away and put them in the [1464] the specific scenarios that are relevant [1467] so this is the LinkedIn one so I'm going [1469] to paste in what I did for LinkedIn [1471] here we are going to write LinkedIn and [1475] then we're going to [1479] say since it's [1481] LinkedIn make it corporate longer and [1483] dress it up a bit okay [1489] great um I think I didn't actually [1492] like copy the data over correctly when I [1495] attempted to make the scenario earlier [1497] so it's probably not going to work [1499] uh write this as well as I it probably [1501] could have if I had trained it better [1503] but that's [1504] okay and then just like we did with the [1506] Twitter scenario um we have to download [1511] the file here for LinkedIn so I'm just [1513] going to paste this [1515] in let me copy this and then go back [1518] here oops I guess I was lagging a little [1521] bit we'll paste this [1524] in and then I'm going to grab one image [1527] URL which should work and then I can uh [1529] just map the output of this okay great [1533] so now we have the LinkedIn scenario up [1535] and running last thing we need is we [1537] need the medium scenario and then I'm [1539] just going to delete all the rest of [1540] these because they're no longer relevant [1541] to [1542] us um the medium scenario here is going [1546] to get pasted [1548] in and then we are going to write the [1551] markdown article and the way we're going [1552] to do [1553] that so we're going to go one. poost [1557] copy [1559] wonderful and we also need to do the [1561] same thing for the title 1. post [1565] copy we can pump the output into medium [1568] which is already nicely formatted and [1569] voila yeah that's [1571] great all right now what do we have when [1574] all is said and done well we've [1575] basically converted our flow and we [1577] don't actually need this module anymore [1579] we've converted our flow which [1581] previously was uh I don't know how many [1583] modules in total probably like 20 [1584] modules in total maybe 18 modules in [1586] total something like that and we've [1587] turned it into a scenario that now only [1588] has five modules um so it's [1590] substantially simpler at the front end [1592] um we were very uh organized and [1595] informative with how we titled the [1597] various modules in our first trigger [1599] scenario um and as a result we now have [1601] like a very organized folder based [1603] system basically where uh one master [1606] parent scenario will trigger all of [1608] these [1609] flows and then the other four scenarios [1612] will sort of you know go and do do the [1614] their bidding basically do what they [1616] were supposed to do here as it stands [1618] this is pretty basic as far as um [1620] breaking up scenarios into multiple um [1623] you know subflows is uh what we could do [1627] for instance is we could go into one of [1629] these scenarios and then use the web [1631] hook response module and we could say [1634] you know let's pretend [1638] that the output of this Facebook page [1641] module was a 400 or something like [1645] that or what we could say [1651] is [1656] um you know if hypothetically this [1658] scenario didn't work we could [1662] say post incomplete I don't know what [1664] what we'd use to basically tell us if [1666] the post is incomplete but then we can [1668] actually send back a response to the web [1670] hook originator and we could have like a [1671] status code [1675] incomplete let's say uh sorry status 400 [1678] and then we could have like an error and [1679] we could say incomplete and then when [1681] this [1683] scenario uh [1685] runs and then if this one's [1688] complete we could return a [1691] 200 and then we could have um no error [1695] at all and now when this scenario [1698] runs AKA when it's called from the call [1701] Facebook post scenario when we run [1703] this we could actually get a response um [1706] that would say you know 200 400 or [1708] something like that inside of this [1710] module which would then allow us to do [1712] some more complicated error handling [1714] like maybe if we call Facebook post [1715] maybe I don't know there's like two or [1716] three different ways you can make a [1717] Facebook post so maybe if we call [1719] Facebook post scenario one and it [1721] doesn't work well now we call Facebook [1722] post scenario 2 and that's where you can [1724] start getting in like the very complex [1726] flows where you know this is Facebook [1728] post scenario one and if this doesn't [1730] work then uh we call Facebook post [1732] scenario 2 instead and then if that [1735] doesn't work maybe we I don't know we [1737] like log the error to our database or [1739] our CMS or something like [1742] that um and and in this way you [1744] basically built in a ton of redundancy [1746] into your application and your [1747] application is now like it's not it's [1748] never going to be an Enterprise [1749] application if you're making it in make [1751] U make just is a little too slow and it [1753] consumes a little too many resources in [1754] order for this to be feasible U make [1756] optimizes for usability of like the [1759] developer Aku and not necessarily like [1761] uh [1762] infrastructural um completeness and and [1764] and that sort of thing but you can get [1766] pretty close and then you can apply the [1768] concepts that you've learn here um to [1770] actually go out there and then make like [1771] a full stack Enterprise app if you [1772] wanted to right you could use make as [1774] like an MVP and then just take the exact [1776] same logic that we've done here where we [1778] have different endpoints to run Facebook [1780] posts Twitter posts LinkedIn post medium [1781] posts and then actually like build out [1783] an app that uh serves hundreds thousands [1785] or maybe millions of users all right [1788] hope you guys enjoyed that video hope it [1789] wasn't a little too academically dry for [1791] all y'all but I think if you've made it [1793] to this point in the make.com for people [1795] that want to make real money course it's [1796] important for you guys to learn like [1798] some of the finer points behind um you [1800] know breaking up scenarios and how [1801] make.com works at a higher level and [1803] that sort of thing if you guys have any [1804] questions about this Advanced material [1806] please leave a comment down below I'm [1807] we're happy to answer you guys um you [1809] know I'm I'm going to do a few more [1811] videos on advanced concepts I just want [1812] to get a pulse sort of read the room and [1814] see where everybody's at with this level [1816] of knowledge uh and then otherwise [1818] please do all that fun YouTube stuff [1819] like subscribe um you know get me to the [1821] front page uh and uh yeah really [1823] appreciate your time looking forward to [1825] the next video have a great rest day [1826]

Title: Here's The Exact Remote Hiring Process I Used At My $92K/mo Agency
[0] hey Nick here and in this video I'm [1] going to show you exactly how I'd hire [3] my very first remote employee if I could [4] dial back the clock and do it all over [6] again let's get into it I've hired over [8] 40 people at this point in my career and [9] I think that the vast majority of people [11] watching that are probably my age or or [13] maybe even a little bit older I probably [14] haven't hired like a third of of that [16] many people so I feel somewhat qualified [18] to speak on this topic um and you know [19] if you count other contractors and that [21] sort of thing uh number is probably [22] closer to 100 what I'm going to do in [23] this videos I'm going to talk about [24] three different things the first is I'm [26] going to show you uh or I'm going to run [28] you through some Concepts you should [29] understand before you even go about [30] making your first hire then I'm going to [33] talk about how best to structure your [34] first hire so how to optimize their [36] daily workflow how to optimize the [38] systems you build to track their kpis [40] and how just best to conceptualize your [42] first hire uh and then the last thing [44] I'm going to do is I'm going to [44] basically give you a roadmap to get out [46] there and hire I'm going to I'm going to [47] show you the websites that I would [48] personally use to do this I'm going to [50] talk a little bit about like my personal [51] best practices to actually have the hire [54] you know perform some piece of work for [55] you during the interview uh and then I'm [57] I'm basically just going to give you the [58] whole play byplay of how I've [59] implemented hiring in my seven figure [61] agency and how I've done hiring as well [63] in my automation agency too so uh yeah [66] without further Ado here are three [68] concepts that you should understand [69] before you even think about making your [72] first hire and I want you guys to think [73] about these very very deeply um the very [75] first and probably the most [76] controversial is that you should not be [78] hiring until you absolutely have to a [81] lot of people will say you should hire [82] as quickly as you can to stop doing work [84] yourself and I understand why people are [86] saying that but the reality is human [87] beings are the biggest variable in any [89] business human beings are not consistent [91] they're not at all going to Output the [94] same thing every single time uh you know [96] somebody from an automation background [97] like myself I treat modules as like [99] input output right and you can map [101] humans similarly but the unfortunate [102] part about humans is you might give the [104] human the same input 50 times and the [106] output might be different every single [107] 50 time uh so uh what I always say is [110] don't hire until you absolutely have to [112] calculate the estimated return on [114] investment of your hire and then work [116] backwards from that for example if the [119] graphic designer that you are planning [120] to hire for your graphic design business [122] is going to cost you $5,000 a month how [124] much money do you think they will enable [125] you to make it's a perfectly valid [127] question and it's also a question that [128] basically nobody ever asks themselves [131] how much work are they going to be able [132] to fulfill hypothetically let's say they [134] do [134] $25,000 every month of designs so they [137] do a little over $1,000 of designs every [139] workday five days a week if you do the [142] math $25,000 divided by $5,000 is an [145] estimated return on investment or return [147] on employee of five times okay [151] now ask yourself is there anything else [153] that you can [156] do to get an Roi of greater than five [160] times [162] elsewhere the answer to that question is [164] almost always yes believe it or not you [167] can usually get a much greater Roi than [170] just five times by implementing uh [173] systems in your business to enable you [175] to grow further before you hire because [177] if you think about it if you manag to [178] grow a little bit further before you [179] hire because you have very smart systems [181] well when you inevitably do hire then [183] your staff memb is going to be able to [184] generate a higher Roi so this is sort of [186] like uh doing double duty essentially [187] killing two birds with one stone um you [190] can usually re uh formulate your offer [193] reformulate your product in such a way [194] that you can generate a substantially [196] higher than five times Roi so I'm [197] getting a bunch of text you know you can [200] usually change your target market to get [202] more than a five times Roi the point [204] that I'm making is you should never look [205] at hiring as your very first thing that [207] you need to do but you should [208] consciously ask yourself and do the hard [210] work of essentially trying to figure [211] this out on your own for you H uh [214] of like where can I work harder to [217] achieve more than a five times Roi or a [219] six times Roi or in many cases like a [221] three times Roi that hiring would be [223] able to give me so treat hiring just [225] like any other business investment [226] decision don't treat it as this nebulous [228] fantastic new thing just treat it as [230] like okay what's the estimated Roi of [231] this if the estimated Roi of this is [233] higher than all my other estimated RIS [234] then fine I'll do it but if it's not and [236] in most cases is it isn't uh then don't [239] do it until you absolutely have to all [241] right now I sell automations for a [243] living I talk about automations for a [245] living Sor we got a police uh thing [247] moving by so you know I usually think [249] about automations as Roi producers in [252] many cases you can just set up a simple [253] automation that will produce much much [255] more than five times Roi on the time and [257] energy that you spend on it uh it might [259] take you a single day or a couple of [260] days to put together an automation that [262] streamlines your work and generates you [263] a 30 times Roi on both that time and [265] also the money that you're spending on [266] it right maybe a Content drafting system [269] or a content syndication system or a [271] hiring system or a cold email system [273] right it's just all about leverage and [275] they're usually things that um that are [276] better leveraged than people at least at [278] the very beginning so that's my sort of [280] controversial T I know a lot of people [282] disagree with me on that but I think [283] that it's important for me to [284] mention the second thing I'm going to [286] say is don't expect your hire to produce [288] any value at all especially if it's your [291] first time doing this obviously you are [293] looking to hire somebody because you [294] want them to produce value because you [296] want them to produce some return on [298] investment right but if it's very first [300] time doing this you're probably not [301] going to do it perfectly and if you [303] estimated a five times Roi on that high [305] you're probably going to get like a [306] three times Roi at least for the first [308] couple of months so do not expect [310] they'll be able to produce value on day [312] one and then also don't expect that they [314] are going to come perfect right out of [316] the box doesn't matter how much money [317] you're paying people people are like [320] we're animals right we can't regulate [322] our own work or we can only regulate our [324] own work up until a certain point um you [327] have incentives for your business to [329] succeed uh you obviously get a profit [331] share you obviously get a percentage of [333] the you know Equity when you sell [334] hopefully as much of it as humanly [336] possible hopefully 100% you know sole [337] owner um but because of that you have [339] like an inherent incentive in seeing [341] your business succeed you're willing to [342] put in the extra time energy and hours [344] uh you know to move the needle when [346] nobody else is don't expect your hirers [348] to have that same point of view at all [349] because they won't if they're being paid [351] a salary even if they're being paid a [352] percentage on every deal the incentive [354] reward structure is still just [355] completely different and the one thing [357] uh that you should also remember is even [358] if they're making the same amount of [359] money as you and have the exact same [361] monetary incentive they don't [362] necessarily have the same social [363] incentive it's not their business we [365] attach a lot of ego to our own [367] businesses uh and so you know their [368] sense of responsibility will differ from [370] yours so basically you have to show all [372] of this stuff to them right um and you [374] can expect your hire to produce value [376] quickly and you can't really expect them [377] to structure their day or know what the [379] hell to do either it's your job as a [381] manager boss owner or hiring manager to [383] do all that for them so on that same [386] note um I would never bring somebody on [388] without having a defined onboarding [389] sequence a defined daily work sequence [392] and a defined set of kpis that you're [393] looking for I want you to think about [395] yourself as giving your team members all [397] of the tools that they need to succeed [400] and having them run with those tools but [403] if you don't give them the tools that [404] they need to succeed they're not going [406] to be capable of just making those tools [408] from scratch or if they are um the like [410] number of hires that will be able to do [412] that on their own so maybe like one in a [414] 100 one in a thousand so don't play [416] don't roll the dice don't play Chance um [418] focus on giving them the tools to [419] succeed and they will and if uh if you [421] don't know how to do that or if you [422] don't do that then uh then they won't [424] and that's really your fault I'll talk [426] about exactly how to do these three [428] steps here in a moment the last thing [430] I'm going to say is don't just interview [433] the staff member we are unfortunately [435] massively misled in today's society [437] because most of us have grown up um [440] getting our first couple of jobs at like [441] bigger corporate chains or bigger [443] corporate franchises with very [444] structured interview processes and that [446] sort of deal the vast majority of the [447] people watching this do not have big [449] corporate corate franchises or big [450] corporate big corporate franchis they [452] don't have like big companies with 5,000 [454] employees it's probably you and like you [456] know maybe like your third cousin twice [458] removed and the new hire that you're [460] trying to make um so the same processes [462] that work well for that company they're [463] not going to work well for your company [465] when you're small and if you're starting [466] out on the agency space the best way to [468] hire somebody is to get them to do [470] something specifically to get them to do [472] something that generates you a return on [474] investment it should ideally be as close [476] as possible to the actual work that [477] they're going to be doing when you hire [479] them the reason why is because everybody [482] promises the world during interviews [484] also I mean you know if this is the [486] first time you're doing this you're not [486] very good at like sniffing out who's [488] good like who's going to be a competent [490] or valuable employee and who's not just [492] based on what they tell you um you know [494] if you think about it a person's quality [497] of work is not one toone correlated with [499] their ability to explain that quality of [501] work some people are fantastic workers [503] but some people aren't very good at [504] demonstrating their value socially or [506] verbally right other people are the [508] worst workers on planet Earth but they [509] will spin the longest yarn if it means [512] that they can get a job right so you [515] know everybody will try and promise you [517] the world during interviews these days [519] um but few will have the skills to back [520] it up and to eliminate that disparity [522] entirely what you need to do especially [524] for your first to you hires is structure [526] your hiring process so that you actually [527] get them to produce the deliverable that [529] you are going to get them to produce if [531] they work with you before you even start [533] working with them yes this is going to [535] take you a little bit time and energy to [536] set up effectively yes this is going to [538] take you a little bit of money because [539] you're going to have to pay people to do [540] some of that work for you but this is [541] number one the most efficient way to get [544] all of this uh the actual hiring process [546] done and I'll talk about this later but [548] essentially if you're a Content writing [549] company get them to write a piece of [550] content if you're a PR Company get them [552] to draft some coms for you or make a [554] campaign if you're a graphic design [555] company get them to make you a graphic [557] design right give them a couple of hours [560] put them on a leash of course don't like [561] let them learn completely free and [562] bankrupt you but give them a couple of [564] hours and have them show you what they [565] can [566] do okay so those are the three concepts [568] that I want to cover before you hire now [570] assuming that you are actually going to [571] hire what do you need to do um like like [573] what sort of groundwork do you need to [574] set up in order to make sure that you [575] can do this effectively and that you can [577] extract maximum value out of everybody [579] that's going to be working for you um [581] because you know people people are only [583] as valuable as like their bosses [584] essentially make them and you are in [586] this case a boss the number one way that [588] I found uh to do this is by building [590] three things a Define onboarding [592] sequence a Define daily work system and [593] a defined set of kpis so what does that [596] actually look like in practice well I've [598] whipped up a handy dandy Whimsical [600] flowchart right here the very first [603] thing that I would do if I were you and [604] I decided that it is time to hire is [607] that I would Define three kpis that I [609] could use to measure progress if you're [610] unfamiliar with kpi kpi stands for key [613] performance indicator and it's just a [614] nerdy way of saying like their output [616] now uh the reason why you're doing more [618] than one is because you don't just want [620] like no in order to get a full picture [622] of performance one kpi is never enough [625] uh for instance let's say you were a [626] salesperson um you know what are some [628] kpis that might be important to you well [630] one is obviously how many calls have you [631] had that day if you're doing cold calls [632] or I don't know inbound calls or [634] something right but call volume doesn't [636] really tell you the whole picture some [637] person might have 100 calls a day and [639] then they might produce your company [640] zero dollars is that still a good [641] salesperson no but if you judge them [643] based off only one metric that initial [645] kpi call volume uh you're not really [647] going to you're not really going to be [648] able to fully understand that so I [650] choose three kpis and I choose no more [652] than three kpis personally because you [654] can also get too many kpis and just [655] confuse yourself but I choose three kpis [658] around every hire uh and I find that [660] that's usually like a good middle ground [661] A good rule of thumb for you to be able [662] to assess people especially at the [664] agency uh level between maybe like 25k [667] up to like 250k a month so some example [670] kpis that I would use for different [671] positions if I were hiring a salesperson [674] my first kpi would be call volume [675] because I want them on the phones [677] presumably my other kpi would be cash [679] collected new cash collected let me [681] specify that that's how much money have [683] they closed that day and the third might [685] be client turn rate that's um what is [687] the turn rate of clients that they bring [688] on [689] these three would give you a reasonably [691] not an entirely perfect picture of their [693] performance but a reasonably good [695] picture of their performance Without You [696] Falling prey to like over optimization [698] of silly metrics that don't really [699] matter you know how many calls they [701] doing how much money are they making you [702] and uh the people that they do make [704] money with are they staying on your [706] company Long Term or are they leaving [707] very quickly right uh kpis for writers [711] or somebody that's fulfilling uh those [713] might look like number one article [714] volume number two client volume how many [716] clients are they taking on and number [717] three client satisfaction with their [718] work you can imagine how maybe you send [720] a survey at the end of every article [721] that's completed and you say hey how did [722] you like this article if somebody writes [724] you a five then you assign that five to [726] a writer right so this would give you a [728] pretty reasonable picture of of what [730] that writer is doing for your company um [732] article volume you could use that to [734] discover or determine how much money you [735] know the the writer is generating you [737] client volume might tell you something [739] about how many different clients that [740] they can juggle for you how many client [742] relationships they can maintain and then [743] client satisfaction is obviously how [745] happy are the clients with the work that [747] is specifically attributed to them these [749] are just some examples uh but I [750] encourage you to take the minimalistic [752] approach here uh spend you know 15 [754] minutes thinking about these three and I [756] guarantee you'll have a you'll have a [757] much better view of uh of your staff [760] performance you know six months out the [762] second thing that I would do is I'd [763] create a defined 7-Day onboarding [765] sequence now I will say s days here is [767] arbitrary um if you're hiring a much [769] faster turnaround maybe you make a [770] three-day onboarding sequence a 5day [772] onboarding sequence if it's a much [773] longer turnaround for like a bigger [775] position they paying a lot more money [776] maybe it's a 14-day turnaround sorry [778] 14-day onboarding sequence or 21-day [780] onboarding sequence but uh the point of [782] this is you need to give your staff [783] member an on-ramp to your company where [786] you define the work that they do [788] basically every minute of the first [789] couple of days and or weeks so that they [792] don't have to focus on making their own [795] decisions essentially you get to make [796] all of the high leverage decisions as [798] quickly as possible and you get to um [800] get them to the point where they produce [802] value for your company as quickly as [803] possible you need to hold them by the [806] hand to that point you can kind of think [808] of it as a hill like at the initial [810] first couple of weeks they're going to [811] be climbing a hill and you need to drag [812] them up that hill but the second they [814] make it to the crest of the Hill you [816] know it's all downhill from there and [817] they can actually start producing value [818] for you it's a lot easier for them to [820] move on their own um so this is [822] important because they need some time [823] within your company with a defined set [824] of tasks to essentially be able to learn [826] your culture learn um how to do things [829] obviously learn the logistical [830] procedures behind their projects and [831] that sort of deal if I were hiring a [833] salesperson for instance here's an [835] example um what 4day onboarding sequence [837] but obviously just extend this to six [839] and 7 uh your first day they might be [841] responsible for finishing an entire [842] Salesforce course that might be an [845] estimated time of like 8 hours or [846] something right if you're hiring a [847] full-time person that would consume [848] their whole day the second day they [851] might listen to send sales calls and [852] then present their notes on every sales [854] call to a manager the third day they [856] might Shadow one of their fellow sales [857] associates the fourth day they might [859] actually start getting into work they [860] might call 10 Prospects the fifth day [862] maybe they call 30 prospects and then [864] they share notes with their manager [865] again and then maybe the seventh day the [867] manager takes them out to like a bunch [868] of like closing meetings whether that's [869] in person or whether that's just over [871] the phone or on a video call uh and then [873] at that point you know you'd consider [874] them ready to start making way making [876] their own way you need to have a defined [878] onboarding sequence and you need to make [879] sure that they know that this onboarding [881] sequence is built uh to get them up to [883] speed as quickly and effec effectively [884] as [885] possible the third thing that I [887] recommend is that you build a daily [889] system that forces them to track [890] progress this is like probably the Crux [892] and one of the most important things [893] that I would do today that I did not [895] used to do back in the past and it has [897] bitten me so hard so many times I've [899] lost hundreds of thousands of dollars [900] because I did not build a daily system [902] to force people to track their own [903] progress what is a daily system that [905] forces people to track their own [907] progress well we have kpis now right we [909] have call volume new cash collected [911] client turn right or we have article [912] volume client volume client satisfaction [914] all a daily system that forces them to [916] track progress is is a way for them to [919] log that information every single day in [923] practicality what this usually comes out [925] to what this usually ends up being is a [927] forum or something that they just do at [929] the end of every day like a checkout [930] form where essentially they need to put [932] what did they do that day what is their [934] output if you're a salesperson at the [936] end of every day you might enter in your [937] call Volume Plus your new cash collected [939] very very simple form might take you I [941] don't know less than 15 seconds to fill [943] out uh you can do it in type form jot [945] form monday.com clickup forms like [948] whatever your project management system [950] is all of them have forms so you can [951] definitely build this in um and their [953] only task to do before the end of the [955] day like before they can finish their [956] work they have to enter in this [957] information that information goes to [959] some big spreadsheet or some tracker and [962] this is how you are going to one [964] consistently motivate them to continue [965] working on a task uh two to hold them [967] accountable and three to assess them [970] periodically to make sure that they're [971] not falling off the map or uh just not [973] really working um at the level that you [976] expect them or want them to work this [978] right here is is the Crux of like a good [980] employee uh or a good staff member I [983] want to say you know if you're hiring a [984] contract or something like that so just [985] make sure you have some type of daily [987] system that forces them to track [989] progress and I offer a couple of [990] examples here if you're a writer that [991] might be how many articles have you [992] written or maybe how many words have you [994] written if you're an automation engineer [995] maybe you enter how many hours did you [997] work today and for every uh hour or [1000] whatnot you know what project did you do [1002] what progress did you make if this is [1004] like in GitHub or something you might [1006] you know if you're you're working with [1007] like a developer that might take the [1009] form of like looking at their commit [1010] history or something there are a lot of [1012] options here but the point is you need [1013] to have some type of system that forces [1015] them to do something at the end of every [1016] day if they don't have one of those [1019] performance will inevitably fall off the [1020] cliff because they'll feel like nobody's [1021] watching them and as great as people are [1024] as I mentioned earlier they're not going [1025] to be intrinsically motivated to work as [1026] hard as you are um so you can't really [1028] expect them to maintain high levels of [1030] performance forever unless they're being [1031] held to it on some level the last thing [1034] that I'm going to mention here is make [1036] the output of this tracking system [1038] public or periodically review the [1041] tracking system why is this important [1043] this is for accountability as I [1044] mentioned earlier um you know if we put [1047] the perform if we put our performance on [1049] display and if we make that performance [1050] public people invariably do better and [1052] this is just a very quick and easy way [1054] to ensure that one your company has a [1055] culture of openness two your company has [1057] a culture of accountability and three [1059] you make as much money as you humanly [1060] can from these staff members doesn't [1062] have to be like degrading or anything I [1063] mean when people hear me say this [1065] they're usually like oh that sounds like [1067] it would be rough or that that sounds [1068] like uh that sounds manipulative or [1070] something like that it's not um this [1072] might take the form of just like you [1074] know it's sop where every time you fill [1076] out your daily uh tracker system it just [1078] dumps into a public slack Channel where [1079] everybody on the team you know sees it [1081] and it's just part of your culture like [1083] hey you know every day I do my daily [1084] accountability work for and at the end [1086] of it we just have a big slack channel [1087] that shows us the Daily accountability [1088] work it doesn't have to just be for work [1090] performance um strictly accountability [1092] performance either it might actually [1093] have some functional utility maybe [1095] because you put a description of what [1096] you did other people in the team can see [1097] what you did maybe they can Pro offer [1099] advice they could help you remove [1100] blockers right as long as you just make [1103] the output of that system public or if [1105] you do something similar by periodically [1107] reviewing with them their performance [1109] maybe on a weekly or monthly basis um [1112] that that performance drop off is not [1113] going to occur and you'll be able to [1114] maintain extremely high op for a long [1116] period of time that actually improves [1118] with time because people get better at [1119] their jobs uh you know if people track [1121] they will improve inevitably that goes [1123] for you I um any business owner and any [1126] staff member and employee at those [1128] businesses so my example here is to dump [1130] responses into a public slack channel [1131] that the rest of your team can see and [1133] alternatively you can set up like a [1134] weekly 30 or 60 Minute one-on-one with [1136] your team member where you go over their [1137] performance you go over blockers they [1139] have and you just hear their General [1141] thoughts on the company um because you [1142] set up a form system before where you [1144] have some type of like daily system that [1146] forces them to track progress you can [1147] literally just open up the spreadsheet [1149] or open up the tracker there and you [1150] guys can just go through it together um [1152] so very very valuable and if I could go [1154] back in time this is exactly how I would [1156] structure my own hiring U for all of my [1158] very first few employees all right so [1160] we've talked a little bit about uh some [1162] Concepts to keep in mind before you make [1164] your hire now we've talked about how to [1166] actually go about structuring the first [1167] few days and or week of a hire's life [1170] the last thing I'm going to talk about [1171] is how do you actually go out there and [1172] get a hire well we're talking about [1174] remote employees specifically and what [1176] I've found is there are six places that [1178] you can find highquality remote [1180] employees if you have scalable systems [1182] to manage them the first is going to be [1185] upwork upwork is very very quick uh it's [1188] like the shortest time to TTL basically [1191] the shortest like time to viable higher [1194] um but the uh unfortunate result of [1196] upwork is a lot of the time it's fast [1199] but can be more expensive what does this [1201] look like well this looks like you [1202] literally log on to upwork.com you [1205] create a client account which is the [1206] account that allows you to post jobs and [1208] then you post a job looking for somebody [1210] you route them either to some form where [1212] you can ask them specific questions [1213] about their output and if you want um [1215] sort of an out-of thebox hiring system [1217] um just feel free to watch my video on [1219] like my my seven figure agency hiring [1220] system that I'll link in one of these [1222] Corners up here um but uh you know just [1226] get them to to pump their data in [1227] through a form uh and you can usually [1228] get a hire within 24 hours assuming that [1230] you're on the ball and you're willing to [1231] talk to people and have them do tasks [1233] pretty quickly uh fivr is sort of in the [1235] same vein although this is primarily [1237] Freelancers um also fast and it's not [1240] very expensive but quality can be rough [1244] so I mean upwork versus Fiverr I would [1245] just say upwork has a higher on average [1247] quality um than Fiverr Fiverr uh can be [1251] a little bit cheaper than upwork but you [1252] know it's sort of like Fast cheap good [1254] pick two the third is indeed on indeed [1257] you're going to find a ton of people [1258] that are like looking for stable 9 to-5 [1260] work uh these are people that are [1262] looking for like corporate jobs and that [1263] sort of deal it's not that you can't [1265] post part-time positions or contract [1266] positions I find they're just a little [1268] bit more difficult and the audience has [1270] catered more towards that like you know [1272] 25 to 35 like uh mid-level corporate [1275] professional who's just like starting to [1276] get a leg up on their career the benefit [1278] to this though is indeed is extremely [1280] scalable uh because you can set up [1282] automated systems that will post for you [1284] um and then we'll uh you know route [1286] people into like a form sequence of [1287] yours that you've velop beforehand so [1289] indeed is [1291] scalable the downset of it is expensive [1294] and it's primarily 9 to5 or corporate [1298] hires Facebook groups are a great place [1301] to hire that a lot of people don't know [1303] about where I would personally hire my [1306] virtual assistants today is basically [1308] exclusively through Facebook groups [1309] because you can get the cheapest prices [1311] and you can also get the best talent the [1314] only downside is you have to work a [1315] little bit [1317] more what do I mean by this well if you [1319] go to Facebook here and then if you just [1321] type in like virtual [1324] assistant group or something let's say [1326] you want to hire a VA um you'll find a [1328] bunch of these groups like Canadian [1329] virtual assistant this is Canadian [1331] specific because I'm in Canada virtual [1333] assistant jobs that sort of deal and uh [1335] these groups essentially allow you to [1337] post VA jobs or they allow you to Source [1339] vas from comments that people leave so [1342] what I would do if I were doing this now [1344] I would go through um check out a bunch [1346] of people that say that they're [1347] interested for a particular job and i' [1348] actually like direct message them and [1349] say hey Shay how's everything going I [1352] noticed that you were interested in a [1353] position like this I have a very similar [1354] position I'd be curious to see you know [1356] what your chops are for instance so [1358] that's personally what I would do for [1359] Facebook groups um another way that you [1361] can hire is in community in community [1364] just means uh you know like one of the [1365] big ways that people um start their [1367] entrepreneurial Journeys nowadays is [1369] through communities there are groups of [1370] like-minded people out there that you [1372] know have done a lot of the same things [1373] that you want to do in order to be [1374] successful and if you go on these [1376] communities and if you join one whether [1377] it's paid or free you can a lot of the [1379] time find people that are really really [1381] good at a specific thing and hire them [1382] for usually a little bit less money than [1384] you'd be able to otherwise for instance [1386] I run a community called makemoney withm [1388] make.com that I mentioned earlier right [1390] um if I just scrolled down here read [1391] every single comment um i' I'd very [1393] quickly get a feel for the competence of [1395] these people um at their particular task [1397] at least for automation engineering um [1399] and I what I would do is I would just U [1401] Mouse over them and then chat with a [1402] person that I'm interested in [1403] potentially working with mention you [1405] know uh that you have a job that you're [1406] considering getting done and then from [1408] that point on this is where of your top [1409] of funnel just treat them the exact same [1411] like you treat any other hire you know [1412] you could even send them a link to a [1414] form that you developed for maybe upwork [1416] Fiverr indeed or Facebook groups and [1418] just have them to fill that out so I say [1420] that here the quality is [1425] fantastic price can be [1429] reasonable you do have to work a little [1432] bit [1433] more and last but not least is cold [1436] email and you can treat cold email the [1438] same way that you're treating Facebook [1439] groups essentially what you can do is um [1441] instead of you doing things through [1443] Facebook or through social media [1444] platforms DMS that sort of thing you can [1446] actually Source people that you might be [1447] interested in working with direct from [1448] LinkedIn and offer them jobs this is [1450] very similar to what recruiters do um [1451] and this is to me is how you get like [1453] the best staff members on the planet but [1455] it's also very very sniper rifle focused [1457] like you have to do a fair amount of [1459] work you have to identify who the person [1460] is you have to make sure they know how [1461] to do what you want to do uh you could [1463] poach them from other companies that are [1465] very similar sorry I just got a call the [1466] point that I'm making with cold email is [1468] this is sort of like your sniper rifle [1471] approach potentially best [1474] quality potentially best price but you [1477] have to work a ton because you know you [1479] have to do the lead source and you have [1480] to do basically everything there is to [1481] know about that um yeah so that's where [1484] I'm at here and then the last thing that [1486] I would do is I would offer them [1488] obviously um a job description job [1490] listing a form or whatever structure [1491] that you have again feel free to check [1493] out my uh seven figure hiring system [1495] video If you're not really familiar with [1496] what that might look like and then you [1497] have to get to do a task for you and [1500] what I mean by task is as I mentioned [1501] previously in my writing company we had [1503] people write a 500-word article uh when [1505] I ran uh when I was an owner a part [1507] owner of a PR Company uh very big [1509] prestigious PR Company we did the exact [1511] same thing it doesn't matter the level [1512] of the business or the size of the [1514] business in our case we sent them a [1516] bunch of emails basically and had them [1518] draft up like good PR responses to each [1520] of these um if you're doing an [1522] automation engineering project for [1524] make.com or zappy or something you could [1526] have them get some Project Specific spe [1528] and then do as much as they can with [1530] those project specifications in say 1 [1531] hour just to see their speed their [1533] attention to detail and all that stuff [1535] the way that you do this is usually will [1536] attach some um part of your form with [1539] like maybe a PayPal or something like [1540] that uh the user will enter their PayPal [1542] you'll mention hey this job is like a [1544] one hour quick little test and we're [1546] going to pay you $25 for it you don't [1548] get everybody to do this job up front of [1551] course you make sure to filter down to [1552] people that you think have good [1554] portfolios or that you might be [1555] interested in initially uh but what you [1557] do after that is you know usually get a [1559] very good understanding or idea of [1561] whether this person is a skills fit and [1563] then and only then can you actually [1565] upgrade that person to an interview and [1567] then worry about culture fits and that [1569] sort of thing afterwards make sure that [1570] their skills are first before you worry [1572] about the culture um and if if their [1574] skills aren't then uh you know make sure [1576] that they're like at least an ambitious [1577] person that you think can grow quickly [1579] and then you can worry about actually [1580] jumping on a phone call with them [1581] jumping on a video call with them [1582] running them through you know what your [1584] company does and and their past [1585] experience and that sort of deal leave [1587] the interviews until the end basically [1588] they're not very predictive of actual [1590] performance all right that is how I [1592] would hire my very first employee if I [1593] could dial back the clock and do it all [1595] over again I hope you guys enjoy this [1596] video had a lot of fun putting it [1598] together I'm going to make this [1598] Whimsical um publicly available so uh [1601] anybody that you know has any questions [1603] about this can just go direct to that [1604] whimsicle read through and not [1606] necessarily just have to like back up [1608] and and trickle forward the video over [1610] and over and over again um if you guys [1611] have any questions about this process if [1613] you guys aren't entirely sure what I [1614] meant by one or some other part just [1616] feel free to drop a comment down below [1618] more than happy to help you out [1619] personally otherwise please like [1621] subscribe do all that fun YouTube stuff [1622] and I'll catch youall

Title: Watch Me Build A PDF Invoice Parsing Flow In Minutes
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here one [1] of the most common requests for [3] automator is hey I have this PDF or this [6] file and I want to parse it and turn it [8] into some s sort of structured data how [11] can we do it in this video I'm going to [12] show you exactly how using a PDF parsing [15] library make.com and artificial [17] intelligence in my specific case we're [19] going to be doing this on invoices but [20] you can apply the exact same approach [21] that I'm going to show you to literally [23] any type of data out there whether it's [25] maybe a resume white paper an ebook an [28] article PDF literally any sort of file [32] type can be converted into structured [33] data using the system that I'm about to [35] show you so if you guys have wanted to [37] level up your Parson game learn a little [38] bit more about Ai and maybe a couple of [40] the cooler features that make.com has [42] that you might not be familiar with this [44] is the video for you stay tuned let's [46] get into [49] it all right so what I have here is I [51] have a Google sheet and inside of this [52] Google sheet I have an invoice URL [55] column where we are going to store URLs [57] of our invoices you can get the URL of [61] your invoice in a variety of ways [63] sometimes you'll also just get the raw [64] file say if it's emailed to you or maybe [66] if it's in a big Google drive or [67] something that the client uploads um but [69] I'm just showing you how to do it in [70] this way and this is probably the more [72] complicated way so if you know how to do [74] it the way that I'm about to show you'll [75] know how to do it in every other way as [76] well then we have um some fields that [79] we're going to just parse the invoice [81] for so we have an amount field which [83] we're going to use um to just store [84] whatever the amount is that that is owed [86] we're also just going to take all of the [88] line items here and then just pay P them [90] in this line items column and then we're [92] also going to um do some fancy text [94] parsing and we're going to extract the [96] uh the from address as well uh we're [98] probably going to use AI for this cuz [99] it's a little more um creative of an [102] exercise in terms of what the invoices [104] themselves actually look like I have [105] them open over here an example might be [108] something like this so this is a PDF [111] from I don't know some service called [112] sliced invoices which has a uh which has [115] a default template available for us here [118] and uh PDFs are kind of tricky to parse [121] you know there are several different [123] types of PDFs and I've explored all [124] sorts of them over my career like you [126] have PDFs with clickable text so for [128] instance this is a PDF with clickable [130] text I can actually double click and I [132] can select the data and actually most of [134] this is like already formatted for us so [136] the parsing is going to be pretty easy [138] um I want to say that the majority of [139] PDFs nowadays are probably like [140] clickable text if they're being exported [142] from some invoice software all the stuff [143] is already done for you but there are [146] also a lot of PDFs out there that do not [148] have clickable text that are essentially [150] just images they're sort of sort of like [152] PNG images or jpgs or whatever and when [154] you Mouse over them um it doesn't [156] actually do anything uh and you can't [157] select it and so because of this there [160] are a variety of different ways to parse [161] PDFs you can parse them through like um [164] if you guys are familiar with optical [166] character recognition basically there [168] are a bunch of services out there that [170] allow you to feed an image and then it [171] will try and make out whatever the [172] letters are so you know we could we [174] could like have Let's Pretend This is a [176] PNG or something or like a JPG right [178] those are those are both image files we [179] could take these image files and we [181] could feed them to some optical [182] character recognition service and then [184] we would say convert to text and they [186] would try to kind of figure out that [187] this is an s that this is an L that [189] that's an i you can imagine because [191] there's like five billion different font [193] choices you know like the the the [196] endpoints um for this optical character [199] recognition and a lot of them are like [200] older Services as well from 5 10 years [202] ago before we started using Advanced AI [204] they're pretty crappy at that and the [205] results from the ocrs are are not very [207] good so that's sort of like one way to [209] do it but another way to do it is um you [211] could just feed in um like the whole PDF [215] into chat GPT or something um GPT 4 [218] seems to do a pretty reasonable job [219] especially if the text on the invoice is [221] selectable like this um so whatever your [224] PDF style is you know will have sort of [226] an effect on on the bottom line but yeah [229] that seems to work okay and then the [231] last thing is you can just use like a [233] like a dedicated PDF parsing service and [236] that's personally what I do nowadays I [238] just use like pet dedicated PDF parsing [240] Services cuz they're super easy and [241] super simple so I'm not yet affiliated [243] with any U dedicated PDF parsing [245] Services I've had a bunch of them reach [247] out to me and try and you know sell me [248] on sponsoring a video and that sort of [250] deal um but I have poked around and I've [252] tried a bunch of different apis and the [254] best one that I found is a probably the [256] simplest one to remember just called [258] pdf. uh [260] pdf. uh basically if I just go to their [262] little website [264] here um Brands themselves is like just [266] the the PDF and all be all that just [268] turns PDFs and apis basically um and [272] it's just very very straightforward they [273] also offer you like 10,000 credits I [275] think for free at the time of this [277] writing uh so you can imagine how like [279] low cost it is on their back and how [280] streamlined and efficient everything is [282] and you can use those 10,000 credits um [285] to do everything that you need to do in [286] you know testing purposes and then once [288] you figured out whether or not this [289] works for you and you want to you know [291] implement it into your Enterprise [292] workflow then you can obviously sign up [293] for a plan and subscribe and that sort [295] of deal but basically um the the purpose [297] why of using these dedicated PDF par [299] platforms is because it just gets the [301] the data into a format that is much [303] better um that you can use for basically [306] anything else later on like if you think [307] about it text is the universal interface [309] right especially nowadays with large [311] language models so if you can just like [313] convert a PDF just into text format [315] doesn't even matter if you lose the [316] formatting it doesn't matter if like a [319] human being would have to like squint [320] and stare at it for 3 hours before [322] making any sense of it you can just feed [323] that into a large language model and it [325] can like process and for reformat the [326] text and extract everything for you and [328] that's sort of like the Bas upon which [330] now U most of the the the PDF parsing [333] flows that I've built out rest upon and [336] that's what I'm going to show you how to [337] do in this video I'm going to show you [338] how to feed in one of these invoices [340] into a PDF parsing service we're going [341] to extract the text we're then going to [343] feed it into AI then we're going to use [344] AI to extract various portions of this [347] text that we are then going to map into [349] columns like amount line items from [350] address Etc and I don't want you guys [354] just to think that this is only doable [356] with invoices you can do this with uh [358] basically any type of PDF off format [360] another common request is doing this [361] with resumés so you know maybe you're [363] like trying to hire somebody or [365] something or maybe you run like some [366] resumé service we can actually just [368] parse the PDF and then feed it into AI [370] extract I don't know like their job [372] history you could extract how long [373] they've been working for what their [376] hobbies are you could obviously like [377] extract keywords if you want to like [378] automatically not allow somebody in or [381] you know automatically Greenlight [382] somebody so so there's a lot a lot that [384] you could do obviously and um yeah [386] that's one of the reasons why I love AI [387] so much and I love these applications [390] so uh what I'll do in this video is I'm [392] going to show you guys just how to take [394] these and then just parse out these [395] three columns but just know that you can [397] add however many columns you want you [398] just need to like add the logic on the [399] AI parsing side and you don't have to [401] use invoices you could use uh more or [403] less anything and then just to reiterate [405] uh you also don't have to do it in this [407] format like you might be getting them as [408] emails um but this is just the hardest [410] way to do it so I figured I'd start with [412] a Google sheet method okay got a [415] scenario open here called Parson invoice [416] add to sheet first thing I'm going to do [418] is I'll just go to sheets and then [420] because we're going to be searching so [421] I'm going to be testing this flow out a [423] bunch I'm going to be using the search [424] rows module so I have my um email [428] address set up over here and then what [429] I'm going to do is I'll just go to my [430] invoice parsing example [432] sheet and then I have to select the [434] sheet name and map all the stuff so bear [436] with [439] me I'm going to select a maximum number [442] of return rows and I'm just going to set [443] that to one and that way if I right [446] click on this and press run this module [447] only I will always get the exact [450] um same invoice and then I can just use [452] this to test so you see the invoice URL [454] I got here was [455] this right and this is the file [457] essentially which is pretty [460] cool okay um there are a couple other [462] things that we need to do but I'll just [464] run I'll run you through the PDF stuff [466] um just go to add and then type pdf. Co [469] and then there are a bunch of endpoints [471] here that you could use right there's [472] convert from PDF convert from PDF to [474] images convert into PDF convert HTML to [476] PDF you can do a lot right they have [477] like a million end points that are PDF [479] specific the one that most people use [481] and the reason why it's first is because [483] uh we're going to convert from a PDF to [485] one of these structured data types and [487] I'll show you like three or four of them [488] just that you could um see what they [490] look like for your use [491] case now when you click on this you're [493] going to have to connect it if you've [495] never connected it before so go to add [497] and then what you're going to have to do [498] is sign up with the pdf. API key the way [501] that you get that is go to app. pdf.com [504] sign up there'll be an API key over here [506] that you can just click copy then once [508] you've copied you can go back to your [510] make scenario just paste it in and then [513] after you've pasted it in um you know [514] you're going to be be left with a [516] connection like this I just called my [517] invoice parsing [519] example okay so there are two options to [522] put in the PDF you can upload a file or [524] you can import a file from a URL now [527] obviously our files are already in url [528] format so it's going to be very easy for [530] us just to paste the URL [533] in um let me just refresh [537] this and then go invoice URL here and [541] then uh we can also add an output file [543] name so I'm just going to do like [546] example for [549] now all right now there are a variety of [552] different ways that you can do this [553] there's a simple endpoint PDF to text [555] simple no layout fast PDF to text which [558] is where they try to preserve the layout [559] of the PDF for you so uh what I what I [562] mean by this I mean like well from is [563] over here on the left right all this [565] stuff is over here on the right they [567] actually are going to try and convert [568] this just into plain text like a plain [569] text file and then just add a bunch of [571] spaces between the two to so that it's [573] still in the same layout um there's no [575] real reason for us to do this because [576] we're just going to feed this in AI so [578] it's more or less meaningless uh you can [580] do PDF to CSV PDF to Json 2 uh Json 2 is [583] just their like new endpoint which [585] converts into Json I haven't actually [587] experimented with any of the Json or CSV [589] ones so we'll do that together uh you [590] can convert into HTML you could also [592] just like turn it into a JPEG or a PNG [594] so one of those like um text list images [596] that I mentioned before and then you can [598] also do like XML Tiff and that sort of [600] deal we're going to do the simplest one [601] to start PDF to [603] text um and then Pages allows you to par [606] specific Pages if you just leave this [607] empty it'll do every single page if the [610] PDF has a password so some invoices may [612] be password protected some Rising Ms may [614] be password protected you put those the [615] password in here if you're trying to do [617] this like on mass or in bulk you can [619] imagine how you might need like a [620] password column to like dynamically map [622] the password to the specific [624] PDF um and then uh you know we want a [628] small task so I'm just going to go to [629] sync but if you're running large batch [631] tasks so these PDFs have like 15 pages [633] or something then select async [635] essentially what's going to happen if [636] you go async is you'll send the request [638] to the server it's not going to Output [640] the the actual like result in this [642] module um you're going to have to go and [644] then grab the result after a certain [646] amount of time um but we're we're not [648] going to do that we're going to select [648] sync which is very simple and very [651] easy and then there are um some other [655] they have like a big list of [656] documentation um they have a bunch of [659] documentation that shows you um how to [661] adjust uh the way that the PDF is parsed [663] using what are called profiles we're not [665] going to do any of that so we're just [666] going to feed that in here and then [668] output links expiration they actually [669] set an an expiration date on the output [672] Link in case you I don't know are doing [674] this at like batch services or in case [676] some of the data is um secure and you [679] don't want to like reveal it you could [680] set this theoretically like one minute [682] the thing that you'd have to do here is [683] you'd have to do something with the data [685] within a minute essentially you'd have [686] to like request that URL that it gives [689] you uh within 60 seconds so in our case [691] I'm just going to leave this to 60 [692] minutes because these are just silly [693] little invoices that are examples that [695] don't really [696] matter then the export type is download [698] a file or Json output I'm going to show [700] you how to do both um but essentially [701] you can either turn this into a file [703] that you download and then parse or you [705] can turn this into [706] Json and uh why don't we actually use [708] Json to start that'll probably be a [710] little [711] simpler okay we should have everything [712] we need I fed the invoice URL in and [715] then I've done the rest of the settings [716] and then we're going to pull that from [717] here so I'm going to click run once [718] let's see what happens [721] all right so our Google Sheets search [723] row module ran and selected the correct [725] URL and then we converted the PDF um and [729] it sent us back a bunch of um a bunch of [732] codes I guess there's a page count so it [734] counted up the number of pages in The [735] PDF um there's an error status and this [738] is false so if this was true maybe you [739] could send up some error handling to do [741] something with it um there's a status [743] there's a file name there's a credits [745] remaining credits how many credits you [747] got left the duration I think the dur [749] duration maybe the number of characters [751] or maybe like the number of milliseconds [752] I don't know but you can see we Ed four [754] credits there so we technically have [756] 9,996 I don't know exactly how they're [758] doing that processing but whatever okay [761] now this is the text that we get we get [763] a bunch of [765] links we get um the title which is [767] invoice we get the payment is due within [769] 30 days from the date of the invoice [770] late payment is subject to fees of 5% [772] per month thanks for choosing demo [774] sliced invoices then we have a from as [778] you can see here we have the inv number [779] we have the due date we have the total [780] due date right the two we have um some [784] line items here is pretty cool then we [786] have the total and the total is what [788] we're going to be extracting um along [790] with let's see here so we are going to [792] be extracting the line items we're going [793] to be extracting the total amount maybe [795] we'll just call this total that'll [796] probably be easier to see and then we'll [798] also try and get the the from address as [800] well and I want I actually want to get [801] the full address I don't just want to [802] get the email address so we may have to [804] do some prompt finagling there but uh [806] yeah you know this is just in a format [807] that we can basically take and now dump [809] into Ai and then AI can like actually [811] parse and extract out the text for us [814] the benefit to doing it this way is you [816] don't need the invoices to always be in [817] the exact same format like previously [819] procedurally if you wanted to parse this [821] you would have to like parse the term [822] invoice number space and then you know [825] however many spaces there are between [826] these two terms you'd have to like match [827] it every time um using you know Reax or [830] something like that but now you don't [832] you don't have to do that you just feed [833] this in Ai and it's a lot simpler so I'm [836] just going to show you how to do this [838] now you the create a completion endpoint [840] just while we're on a roll and then I'll [841] go back through and then I'll run [843] through some of the other data types [844] here which may be a little bit simpler [846] maybe even a little bit [848] harder um there are a variety of models [850] so I'm going to choose the create a [851] completion endpoint uh we could do gbt [855] 40 we could do a very um handsome [858] individuals driving a very cool sports [860] car outside gp2 I don't know why I [862] always leave my freaking balcony door [863] open when I record these videos it's so [865] funny I got to stop doing that uh gbt 40 [867] gbt 40220 [869] 4513 gp4 turbo gp4 I'm going to just [873] choose GPT 40 uh this is like sort of a [875] I don't want to say it's a dumber model [877] but it is kind of a dumber model so [879] we'll see if it works you're a helpful [881] intelligent [883] um let's say data extraction assistant [887] that's what I'll [888] do then we're going to add some messages [891] I'll [892] say you extract excuse me I'm about to [897] sneeze no I'm not you extract data from [902] PDF [903] invoices [905] you'll from PDF um invoices you'll [909] receive [912] a a [914] text we'll just say like a text scrape [917] of of the invoice data and your job is [921] to turn that invoice data into three [926] structured Fields we'll say [929] um [930] total and then line items and then what [934] was the last one here from [938] address um return the results in [944] Json so that looks pretty good to me uh [947] let me just think if I need to do [948] anything [950] else for from address I'm going to say [952] not the email but the actual address of [956] the sender [959] then light items can just be a plain [960] text dump then I'll say using this [965] format and then I'll say [969] total total goes here we'll say uh line [976] items line item string goes here and [980] then we'll do from address and I'll say [984] from address goes here [989] respond only in Jason your first [996] character the first character of your [1001] response should be a opening bracket [1005] okay great the reason why I'm feeding at [1007] all of this information here is because [1009] I don't want to have to go through the [1010] pain in my ass of like teaching it [1012] basically training it with a few [1013] examples um you could and it would [1016] probably be a better choice if you [1017] wanted to train it uh you could feed it [1020] in a couple of example PDFs and then see [1022] what the output is and then add a user [1024] prompt for your instructions which would [1026] be something like this and then an [1028] assistant prompt sorry another user [1030] prompt with an example then an assistant [1032] prompt with like what you want it to [1033] output and it even if you provided one [1035] example it would do a really good job of [1037] um of adhering to [1039] that okay now what I'm going to do is I [1041] will feed in the let's [1044] see the body okay so it's just body so [1049] now I'm just going to feed in the [1051] body which is I believe just going to be [1054] everything I hope it's going to be [1056] everything I don't know I guess we'll [1057] find [1058] out um max tokens I I said 496 here um [1063] but that's just because that's like the [1064] maximum it'll ever output I'm going to [1066] change the temperature to 7 I just find [1068] it a lot faster and easier to do it that [1070] way and yeah I'm just going to give this [1072] a run and we're going to see what it [1074] outputs the reason we're doing this in [1076] Jason by the way yeah so it already [1078] screwed up seed add of these three [1079] little back Texs I hate when it does [1081] that [1084] um but the reason why uh we're doing in [1087] Json just so we can parse it later which [1089] is really nice so the total was 9350 [1092] which is good the line items is this the [1095] from address is demo sliced invoices [1097] sweet a okay great I got the from [1099] address and stuff like that as well [1100] which is perfect the only thing we need [1101] to do is we need to change it that it [1103] does not [1105] output do not output [1110] backtick Json or any other sort of [1113] formatting okay I'm just writing a very [1116] explicit instructions here then what I'm [1118] going to do next is I'm going to add a [1119] parse Json module so go to parse Json [1122] drag that puppy here um you know you may [1124] not even need to do this anymore I mean [1127] gp4 keeps on changing [1130] um you they keep on changing how they do [1133] this I believe you can now potentially [1134] even use Jason object but I'm just going [1136] to use Jason here cuz I love wasting [1138] credits no I'm just more comfortable [1140] using it this way and if there's one [1142] thing that I know it's that um make.com [1145] is a platform where just learn how to do [1147] it once like you should obviously be [1150] constantly improving your skills but if [1151] you know how to do it then do what you [1152] know how to do um a lot of this AB a lot [1155] of this complexity is going to be [1157] abstracted away from the customer or the [1159] client or whoever you're building this [1160] for they're not going to see any of it [1162] okay great now I have the output here [1163] which is nice we have a total line items [1165] and from address and now what I can do [1167] with this is I can [1169] update a row which means I can go back [1171] into my Google sheet and then I can add [1173] that data so I'm going to go to invoice [1178] parsing example [1182] here and then I just have to map the [1184] rest of this like I did in the first [1188] module what we'll do for row number is [1191] we'll go [1192] here select the row number from the very [1194] first module which actually outputs the [1196] row [1197] number and then not going to update the [1199] invoice URL cuz we already have it what [1201] I'm going to update is the total the [1202] line items and the from [1209] address [1214] okay so let's give this one final run [1217] and let's see how it [1220] performs if I go back to my Google sheet [1222] now you'll see that I've now extracted [1224] all of the three pieces of information [1226] that I wanted to the Total Line on in [1228] the from address and that looks pretty [1229] good to me [1231] honestly um I mean we could change the [1233] format of this maybe we don't want you [1235] know one dot z00 Web Design This is a [1238] sample description but my whole idea [1240] here was I was just going to pump in the [1241] line in them so that you know if anybody [1243] wanted to like double check this later [1244] that they could easily you know go back [1246] and and do the math um we could also [1249] like extract taxes as I mentioned ear [1251] you can extract whatever the hell you [1251] want you could do taxes you could do the [1253] due date you could do the invoice date [1254] you could you know grab I don't know [1257] like if does this include Bank [1259] information if so add their Bank details [1261] here um what is the payment due policy [1264] right what is the late payment subject [1266] fee right you can extract however many [1268] columns you want here I'm just doing it [1271] um I'm doing fewer because I just want [1273] to show you guys how to do it and then [1275] all of you guys have your own use cases [1276] so that's that okay so we've done it on [1279] one example one example is never enough [1281] to like verify that this works so what I [1283] want to do is I want to run this through [1285] another example one that's much more [1287] complicated and see if still works uh [1289] and then if it doesn't work then see [1291] what sort of changes we have to make to [1292] allow this system to scale as needed and [1295] essentially handle like multiple [1296] different forms of of invoices and data [1299] now keep in mind you may not have to do [1300] this for your use case you may be [1302] receiving all of your invoices in the [1303] exact same format and all that stuff so [1305] I don't feel compelled to I guess is [1306] what I'm saying now what I'm seeing here [1309] is this is a really really long invoice [1311] this is like five pages or something so [1313] realistically the invoice is really just [1316] on the first page [1319] and then everything else is like a bunch [1321] of silly stuff that's probably like [1323] required by the government because this [1324] is um excuse me Canada Post it's sort of [1327] like uh I don't know like Federal like [1330] postage thing probably in the US uh if [1332] you're more familiar with that so what [1334] I'm going to do is I'm actually only [1335] going to grab the first page of this um [1337] we could even have a rule that says like [1339] if the URL contains Canada Post or [1340] something only grab the first page uh [1342] you can imagine how you know you're [1343] probably not going to receive invoices [1345] from like everything and everybody under [1347] the sun um so that that seems pretty [1349] pretty reasonable to me so why don't we [1351] do [1353] that so here's a comma separated list of [1356] page indices or ranges to process first [1359] page is zero so I'll say if and then I'm [1361] going to say contains URL and then it'll [1364] say Canada [1365] Post then uh let's output zero otherwise [1369] let's output um empty [1374] string or null I don't know I'm just [1376] going to do empty string so logic here [1379] um is it's going to check this invoice [1381] URL which is this over here Canada post- [1384] whatever then if it contains the term [1386] Canada [1388] Post then it is going to um output zero [1391] which is going to say hey we only want [1393] you to look at the first page it's one [1394] of those Canada Post invoices which [1395] sucks otherwise it's going to put an [1397] empty string and the idea is an empty [1399] string should just be nothing um if [1401] that's not nothing then we may have to [1402] use a different character here sometimes [1404] different apis treat these things [1405] differently uh but that should be okay [1407] uh for our purposes [1409] and then I'm still going to do the Json [1411] output export and we're going to give [1412] all this a try and then um we're going [1415] to feed into open AI we're going to [1417] parse it and then we're going to update [1418] a row what I'm going to do first is I'm [1419] just going to test this on these two I [1421] just want to make sure that the parsing [1422] is good before I send everything over to [1424] open AI it's sort of a good habit to get [1427] in or sorry it's a good um thing to get [1429] in the habit of doing and you see here [1431] that this pars two um two rows sorry one [1435] row uh so I just got my old sample one [1437] so I'm just going to do two two here and [1438] I'll see how a batch job looks like when [1441] we sent [1442] two doesn't look like there was any more [1445] time that it took which is pretty [1448] cool okay so looks like this um parsed [1451] out all the text basically instantly um [1453] I thought maybe there would be some [1454] issue with this but doesn't look like [1455] there was any issue at all and just [1458] because I'm testing this I'm I'm just [1459] going to cut this down here and then I'm [1463] going to put this up again just so we [1464] can just get one result on this next [1467] test I don't actually want to run this [1468] twice [1469] I'm very um careful with the credit [1470] usage [1472] clearly and then I'm going to feed this [1474] into open Ai and let's just Parts the [1476] Json before we update the row let's just [1478] do this incrementally at every [1483] step [1484] okay all right so the total is here line [1488] items are here from address is [1491] here um client one client two sample [1493] business name address one Barry Ontario [1497] l4m uh 3c2 let me just double check that [1500] this is [1503] correct what I would like is I would [1507] like this however probably because this [1511] is client one client two sample business [1513] name it's probably just pulling that I [1515] wish we could have like an actual [1517] address that would be so much [1519] simpler yeah so the reason why it's [1521] pulling this is because it's attempting [1524] to um it just doesn't realize that this [1527] is like an example that this system put [1528] in uh on a real invoices you presumably [1530] would have an actual client name here [1532] right hence why it's pulling that uh [1534] that in is the from address as opposed [1536] to this this should kind of be the the [1538] from address but say Levy that's all [1541] right we're just using an example any [1543] invoice that you guys use on your own [1544] end is not going to include that I would [1547] imagine okay there is another issue here [1549] the issue is this text is like formatted [1551] quite perfectly so we actually have a [1553] dollar sign here um we have a dollar [1556] sign here too that I'm thinking so there [1558] are a couple things we could do you [1561] could go on the Google sheet side of [1562] things and then you could change the [1564] formatting of the text so that it's like [1567] dollar and then um this won't be a big [1570] deal and then you can still perform like [1571] text operations on this um I think like [1574] multiplication operations and stuff I [1576] wonder if we do five if that's going to [1578] work no it's not going to work so [1579] actually one more thing we have to do is [1580] we have to strip out this dollar sign um [1583] and then we we'll just do the formatting [1584] on this end the reason why I want to [1586] strip out the dollar sign is because [1587] right now this is sort of a string I [1588] don't really actually want a string um [1590] we can output it from the service fine [1592] if it's a string uh but I I just want to [1595] like turn this into [1598] a um I want to turn this just into a [1600] number so instead of like dollar sign 17 [1602] comma 813 57 it's like 17813 .57 instead [1608] that's going to be pretty important [1610] because if you ever want to perform like [1611] text operator sorry numerical operations [1613] on this data later if you want to pull [1615] it back into make.com you're going to [1617] have to do this text formatting step [1618] anyway so why don't we just solve that [1620] problem right now I'm going to say set [1622] multiple variables I'll drag that here [1625] and then what I'm going to do is I'll [1627] say strip dollar let's say strip [1632] total okay what we have to do is we have [1634] to feed in the output that we get from [1636] the Json module and then we have to um [1640] basically remove the dollar sign and [1644] there are I believe a couple of ways to [1646] do this I don't actually remember all of [1649] them I think what we could probably do [1652] is format number maybe parse [1655] number so we might actually just be able [1657] to use a parse number module feed in the [1660] total and then get the strip total I'm [1662] going to test this and I'm going to use [1664] this exact string on my test just to [1667] verify that this works so let's say we [1669] got this the number is perfect that's [1672] exactly what I wanted fantastic so what [1675] we can do then is on the last module [1677] instead of feeding the total from here [1679] we'll feed in the total from here which [1680] will include that strip total which [1681] would be much easier for [1683] us all right great so that looks good uh [1686] why don't we go and run this from end to [1689] end now on the Canada Post [1694] data let's go back here and you see that [1698] we now have the data formatted but you [1700] see how it's on the right the reason why [1702] it's on the right is because it's [1703] actually like formatted it's just a [1704] number and then we the Google Sheets if [1707] we go to form format and then go number [1709] and then um US dollar Google Sheets is [1712] doing the formatting for us so now we [1714] could theoretically multiply this by [1715] five or 10 or 100 we can't do that here [1719] because this is still technically you [1721] know a piece of uh piece of text it's a [1723] string and now what I'll do sort of as [1726] my final Act is I'll go to maximum [1728] number of return rows we'll go [1731] two and then we're going to run it on [1733] both of these puppies [1738] that was number one and then looks like [1740] gp4 is going to be the vast majority of [1743] the the time usage here but that's okay [1746] and then you'll see now that um the text [1748] is is formatted or sorry the total is [1751] now formatted as a number which is nice [1753] and then we have all the line items from [1755] the invoices that we received previously [1757] now whether or not this is particularly [1758] interpretable I don't know but as I [1759] mentioned to you previously you can uh [1761] you can train the model pretty easily to [1762] deliver you the exact format that you [1764] want you just need to provide a couple [1765] of examples of of before and after and [1767] if you're not how to do that you can [1768] watch any one of my videos on AI text [1770] processing I probably have like 15 of [1771] them up um but yeah that's more or less [1775] it what I'll do now is I'm just going to [1776] play around a little bit with the [1777] various formats of um invoice to PDF [1780] just so you guys can see what's going on [1781] how this works um remember how [1783] previously there was PDF to text simple [1786] no layout fast what I want to do now is [1788] I want to show you guys PDF to [1790] text which will include the layout which [1792] is going to be really interesting so [1794] what I'm going to do is I'm going to [1795] unlink this and then we'll go one [1799] returned [1800] row I'm going to run this [1804] puppy this took a lot longer and it used [1806] more credits but you can see now that [1809] this text is actually laid out just like [1810] a real invoice is and you know now that [1813] I think about it this might actually [1814] help AI determine what's what so maybe [1817] this is what you feed into AI if you're [1819] comfortable spending a little bit more [1820] time and credits um making something [1822] happen presumably the formatting of this [1825] text like the words and the the the [1827] sentences and the words that are next to [1829] each other are probably more relevant to [1830] each other they're sort of conceptually [1831] categorized as a group so maybe the [1833] model would do better um with that than [1834] with the previous [1836] flow so that was PDF to text we could do [1838] PDF to Json 2 let's give that a try this [1842] is probably going to use some internal [1845] model to format stuff as well I don't [1847] know so we go documents um and now [1849] everything's fed um it's sort of like [1851] encapsulated within this Json so this [1853] page count page index whatever and then [1856] objects value we've essentially broken [1858] all of this stuff down into um what [1861] looks like uh tabular data where we have [1864] the customer number invoice [1868] number um customer reference number [1872] customer reference 2 right I'm just [1873] going to open up one of these in the [1875] middle here that's probably more [1878] recognizable let me see here okay we [1880] have some prices here which is nice so [1883] if I go [1884] before you'll see this Json is now [1886] formatted so basically what what it did [1887] is is it took this whole thing and then [1889] tried to convert this into like an a key [1892] and then a value key and then a value [1895] key and then a value and the idea here [1897] is that data may be easier for you to [1898] parse procedurally if you get the exact [1900] same invoice every single time or exact [1902] same format every single time um you [1904] could easily just say oh okay every time [1906] we run this I want I always want row 20 [1908] column 2 or something then you don't [1910] really have to use AI to do the [1911] formatting for [1912] you and then um there's CSV as well CSV [1917] will be pretty similar it's just going [1918] to turn all of this stuff into comma [1920] separated value which you can then [1921] upload to Google Sheets directly um but [1923] just keep in mind that like you [1925] know this may not necessarily be more [1927] parsable basically we've just added a [1929] bunch of random spaces wherever their [1931] proprietary process sees fit which is [1933] pretty interesting um but you know you [1935] might be able to feed this into a Google [1937] sheet and then see where that goes why [1939] don't I try down [1943] here so if I try and separate this then [1945] I get this and then I think if I go [1951] to data oh split text in the columns [1954] here then now I sort of have it all in [1955] like column format granted this is still [1957] not super meaningful just keep in mind [1959] that you know PDF um parsers and [1961] processors they all process things using [1963] their own Super proprietary method and [1966] uh whether or not that method actually [1967] translates to like good csvs like if [1970] it's too good to be true probably is [1971] it's not going to like turn this into a [1972] perfect Google sheet every time and yeah [1974] there are a variety of other formats [1975] down here as well I also mentioned that [1978] um right now we're importing the file [1979] from the URL but a lot of the time [1981] you're going to be getting data directly [1982] from like an email or something right so [1984] how exactly do you do that how do you [1986] get data from an email um if you know [1989] instead of it being like this instead of [1991] it being a URL it's instead like like a [1994] file that you have to download or [1996] something well I'll show you how um the [1998] first step is we're going to get this [2001] URL from the Google Sheets output right [2004] so what I'm going to do next is I'm [2005] going to go http [2007] and then I will get a file from a given [2011] URL I'm going to feed in the URL of the [2014] invoice [2015] here I'm going to unlink this so I'm [2017] only testing these [2018] two then I'm going to click run ones and [2022] what I ended up getting is I ended up [2023] getting a bunch of data at this buffer [2025] code page binary format which may not [2027] mean anything to you but all this really [2029] is is this is just a translation of this [2031] from English into binary basically like [2033] a machine language uh that machine [2036] parsers will use to rebuild a p PF on [2038] the back end and now anytime you have a [2040] download a file module as a previous [2042] step in a flow and then a subsequent [2044] step requires like a file to be uploaded [2047] you can just um automatically map it [2048] it'll automatically find the downloaded [2050] file module for you in that format if [2052] you go to map here you'll see what it's [2053] really doing it's feeding in the binary [2056] data here as the data field and the [2057] output file name here is the uh is the [2059] file name but this will work exactly the [2062] same as what we were doing previously so [2064] I'm just going to go to PDF to text no [2066] layout fast [2068] then sorry I have to do this twice [2069] because sometimes I'm a little too quick [2071] for [2073] make and then essentially what we've [2075] done is we' fed the exact same data in [2077] it's just instead of pulling it from a [2079] um file URL uh we're actually doing the [2081] downloading ourselves and maybe this is [2084] good because maybe then you can do [2085] something else with this I don't know [2087] maybe you can store this data somewhere [2089] or maybe you can download a file onto [2090] your server right they variety of other [2092] flows that you can use but for the [2094] purposes of this demonstration I'm just [2096] going to go back to importing a file [2099] from the URL and selecting this source [2101] and then I'm going to download this as [2102] the blueprint for you guys so that [2104] anybody that watches this that wants to [2105] use this as sort of like their [2107] inspiration uh can do so pretty easily [2110] so let's just export this [2111] blueprint awesome and we have it now [2115] cool well I hope you guys enjoyed that [2116] video had a lot of fun putting it [2117] together this is how to essentially take [2119] a PDF um any sort of PDF whether it's an [2121] invoice or a resume or I don't know even [2124] like a white paper and then turn it into [2126] structured data using a p F parser and [2128] make.com oh and artificial intelligence [2130] don't forget the like Galaxy siiz brains [2133] that are humming on servers 24/7 that [2134] make all this possible if you guys have [2136] any questions uh feel free to leave them [2138] down below as a comment otherwise like [2139] subscribe do all that fun stuff and I'll [2141] catch you on the next video thanks

Title: Watch Me Design A Monday.com CRM For A Shuttle Service Company
[0] what's going on everybody in this video [1] I'm going to be designing a multi-step [3] CRM and project management system for a [6] shuttle booking services company this [8] was requested to me by one of the [11] community members in makemoney withth [13] make.com and it's probably like the most [15] complicated type of CRM or project [17] management system you build I'm going to [19] do in monday.com uh and I thought that [21] by tackling this I would essentially [23] give anybody that watches this video the [25] tools that they need in order to design [26] any sort of CRM or project management [28] system for their own business cuz as our [30] going to be less complicated than this [31] so I'm not going to lie this is a little [33] bit on the drier end of the videos that [34] I've recorded it's a little bit more [36] Theory I'm doing some flow charting I'm [37] sort of walking you through how to set [39] up the logistics of connect and [40] relationship boards but I'd still [42] consider this extraordinarily valuable [44] if you are either running a business [45] that has a little bit more complexity on [47] the Crum or the project management side [49] or you're Building Systems for other [50] people and you just always wanted to [52] know how to juggle more complicated [54] systems with like orders and customers [56] and agents and and bookings and that [57] sort of deal so that's something [59] something you guys want to appre on this [60] is the video for you stay tuned and [61] let's get into [65] it the real juice is probably about [67] halfway through this video where I'm [68] going to go through monday.com and show [70] you guys actually how to set up one of [72] these systems you're SOL from scratch uh [74] I also think the real value here is I'm [75] going to run you through my thought [76] process at every step I haven't solved [78] this problem yet so I'm going to be [80] solving this problem in real time and [81] I'm also just going to be guiding you [82] guys through uh you know what I think [84] and and why I think it question that I [86] received that prompted this whole video [88] was from the lovely Rush futurz [90] he said regarding the question I [92] mentioned during the weekly office hours [93] I do a weekly office hour as part of my [95] community offering where I answer [97] questions I show people how to set up [98] their automation business all that stuff [100] so during one of these weekly office [101] hours Rush asked uh hey I'm dealing with [104] a vehicle shuttle service business often [107] travel agencies or companies book [108] shuttle services for their guests or [110] Executives which leads to two main [112] challenges number one sometimes there [114] are different passengers and Bookers [116] frequently the person booking the [118] service is not actually the one using it [121] and number two there are multiple orders [123] with varying addresses since we work [125] with agencies they often need to book [127] Services multiple times with different [129] addresses each time this becomes a [132] challenge in designing the CRM system in [134] my situation there are also some cases [135] where single booking involves picking up [137] passengers from different locations and [138] transporting them to a common [139] destination however I think this might [140] be too complex or uncommon for most [142] people so we can skip discussing this [144] aspect um the reason why I I wanted to [147] do this is because I think this [148] illustrates very well complexities in [150] designing crms for uh like sort of [153] uncommon business models like it's easy [155] enough to design a CRM or a project [156] management system for a very simple [158] business like um I don't know content [160] writing is a good example where [161] typically you only really have like [163] maybe a list of clients and then like a [164] list of the Articles uh but for [167] something that's more complex something [168] that has more moving parts and something [169] that has a few exceptions you need to [170] keep track of um this this booking [173] shuttle service CRM or or tracker [175] whatever we want to call it uh this is [177] about as uh as as complicated as one of [180] these systems can get so if you learn [181] how to do a system like this then you'll [183] easily be able to do any other system [185] later on down the line and whether [187] you're building out a CRM or a project [188] manager for yourself or whether you're [190] doing it for a company maybe a sort of [191] like like an operations person or or a [193] process person um these skills are are [195] extremely invaluable if I did not know [197] how to build crms or project management [199] systems I would not have been able to [200] scale U my content writing company to [202] seven figures ain't no way in hell [204] because just having a good system [207] allowed us not to hire like probably [209] five people five project managers those [212] would have crushed our margins and [213] reduced our ability to grow and nowadays [215] honestly like I don't even know if [216] people really even need project managers [218] for digital agencies at least smaller [221] digital agencies because they can just [222] get away with having like a really good [223] CRM really good project manager um and [226] you know that'll that'll just do most of [227] it for you sorry really loud car okay so [230] uh what I'm going to do here is we need [232] to this is a little more complex so I [234] can't just like Dive Right into um what [237] I'm going to be using to build a site [238] which is monday.com a little more [240] complex so what I need to do is I need [241] to flowchart this first or I need to [243] like basically build like like a like a [245] data structure almost I'm going to talk [247] you guys through my Approach for this I [248] haven't done this yet this is like my [249] first stab at it so you'll see my [251] thought process in real time sort of the [253] decisions that I'm making I'm not going [255] to say that the decisions I'm going to [256] make are the perfect ones there may be [258] better ways to accomplish the same thing [260] but uh you know my way is certainly [262] going to accomplish the end result and [264] hopefully this is going to help you guys [265] when you're faced with a similar problem [267] you know just walk through whatever [268] process that I'm using for this um for [271] your own business or you know for your [272] own request so first off we have two [275] very important pieces of info I'm just [276] going to open up Whimsical over here [277] this is my flowchart two very important [279] piece of information number one [282] different passengers and Bookers [283] frequently the person booking the [285] service is not the one using it and [287] number two multiple orders with varying [288] addresses since you work with agencies [290] they often need to book Services [292] multiple times with a different address [293] each time this becomes a challenge in [295] designing the CRM [297] system so we don't know um anything [300] aside from this this is very general [301] scope and a lot of the time if you're [303] working um as like an automation [305] business or you're working as an [306] operations business this is basically [308] the only scope you're going to get and [309] that's okay you just need to make sure [310] the system conforms to a couple of very [312] simple um like foundational principles [315] and you can build in like the rest of [316] all the the functionality later but as [318] long as you set it up right from the [320] beginning that's all that matters so [322] normally um and I'm going to be doing [324] this in monday.com so I haven't fully [325] set up Monday yet but I'll just do it [327] with you guys once I'm done this [329] normally [330] uh you want to minimize complexity as [332] much as humanly possible and so that's [334] sort of my guiding principle here I know [336] for sure no matter what we're going to [338] need to have a few different um you [341] almost think of them as databases a few [342] different like lists or tables we're [344] going to need to have a list for [346] passengers so people that are physically [348] taking a ride and we're also going to [351] need to have a list for U Bookers or I'm [353] I'm probably going to call them agents [355] in this case because the person booking [357] the service is not always the one using [359] it and because if you think about it [360] there's probably some uh functional [362] utility like there's probably some [363] benefit to having Bookers and passengers [365] right also I'm trying to think about the [367] relationships between these one Booker [369] could probably have multiple passengers [370] of their booking and then one passenger [372] is probably going to go one Booker or [374] zero Bookers and then what else we need [376] here is is we need some way to represent [377] an order and the way that I'm thinking [379] about this off the top of my head is I I [381] can imagine how uh we would have an [383] order and in an order we would relate [386] each order to a passenger in a Booker so [390] the entire success of the system is [391] going to hinge on our ability to make [393] use of what are called like [394] relational uh queries between uh tables [398] monday.com specifically calls them [400] boards uh and so what we're going to be [402] doing is we're going to be connecting [404] different boards together like kind of [406] linking them together based off of [409] passengers agents and then orders so [414] every order is going to have a passenger [416] and then an optional agent right [419] sometimes pass passers are going to book [420] the service themselves other times [422] Bookers or sorry agents are going to [423] book the service for [425] passengers but at the end of the day the [428] number one thing that you know is is [429] important for the system is to have a [430] list of orders and then uh what we can [433] do is we could sort the list of orders [435] by date so that anybody on the team will [440] know um you know like uh the next order [443] is June 20th at 9:30 at this location [446] right so trying to think about it from [448] like a simple a simple perspective as [449] possible okay so that was a bunch of [451] word vomit but what would this actually [453] look like in practice well uh we're [455] going to have let's use this because [457] this is sort of like a like a [459] database so we're going to have [461] orders so we're going to have a a board [464] full of [465] orders then we're also going to have a [468] board for [472] passengers and then we're also going to [473] have to have a board for [476] agents and the way that this works is [480] I'm going to use some arrows [482] here in order for there to be an order [486] there needs to be a passenger so [488] basically every order will have at least [489] at minimum one passenger and then um you [493] know agents is sort of not 100% required [496] oops sorry looks like I deleted one of [498] the uh the arrows [499] there so peners to orders and then [502] agents to orders this isn't 100% [505] required so I'm just going to use a dash [506] to to illustrate this this is sort of [508] optional and then we also need there to [510] be an association between passengers and [513] agents so let me just draw a little [515] arrow over here and then I'm also going [517] to draw an arrow going back and so um [520] this is not 100% required we don't need [523] to have an association between [524] passengers and agents there's going to [526] be some instances in which um you know [528] an order comes in that has a passenger [530] but that doesn't have an agent and then [531] there's also going to be a bunch of [532] instances where like an agent might have [534] multiple passengers so uh I don't think [536] there's really a good way for me to [538] illustrate like the one to many relation [539] a ship here but I'm just going to use [540] this sort of um [542] diagrammatically okay now we have a very [545] you know this is a very simple sort of [547] um diagram and the reason I did it is [549] just because I want I want us to be able [550] to keep this in our mind I don't want us [551] to have to like constantly be trying to [553] remember kind of the structure here this [555] just uh stops us from having to bounce [557] us around in our working memory and what [559] we need to do is we need to Define some [560] fields for the orders for the passengers [562] and for the agents now the way that I [564] personally like to do this in Whimsical [566] is I just add like a little sticky note [569] and then I will just list out the fields [571] that I I think that we need so for [573] orders for sure we're going to have to [575] do um [577] passenger and basically order is going [580] to be a um we're going to connect an [583] order to a passenger and so every order [585] is going to have a passenger of some [587] kind we're obviously going to need to [589] have a location because really like the [591] order is the location right like pick me [592] up here and pick me up there actually [594] we're going to need u a pickup location [597] we're actually going to need a [598] destination location [601] and then we're going to probably want to [604] have a type of some kind the type is [607] just going to be a simple field that [608] determines whether or [610] not um this [612] is uh like a passenger [617] booked or agency [620] booked and then if it's agency booked [622] we're also going to need to have like an [624] agency [625] field now um because we know very little [628] about the rest of the system [629] I'm going to leave the number of fields [631] there but you can also imagine how you [634] could do anything with this assuming [635] that we're getting orders from an online [637] system we could build out like uh like a [639] revenue tracker so every order could [641] have a revenue associated with it for [642] instance every order could also have a [644] driver associated with it for instance [647] actually now that I think about a driver [648] is probably a good idea to have um I'm [650] just going to call this the assign field [652] well no let's call this a driver field [654] and basically the the driver is going to [656] be an asse field that tells us who is [659] responsible for managing that order [661] that's pretty straightforward um we also [664] need a time now that I'm thinking about [666] this as well so we need to pick up [669] time so let me just rearrange this so [672] that it's maybe a little bit [675] simpler and so that we have all the [677] information that we need um and you know [680] instead of agency let me just go agent [682] because realistically um agent is a more [685] general term that I think will cover us [687] uh yeah so anyway as I mentioned uh you [689] could like Revenue you could store um I [691] don't know you can even store like [692] margins you could have like earnings you [693] could have profit per order if you're [695] paying the driver like a fixed rate [696] based off distance you could do things [699] like uh you pump in the pickup location [701] and the destination location into Google [702] Maps every time any order is created you [704] figure out the distance between the two [706] and then you like pay the [707] driver some pro-rated like distance [710] amount um between like the the pickup [712] and the destination location times two [714] or or whatever maybe you have some [715] internal Raider system to figure this [716] out this is basically what what [718] platforms like uber and whatnot do do [719] under the hood they just have all of [721] their own data they don't need to call [722] the Google Maps API CU they have their [723] own so yeah this is what um an order is [726] going to be and then you can put in all [728] the information in the whole wide world [730] um aside from that but this information [731] is specific to the order right now we [735] also want some information for the [737] passenger actually let me put that up [739] here maybe it'll be a little bit easier [742] to see and distinguish which is which [743] here and we're also going to want some [745] uh information for the agent so the [748] passenger obviously is now data that is [750] specific to this person so we're going [751] to want like a first [753] name we're going to want a last [758] name let's think we're going to want an [760] email address we're going to want a [761] phone number [763] um maybe we have a list of preferences [765] so maybe every passenger um when they [767] fill out their form just says hey you [769] know like do you have any preferences of [770] your ride do you want it I don't know [772] quiet do you want like the person to [773] talk do you want I'm not sure but [776] essentially you you uh you can just put [778] in some ideas sorry you can put in some [781] preferences about how you would like [782] your ride to be right I think Uber [784] probably does that nowadays or maybe [785] lift does it or one of those [787] platforms [790] um you could obviously do like Source [792] you could ask uh you know where where [794] they found you from and and you could do [795] all that but I'm not going to focus on [797] that um for agents uh presumably like [801] company name is [803] important uh and this is going to be [804] sort of like the primary field upon [806] which we decide whether or not it's a [807] new agent or not um um we could do first [810] name as well last name as well [813] email address phone [818] number and then this is probably all the [821] information I'm going to put in for the [822] agents for now um maybe there'll be some [825] more fields that come up but you know [827] regardless of whatever CRM or project [828] manager you're using there are also some [829] additional fields that they basically [831] put on every um every type which sorry [834] every uh field sorry good lord it's [837] early every [839] row which is usually like the date [841] updated or like the date created or a [844] creation log of who the person is or [846] that sort of thing you can also imagine [848] how um if we have like a sales team or [850] something we can assign salespeople to [852] agents maybe those sales people are [854] responsible for trying to sell the agent [856] something we can have like an assign [857] field a lot of options here but this is [859] good enough for our simple system and [861] essentially these are the foundational [862] principles that we're going to use to [863] build out the rest of this flow uh and [866] then once we have these foundational [867] principles you can just add whatever you [868] want so we're going to have orders [870] passengers and agents it's going to be [871] sort of like a like a three-step system [873] um and now that we have like a loose [875] understanding of what's going to go on [876] I'm just going to jump into Monday and [877] start building this out so why don't we [879] say uh why don't we just call this first [881] board [883] orders uh essentially Monday is just [885] guiding me through some onboarding so [886] I'm just going to skip all [889] this we'll just go X Y and [894] Z and let's not do any [897] automations and I'm also going to going [899] to run through the uh board connection [900] for Monday I'm going to guide you guys [902] through basically everything I haven't [904] verified my email yet so I might have to [906] do that in order to do automation so let [908] me just jump over here and do [913] it cool looks good to me all right so we [917] have our orders board um I'm going to [920] want to create two more boards so I'm [923] going to want to call one [925] agents I'm also going to want to call [928] this one if I duplicate this again uh [933] passengers now we have a bunch of random [935]  on this board we need to fix [938] Monday will separate data into groups [940] not all crms or project management [942] systems are the same but this is what [943] Monday does so I'm just going to delete [946] all of [947] this so no completed uh groups for us [951] and I'm going to close this onboarding [952] stuff so it doesn't pop up every time [955] and I'm just going to call like the main [957] one like Main I don't really see any [959] reason to separate these into groups so [961] for me that's that's not really [962] necessary or [964] required okay the way that I'm going to [967] um do orders is if you think about it [969] like we need one of these fields to be [971] the the primary key so to speak we need [973] one field um that is always going to be [975] different than all of the other fields [978] so if you think about it we can't do [980] address because if we receive multiple [982] orders from the for the same address [984] then uh they'd sort of collide there'd [986] be like multiple orders with the exact [987] same name and it would be difficult to [988] filter and difficult to search so what I [991] do in in situations like this is I will [993] concatenate two or more Fields together [995] um so you know I will usually do like in [998] this case it would be like a it' be like [999] a location and then it'd be like a date [1001] and a time um and presumably there [1003] aren't going to be two people um that [1006] are being picked up at the same date and [1007] time that are going to a particular [1009] location if you're afraid of collisions [1011] and if your order system is even bigger [1012] than that you could also do like [1013] location date time um name of the [1015] passenger or something like that or [1016] phone number of the passenger um you [1018] could ALS like assign just some random [1020] ID to every single one of these and then [1021] worry about having the the data [1023] elsewhere that's totally doable um but [1026] yeah that's what I'm going to do here [1027] just to to make it really simple uh the [1029] way that you do this is you need to go [1031] to let's see change item [1035] terminology and then I'm going to say um [1040] order [1042] instead so this is an [1044] order uh this one here is going to be [1047] agents which is okay [1050] so we don't need to necessarily do [1051] anything fancy [1053] there then this one here is going to be [1061] passengers this is going to be passenger [1063] okay lovely we don't need X Y and Z so [1066] let's just delete [1067] these I'm going to create a um an [1070] example order and I'm just going to add [1072] in like some location we'll say like [1075] 29th pen drive Avenue [1080] uh what are our postal codes like in the [1081] United [1083] States uh something like that probably I [1086] don't actually know uh let's do [1088] Portland Oregon this that looks [1095] nice and why don't we do um the current [1098] time so we'll like do [1100] 8:30 [1103] a.m. June [1106] 20th this will be reasonable to to uh to [1109] put in uh we don't actually need to see [1110] all that we just want something that's [1111] reasonably unique so I'm just going to [1113] cap it out here we see the address okay [1115] so we need a couple of other fields um [1117] the first other field we're going to [1118] need is if we go back to a shuttle [1120] service CRM we're going to want a [1123] passenger so I'm going to need to do a [1125] link or [1127] connect uh field it's the way you do [1130] connect boards in Monday basically the [1131] way that you store a record in uh column [1134] of another board is you use this connect [1137] board then you select [1139] it so we're going to be selecting [1141] passengers and then I'm going to connect [1143] that here and I will do this later but [1145] we're going to call we're going to say [1147] passengers on this book on this [1149] booking so let me just try and make this [1151] as small as humanly possible uh then [1153] we're going to need a pickup location so [1155] we can do an address field maybe a [1158] location field yeah there we go so we'll [1160] say pick up [1163] location I'm going to then duplicate [1165] this column to the right and we're going [1167] to call this drop off location and maybe [1171] we don't even need uh we don't even need [1173] the term location it'll probably be [1174] self-evident and that way I can make the [1176] fields a little bit smaller you know [1178] when I type in like the Giza Pyramid [1180] complex or whatever it's pretty obvious [1181] that this is a location and that would [1183] be a very long drive um okay great uh we [1186] need to pick up [1188] time so we should have maybe like a due [1190] date or something probably the date [1193] field [1195] yeah we should have a time here as well [1199] oh add time there we go okay so maybe [1201] we're doing this on June 20th at 9:00 [1203] a.m. um we need a driver uh which we can [1206] just do in our system is like an assign [1208] or a people field so I'm going to be The [1210] Driver uh we need to type so passenger [1213] booked or agent booked so I'm going to [1214] do I think in Monday it's called a [1216] status field so we're going to roll with [1219] that we're going to [1221] say passenger booked um agent booked and [1227] for now I'm just going to leave the rest [1228] of these as uh you got to have a default [1230] label of some kind in Monday [1232] unfortunately how do I change this color [1234] I don't want this to be green or [1236] whatever okay we'll do green or blue [1239] these aren't super like these don't [1242] imply that green is better than blue or [1244] anything like that um so it shouldn't be [1246] a [1247] problem and I'm just going to have a [1249] third default ficon intake here which is [1252] sort of like the default which is [1253] annoying but that should be all right [1255] and it looks like actually passenger [1257] book does like a complete stat status [1258] and I don't really want a done status [1260] here I'm not sure why uh why that's a [1263] done status why don't we do this why [1266] don't we just default to passenger [1269] booked and then oh I can't delete I got [1272] to deactivate it first that's annoying [1276] okay uh whatever um the default is going [1277] to be passenger booked and then we'll [1279] also have an an agent booked so this one [1281] is passenger booked uh and then the last [1284] one is going to be agent and so the way [1286] that we do this is we go to connect [1287] boards [1288] and I'm going to set this up with my [1291] agents over [1294] here okay now keep in mind this is using [1297] the pluralized version of it passengers [1299] agents right realistically um we're only [1303] going to need one and I just have like [1305] minor OCD about stuff like this so if I [1307] could change it from Agents to agent [1309] probably be better then if I change this [1311] from [1313] um or passengers to passenger it's [1317] probably better [1320] oh gez I could have totally just changed [1321] the title of this that's annoying all [1323] right whatever okay uh and then what I'm [1326] going to do is I'm just going to add the [1328] the rest of the data for the agent and [1330] for the passenger as well so um for the [1333] agents we need the company name first [1334] name last name so the agent is [1337] realistically probably just going to be [1339] a company [1341] name all right so if you think about it [1343] um we already have the company name here [1346] uh this is just going to be the the the [1349] title of the board more or less we don't [1350] actually need a company name field what [1352] we do want is we want a text field which [1355] I'm going to call first [1357] name we want another text field that I'm [1360] going to call last [1362] name uh we want an email address so we [1365] should have an email field on Monday yep [1367] we want a phone [1369] number [1370] presumably and then what we also want is [1373] we want a list of orders and that's one [1375] thing I didn't add here so connect [1376] boards I'm going to connect this to the [1378] orders [1379] and basically we want a list of orders [1381] that are connected with this um like [1384] kind of back and forth so if you know [1386] one agent is responsible for 15 orders [1388] we want a way to track that and [1390] hypothetically I'm going to I'm going to [1391] associate this with our 29 pen drive um [1393] Avenue [1396] record and I pretend that I'm an agent [1403] here awesome it's even got my um you [1406] know my my location which is cool all [1409] right and last but not least we're going [1410] to do the passenger field we'll do first [1411] name last name email address phone [1412] number and preferences so realistically [1416] the likelihood of there being two people [1417] with the exact first name and last names [1419] is pretty low so I'm just going to leave [1421] the first [1422] name um H if I do something like Nix [1426] Sarah for instance yeah sure my name is [1428] probably less likely to have a collision [1430] with somebody else's name because you [1431] know it's like vaguely European sounding [1434] specifically Eastern European and there [1436] are very few people with the the same [1437] permutation of a first and last name but [1439] I think we could [1442] probably I think we should probably [1444] store this data again it's like a first [1446] name and a last name [1448] field yeah so I'm going to leave the [1449] first and the last name and then I'm [1451] going to add a first name field [1453] here and then I'm also going to add a [1455] last name [1456] field so we're going to go first name uh [1460] last name I'm going to go email address [1462] here I'll do phone number as well what [1466] else did I want I wanted a preference [1467] this field right [1469] so preference is just going to be like [1470] hey you know does this person have any [1472] specific requests that they want to make [1474] and then I also want to have a connect [1476] field and I want to connect this back to [1478] my [1479] orders um for the same reason as uh uh [1484] for the same reason as what I mentioned [1487] earlier and then I'm going to write all [1490] the information so Nick [1492] surf um we're going to use a different [1494] email [1495] here I'm going to have like a different [1497] phone number [1502] and then I'll say I don't want to talk [1505] to [1510] you I don't know some people don't like [1512] talking I'm not like that I Yap [1514] constantly non-stop every time I get a [1516] ride [1517] anywhere and yeah we're going to want to [1518] associate this and we're going to want [1520] to associate this I have a [1523] feeling the should automatically be [1525] associating so I'm surprised that [1526] they're not let me me try removing this [1530] order let me give this thing a little [1532] refresh [1534] here H this should be a two-way [1536] connection why is this not a two-way [1543] connection if I go back to connect [1547] here oh yeah sorry you need to click [1549] create a two-way connection uh not a [1551] one-way connection so I actually need to [1553] delete these fields here and then we [1555] need to remake them all sort of annoying [1558] but say [1559] Levy uh make sure you're doing a two-way [1561] connection this way we'll essentially be [1564] able to track on both sides not just one [1567] side so from passengers I'm going to go [1569] connect [1570] board I'm going to select my orders [1573] board as a 2-way [1576] connection so now we have like a back [1577] and forth connection and I can say this [1579] order for my agents I'm going to go [1582] connect [1584] boards and then I'm going to go create a [1586] 2-way connection to orders as well [1590] and then if I go to my orders [1592] now I'll have two I'll have link to [1595] passenger and I'll also have link to [1598] agents so I'm going to drag this over to [1600] the beginning and then I always like to [1603] order things in terms of priority so for [1605] me a passenger is high priority and then [1606] agents is as lower priority so we're [1608] going to leave that back here uh then we [1610] need to associate the order [1614] here [1616] okay all right so now we have a [1618] three-step system basically with an [1620] order an agent and then a passenger and [1622] they're all Associated between the two [1624] when a new order comes in you can [1625] imagine maybe it'll come in through a [1626] form or something like that online um [1628] we're going to get the the um name of [1630] the person uh assuming that the form I [1633] don't know tracks the the user of it [1635] maybe you have like some login [1636] functionality in your portal you'll also [1638] have the passenger and you'll also have [1640] the agent information and the benefit of [1642] this simple system now and I'm just [1643] going to do everything manually here but [1645] the benefit of this simple system um and [1648] you know we should probably come up with [1649] like an actual [1651] address there you go why don't we do [1652] that I'm in Australia [1656] apparently um the benefit of [1660] this is essentially now we have uh we [1664] need some other one let's go Sydney [1665] Opera [1667] House there you go I have no idea if [1670] those are even remotely close to each [1672] other but the benefit of this now is uh [1674] you know we could have um multiple [1676] orders come in for different passengers [1679] and and have the same agent [1681] hypothetically if that's necessary or [1683] required um and then we could also track [1686] uh which agents have uh or you know how [1689] many um orders every agent has and then [1691] how many orders every passenger has and [1693] the cool part about this is now at any [1694] point in time we can use make.com or you [1697] know similar no code tool to query an [1699] order then after the query and order we [1701] can grab the passenger data and then we [1703] can also grab the agent data or we can [1704] query a passenger if we're doing some [1706] sales activity and then we can query [1708] every single one of the orders that they [1710] have and then count up say the distance [1711] of every order for instance or who the [1714] agent on every order was if we want to [1715] assign some referral multiplier or [1717] whatnot essentially this is the most [1718] flexible way to design a system um by [1721] separating into these three [1722] fundamentally different data types and [1724] then by associating them through [1725] relational or connect boards in instead [1728] of doing what a lot of people would do [1730] in this case which is probably just try [1731] and cram everything into just one board [1734] um you know and and just you know juggle [1735] everything that way which is sort of [1736] annoying so let's pretend that I'm [1739] adding a bunch of more orders here um I [1741] don't know I want some other location in [1742] Australia so let me just use this [1745] location [1747] field I'm going to say 19 [1750] Australia looks like there's a street in [1752] Australia called um Australia [1755] Street nice we'll go camper down [1759] somewhere [1761] else 24 camper down in kough's Harbor uh [1766] with this date here [1768] we want a time as well right maybe we [1771] want like 11 or [1773] something also assigned to the same [1775] driver this time it's just passenger [1777] booked and then uh I'm going to grab oh [1781] man I love how there's like a map [1782] function here so anybody on the team [1784] could easily see where this order is [1786] coming [1787] from um then I said June [1789] 21st 11:00 [1795] a.m. so we got a couple orders here [1798] and let's say they're for the same [1800] passenger um the first one is Agent [1802] booked the second one was passenger [1803] booked if we go back to passengers now [1805] you'll see that there are now two orders [1807] represented in the orders [1808] field and so if we were to query a [1811] passenger we now have two separate [1813] orders you can change the way that this [1815] looks so instead of it um kind of [1819] looking like this I believe you can just [1820] show a number for instance uh there are [1822] many ways that you can kind of [1823] manipulate this any now that we have our [1826] three simple Fields open what I'm going [1828] to do here is I'm going to connect them [1829] and make and it just show you how how [1830] much more valuable it is to build [1832] something out like this so the first [1834] thing I'm going to do is I'm just going [1835] to get an [1838] item in order for this to work I need to [1841] connect it in order for that to work I [1843] need to grab an API key and so I believe [1846] in Monday in order to do that you need [1847] to go to [1851] developers and then you need to go to my [1856] access tokens [1860] and then I need to show this and then [1862] copy it and then go to API key paste it [1867] in so we now have a connection to Monday [1870] the ID of the record that I want at [1872] least to start is I'm just going to use [1874] this record so I'm going to open this up [1875] and then in the top right hand corner [1876] there's like a pulse ID in Monday it's [1878] called and that pulse ID is the ID of [1880] the specific field so I'm going to call [1883] that and I'm not going to check the the [1885] board ID that's okay we're just going to [1887] run it [1889] and what you'll see is after I run it I [1891] get all of that information but there's [1892] another field called mapable column [1894] values and one of them is called connect [1896] boards and you see that it has a bunch [1898] of linked pulse IDs and in our case just [1900] because we're putting all of the data in [1902] like the title um we we just get like [1904] all the text but we also have an array [1906] of other um IDs of other boards [1909] basically so linked pulse ID one is this [1911] link pulse id2 so we could have a flow [1914] for instance that get [1915] passenger so we could say get passenger [1919] then for every [1921] passenger we could get orders for [1928] instance and if we feed in the connect [1932] boards linked pulse ID's linked pulse ID [1935] here then if I run this flow this thing [1937] will run um a couple of [1941] times and you see why did it only grab [1944] one hold on a sec we should have uh an [1947] array of linked pulse IDs [1949] right so this actually should be [1951] iterating over an array hold [1965] on okay so we have to iterate over here [1969] so let me feed in this iterator and then [1971] I'm going to feed in the linked pulse ID [1975] array here [1978] then I'm going to take the output of [1979] this [1981] iterator so I got to reconnect [1984] this and that's start I cancel this and [1986] then click it over [1988] again and then I want the linked pulse [1990] ID there we go so now we can get um one [1993] passenger and then we can get all of the [1994] orders for a particular passenger so now [1997] we have all of their [1998] data and so hypothetically what we could [2001] do is I don't know let's say that may be [2003] one of these um order [2005] fields in orders was like revenue or [2009] something uh let me see if there's a [2011] money field yeah I'll just type in [2014] Revenue this is 150 this is [2018] 200 if I go back to our make.com [2021] integration we can then use like a [2024] numeric aggregator well actually let me [2026] just run this first to show you so now [2029] we get the um right down over here [2033] numbers field numbers underscore uncore [2034] one which is 200 and we could feed in to [2038] a numeric aggregator hypothetically if [2040] we wanted to sum up the revenue of this [2042] at some point um and then we could go uh [2046] numbers [2048] one The Source module for this is going [2050] to be get orders and then the aggregate [2052] function is going to be [2053] sum and we're going to ignore the [2056] transformation and at the end here we [2058] have [2059] um oh sorry when you run an an [2063] aggregator function you have to connect [2065] the source to the iterator that's [2066] essentially produce the the iteration um [2069] otherwise the output is going to be kind [2070] of odd anyway uh we have a result of 350 [2074] here which is basically like the the [2075] revenue that has been summed so I show [2077] you this not because I think this is [2078] like hyper relevant to um me building up [2081] the logic but because I wanted to show [2083] you just how how flexible your system [2085] gets and how much you could do on the [2086] automation side of things when you [2087] connect systems this way um instead of [2090] you having [2091] to uh I don't know um instead of you [2094] having to muddle up a single board with [2096] all of the information like imagine if [2098] we tried to add a separate passenger [2101] here and then just had like a passenger [2103] first name passenger last name passenger [2105] email address passenger this passenger [2107] that um imagine how many fields there [2110] would be on this main board and then [2111] also just how much of a cluster it [2113] would be to manage this data and to [2114] ensure that it's the exact same between [2116] passenger what if one time one of their [2118] names gets put in slightly differently [2119] or whatnot right um when you connect a [2122] passenger uh field to a whole other [2125] board called passengers that stores that [2126] separate data you basically ensure that [2128] the data is going to be the same between [2129] every call um which is uh which is why [2132] it's just a lot simpler and and what I'd [2133] much prefer so yeah a lot you could do [2136] with that I think if I were to build out [2137] the system and kind of Flesh it out a [2138] little bit more what I would do is I [2140] would probably add a uh form at the [2142] front end the form would take in the [2145] order and in order to fill in an order [2148] you would need to add a passenger and so [2150] you need to select who the passenger is [2152] for instance um and then you'd also need [2154] to have an optional field that allows [2156] you to enter in whether or not an agent [2158] is present I would also have um some [2160] other field or form you know if you [2162] wanted to make your own like SAS app or [2164] whatnot uh where somebody can like [2166] create their own passenger profile and [2169] then you know now they have a passenger [2170] profile every time that they make an [2171] order it's automatically filled in that [2173] they are the passenger on that order [2175] then I do the same thing for agents and [2176] then I would also assign agents to [2178] passengers and so maybe like an agent uh [2180] owns a bunch of passengers for instance [2182] that's one thing that I didn't [2183] necessarily do uh let me see if [2185] passengers have agents no they don't [2188] you know I might assign certain agents [2190] to certain passengers where you know one [2193] agent might have three or four of [2195] them so maybe you know this one has neck [2198] and then on all orders that the agent is [2200] doing for a passenger they're just like [2202] the default [2206] agent um you know for that person so now [2210] you know every time we get a passenger [2211] record we know that their agent is left [2213] click the vast majority of their orders [2214] are probably going to include left click [2216] um we know that you know they have a [2217] list some past orders we have some [2219] preferences you know if a driver jumps [2221] into the system um and you know sees uh [2224] if we sort this based off D date which [2225] should sort of already is sorted based [2227] off due date just because of how I put [2228] this in but if we sort this based off [2230] due date for instance maybe we make due [2231] date the most important field [2234] here we call this pickup [2238] time maybe we call this um let's just uh [2243] actually let's just use pick [2245] update I'm realizing here I didn't use [2248] location or uh on the pickup or drop off [2251] Fields hence why that might be a little [2252] bit confusing so um you know now they [2255] can jump in take a really quick look at [2257] the passenger field they see the [2259] preferences they're like okay sure that [2261] makes sense then they jump in check the [2263] address on a map which is like a [2265] one-click integration they say hm like [2267] how do I get to that road okay I guess I [2268] need to pull in here all right that's [2269] easy then you know they look at the drop [2271] off location they're like this is Sydney [2273] Opera House this is going to be like a [2274] massive pain in my ass but hey I'll do [2275] it anyway um and then you know because [2278] we're using assign fields and what that [2279] they get automatically notified which [2281] allows them [2282] to uh you know just like kind of manage [2285] their orders and [2286] whatnot I believe that is more or less [2288] what I wanted to do for this system I [2290] wanted to show you how to build out um [2291] an endtoend more complicated CRM thanks [2294] so much for watching Everybody if you [2295] guys have any questions about how to set [2296] up a multi-step CRM like this feel free [2298] to let me know I love doing stuff like [2300] this uh this is honestly this is where I [2302] got my start in project management crms [2304] and operations um and you know it's [2307] where will find my end I don't really [2308] know but yeah if you guys have any [2311] questions or anything like that just [2311] leave a comment down below and we'll [2312] sort of take it from there thanks so [2314] much do all that fun YouTube stuff like [2315] And subscribe I'll see you on the next [2316] video bye-bye

Title: Watch Me Build A Client Onboarding System Using Hidden APIs
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here and [1] in this video I'm going to show you how [2] to build a client onboarding system live [4] the really cool part about this video [6] that's probably different from most [7] other ones that you've seen either on [8] this subject or that I've recorded [10] previously is I'm actually going to make [11] use of a hidden API to do so I've used [14] hidden apis before for web scraping but [16] I've never used it to actually like do [18] things um a lot of the time if you are [20] scoping a project and something is not [22] available in the API or maybe there is a [24] make module for it uh you can actually [26] like figure out what the API endpoint is [28] on your own using nwor requests and sort [31] of like the the Chrome Dev tools Tab and [33] then you can hack together a solution [35] that still works really well so that's [37] what I've done in this video I'm taking [38] a customer request or a viewer request I [40] want to say which is similar to a [42] customer request I'm turning that into a [44] sequence of steps and I'm showing you [45] how I scope it and how I build a hidden [47] API system from scratch that sounds like [50] some you guys are interested in learning [51] how to do yourselves stay tuned and [53] let's get into [56] it all right first things first this [58] request came from the lovely ATC [60] quarantine on YouTube she said uh tons [62] of amazing compliments thank you for [64] that and then she's looking for a new [65] client workflow automation scenario [67] where she takes a new client [68] subscription from stripe then she sends [70] an email to her team with new client [72] info then automatically creates a client [74] dashboard and clickup from a template [76] adds the client name from stripe to the [78] dashboard and then even creates the [79] sharable link for the client sends a [81] welcome email to the client and then um [83] includes the newly created clickup [85] dashboard link she'd also love to know [87] how to apply something like this in [88] Reverse as well as showing when a client [90] cancels their subscription um so I'm not [93] going to do that second part just [94] because I don't want this to be like a [95] 4-Hour video but uh everything that I'm [97] going to show you today um that has to [99] do with hidden apis will we'll provide [100] you the tools and the knowledge you can [102] go out uh to use and do yourself okay so [105] yeah I'm more than happy to build a [106] system it's one of the funnest uh [108] probably requests I've gotten in a while [110] because it allows me to leverage some of [112] the Hidden API knowledge that I've built [114] over the last couple of years in a way [116] that basically I don't think anybody [117] else in the world that is using clickup [119] is currently [120] utilizing before I get into this you [123] need to have a couple of tech skills in [126] order for this to make sense to you you [127] need to understand a little bit of Json [129] so JavaScript object notation you need [131] to understand generally speaking like [132] what a server is um we're going to make [134] requests to a server that clickup is [136] essentially hidden from our view uh so [138] we need to be familiar with that and I'm [139] going to guide you through as much of [140] this as I possibly can so that even if [142] you're not extremely technical you'll [144] still sort of understand what's going on [146] but you know if any of this seems like [147] Arcane runes written in like a a a Dusty [150] old tablet if any of this is Wizardry [153] then uh you know you you can brush up [155] your request skills and you can go [156] pretty far with this stuff so uh the [159] main issue here with what Susie is [161] asking for you know if you don't know [163] what I'm about to tell you is if we go [165] over to make.com here and we go to like [167] clickup and we scroll through all the [170] like million modules here for tasks and [173] lists and folders and spaces and goals [174] and Views and whatever uh the main issue [177] you'll find is that clickup has no [178] inherent way to do duplicate a dashboard [181] and so you know normally what'll happen [182] is you'll scope this out and then you'll [184] be like dashboard dashboard how do we [185] duplicate a dashboard H like there's no [187] way to do so oh maybe may maybe make an [189] API call then you'll go you'll redo the [191] clickup API and then you'll like you [193] know still isn't working and then you [194] realize that there's just no way to to [195] do what you want to do and then you'll [196] say okay this project is not doable but [199] um just because a platform H does not [202] have an API endpoint or just because a [204] platform does not have a module in [206] make.com or like a listed API endpoint [208] doesn't mean that you can't actually do [210] it and what I mean by this is all of [212] these software platforms technically [214] have apis that do all of these functions [216] on the software platform for instance I [218] have a dashboard here open and click if [220] I right click this and if I press [222] duplicate obviously something has to [225] happen on their backend there has to be [227] a request made to some server out there [230] to tell it that I'm going to be [231] duplicating this dashboard right the [234] question is uh how do we find it so [237] obviously it's there for whatever reason [240] they haven't made that functionality [241] available as part of their module but we [243] can still get it and that's what I'm [245] going to show you guys how to do in this [246] video I'm going to show you guys how to [247] do the Crux of what she's asking for [249] which is initially she wants to get a [252] trigger from stripe then send an email [254] to the team and then here create a new [256] client dashboard and click up we're [257] going to use hidden apis for this and [258] then add the client name from stripe to [259] the new dashboard we're going to use [260] hidden apis for this create shareable [262] link um we're not going to be able to [264] create like a public sharable link cuz [266] clickup doesn't allow you to do that but [267] we'll still be able to get the link to [268] share um with people [270] and then we'll be able to do you know [271] all all the rest of the stuff uh too [273] using hidden apis so pretty cool stuff [275] we're going to be diving pretty deep [277] into um like Network requests and uh [279] headers and stuff like that so if you're [281] unfamiliar with us if you're not like a [282] professional super technical request and [285] internet person that's all right I'm [286] going to guide you through it as much as [287] I can but you know some some basic [290] understanding of Jason uh JavaScript [291] object notation and uh you know just how [294] to make like an HTTP request and make is [296] pretty important so if you haven't [297] already figured that stuff out then I [298] have a bunch of videos that show you how [299] to scrape websites and make HTTP [301] requests that uh you know you can just [303] jump around my profile and find okay [306] without further Ado let's actually build [308] this whole system from end to end so the [310] way that I usually build systems [311] especially client systems like this [312] where uh you know I'm just kind of going [315] you know shooting from the hip is it'll [316] always start at the end or the most [318] important function first so to me the [320] most important function here is creating [321] a client dashboard so what I'm going to [323] do is I'm just going to verify that that [324] works first I'm going to test it and [326] then once I know that that works then I [327] can kind of work my way back where it's [329] the rest of her requ ests cuz this to me [331] is the Crux of it right she just [332] obviously wants to duplicate a dashboard [333] automatically when some payment comes in [336] it's easy enough to track a payment like [337] it's easy enough to trigger when a [338] payment occurs do X Y and Z these are [340] built-in triggers and make but this is [341] the one that's like there's a big [342] question mark here um and this is like [344] the real the real Alpha in the system so [347] that's what I'm going to start with [348] first and in order for me to do so I [350] need to explain a little bit about how [351] clickup works so basically what she [353] wants to do is she wants to have a [354] dashboard so I already have a dashboard [356] called dashboard here this is a very [357] simple dashboard that I set up with my [359] average cycle time for my articles in [360] the queue for my content writing compony [363] you know you can see how sometimes it [364] goes up sometimes it goes down right on [366] average it's like three to four days [367] that's how long my writers take to [368] finish stuff uh that's cool but she [371] basically wants you know let's say this [372] is her dashboard and I imagine her [374] dashboard's probably going to be a lot [375] more complicated than this but let's [376] pretend this is her dashboard um what [378] she wants is she wants a way to [380] automatically duplicate [383] this and you see I just duplicated now [385] it's called dashboard one and then she [388] wants a way to send whatever the [389] finished link is to the [391] client so um we already checked make [395] there's no built-in module what do we do [398] well this is where we need to start [399] looking into the hidden API so how do [401] you access a hidden API of a service [404] well every service is going to be [404] different not all services are going to [406] have a very straightforward simple [407] hidden API some of them are going to use [408] what's called like websockets some of [409] them are going to use there's a variety [410] of different approaches but generally [412] speaking on your browser you need to [413] hold and press like control shift C or [415] command shift C or something or you just [417] need to right click and then press [419] inspect [420] and then this tab is going to open up um [422] either on the bottom of your page or on [423] the right hand side of the page and this [424] is the inspect element Tab and you've [426] probably seen this before if you're [427] familiar with web stuff you played [428] around with it but there are a bunch of [430] tabs here what this is is this is the [432] layout of your whole website so this is [434] the clickup site just built in HTML [436] right uh if I search for the term start [438] with a [440] template or maybe just template um the [443] term template will be somewhere here I [445] don't know exactly where obviously [447] there's a boatload of code but um you [449] know all the information that's here is [451] technically written over here in the [452] elements panel uh just in code so this [455] is a onetoone representation and then [457] what happens is uh you will feed all of [459] this code into your browser and then [460] your browser just sort of understands [462] the way that you want this code to look [463] and that's how it'll render the web page [465] it's a very neat system but obviously [467] it's a little bit beyond the the scope [469] of this video next up you have a console [470] the console is just um usually like a [472] logging uh a list of logs essentially [475] that have cropped up so it'll tell you [478] whether or not it's been able to access [479] resource or whatever um you can write [481] JavaScript in here if you want as well [483] I'm not going to touch too much on that [484] there's a sources tab which we'll go [486] through and then just list all of the [488] various data sources that this page is [489] pulled from so you can see it's pulled [491] from a service called canny. cn. [493] segment.com attachments. clickup doccom [495] some of these are clickup own services [497] and some of these are thirdparty [498] services that they're using for like [499] tracking and analytics and then the most [502] important one for us is this one here [504] called Network and this is where you're [505] going to be spending the vast majority [506] of your time if you're looking to screw [507] around with hidden apis like I am [510] so um every time that I do something on [513] this page anytime I do like a server [515] request it's going to pop up over here [518] and it's going to basically be sending a [519] request to clickup or some other service [521] to tell it what I'm doing um and you [524] know we're going to be able to track it [525] all so what I'm going to do is I'm just [526] going to minimize this make this a [527] little bit smaller and I'm going to make [529] this a little bit bigger I'm going to [530] scroll all the way to the right hand [531] side here and what I'm going to do is [533] I'm going to duplicate this and I'm [536] going to see what happens on the network [537] tab when I duplicate this because again [540] you know if I click this duplicate [541] button and it duplicates it obviously [544] clickup has to know somehow I have to be [546] sending or receiving a request to or [547] from a clickup server in order for that [549] function to happen so what we want to do [551] is we want to see what that Network [552] request is and then we want to duplicate [554] it and [555] make okay great so I just clicked [560] duplicate and if you notice there are a [563] couple of network requests that have [565] popped [566] up and the one that's relevant for me [569] right if we just scroll through here the [571] one that's relevant for me and the one [572] that's probably going to be relevant for [573] you is there's going to be a name and [575] the name's just going to usually [576] describe the function so it'll be copy [578] it'll be rename it'll be duplicate it'll [580] be something like that and there's [582] actually two Network requests [584] here um both of them are virtually [587] identical there's a minor difference [588] here between um the status codes it [591] looks like or sorry the um whether or [593] not this is like a service work or [594] whatever you don't need to know too much [595] about that what you need to pay [597] attention to is this request URL [601] basically anytime I copy or duplicate a [604] dashboard excuse me there is a server [608] request being made to this [610] URL pro- us-west this is an Amazon [613] server doclick up.com dashboard dag [618] t-22 copy it's a post request and then [623] there are a bunch of headers [625] here and the last thing that I'll [627] mention is there is a authorization [631] header and that authorization header [633] includes basically like an internal API [635] key it's an API key that clickup will [638] assign to you but they won't tell you [639] about it and if you just copy this [642] request but instead of doing it through [644] your browser you do it through make.com [646] you can do the exact same thing that [648] we're accomplishing here um inside of [651] clickup right we have the authorization [653] we have all these other headers if we [655] just copy this one for one clickup [657] doesn't care if the request comes from [658] make or if it comes from your browser [660] when you click the duplicate button it [661] will do the same thing because you know [663] it's authorized uh and so we can [666] actually feed this into a make.com SN we [668] can automate the hell out of it now [670] obviously I don't want to show you guys [671] my um my authorization header so I'm [674] just going to be like blurring this out [676] in post uh but you know if you sign up [678] for clickup it should be like a pretty [680] long string you know in this case it's [681] like four or five lines or something [682] like that um so yeah uh what we're going [685] to do is we're just going to find a way [686] to copy this request exactly and then [688] send it over to uh make.com and then [691] from make.com send it back over to [693] clickup and then we're going to just see [694] what happens so I'm going to go back [697] here and then I'll just see my list of [699] dashboards you can see that I've already [700] copied that one here so it's dashboard [702] and then there's a space and then [703] there's a bracket and there's one but [704] I'm going to delete this because I only [706] want to screw with this one [708] here okay so first thing I'm going to do [710] is I'm going to copy this request URL go [712] to make and then I'm going to use an [713] HTTP module to make a [716] request I'm going to paste in this [718] module here [720] now just when I'm reading this and I [721] don't actually know fully I'm just [723] poking around uh new to the same as you [725] are um this da DH a gt- doo2 that to me [730] looks kind of like an ID I don't think [732] this is like an endpoint I mean all the [734] rest of these are interpretable terms [736] dashboard copy this one here to me looks [737] like an ID so what's probably happening [739] is we are probably calling a specific [743] resource and where this is the ID and [745] then the copy function is being [746] performed on this ID like if I'm [748] thinking about it like by what the [749] server is doing we're probably copying [751] um this and so I bet you if you had a [754] different template if I duplicated a [756] different dashboard right if I had like [757] three or four different variants and [758] then I I duplicate a different one uh [760] this would change maybe it' be ABC ef- [763] 913 or [765] something okay the next thing we need to [767] do is we need to copy all of these [768] request methods so this is post right so [770] I'm going to go over here I'm going to [771] click [772] post all right um I'm also going to go [775] to body type Go to Raw content type go [777] to Json application Json and I was like [779] parsing the response and then what I [782] need to do is I need to add a bunch of [783] headers and so the headers that you need [785] to add if you scroll down are your [786] request headers they're not your [788] response headers this is the response [789] from clickup uh they're your request [791] headers and generally you don't need to [793] add any of these ones here with the um [794] the colons by them uh so what I'm going [797] to do here is I'm going to add my [798] authorization [801] header then I'm going to [804] copy this long string [809] and then I am going [812] to actually why don't we do this this [815] instead we'll go to. API key like this [819] that should be good that's what this is [821] called okay great and that way I just [822] don't have to like do all that work and [823] post blurring it out every time all [825] right uh next up I'm going to um [829] continue scrolling down here and I'm [831] going to find the content length content [835] type cookie we have a big cookie here [836] I'm just not going to feed in the cookie [837] at all I'll go go to uh SEC [842] Chua um I don't know for sure whether or [844] not all of these are [846] required but from most of the services [849] that I ping you need to have your um [852] secua and then you need to have your [853] user agent as [855] well and uh this basically is just like [857] a hack to tell them that we're a browser [859] using Mozilla 5.0 uh Linux Android Nexus [863] whatever you know we're on Google Chrome [865] uh is just a way to basically say hey [866] we're not calling you uh from a from a [868] server from like make.com we're calling [869] you from um just a normal [871] website okay great so uh the last thing [874] we need to do is we need to feed in the [875] request content so if you go to payload [878] or preview maybe I should go over [882] here um we don't actually have a [885] dashboard here do [888] we okay sorry if you go to a [891] preview and then if you copy this whole [895] long Val or object rather then we have a [898] giant string basically a giant request [901] string with information here and it [904] looks like we can change the ID of the [906] thing that we're creating we can change [907] a name we can do all that stuff um I [909] don't know if all of this is going to [910] work but we'll we'll give us a try um [912] why don't we call this like client [913] example dashboard [915] name looks like you also given an [918] ID um so I don't know if this means like [921] it's been created I'm not really sure [922] what's going on but we're going to call [923] it anyway and then uh what I'll do is [926] I'll just give this a try and we'll see [927] what happens I I don't know if this is [928] going to work we're just going to test [929] it out so we got the API key and then we [931] call the server it's giving us a 200 [933] request and it's also sending us back a [935] dashboard um object again the ID of this [938] is a different ID okay and then the name [941] is dashboard one so if I go back here [944] and I [947] refresh sorry it is trying to push me to [949] mobile [950] here if I open this up [954] again go to [957] dashboards we'll see that I just created [959] a dashboard just now called dashboard [962] one so that looks good um we're sort of [966] hacking this API call together and so [968] not all the fields seem to work so like [970] name doesn't work for instance that's [971] okay we could just use a different API [973] call to rename it I'm sure that'll be [974] fine uh but it looks like we've actually [976] already done the main functionality [977] which is just duplicating the uh the [979] dashboard it's pretty [980] sick yeah presumably um you know the [984] from the scope it sounds like she just [986] wanted to create a new client dashboard [987] and click up from a template we made so [989] that's pretty [990] straightforward um presumably if you [992] wanted to like do different templates [994] you'd have to call a different ID here [997] it looks like DH a GT is just the ID [999] that it's I don't know if this is just [1001] because of me maybe this is just like a [1003] a string assigned to my personal account [1005] and maybe it's not your account but the [1007] number here was was similar I think it [1009] was like 497 so presumably I just change [1011] this to be whatever template that you [1013] want like I bet you if I were to click [1015] duplicate here the API call would be for [1017] a different uh dashboard yeah see this [1019] is [1020] 497 so yeah that is uh that's a very [1022] quick and easy way to hack together some [1024] dashboard functionality which is nice [1026] and it looks like the ID that we feed in [1027] doesn't really matter um if I could take [1030] a wild stab at it you probably wouldn't [1031] need to feed in anything you'd probably [1033] just make a post request to this and it [1035] would just copy it for you because it [1036] doesn't really look like it cares about [1038] the ID or the name it probably is just [1039] um told to to ignore what's going on and [1042] they just create a new dashboard [1044] duplicate for any request that comes in [1046] that's a post request that has the [1047] authorization header in pings this URL [1050] so yeah that's pretty cool now why don't [1053] we do another thing [1056] um uh the client or Susie in this case [1059] mentioned that she wanted a rename [1061] functionality where the dashboard gets [1063] renamed so this is dashboard one what [1065] I'm going to do is let me just click on [1068] this [1069] actually and then why don't I go back to [1071] network um and how do you rename [1073] something and click [1074] up click yeah so i' rename it here so [1078] I'm going to do is I'm just going to [1079] like change the name of this um and I'm [1081] just going to say client example I'm [1083] going to press enter okay and you can [1086] see that a couple of API calls were just [1087] made um DH a gt- 497 that is the [1090] dashboard URL so I bet you it'll be [1092] something like [1094] rename okay so we're doing an HTTP [1096] request to this URL and it's dhag gt- [1099] 497 now with a request method put which [1101] is cool the payload we just feed in name [1105] so I guarantee you this is going to work [1107] as well and all we need to do is is just [1109] take the ID of the uh previous [1111] one so I'm going to copy and paste [1114] this I'm going to feed in this URL [1117] instead I'm going to do a put and keep [1120] in mind we need to grab the ID from the [1122] previous one um previous output here [1125] right so we just go uh I'm just going to [1129] test this I'm going to hard code this [1130] for now but later on we'd replace this [1131] with the ID we have the authorization we [1133] have the same thing everywhere else and [1135] then all we want to do is we want to [1136] have um a new query with whatever the [1139] name is and I'm gonna say this is my [1143] awesome new name and then I'm gonna go [1146] back like [1147] this okay let me just see if there's [1149] anything else we might be [1151] missing um payload looks good preview [1155] looks good yeah let's just let's give [1157] this a go so I'm going to look at this [1159] name here um right now it says client [1162] example I'm going to run this again oh [1165] sorry I need the API key for this to run [1167] so let me just unlink this link [1170] this and then feed this directly [1173] in and then run [1176] it we received 200 status request again [1179] and then voila we have this is my [1181] awesome new name in clickup so we've [1183] just changed the um the name of this [1186] document using our hidden API which is [1188] pretty sick very very cool stuff so yeah [1192] I think that's like the two probably [1193] biggest pieces of functionality Susie [1195] wanted so create a new dashboard and [1196] click up and then add the client name [1198] from stripe to new dashboard name and [1199] then create sharable link the last one [1201] I'll do is I'll just figure out how to [1202] create a sharable link because the rest [1203] of the stuff seems pretty [1204] straightforward like sending a welcome [1205] email that's pretty that's pretty easy [1208] um this is sort of like uh my my my [1211] go-to for basically anything in [1213] automation you know just do the hardest [1214] thing first verify that the hardest [1215] thing a is possible and B um like you [1218] know what you need in order to do it uh [1220] and then after that you can worry about [1221] all the small easy stuff there's sort of [1224] like two philosophies for attacking [1225] anything really like if you're in debt [1227] there's two philosophies one is you [1229] attack the thing that has the highest [1230] interest rate and then once you're done [1232] with the thing that has the highest [1233] interest rate this is like the logical [1234] approach you can worry about things with [1236] lower interest rates but a lot of the [1238] time the debts with the highest interest [1239] rates are also your biggest debts and [1240] the scariest ones so another approach is [1242] to attach attack the smallest simplest [1244] thing first and work your way down right [1246] there's so many different approaches uh [1249] you know of attacking the largest or [1250] smallest thing just generally speaking [1252] in life um but for automation I [1254] definitely like attacking the hardest [1255] thing because it just verifies that you [1257] know I can I can do it [1259] um anyway not I'm not freaking senica [1261] over here okay I'm not Aristotle I'm not [1263] a philosopher I am a make.com engineer [1265] so let's get back to it uh the last [1267] thing I'm going to do is I'm going to [1268] figure out how the share link works [1273] um I think if we right click if we click [1276] share up here uh we have a private or [1280] public dashboard so you may not know [1284] this I do because I've worked with [1286] clickup a lot and I hope Susie does as [1287] well but you can't actually share a [1289] dashboard publicly like I couldn't like [1292] take the dashboard and then send it to a [1294] client that isn't part of my clickup [1295] workspace um even if I make this public [1298] it's just public within my workspace [1300] what I do then is I copy this link and [1301] then I paste it in [1303] here and I press enter and then voila [1305] you know it's like part of uh anybody in [1307] my workspace can see it but I'm assuming [1311] that she knows this and I'm assuming [1313] that she's probably already invited [1314] let's say a client to her workspace or [1316] something to see it um and what we're [1319] doing is we're just going to be copying [1320] this link and this link is always going [1322] to follow a very specific format it's [1323] going to be you know https app. click [1326] up.com whatever your specific um clickup [1330] account ID is and this is mine then [1332] it'll be SL dasboard dhag gt- 497 so we [1336] can actually just like put this together [1337] ourselves um and then just make sure [1339] that it's uh that it's [1341] public um or we can just you know like [1343] add add the people to our um to our [1345] dashboard uh sorry we can add all of the [1348] the people the users to our account uh [1352] and then make it public what else we [1353] what else she can do is she can save [1355] this as a [1357] PDF she can then um like email the PDF [1360] over to people if she wants and the PDF [1362] will just look exactly like how this [1364] looked the only difference is it's not [1365] going to be dynamic so like you know U [1368] this is just like essentially a [1369] screenshot of the dashboard but I mean [1371] this might be a workable compromise if [1372] she's not looking to do what I think [1374] she's looking to do um so you know she [1376] she could do that as well and you can do [1378] all these functions through the hidden [1379] API right like if I go back to network [1381] here and I click on something um if I [1383] were to go to network and then type save [1386] as [1389] PDF you know there's a request that is [1391] basically being [1395] made oh actually there is no request [1397] that's being made that's really [1398] interesting it looks like they're using [1400] some library to just take a screenshot [1402] of the dashboard right there in front of [1403] you so you would actually need to do a [1406] uh well yeah you'd actually need to do a [1409] uh some type of browser automation if [1411] you wanted to get the PDF [1413] fascinating anyway um you know I imagine [1416] that she probably knows what she's doing [1418] here so I'm not going to beat a dead [1420] horse but okay how do you integrate this [1422] into the rest of the flow well that's [1423] pretty straightforward um based off what [1425] she's saying now that we've done the [1427] hard Parts here we need to take a new [1429] client subscription from stripe so we [1431] need a trigger basically that's watching [1432] stripe and when a new stripe transaction [1434] comes in that is a type subscription we [1437] need to send an email to our team with [1438] the new client info uh then we'll create [1441] the new client dashboard and click up [1442] just using the info that we get from [1444] that [1445] transaction then we'll send a new [1447] welcome email to the client with a [1448] welcome message and nearly created a [1449] clickup dashboard link all right so that [1451] seems pretty straightforward why don't I [1453] start at the very beginning um with the [1455] stripe call or stripe Watcher now keep [1458] in mind I don't actually have like a [1459] stripe thing set up here but I'll show [1460] you how to set it up and then I'm just [1461] going to use like a basic trigger to go [1463] but basically what you want to do is you [1465] you'd want to use the watch events [1466] module here so I'm going to drag that [1468] over to the left I'm going to feed that [1471] in what you want to do is you want to [1473] create a new web [1477] hook um maybe we'll do like subscription [1481] events then I'll just say June 19th 2024 [1485] and I'll just say example I really do [1487] need to come up with a good nameing [1488] convention for this you can go customer [1490] subscription and then what you want is [1491] customer subscription um created right [1494] over here and then uh you don't want to [1497] force a different API version you click [1499] save and basically what will happen is [1501] anytime a new um stripe customer [1503] subscription is created so a uh customer [1508] you create a subscription the customer [1509] like completes the subscription um this [1511] will be an event that you can then [1512] capture and it'll include some Fields [1514] like if we go back here it'll include [1517] the um customer ID which then you can [1520] use to call customer data uh it'll [1522] include like some event information [1523] it'll include like the discount the [1525] items on the subscription how much money [1526] it costs all that stuff uh so you can do [1528] whatever you want with that and what [1530] we're going to do after the watch events [1531] is we're going to feed in a get [1535] customer or retrieve a customer I think [1538] yeah there we [1539] go and then we're going to feed in the [1541] ID of the customer that we just watched [1544] here so we'll scroll down here to [1546] customer and then I'm just going to [1548] select all their [1549] information and in stripe you know [1551] you'll store like the name the company [1553] name the address whatever information [1554] you need uh you can even use metadata um [1556] stripe has a bunch of metadata fields [1558] where you can like add information when [1559] you create the customer and then after [1562] you get this transaction what we need to [1563] do is we need to send an email right so [1565] I'm just going to go over here to the [1566] email [1567] module and then uh I'm going to let's [1571] just create a draft for now I'm going to [1573] use the create a draft but you know [1574] Susie if you wanted to use this in [1575] reality you would do the um send an [1578] email which is right over here uh the [1580] create a draft is just going to like [1581] make something in my draft so I don't [1583] have to like send a million billion [1584] emails while testing [1586] this the folder I'm going to do this [1589] uh for whatever reason you have to go [1590] here manually and then select drafts [1592] which is annoying uh the email that I'm [1593] going to use is I'm going to go to the [1595] customer module here and then I'm going [1597] to scroll down till it says email so [1598] that's how I know I'm going to be [1599] sending it to them and then from here on [1602] it's just copyright right you can send [1603] whatever you want so how do she phrase [1605] it send an email to our team with new [1606] client info oh actually we're not [1607] sending this to the customer we're [1608] sending this to our team so maybe [1610] there's like a team um at whatever your [1612] agency.com um whatever your agency is [1615] called.com address and then maybe it'll [1617] be like new [1619] subscription created and then we can use [1621] like customer email so I don't [1624] know um we could [1628] say hello team and then we could [1632] go br br br is just a Break Tag it [1635] basically allows me to create a new line [1637] um so this will be hello team and then [1639] what what this will really look like is [1641] this but we're using HTML tags here just [1644] because it allows us some additional [1645] formatting and I really like it so hello [1648] team new line new [1649] line we've just created or a new [1653] customer has just joined here is their [1659] information and then uh you know we can [1661] put in whatever data we want so I don't [1664] know like you could put in their email [1666] and then if you have this metadata field [1669] uh you could put it in here as well so I [1670] don't know maybe in the metadata field [1672] you do a bunch of other data on the [1673] customer like what the customer's [1675] company name is all that stuff um [1677] obviously you could put in like their [1678] name which is important uh what else you [1680] could put in I'm not sure uh just [1683] depends on the specifics of how much [1684] information you want um assuming that [1687] you are storing all this information in [1689] stripe you're getting it in stripe but [1691] let's say you have like a CRM or [1692] something like click up where you're [1693] managing customer information um you [1695] could also store the ID of the clickup [1697] record in the metadata field and then [1699] extract that and then use that to call [1700] clickup first before you do any of the [1702] stuff to like grab all the other [1703] information that you [1704] have and then what I'll do is I'll just [1707] add two new lines here here and I'll say [1708] thank [1711] you and then we'll go [1715] system so we are just creating a draft [1718] here and we're drafting it to whatever [1720] your team um URL is or you know your [1724] sorry your Gmail sorry good lord it's [1726] been a long time since I've slept you [1728] are connecting it to your email address [1730] uh that your team uses for [1732] communications uh that's what I put in [1733] there Susie in addition has requested [1737] after we do all the dash stuff we need [1738] to send the welcome email to the new [1739] client with a welcome message and newly [1741] created clickup dashboard link so what [1743] do we have to do now um I have my API [1745] key variable over here you don't have to [1747] add this you could just hard code it in [1748] the request but uh I'm just doing this [1750] that I in post it's going to save me a [1751] bit of time I don't know have to like [1752] track the API key to cancel it out but [1756] what we want here is uh we'd feed in [1758] whatever the template is that we're [1760] using so in my case I'm feeding in DH a [1763] gt-22 if you guys have a specific [1765] template that is different from that you [1767] know let's say template is I don't know [1770] DH gt- 399 like you need to you need to [1773] copy and paste that in here and that [1774] needs to be the the hardcoded [1777] template um this probably isn't relevant [1780] but I'm keeping it in here right now and [1783] then uh what we want is we want to put [1785] the name of the [1787] client [1789] here so I'm assuming that this name [1791] field is the company name so I'm just [1794] going to pull this directly from um [1796] stripe and the name is going to be the [1798] company name so now what have we done [1801] we've created a dashboard or duplicate [1805] dashboard we're renaming [1810] dashboard um and then we're just going [1813] to send a welcome email to the new [1815] client with the welcome message so I'm [1817] going to copy and paste this draft [1820] Creator and then I'm going to say [1824] welcome [1826] aboard and I'll say hello [1829] and then again you know maybe you have [1830] the metadata stored U maybe there's like [1832] a name field in the metadata I'm just [1833] going to leave metadata here maybe it's [1835] like you know metadata. uh name so maybe [1839] it's like first name or something I [1840] don't know this is the contact on the [1842] account this is your own data structure [1843] you've created so hello metadata. first [1845] name a new customers just joined here's [1847] their uh we're not going to do that [1849] we're going to [1850] say thanks for trusting us with your [1853] project can't wait to kick off and [1857] deliver something beautiful for [1860] you uh I'm not going to pretend like I [1863] know what all the stuff is but what I am [1865] going to do is I'll [1870] say [1872] here's your clickup dashboard [1876] link and then I'm going to use a [1880] tags um which is just a way to insert a [1883] link and then I'm going to do two more [1885] new lines inside of ah equals these two [1888] quotes I need to put in the link to the [1891] dashboard so if I open this up it'll [1894] just be whatever this URL is so what I'm [1896] going to do is I'll put in this URL and [1899] then I'm going to replace the end here [1900] with the ID of the dashboard that I've [1903] created back [1905] here so this is uh dhag t-49 this is the [1909] result of my successful request it sends [1911] you back the dashboard [1913] ID and then uh I don't know I'll just [1916] say whatever the company is presumably [1918] you know it's like Stephanie at workflow [1920] Loop or something like whoever whoever [1922] helped the client set up right so yeah [1926] and then you'd probably also have a [1927] bunch of additional onboarding um [1929] information [1931] here like you know please do X Y and Z [1935] book a call here um you know read this [1939] doc [1942] Etc just going to leave that [1945] be and then uh let me see if there's [1947] anything else that we would need to do [1948] in order to scope this out [1950] completely yeah send welcome email to [1952] new client with a welcome message and a [1954] newly created clickup dashboard link [1956] yeah that's about that [1958] um while I'm here why don't I go [1963] to manage users and see if I could just [1967] add a user via API too that'd be pretty [1972] sweet we'll go Network I'm going to [1975] add one of my uh calls here and then [1978] it's just going to be Nick left click. [1980] I'll press invite okay so there is an [1981] email lead endpoint so um Susie if you [1985] wanted to do this automatically what you [1988] could do is you could also let's say [1991] they're not actually part of your [1992] workspace yet at the very beginning of [1994] this here when after you receive the [1995] request you [1999] could have another module here and you [2001] could call [2003] this you know invite user or something [2006] to click up You' have to be a little [2008] wary of permissions because permissions [2010] would be different um they as a member [2012] would have access to [2015] everything it looks like email lead is [2018] just their server um call and you feed [2022] in the email address then it'll go [2024] through and basically invite them to [2025] your clickup for you uh but yeah you'll [2028] receive a result called already signed [2031] up uh true or false and then if it's [2033] false then you'll know that they're not [2035] already signed up if it's true you'll [2036] know that they are um which is pretty [2038] neat so yeah there there a lot I you [2042] know there's a lot of ways that you can [2044] um improve a flow like this obviously [2047] and customize it further um I was a [2050] little bit unsure exactly where you were [2051] at when it came to users being party or [2053] clickup or not it's why I provided you a [2055] bunch of options and opportunities but [2057] uh yeah I'll I'll just leave this in [2059] here with that endpoint just so that you [2060] know what to do aside from that this is [2062] the flow from start to finish right you [2064] are watching the events retrieving a [2065] customer creating a draft um in inviting [2068] user duplicating a dashboard renaming it [2069] and then sending out an email so because [2072] I have the strip module set up here I'm [2074] just going to export this blueprint [2075] first because I'm going to um share this [2078] with you guys after and what I'm going [2079] to do now is I'm actually just going to [2080] replace these stripe modules here [2082] because I don't actually want to go and [2083] like pay $5 to my credit card I'm just [2085] going to replace them with my own Fields [2087] um using the basic trigger [2088] module and then uh I'm going to actually [2091] like run this thing from start to finish [2092] just so you guys can see what it would [2094] look like so the name of this I'm going [2096] to do um um we'll do client email and [2100] the value of this is going to be my own [2102] email [2103] nick. we're going to pretend that [2105] there's uh you know like a like a like a [2108] package name or [2110] something and I'll say silver [2114] plus I am going to do company name and [2117] we'll just call this left [2120] click and then maybe there's like a [2122] first name as well we'll just do Nick so [2126] pretend that this is information that [2127] we're getting from stripe I'll say um [2130] watch stripe [2132] subscription and if and only this if uh [2135] maybe the status of this is [2142] completed so if status is equal to [2146] completed I mean you know I'm probably [2148] going to be receiving the completed [2149] request anyway because that's what I was [2151] watching but then we can proceed with [2152] the rest of [2154] this I'm just going to pretend that this [2156] is my client email [2158] this is the package [2160] name this is the uh first [2164] name um sorry maybe this is the company [2168] name and then maybe this is also the [2170] first [2173] name the API key step is good um I'm [2177] then going to oh yeah sorry I got to [2179] remove this as part of my flow because [2180] I'm assuming that I'm already added what [2182] I'll do is I will then duplicate the [2184] dashboard which is good doesn't look [2187] like I need to do anything here in terms [2188] of like add additional info it's [2190] duplicating my dashboard is fine then I [2192] need to feed in my duplicated dashboard [2194] ID just right over [2196] here um and then the name that I want [2198] this to be is I want this to be my [2199] company name if you think back to it if [2201] I'm like duplicating a dashboard it be [2202] nice if it's my company name then I want [2204] to create a draft this draft is now [2206] going to go to the client email which I [2208] have here and then I'm going to say hey [2211] first name here is your dashboard link [2214] thank you Stephanie at workflow Loop [2216] presumably Stephanie's the one that put [2217] all the stuff [2219] together and then what I'm going to do [2221] here is what email am I sing this from [2222] info once un copy okay let me just open [2224] up this email make sure that I have [2226] it available so y'all can [2229] see okay let's go back [2233] here and we should be good I just want [2236] to open this and hold on I actually want [2238] to delete this so that I could see this [2239] happen [2240] live okay let's give us a run this looks [2244] like it was completed we now created a [2247] draft we use the API key to duplicate a [2249] dashboard we've then renamed a dashboard [2250] and then we've created another draft so [2252] if I go back to drafts here there are [2254] two emails number one was hello team a [2257] new customers just joined here's their [2258] information right here's the info that I [2260] pulled from stripe this next one's [2261] welcome board hello first name thanks [2263] for trusting with your project can't [2264] wait to kick off and deliver something [2265] beautiful for you here's some additional [2267] onboarding information and here is the [2269] clickup dashboard link now uh before I [2272] do that let me just verify that if we go [2274] back here and duplicate [2276] it um the dashboard was created it does [2278] look like the dashboard was created [2279] however there was an issue with the API [2281] call cuz this is still called dashboard [2282] one [2284] so why did this take so long oh [2288] dashboard not found okay so what's the [2291] id of this dashboard was [2293] created 517 right we're calling 517 so [2298] what probably happened is we just called [2299] a little too fast click up server [2301] probably takes more than a few [2302] milliseconds to generate this so I'm [2304] just going to add a sleep and I'm going [2306] to sleep here for 5 [2309] seconds I'm going to realign this and [2312] I'm going to run this thing one more [2315] time uh I'm also going to go back to [2317] dashboards delete this other one [2324] here looks like the rename worked this [2327] time which is good if I refresh this we [2331] now have the company name of left click [2333] and then if I go back to my drafts we [2335] also have those two drafts that were [2336] created then if I if I click on this [2338] clickup dashboard link and I open it uh [2340] we're taking directly to uh H why are we [2343] taking a 517 instead of 537 it's kind of [2348] odd [2355] um feel like I might have pulled the oh [2359] sorry sorry I'm looking at the wrong [2361] email my bad we got to go to this one [2364] here [2369] yeah has to say 537 not 517 let me [2372] reload this whole [2378] page okay now we have [2380] two that's not the right one so I'm [2382] going to close both of [2385] these um oh this is the one my bad yeah [2389] yeah so this is the one right here that [2392] says 537 if I were to click on this link [2394] as a customer then I would go directly [2395] to the dashboard which is the intended [2397] EXP experience uh now I can see you know [2399] the average cycle time and odd stuff all [2401] right cool it's was a little bit worried [2402] there at the end thought maybe I missed [2403] something but uh yeah that is the system [2405] from start to finish thanks so much for [2406] watching hope you guys appreciated [2408] learning how to utilize hidden apis in [2410] this way there are very few people out [2412] there that know how to do this and few [2413] are still that are talking about it uh [2415] but I figured I'd just you know give you [2416] guys the secret sauce as uh in in as [2419] upfront a way as humanly possible as [2421] I've shown you it's not all sunshine and [2423] rainbows you are probably going to have [2424] stumbling blocks with hidden apis [2425] because there's no manual there's no [2427] documentation they don't tell you how to [2428] do it you kind of have to figure it all [2430] out for yourself uh if you guys have any [2431] questions about this feel free to leave [2433] a comment down below otherwise like [2434] subscribe and I'll see you all in the [2436] next video thanks so much

Title: How I Scope Automation Projects In Make.com
[0] hey everybody Nick here and in this [1] video I'm going to show you how to scope [3] automation projects from start to finish [5] I'll show you my four-step framework [7] that helps me scope any automation [9] project especially ones whose platforms [11] I don't understand I'll show you how to [13] build out a flow map I'll show you how [14] to identify the highest Ry Parts your [16] flow and then I'm actually going to go [18] ahead and scope like a real live client [20] project that uses a really weird [22] platform that I think like less than 100 [24] people all over the world to use or [25] something I may be mistaken on that and [27] maybe they'll you know try and sue me [29] for it later but yeah very unknown [31] platform that I think will help [32] elucidate um how to approach new systems [35] that you just have no idea where to [36] start with so if scoping sounds like [38] something you guys want to work with and [39] improve on then this is the video for [41] you stay tuned and let's get into [45] it so one of the most common questions I [47] get just before I get into everything is [49] Nick is this XYZ thing possible and the [52] truth is today in modernity basically [55] anything is possible if you know a [58] system doesn't have like a make module [60] available well great you can just call [61] the API if a system doesn't have an API [63] well you can just make your own [65] using scrapers or whatever the reason [67] why I bring this up is is to show you [68] that the question you should be [69] answering is not is this possible it's [73] is this worth the time energy and cost [76] that it would take to make this project [78] work and work well for a long period of [80] time like if you're evaluating your own [82] internal business build you want I don't [85] know some lead generation system and the [87] systems or the platforms that you're [89] looking to use to build this thing don't [91] natively support the functionality that [92] you want you can always build that [94] functionality in yourself I mean we're [96] like basically techno Wizards at this [97] point right any feature that you want [99] there are platforms and coding languages [102] and systems available that can allow you [103] to to build things for them but the [106] question isn't you know is it possible [108] the question is just like is it worth it [110] um you know am I paying myself enough [111] money to do this is this worth the time [113] and energy that I'm spending is this [115] worth the internal cost the [116] maintainability downside the opportunity [118] cost all that stuff so whether you're [120] building a system for yourself or [121] whether you're building a system for [121] somebody else just keep that in mind [123] it's never a yes or no it's always like [126] like how worth it is this project now [129] what I have open here is I have a [129] Whimsical it's a visual flowchart tool [131] and I use this for uh most of my most of [133] my projects nowadays and what I have [136] underneath it is I have a four-step mind [139] map essentially where I go through this [141] process more or less every time I get a [143] project that I don't know whether or not [144] it'll work like I'm at the point in my [146] own career where I've worked with so [148] many of these platforms and I understand [149] that apis pretty intuitively so I don't [151] actually have to do all four of these [152] steps myself when I'm building something [154] for myself or building something for a [156] client but if I get some platform I've [158] just never heard of and if I'm not very [160] confident in whether it's feasible uh [163] this is the process that I will do every [164] time and this is the process that you [165] know maybe people that are a little bit [166] earlier on in their careers can just [168] kind of get in the hobit of doing so [170] I'll run through this and then I'm [171] actually going to show you guys a live [173] example uh where I scope a real client [175] project that I did uh maybe 6 months ago [177] or so for a client uh that went really [180] well and it was with just a bunch of [181] weird ass random platforms that I never [183] used before so presumably you know at [184] the same level of knowledge as most of [186] you that are watching step number one [188] and always probably the most important [190] step is you got to ask yourself what is [192] the deliverable that the client will be [195] seeing the reason why we ask ourselves [197] this is because if you think about it [199] from your own Valley that you're [200] providing like the client doesn't care [202] about the system that you build they [204] don't care that you're using apify and [205] make.com and you're using like a scraper [207] and hook deck and you're doing all this [209] fancy stuff in the background the only [211] thing that they care about and really [213] the only thing that you care about too [214] if it's an internal system is what am I [216] seeing what am I getting at the end of [218] this so what I mean is let's say you're [219] building a lead generation system what [222] are you seeing when you build that lead [223] generation system what's the output of [224] the lead generation system well it's [226] probably going to be leads right but [228] what do the leads look like is it an [229] email with the first name last name [231] email address of the lead is it a booked [234] meeting in your calendar like what's the [236] notification that you're getting what is [237] the the deliverable what is like the the [239] the the visual little box that the [241] client gets that they have to unwrap in [243] order to get the result right that's the [245] most important thing in our case the [248] second is I'd recommend you make a map [250] using a flowchart platform now I wrote [252] here Whimsical I'm not affiliated with [254] these guys at all I would like to be [256] these guys are awesome and I love their [257] software but essentially you need to [259] create a map of all of the steps [261] procedurally in your flow from start to [263] finish and then what I do is any steps [265] that I'm unsure of whether or not are [267] possible I will use U whims as a feature [269] you can just make a different shape and [271] then I will uh just kind of identify it [273] as like an API step with my shape I'll [275] use use like a triangle or something and [277] I'll show you guys what this looks like [278] in a live project in a minute so you see [279] what I mean for every API step after [282] that because you know presumably like [284] the platforms are using these apis we [285] don't know all them off the top of our [286] head what we have to do is we have to [288] map the input to the output we have to [290] get the variable names and properties we [292] have to make sure that the data that [293] we're looking for or that we need works [295] on that API platform uh and then you [298] know we have to just verify that that [299] that we can do what we want and then if [300] we can't do what we want we have to find [301] a workaround so maybe instead of calling [303] one API to find like a list of customers [306] first we have to find a list of orders [308] and then we have to iterate through all [309] the orders until we find one with our [310] customer ID right these are these are [313] additional steps that we have to take [314] but we can figure all of the stuff out [316] usually without even making an account [317] on the platform simply by verifying the [319] API and the reason why we go to the API [321] first is because you know even if [323] there's no module available to us in the [324] no code platform we're using let's say [326] make.com or zappier or I don't know na10 [328] or something um [330] you can always just make an API call and [332] so this is like the the worst it'll ever [334] get so if you know that you could do [335] what the worst you could ever get you [336] can kind of like work backwards from [337] there and then the last step is if [339] there's no API step uh you can also [340] consider building your own API just with [342] like a scraping or crawling platform and [344] usually that involves using something [346] like apify you'll put together a a [348] scraper which will like go to a URL [350] resource and then it will just scrape [352] the whole page and then maybe you'll [354] feed it into AI or something to extract [356] data and put them in adjacent fields and [358] in this way you're basically creating [359] your own input and output right instead [361] of the API stuff that previously you'd [363] send a customer ID to and then you'd [365] receive a list of orders now you um just [368] ping a a web page and then you extract a [370] list of orders and then you kind of get [372] the same functionality at the end of so [374] these are my four steps I do these steps [375] anytime I have a more complicated [377] project if you've never scoped a project [379] from start to finish I'd encourage you [380] guys to give this a try the reason why [381] scoping is so valuable by the way is [384] because uh in bigger teams when you [386] start working with other people or when [389] you're doing some internal business [390] project and it just requires a little [391] bit of collaboration having a scope is [393] sort of like the SC the shared language [395] that all of the engineers and developers [396] in the team will use to to to interpret [399] the project and to know what's going on [401] and the cool part about a scope to is [403] it's typically platform agnostic that's [405] just a fancy way of saying like since [407] the scope is on Whimsical or it's on a [409] flowchart platform it's not on make.com [411] or na10 it's dealing with apis it's [413] dealing with like uh steps right but [415] it's not dealing with like particular [416] modules you can take a scope and then [418] you can like use whatever you want to [420] build it right you don't have to you [423] know you can take the output of this [424] which is usually like a Whimsical map [425] with API steps detailed and then you can [427] build it out in zap here you can build [429] it out in na10 you could build it out in [430] code if you wanted to so it's sort of [432] like this um agnostic more general map [436] that you and anybody else in your team [437] that may not have the same skill set as [439] you uh can use in order to get a project [441] done which uh you know is obviously very [443] very valuable but any that's where we're [446] at right now this is how I personally [447] scope automation projects uh instead of [450] just talking about Theory what I'm [451] actually going to do is I'm going to [451] show you how I would scope a project [453] from start to finish for a real client [454] of mine and this is basically what I did [457] um I think I was using Lucid chart at [458] the time and I don't have access to my [460] specific flow chart where I built it out [462] unfortunately but I will show you [464] exactly how I would how I did scope this [466] project and how I would moving forward [469] so this is a real client of mine this is [470] a client that I got uh forever ago um I [474] think I got them off up workk I don't [477] remember exactly where I got them maybe [478] it was through up or maybe it's through [480] coldo I don't know but it's a real [481] client and essentially what they were is [482] they were an air conditioning company [484] and this is a very successful air [486] conditioning company they were crushing [487] it and uh they couldn't handle the [490] volume of leads that they were getting [492] and they were so overwhelmed with [494] success that they were actually like [496] forgetting to follow up with leads and [497] money was just like leaking through [499] their whole process so their flow prior [501] to me was they would run ads on Facebook [504] and the Facebook ads would be something [506] like hey want like an air conditioner [508] you know summer's coming up [510] um you know get a rebate of X dollar if [513] you apply here I think it was in [514] Australia or something because they have [516] like the flipped winter summer thing so [518] was a smack daab in the middle of summer [519] there were some rebates going on you [521] could save a bunch of money and so you [523] know the Facebook ad was obviously very [524] enticing people click on it they'd fill [526] out a little uh form with some [528] information their first name last name [529] their email address whatever and then [530] they'd um send that data to the air [533] conditioning company and the way that [535] the air conditioning company would see [536] this data is they would get an email and [539] the email would include like a field [540] that said first name person's company uh [542] sorry first name first name last name [545] last name email address you know Nick [547] whatever.com right so they'd get some [549] information the one thing they wouldn't [551] get is they wouldn't get the phone [551] number and I in for the life of me I [553] have no idea why they wouldn't get the [554] phone number I guess they just like [556] maybe their ads guys tried getting the [557] phone numbers and they found that people [559] didn't want to put them in or whatever [560] but they never got the phone numbers [561] which kind of weird so uh what would [564] happen is they'd get an email address [566] with those fields and then maybe some [567] information about the home so maybe like [568] the home address or how many floors the [570] home had or all that stuff and then [572] usually what would happen is a team [573] member on the air conditioning team [575] would get that data and then they would [577] manually add the lead to their CRM which [579] they called simpro and Simo is some [582] janky ass super old platform you know [585] hand to God I uh I've only used it once [587] so maybe there's some amazing [588] functionality I'm missing but uh from [590] what I could see it was some janky ass [591] super crappy platform that like was [594] specific for you know local service [596] contractors or something uh which had [598] like a booking feature had a quote [599] feature but it was crap it was really [601] old it was really annoying they had like [603] tons of login issues and authentication [605] issues and stuff like that and for [606] whatever reason they were just using it [607] for the last God knows how many years so [609] they this is their process then once [612] they've been added to the CRM platform [613] they would email the lead to try and set [615] up a call because they didn't have their [616] phone number but most people would not [618] want to call so instead they would ask [621] the lead for some more information about [622] their home over email uh stuff like hey [624] you know thanks for filling up the thing [626] but like we're currently missing the [626] number of floors you have do you mind [627] like telling how many floors in your [629] home or something like that and then if [631] the lead responded and only if they [633] would um send all of the information [637] like they basically forward the email [638] chain to an engineer on their team who [640] would be responsible for like building [641] out a quote um and the engineer like we [644] needed an engineer to do this because um [646] the company was doing like duct work and [649] specific codes and regulations and [651] bylaws that were like specific to that [652] particular [653] region uh so what they do is they then [656] build out this this plan and then they'd [658] whip it up into a proposal they called [659] it a quote but it was a proposal and [661] then theyd send it over to the client [663] the reason I I tell you this is because [664] in order to scope a project [667] efficiently you obviously need to have a [669] lot of context you need to know uh what [671] the client does for a living how their [673] sales process works and that sort of [674] thing so really the first step is to [676] like understand that ask them questions [678] if you don't get it try and map out [679] exactly um where a lead flows in the [681] system where a project is created in the [683] system and that sort of thing before you [684] actually even even get to this step but [687] the reason I give you this is because [688] this is about the same information you [689] realistically get if you were talking to [690] somebody or um you know if if you're [693] trying to build out a system for [694] yourself you need to know all of this [695] before you even start and I mentioned [698] here that if you're an automation [699] everything that I mentioned to you above [700] Probably sounds pretty dumb it's [701] probably like dude that is super under [703] optimized why do you automate this step [704] why do you automate that step and you [707] know I I agree with you entirely but [709] that's really where the value that I [710] bring comes to the table um and the main [712] reason why they couldn't really do [713] anything is because their software stack [715] was really limiting so in terms of the [716] platforms that we're using for those [718] they used a platform called Sim as I [719] mentioned which handles their bookings [720] and it was like uh contractor software [723] then they wanted to use pipe Drive which [725] is like a like a CRM platform um and [728] then they also wanted to use pandadoc to [730] send out these quotes but they were just [731] having trouble doing it and so they [733] always ended up kind of like in this [734] weird Middle Ground where they I don't [736] know they didn't know enough about the [737] software to like really use it to your [738] full potential and then the CRM was [740] always so cluttered that they could [741] never really move over to Pipe drive and [742] blah blah blah obviously they wanted to [745] optimate as much of the stuff as [746] possible because um because of the load [749] they were only ever really dealing with [750] 20 or 30% of the leads they were just [752] leaving so much money in the table and [754] that's really where they brought me in [755] right their saleswomen forget about a [757] lot of these people in the pipeline um [759] and they had like a really good funnel [760] and and stuff like that especially like [762] top of funnel with their ads um and you [764] know like they they just wanted to fix [765] it so that's kind of where I come in so [767] this is sort of like you can kind of [768] think about this um you know if maybe [770] you're running like a big agency or [771] something that builds out these services [772] for people this is sort of like your [774] client card it's kind of like the [775] context that you get on the client in [777] order to know what they're doing [779] uh you know what problems they're [780] suffering from and that sort of thing [782] before you actually build on a system um [784] you also just get this information over [785] a call um in my case I got it over a [787] call so that's that's pretty valuable if [789] you're trying to sell automation through [791] maybe like upwork or something then [792] maybe you get it through like the the [794] proposal page maybe they tell you all [795] about this just in the proposal I don't [796] know but you just got to make sure to [798] understand all this stuff okay so that [801] is my little client card um what is the [803] actual process that I'm going to follow [805] for this client well the first thing I'm [806] going to do is I'm going to ask what is [807] the deliverable visible to the End [810] customer going to be so if I think about [813] their process here what they're [815] currently doing is they're adding uh [816] lead to Simo and they're emailing the [818] lead to trans set up the call and then [820] they ask the lead for some information [822] and then they send a proposal so kind of [824] like the customer Journey here starts [827] with a Facebook ad and so um there'll be [830] some Facebook ad that the you know [833] Prospect will see and presumably it's a [835] great Facebook ad and you know that'll [837] like completely wow them to the point [839] where they enter their information in so [840] that's kind of the first thing that the [841] customer sees right now uh I'm not [843] really responsible for that so I'm not [845] going to include that in my system but I [846] but I just need to know this I need to [847] have this in my head the second thing is [849] um we're going to send them an email of [850] some kind right we ask them for [852] information so like one of the [854] deliverables probably the first [855] deliverable that I'm going to think [856] about is okay I'm going to be sending [857] the client an email of some kind or the [859] customer an email of some kind my [861] client's customer is going to see the [863] email and presumably that's how they're [864] going to decide whether or not like [865] we're professionals they it's going to [867] make a big impression on whether or not [868] they want to continue talking to us so [870] that's number one number two is the [871] proposal at some point sorry there's [873] some big truck outside hopefully you [874] guys can't hear that it's um honking the [877] second part is uh is the proposal right [879] depending on the quality of The Proposal [881] whether or not it's a good proposal um [883] whether or not it has all the [883] information and stuff like that the [885] client's customer is going to make a [887] determination as to whether or not they [888] want to work with that business so I'm [890] starting at the end first because these [891] are the two most important things to the [893] client and I need to hold these things [895] in my mind because uh the success of the [898] entire system system is going to depend [899] on the success of those two steps so I [901] know that the deliverables are going to [903] be um and what I'm going to do here is [906] I'm just going to copy this little [908] note and I'm just going to say [911] deliverables and the first is going to [913] be an [914] email asking for additional info the [917] second is going to be proposal quoting [920] the airon [922] installation let's make this a little [923] bit bigger here there you go so these [926] are the the first things that I'm going [928] to be thinking about now the second [930] thing is I need to make a map I [931] basically need to create like a [932] flowchart um and then identify API steps [935] during this flowchart process for me [938] later on to go into the specific API [940] documentations I'll do that live in [941] front of you I'll show you how I think [942] about these API steps um just to [944] determine whether or not this is this is [945] going to [946] work so in this case uh as I mentioned [949] earlier they are manually adding a lead [951] to their serum platform called simpo so [953] presumably we can automate all this [954] stuff so I'm going to go over here and [956] I'm just going to there's some feature [959] here in whimsicle where you can create [960] like a section so I'm going to call this [964] my um process flow map going make this [969] really big and this is what I'm going to [971] be using to sort of um embody all the [974] steps in my [975] process so maybe it was a little bit too [978] big whatever um the first thing that [980] happens is is a new lead is acquired [985] right and the way that we see a new lead [987] being acquired is uh uh there's a new [989] lead email I should [991] say so right now we have a new lead [993] email that hits the inbox right now [995] they're doing this manually they are [997] taking the information adding it to [998] simpro but odds are if it's a new lead [1001] email and it's the same format every [1002] single time what we can do is we can [1004] automate this process by parsing the [1005] fields even if it's not the same every [1007] time we could probably feed this into AI [1009] have ai really quickly like extract the [1011] data from that email and then turn those [1013] into structured fields for us now if I [1015] was unsure whether or not this process [1017] made sense I would actually go and I [1018] would test this I would ask the client [1019] hey can you send me a few new lead [1020] emails so I can run through and just [1022] make sure that we can do the parsing or [1024] the extraction uh in my case I mean uh [1026] I'm very confident about this the the [1028] power of artificial intelligence here [1030] because extracting an email address and [1031] name and maybe like an additional field [1033] very very straightforward process so I [1034] just know that that's probably going to [1035] work so I'm okay on that step for the [1037] for the scoping so new lead email hits [1040] inbox what am I going to do I'm going to [1041] parse Fields I'm going to convert to [1046] Json now from here I'm going to [1049] add to Simo now I don't actually know [1052] what I'm going to be adding to Simo yet [1054] so what I'm going to do is I'm going to [1054] go over here and I'm going to change the [1056] shape um to this this will be my API [1058] step maybe this represents like sending [1060] or receiving data from a database or [1062] something [1063] right next up um once they're added into [1065] Simo we would email the lead to try and [1067] set up a call so what we what what can [1070] we do here it sounds like um they don't [1073] just want to email them to set up a call [1075] they'll ask the lead for some more [1076] information about their homeover email [1077] and then if the lead responded to the [1078] air the air conditioning company would [1080] send the information to an engineer on [1081] the team so U what we can do is we can [1083] make the ad to simper trigger assuming [1084] that this works [1085] out fortunately it's um kind of [1089] templating at that same API step I don't [1090] really want to do that but we can say [1092] assuming that the the add to Simo is [1098] successful uh let's just make this a [1099] little bigger double click and I'll say [1103] um assuming it's successful and the only [1104] instance in which it wouldn't be [1105] successful is if this if the lead [1107] doesn't already exist [1109] then we would send templated [1113] email and what we could do is if we're [1115] getting a bunch of customized data we [1117] wouldn't just send like a template any [1118] like hello Peter thank you for filling [1120] out our form we would like to blah blah [1121] blah blah we could actually use AI or [1123] something to customize the first line of [1124] that email I just make it a lot higher [1126] quality I didn't actually do this for [1127] the system now that I'm thinking about [1128] it but it's probably because I didn't [1129] spend the time and energy to like really [1131] fully map this out as I am now so that's [1134] another benefit here you get you get [1135] really really granular in the quality of [1136] the system you can build okay so um [1139] let's say it doesn't exist uh then we're [1141] going to send a templated email and I'll [1144] deal with all of the the the other [1145] routes and stuff like that after those [1147] aren't the most important things we just [1148] want to verify whether or not this works [1150] kind of off the top of my head [1154] um you know my goal is always to reduce [1157] human involvement wherever possible so [1159] if I send a template [1160] email and then they respond to the email [1163] well now I have to wait until somebody [1165] on the team sees the response so it' be [1167] much better if we had a a way to [1169] automatically pull the contents of the [1171] templated email responses so let's say [1173] we ask them for three questions let's [1174] say we ask them um hey what's the square [1177] footage in your home hey how many floors [1178] does your home have and three what's [1180] like the full address of your home or [1182] something right those are the three [1183] pieces of information we had we could [1184] just send that an in an email we could [1186] say like uh you know put at you know [1188] information one two three but if we were [1190] to do that um you know presumably people [1192] would people can respond with like a [1195] range of formats and values um some [1197] people like like the data probably [1199] wouldn't be very easy to parse we could [1200] use artificial intelligence to parse [1202] this um but given that this would [1205] probably be a lot more complex like [1207] maybe it's like hey what's a square [1208] footage of the home and somebody says [1209] hey you know it's 1,290 ft but our [1212] balcony is an additional like 130 f feet [1214] and also like our basement a little bit [1215] and blah blah BL blah I don't really [1217] trust that this is going to do as good [1218] of a job so my my mindset here is um you [1220] know there has to be a procedural way [1221] that we could do this a lot easier and [1223] by procedural way I mean like I'd [1225] consider AI very flexible which is great [1227] but sometimes the flexibility is it's [1228] downfall so if I have a way where I can [1230] just get the data in the right format [1231] every single time then that's what I [1233] want to do and when I see a step like [1235] this like we're sending a template an [1236] email asking for information my first [1238] thought is why don't we just send a form [1239] we can send a form to the customers the [1241] form will ensure the right format right [1243] we'll be able to parse the data [1244] ourselves just without having to use any [1246] AI or anything and that'll basically [1248] guarantee like 100% success rate so I'm [1250] not just going to send a templated email [1251] I'm going to send a templated email with [1253] a form there are many form platforms we [1255] could use to do this we could send um [1257] like a type form we could send uh like a [1260] u form we could send a paper form we [1261] could send jot form we could do a Google [1262] form it's free right so I just know off [1265] the top of my head that we're going to [1265] have a lot of um a lot of options here [1268] but what we need to do is we need a way [1270] to uh pass data into that form so that [1273] we know like when the customer responds [1275] and fills out the form we get instantly [1277] notified uh because if we get instantly [1279] notified we'll then be able to shorten [1280] the the cycle in the process quite [1282] considerably right like if you imagine [1284] how how it used to work is um they would [1286] ask uh for some information for like the [1288] square footage maybe the number of [1289] floors maybe the full address the [1291] customer might take like 6 hours then [1293] they get back 6 hours later and then [1295] despite the fact that they took 6 hours [1297] to respond we don't get the information [1298] immediately what they used to do is the [1299] salesperson would have to like wait [1301] until the salesperson was on the email [1302] and then they'd like read the email and [1304] only in only when they got to it would [1305] they actually do something with that [1306] info well we can actually shorten that [1307] whole Loop by attaching a watcher to [1310] that form so maybe like um you know if [1311] we're using like type form we can know [1313] when the type form is completed we can [1315] watch form submissions and the second [1317] that that form is done we can do [1318] something with it maybe we can send it [1320] to our engineer or whatnot the way that [1322] you would do this is you would have to [1323] send some data alongside this [1327] form so uh what we could probably do is [1330] Simo I imagine um and most uh most crms [1335] do this they host some type of like ID [1337] per user so we could probably just feed [1339] the user ID from Simo into the type form [1341] as a hidden variable um type form allows [1344] uh basically like if you have your type [1346] form here typ form.com [1348] whatever um this is the form ID you [1351] could have like a query so maybe we do [1354] like uh Simo ID equals whatever what we [1358] could do is we could send an email that [1360] contains this ID here 2f2 3F and then [1364] when the customer finishes the form we [1367] could grab the output of the form and [1368] then use it to update something in Simo [1370] maybe we could say um you know we could [1373] like add a custom field or something I [1374] don't know if somean allows this to be [1375] honest it's been so long since I've [1376] worked with them so we can scope that [1378] out um in a second but the point that [1381] I'm making is I'm just doing a lot of uh [1382] I'm doing my due diligence here and I'm [1384] thinking deeply about you know how we [1386] could best utilize data and how we could [1387] best minimize the number of steps here [1389] because previously everything was manual [1390] we're going to try and make everything [1391] automat [1393] automated okay so that's the add to [1395] symos step that's a send templated email [1397] with form and then we could say [1401] um fills out [1404] form and assuming that the customer does [1407] indeed fill out the form [1409] we could do something so if they do fill [1411] out the form what do we want to do uh [1413] well obviously we want to send this data [1415] to our engineer from the sounds of [1417] things we can't automate the engineering [1418] step this is something that like you [1419] need to license in order to do so I'm [1421] just going to send this to an [1424] engineer this is sort of like a manual [1426] step and usually I will represent manual [1428] steps with different shapes so I don't [1430] know I don't really have my own like a [1432] shape in mind here maybe we'll do this [1438] and we will um Define send to Engineers [1441] with this little outline all of mine are [1443] completely different sometimes it's like [1444] a circle sometimes it's a square [1446] sometimes it's like a little KY thing [1448] like check out this shape man this one's [1451] crazy it just shows how screwed up it is [1453] to have to send something to a human [1456] just kidding um and then the engineer [1458] will actually do the quoting process [1459] based off the information and then once [1462] the engineer is done with whatever the [1464] quote process is you know from a very [1466] high level [1468] we will [1470] um just send the [1474] proposal and we can send the proposal [1476] using pandadoc uh I'm going to pretend [1478] that I don't know how pandadoc works [1479] here because I'm obviously assuming [1481] knowledge with this type form stuff but [1482] let me just like go take a few steps [1484] back here pretend I have no idea how [1486] pandadoc works so I can actually like uh [1488] go through the [1489] API for [1492] you oh I hate that it's two lines there [1495] we go it's one line [1499] uh we're going to send the proposal with [1500] padok and then [1504] um let's say [1508] finished or maybe I don't even know uh [1511] we should do filter steps right now [1512] actually I'm not going to include any [1513] filter steps okay we're going to send [1514] the proposal with pandadoc and then [1516] presumably they could [1519] sign and we could have some time period [1522] upon which they sign so like you know [1524] maybe they sign Within [1529] um we'll just say [1530] sign we'll say send onboarding so it [1533] maybe an onboarding document is just [1535] like I don't know like like an email [1536] that welcomes them and stuff like that [1538] and then if they don't [1540] sign in we could do like seven days or [1544] something uh I'm going to convert the [1546] shape again back to a [1549] square then I'm going to make this [1552] flat we could do some s of some sort of [1555] follow up over email [1560] I'll just say email follow that looks [1564] better okay this is a [1567] basically wow I made that box way too [1572] big this is basically like iteration one [1574] of my process flow map the reason why I [1576] put all this stuff up the very top level [1578] is because presumably underneath here as [1580] I learn more about each of these apis [1581] and I think more deeply about this [1582] there'll be some catch uh caveats like [1585] if the ad to simro uh actually exists [1588] maybe we need to do something else right [1590] uh if uh I don't know the engineer can't [1592] do it or something like that then maybe [1593] we need to add something else I'm just [1594] I'm just leaving myself a little bit of [1596] data and this flow map is going to [1597] evolve over the course of the next uh [1599] few minutes here as I scope out the [1600] actual apis so I'm assuming here there [1602] are two steps whose apis we need to [1604] figure out that work the first is Simo [1608] which is a platform like you know before [1609] then I'd never heard of and turns out [1611] like 17 people use it and maybe like the [1613] one of their cats too I don't know and [1615] then uh you know Panda here who which [1618] I've used multiple times before but I'd [1619] like to like scope it out via API just [1621] to show you guys assuming you don't have [1622] anywhere near exper anywhere near as [1624] much experience as I do so new lead hits [1627] the inbox we're going to parse the [1628] fields this is good now we're going to [1629] add to Simo why don't we actually go [1630] over to Simo and just learn a little bit [1632] about it so Simo API there you can see [1634] it's actually been autoc [1636] completed um I think this is what I'm [1640] looking for [1641] here I may be [1645] mistaken let's actually just make sure [1647] that I'm on the right website first of [1652] all yeah okay this this looks like it [1654] okay so simos yeah some job management [1656] software so syor group.com all right so [1658] this is the page here what is the simpo [1660] API we can view create or edit resources [1663] any syro builds we use ooth 2 Okay blah [1666] blah blah blah I'm not really concerned [1667] about the authentication stuff here [1668] because I'm I'm not you know I'm going [1669] to assume that I can do the [1671] authentication um what I'm curious here [1675] about is the actual [1678] end points so they're people projects [1681] materials payments and invoicing setup [1682] reports and others so basically these [1685] are all the various end points of the [1686] API and I can see that now I think they [1688] changed it this looks quite different [1690] from what I remember looking at seems a [1692] lot newer but anyway there's contacts [1694] contractors customers employees site [1696] staff vendors and supplier then there [1697] projects jobs job cost centers recurring [1699] jobs recurring job cost centers leads [1700] quotes quotes contractor jobs what I'm [1703] thinking here is leads is probably going [1704] to be important contacts is probably [1706] going to be important maybe customers [1708] although at that point they haven't [1709] actually like change money hasn't [1711] changed hands [1713] um materials cataloges inventory [1716] prebuilds takeoff templates blah blah [1717] blah payments and invoicing invoices so [1719] we could actually maybe send an invoice [1720] automatically using simpro um we could [1723] do that keep in mind the customer also [1725] wants to use pipe drive for some stuff [1727] um and I haven't added that into the [1729] system yet just because I wanted to [1730] verify that this worked uh we can do a [1733] web hook subscription that's cool a lot [1734] of these platforms will have web hook [1736] subscriptions and that basically allows [1737] you to uh usually you have to like make [1740] um a web hook using an API call the cool [1743] part about this is anytime some event [1745] inside of the CRM happens you can [1747] automatically produce a web hook so what [1749] I'm seeing [1752] here is they have a bunch of events so [1757] anytime uh company customer is created [1760] you can get a web hook call company [1761] customer update you can get a web call [1763] that's really cool yeah yeah so there's [1765] a lot of functionality here actually [1767] fantastic [1768] so you know I'm I'm thinking like you [1770] could trigger things in make you could [1773] also trigger things in Simo depending on [1775] events in Simo so if you wanted to [1776] automate this uh further you know you [1778] could have another flow that starts when [1781] a customer gets con sorry a lead gets [1783] converted into a customer for instance [1784] or maybe when a charge is created you do [1786] something these are all ideas that I'm [1788] getting as I'm reading through this [1789] giant list of events here but I'm not [1791] going to look at this too much I don't [1792] want to get sidetracked so why don't I [1794] go back to what I was doing before I [1795] want to know how do I add like you know [1797] if I if I'm adding something into this [1799] simppro platform [1800] like you know how do I add this [1802] information most effectively presumably [1805] I'm going to want to add a contact [1809] right so [1811] parameters essentially what we can [1813] do is we can list all [1816] contacts we can create a new contact [1819] it's probably what I'm going to want to [1820] do we can retrieve details for a [1822] specific contact update a contact delete [1824] a contact so the two end points that are [1827] probably relevant to me create a new [1828] contact and then retrieve details for a [1830] specific contact if you think back to [1832] this step here um this will probably [1833] have to do with creating a new contact [1835] and then over here if um we send the [1838] form out when somebody fills out the [1839] form you know we can uh I don't know we [1842] might have a step where instead of [1843] sending it to the engineer directly we [1845] send it back to Simo using the contact [1846] ID something like that so that's pretty [1849] cool and you see there's a contact ID [1850] parameter right [1852] here so let me just take a look here and [1855] verify that we can actually create a new [1856] contact and then it's going to have all [1858] the information that we want so we can [1859] add a first name we can add a last name [1861] good we can add a cell phone great um' [1864] be nice if we had a phone but but we [1865] don't uh we can add an email we can add [1868] a department we can add position and we [1870] can also add a notes field notes are [1871] great because it essentially allow you [1873] to they allow you to add custom things [1875] and I'm also looking down here that [1876] there are there's a field here called [1878] custom Fields um and presumably we can [1880] create our own custom Fields if we [1882] needed to later which is quite nice so [1885] yeah that's that and then when you [1886] create a new contact this is what you [1888] get back you get a 2011 2011 or a 422 if [1891] like you um do a crappy API call and [1894] your 2011 includes the first name last [1896] name it basically just repeats all the [1897] information and then it also includes [1899] all the custom Fields here which is nice [1901] date modified which is nice um and then [1904] it looks like here this is what I was [1906] really curious about and this looks [1907] awesome it looks like they link a [1908] contact with [1909] customer so they link a contact to a [1913] customer so you can get um you know if [1915] you create a customer you could probably [1917] just feed in a contact ID to do that I [1919] don't know what site means it's probably [1921] something specific to like air [1923] conditioning maybe this is like the [1923] address of the place yeah we'll see but [1926] uh okay cool so we can create a [1928] contact let me look at customers here [1932] how exactly do we go about creating a [1933] company [1935] customer or maybe create a new [1936] individual [1938] customer so you need to feed in if you [1941] want to create an individual customer [1943] you need to feed in a company [1946] ID and interesting so presumably we [1949] don't want to do that I mean we're [1950] working B to C here so I don't think [1952] company is uh is really relevant to us [1954] okay great let's go to projects maybe we [1956] can do jobs or actually [1960] um keep track of all the details of work [1962] being carried out including schedule [1964] employees signing stock creating vendor [1965] orders okay so this seems like okay [1967] something is already become it's already [1970] transitioned to work so I don't really [1971] care about that what I want is lead yeah [1972] use leads to manage potential business [1974] opportunities once created you can [1975] convert a lead if it is successful or [1977] close a lead if it is unsuccessful so [1980] this is perfect I'm curious whether or [1982] not we can link this with a [1986] contact now it says we have to enter a [1988] company ID which is interesting a build [1990] with multi company setup may have [1992] company ID greater equal to zero other [1994] builds use Zero by default so maybe we [1996] just feed in zero and that would just be [1998] the default some apis are weird like [2000] this this looks like one of them so we' [2003] go companies zero and then leads all [2005] right what I want to do is create a new [2007] lead if I want to create new lead how am [2008] I doing [2014] it [2019] okay looks like I'm feeding in the ID of [2022] a [2023] customer the ID of a site [2027] interesting lead name [2032] okay customer contact ID of a contacts [2035] they're essentially allowing me to link [2036] this with all of my other customers and [2038] stuff very [2039] interesting uh follow-up date so you can [2042] set follow-up dates all right I don't [2045] really know how much of this we're going [2046] to use um to be honest but I think I [2048] know more than enough at this point so [2050] what I can do is uh when a new lead [2052] email hits an inbox I can parse the [2053] fields convert every one of those fields [2055] to Json and then I can add I'm going to [2058] do a couple things I'm going to add a uh [2060] contact to [2063] simpro then I'm going to add a lead oh I [2067] said contract [2068] I'm going to add a lead to [2071] Simo so what I'm going to do is I'm [2074] going to press C and then I'm going to [2075] drag this right to the [2077] center and then I know that this API [2079] step is going to work so now I'm just [2081] going to outline it I know that this API [2082] step is going to work so now I'm going [2083] to outline it and I'm going to say lead [2086] to [2090] Simo I have a crazy OCD about the number [2093] of lines so if this has two lines in it [2096] this needs to have two lines in it [2100] um and then I need to feed some data in [2101] here so I'm unsure excuse me I'm [2104] unsure to the extent that [2109] leads are going to be [2113] required uh sorry our company names are [2116] going to be [2121] required so it looks like these guys are [2123] actually doing air conditioning installs [2124] that's so [2126] interesting yeah [2137] okay so I'm going to have to create a [2140] new [2141] lead going to have to select the [2143] customer if the lead is from a new [2144] customer click create new and enter the [2146] customer's details the new customer is [2148] now created and you can continue [2149] creating a lead so it looks like I I [2151] don't just make a lead I have to make a [2152] customer I also have to select a site [2154] which is annoying then I have to enter a [2157] lead name [2160] interesting okay well that's all right [2162] looks like I'll just have to add all [2163] that information in so we're going to [2166] have new lead hits the email [2169] inbox and then what I'm going to do is [2172] uh this parse field [2174] step uh you know I didn't Define this [2176] here but I I should have we'll say Nick [2179] last name [2181] sarf um email [2185] address uh and then we'll also say home [2188] address so I don't know we'll say like [2192] 6040 [2195] um I'm just going to pretend that this [2197] is like a postal [2208] code okay and then with this information [2211] we're going to know the first name the [2212] last name the email of the customer [2214] we're going to have the address so [2216] presumably these are all the fields that [2217] we're going to from this new lead email [2218] maybe there's more I don't know like how [2219] many floors you have and that sort of [2221] thing but maybe we'll answer that here [2223] uh and then what we can do is using this [2225] information we can add a contact to [2227] Simo and then 're to add a new lead we [2229] need to add a customer first and then a [2232] site as well so I'm actually not going [2233] to do that I'm going to add a [2239] customer um let me think [2243] here we could do all these [2245] simultaneously but it would probably [2246] make sense to to add a customer [2249] first then add a Le uh site to [2253] Simo now this site is going to include [2256] this address [2257] information and then uh after we're done [2260] that we can now add a lead to [2263] simro so we're going to be representing [2266] this data basically in three ways the [2267] first is going to be a contact then the [2269] next is going to be a customer um a site [2272] and then a [2274] lead and what we theoretically would [2277] have to do is we'd have to say um you [2280] know if only if and only if the customer [2282] doesn't exist we add the next step and [2284] the next step and the next step but I'm [2286] going to simplify this pretty [2287] dramatically [2288] here um by not doing that because [2293] otherwise we'd have logic here and we'd [2295] have logic here then we'd have to I [2298] don't know like reference the old [2299] customer and that sort of thing and I [2301] yeah I don't I don't think up the top of [2302] my head that this is going to be a [2303] situation which really warrants all that [2306] complexity so yeah we have three steps [2308] here customer site lead and then we have [2311] contact and then um it seems like the [2315] contact can be added independently so [2317] this is going to be my main flow and [2318] then this is just going to be like the [2319] rest of the flow the customer the site [2321] and the [2322] lead and I'm just going to move this [2325] stuff down here so that I have the room [2327] that I'd need to if I were to uh draft [2329] up the rest of this so add contact to [2332] syro doesn't exist send a templated [2333] email with a form I'm going to do type [2335] form [2336] here once they fill out the form we're [2338] going to send to [2340] engineer and so what I think should [2342] probably happen is when they fill out [2343] the form we don't just um send to [2345] engineer we're going to do a couple [2347] things uh I want [2350] to [2353] update contact I don't know if I should [2355] be updating the contact or I should be [2357] updating the [2359] lead okay we have some statuses here so [2362] presumably we could use the status [2378] okay looks like you can create your own [2379] status code so what we could do is [2381] before ahead of time we could have [2383] different status codes for different um [2384] steps in the process we could say one [2387] step might be to be followed up another [2389] step might [2391] be [2394] um well if you think about it um we'll [2397] have a couple of steps here the first [2398] step is going to [2400] be new lead hits email inbox then we're [2403] going to add all of their information so [2405] sort of at that first step they're going [2407] to be interested but we won't have their [2409] information the Second Step would or [2412] second status that we could add would be [2416] um filled out additional information or [2420] something and then the third step could [2423] be receive proposal so what I'm going to [2425] do here is uh if [2428] they fill out the form and only if they [2432] fill out the form I'm not going to send [2433] it to the engineer just [2435] yet I'm going to delete the [2438] step I'm going to say fill out [2444] form and then I'm going to change this [2448] color or change this shape here back to [2451] my database one then I'm going to say [2453] update lead status in Simo [2458] and I'm going to say [2463] um form completed let's do that that's [2465] probably the simplest way to do [2471] it so now we have the lead status in [2473] Syra updated to form completed which is [2476] nice I'm going to extend this a little [2483] bit drag this way back over here [2486] presumably we're going to need to do a [2487] couple other things um I don't think [2489] we're going to need to update the [2490] contact because I don't think that there [2493] really is a contact field that is [2496] relevant let's [2499] see people uh we'll go [2503] to [2505] contacts and then I'm also going to [2506] check out [2508] customers we'll do contacts [2512] first um let's see here [2521] let's try creating a [2529] contact interesting you can create a [2531] single contact us as the customer and [2532] sight contact on a lead quote or [2535] job very nice so you connect the [2538] contacts to the uh to the [2545] jobs cool [2548] well I don't think we need to [2550] necessarily put all this information in [2551] contact we can if we want to but I think [2553] it probably make more sense to do [2554] everything out of um out of leads [2556] because I think that's just like a lot [2558] more logical so I'm just going to use [2560] leads as like the place where we track [2562] the status and all that stuff that makes [2564] more sense to me so we will still add a [2566] contact of course we want all that [2567] information interl between the customer [2569] and the site and the lead um but we're [2572] we're just going to like deal with the [2574] if we're using their crappy serum we're [2575] going to use the uh lead status in [2578] Simo um as the like pipeline determinant [2582] of where they are that that sounds good [2583] to me so yeah anyway the form will be [2585] completed and then what we're going to [2587] do is we're going to send to [2590] engineer so we'll send all the lead [2592] information to the engineer [2594] basically I'm going to go back over here [2596] and then make this a oh what did I do [2600] before I think I had a little circle or [2604] something then I made this an outline to [2606] repr repres that this is a human step [2609] you know build build out your own um sop [2611] for this of course if you don't like [2613] mine uh and then after we send the lead [2616] to the engineer assuming that that is [2618] good we can now do that next step which [2620] is send a proposal with [2622] pandadoc and uh what I'm going to do is [2625] after I send the proposal with padok [2627] actually going to delete these steps now [2628] that we know more about the Simo [2630] API paste this in over here and then the [2633] next step is going to be update lead [2636] status in syo 2 instead of form [2639] completed it's going to be proposal [2644] sent and we'll also you know attach some [2647] information [2649] here and [2651] then um what we'll do is we'll move the [2654] logic down here so this is where we'll [2656] say hey have you signed yet [2659] basically so we'll say signed great and [2662] then down [2663] here if they haven't signed and whim Al [2667] you have to like drag it here in order [2668] to make that work which is kind of [2670] annoying um let's move this just a tad [2674] over here connect that puppy uh and if [2677] they don't sign in s days then we will [2679] do an email followup and then if they do [2680] sign uh then we'll continue with some [2682] next step in the process which in our [2683] case is just going to be like send on [2686] boarding or [2687] something that looks good to me uh time [2689] to scope out this proposal with [2692] pandadoc obviously in order to do this [2694] you need to see what their proposals [2695] were like um I can't show you what their [2697] proposals were like because that would [2698] be sort of like a breach of uh client [2700] privacy here they have like a very [2703] proprietary sort of flow uh and they [2705] have like a very proprietary sort of [2706] sales material uh so that's okay all I [2709] want to do is I just want to make sure [2710] that I can send a document from a [2711] template and it looks like this one of [2713] the first ones create document from a [2714] template so let's pretend I have no idea [2716] how panad do works it's like a contract [2717] software uh I basically need to be able [2719] to create a template and then I need to [2720] be able to reference a template later [2721] right so um I'm looking here at the data [2724] that I'd feed here I'd feed in the name [2726] of the document I'm cre [2727] so presumably what I could do is I [2730] could get the address information from [2733] here and I could use this as the title [2736] of the document that I'm creating which [2737] would be nice and [2738] customized template uu ID so presumably [2741] I'd make a template elsewhere and then [2743] I'd feed this ID in and maybe it's just [2744] the same template every time which is [2746] doable um folder ID right I'm only [2748] looking at the ones that are required [2749] I'm not looking at these other ones here [2751] which aren't owner so you could set an [2753] owner I don't know if we' need to do [2754] that recipients uh we need first name [2756] last last name then email address right [2759] so I have all of those back here first [2762] name last name email and I even have [2764] like the physical address which is cool [2765] so presumably we could send [2768] that and then you can pass a list of [2771] fields or values to pre-fill Fields used [2773] in a template please note signature [2774] field can't be pre-filled so I could [2776] feed Json and with that Json I could [2779] have parameters like value is true value [2781] is same day delivery value is panda. [2783] green so let's say I created a template [2786] and that template had Fields like [2789] address number of rooms um I don't know [2792] let's say the engineer writes like a [2793] quote down but we'd have like price and [2795] then my pandadoc proposal could actually [2797] pull from those values to automatically [2799] populate the uh the proposal which would [2801] be pretty cool uh you could then feed in [2803] like a pricing tables variable so you [2804] could even add pricing tables if you [2806] wanted you could do a lot and then [2807] obviously you have to do your [2807] authentication stuff like that but [2809] anyway at a first glance I mean I [2810] already know that this works because [2812] I've I built this exact thing out but at [2814] the first glance this looks fine to me [2815] um and we'll be able to send proposal [2817] automatically with pandadoc whether or [2819] not like we want some human step [2820] involved or whatnot that's um you know [2822] that's something that we can figure out [2823] later uh on our end it would basically [2826] cost no additional work to send the [2828] proposal immediately versus just like [2829] queue up the proposal and have a human [2830] being look it [2831] over okay so where we at now we now have [2835] a flow set up where when a new lead [2837] email hits the inbox we're going to [2839] parse the fields convert to Json we're [2840] going to do this instead of make we're [2842] then going to make an HTTP request to [2844] add the contact to Simo using their API [2847] uh we add a customer to syo as well add [2849] a site to syo as well and add a lead to [2851] syro as well this lead sounds the most [2853] important I mean I broke this up into [2855] two levels but may just be like [2857] additional complexity that I don't need [2859] I may just be able to like add all of [2861] these um in one step [2864] honestly I may just be able to do [2874] this this uh isn't n the [2879] prettiest so maybe I do [2882] this um maybe I just do all four of [2884] these steps at the same time instead of [2886] just split them all up like that um you [2888] know the specifics don't really matter [2890] too much and it's just semantics whether [2892] or not I add one first the other after [2894] um you know assuming that I can do one I [2896] could probably do all send templated [2898] email to form fill form of delete status [2900] all right just thinking about this in my [2901] head send lead to engineer how would we [2903] send the lead to the engineer we [2905] probably need a way to [2908] okay there are a couple things we could [2909] do we could have an sop where the [2911] engineer checks the simpro leads with [2914] status equals form completed and they [2916] just do that every day and assuming that [2918] you know assuming the lead does have the [2920] form completed then we could you know [2921] proceed with the next step alternatively [2924] we could also just send an email to the [2926] engineer uh letting them know that hey [2928] you know a new lead has been filled out [2931] and this would be a little bit more [2932] time-sensitive but it may not be part of [2933] their [2934] workflow so [2936] I think the send lead to engineer step [2938] I'm just going to leave as blank uh I'm [2940] presuming that I had initial [2941] conversation with my client I know [2943] enough to scope out whether or not the [2945] system is feasible and I can work out [2946] the specifics later uh but that's [2948] something to [2950] consider send Proposal with padoc that [2952] looks good update lead stus s b is not [2954] signed or don't sign in seven days and [2957] then assuming that you [2962] know we could have like an email [2964] follow-up cycle [2968] and then we could have another arrow [2970] that goes from here back to [2972] here the idea being basically that [2977] if let's see if I could just move this [2979] over to the [2982] right the idea being that if they don't [2985] sign in a few days we're going to begin [2988] this cycle and the Cycle's just going to [2990] go back and forth and follow up with [2991] them [2992] constantly um and that this this is [2994] pretty straightforward to implement off [2995] the top of my head um we would just [2997] continuously ping them every 7 days if [2999] the status is proposal sent [3001] essentially and then oh in order for [3004] this to work actually we would need a [3005] field in Simo that tells us when lead [3007] was added or sorry when uh we changed [3011] the status of a [3013] lead let me think [3016] here let's go back to the Simo API or [3019] the developer Center I [3021] think where was it API documentation [3023] here we go okay let's go back to project [3026] and then [3029] leads let's see all the information that [3032] we get this is the lead created [3034] successfully so we have the follow-up [3037] date the date [3038] created so we'll know when the date when [3040] the lead was created which is [3043] great we'll have some notes uh and we'll [3045] have some custom Fields as well date [3046] modified so this is [3048] good so presumably we could [3051] update we could use the date mod this [3053] isn't perfect but we could use the date [3055] modified field to show us when the lead [3057] has been acted [3059] upon um so I mean you know date modified [3062] is June the 11th and Status equals [3064] proposal sent odds are we have not [3068] received a response from [3069] them um another step that we could do is [3072] this sign step I realize now that uh you [3074] can just watch signatures in pandadoc so [3076] we could have another step where when [3078] the signature of this document makes it [3082] we use the ID of the lead to go back [3085] into Simo and then update the lead or [3087] convert it into a deal so in order for [3089] that to happen in the panx step we'd [3091] have to like feed in the ID of [3094] the um we'd have to feed in the ID of [3097] the simol lead and we can do this using [3098] what looks like the metadata field you [3100] can pass arbitrary data in key value [3101] format to associate custom information [3103] with the document this information is [3104] returned in API request for the document [3106] details by ID example opportunity ID [3108] yeah perfect this is exactly what we [3109] wanted so what we can do is [3113] um we'll feed in the [3120] ID to [3122] pandadoc and then we'll [3126] watch The Proposal signature here and [3129] when the proposal is signed then we'll [3131] automatically trigger the send [3132] onboarding step if it's not signed every [3135] seven days we will just do an email [3136] Fallout cycle which we could set up in [3139] make.com all right that looks pretty [3141] good uh we just need one more route for [3142] let's what what happens if they don't [3144] fill out [3144] form what I would do is I would do the [3147] same thing that I've done here and it [3149] doesn't have to be seven days this lead [3151] is a little bit younger and more fresh [3153] and [3154] supple no it's it's a lot younger you [3158] know and uh they're a little further up [3159] on the buying ladder [3161] so um I don't know maybe if they if they [3164] don't fill in three days we do some [3166] email follow-up cycle and you could do [3168] the same thing here maybe it's not seven [3169] days it's three [3171] days that looks good to [3174] me uh what if the lead exists [3181] so if the lead exists [3184] then what are some instances in which [3186] the lead might exist uh [3189] maybe they click the ad twice if they [3192] click the ad twice I don't want anything [3193] to do with them [3195] right so I think what would happen is if [3197] the lead does exist we should notify the [3200] lead [3202] obviously and the way that we notify the [3204] lead is we just say something along the [3205] lines of hey [3207] you know we I've noticed that you're [3208] you're actually already in our system [3211] for whatever some other what whatever [3215] their previous request was and then [3219] if they want [3222] to do a new quote then we can pass that [3225] off to a salesperson because presumably [3227] like probably less than one in 50 leads [3229] are going to exist and uh if a lead [3231] exists then it's probably important [3234] still but it's probably not as as [3236] important as a new lead I would imagine [3239] and also there are probably other [3240] methods by which a person could get in [3242] touch with the company if they were a [3244] referral or a follow-up customer and I [3247] should not we should not allow that to [3248] poison the rest of our flow like [3251] uh um we need some logic to handle [3254] whether or not it [3255] exists um so I am going to [3259] say already exists and then we can go [3263] into [3264] shapes then we can send [3268] email to [3272] customer with previous job [3277] details and then we [3282] could [3286] notify inside of the email to the [3289] customer with previous job [3292] details we could say hey just letting [3295] you know that you have a [3299] yeah let's do that we could say hey just [3300] letting you know that [3303] um that we already see that you're in [3305] our system we'd love to help you if this [3308] is for a new order that's not 6430 pen [3312] Pena drive or whatever their old order [3314] information [3315] was then please fill out this form and [3319] it'll be another [3321] form um like another templated [3324] form so that that sounds good to me so [3326] basically whether or not it exists we're [3328] still going to go through this the [3329] templated email with form [3332] step the difference is just going to be [3334] that we're going to use a different [3335] template to do [3337] it and [3339] then [3344] afterwards we'll [3347] say let's say um extract previous job [3351] details from [3353] Simo this is another one of our weird [3356] API steps that we don't know whether or [3358] not is viable or we would not have known [3360] whether or not it's viable um I I know [3363] now obviously CU you can just get [3365] customer information get lead [3366] information right so then we're going to [3368] send templated [3372] email with form and then we can just [3377] copy and paste the rest of this [3380] basically um the only difference is it's [3383] going to be here don't fill in three [3387] days then I'm going to put this here [3390] then we're going to have another arrow [3392] that goes from here back to here which [3394] looks all right I don't like how this [3396] isn't connected to there we go that [3399] looks pretty good I also personally like [3401] the Symmetry here in my wonderful little [3404] flowchart almost [3407] symmetry we'll put this back [3410] here and here [3413] okay um and then send the templated [3415] email the form and and then if they fill [3417] out the [3421] form [3423] um we should update the lead status in [3426] Simo but we should also add all of the [3428] information from the previous job like [3430] uh all of the information from the [3432] previous job details just in the notes [3433] field or something we should basically [3435] notify the team that this is a person [3437] that has gone through the flow before I [3439] mean there obviously going to know right [3441] when they pull it up and they'll see [3443] what date that it was created and stuff [3444] like that so we're just going to need [3445] one more [3446] step we're going to [3452] say um if they fill out the [3457] form we're going [3461] to make an API call to Simo which is [3467] here and then we're going to um let me [3471] think here where's the API call for Simo [3473] we we need to retrieve details for the [3475] lead and then we need to get all of the [3477] data [3480] here okay so we can get all the data [3486] here um we need to get the site info [3489] after we need to get the site contact [3490] info and this is sort of a dirty hack [3493] well maybe it's not even dirty hack [3494] because the likelihood of this happening [3495] is so low but but we do need to handle [3497] it what we could do is we could just [3499] call for the lead and then their site [3502] and then any other information and then [3503] we could just like take that data and [3504] just dump it into the notes field [3509] or maybe the description field we could [3510] say this customer or this lead note this [3513] lead has a previous order or something [3514] like that and that would be more than [3516] sufficient [3518] um yeah that' be more than sufficient [3522] for these [3525] leads okay so that's what we'll do we'll [3528] say retrieve lead details [3532] and and uh add to note [3541] field so I'm just going to dump all that [3543] information in here just for posterity [3544] and then assuming that that's filled out [3546] then I'm going to update the lead status [3550] in simpo with the status form completed [3554] uh and then that'll kind of fill in the [3555] rest of our [3557] flow okay yeah that looks pretty cool uh [3559] I don't know what the onboarding is for [3560] this client so I'm just going to leave [3561] this as [3564] tentative and then everything else [3566] should be pretty reasonable yeah cool so [3570] I mean this took you know a fair amount [3571] of time this wasn't perfect and you can [3573] see that there were some stumbling [3574] blocks in there where we laid out the [3575] flow and then I was like a crap you know [3576] it's not actually the way that the flow [3578] should work simpo requires us to make a [3580] contact and a site and a lead and a job [3583] and the thing is every API is going to [3584] be very different when you're dealing [3585] with crms like this um you know as much [3589] as I would like it to be straightforward [3591] and there's like just leads maybe and [3593] and I don't know like closed contracts [3595] you you know uh there are just so many [3599] externalities here and like edge cases [3601] that a lot of them have taken to having [3603] five or six different layers of people [3605] so there's like a contact and there's [3606] like a company and then you can have [3608] multiple contacts per company you get [3609] have multiple companies per contact [3610] right they they just want to like allow [3612] you to deal with basically anything but [3613] obviously the complexity pretty [3614] intimidating initially uh but regardless [3617] you know I think if you focus on the the [3618] steps here what is the deliverable [3621] that's visible to the client going to be [3623] um let's write a flowchart map of logic [3625] that ident API steps as different shapes [3627] and then for every API step map the [3629] input to the output just know whether or [3631] not you have the fields that you need in [3632] order to make it happen um then then [3634] you're basically uh you're basically [3636] golden and you don't have to fill out [3639] this or make this flowchart the same way [3640] that I did you could add way more [3641] information here if you wanted to um I [3644] think one thing that I consistently try [3645] and show in my videos is that like good [3647] enough is good enough uh there are a lot [3649] of things that you're going to figure [3650] out while you're like actually building [3651] a flow um that may be a little bit [3653] different from what you're expecting [3654] through the API stuff so I just don't [3655] try and like too much e effort or [3657] emphasis or whatnot on this step it's [3659] also important if you want it to remain [3661] platform agnostic so if you want this to [3663] work for make.com app your no code tools [3665] uh and also programming or whatever if [3667] you start like really getting into like [3668] the down and dirty details of every [3670] single field or whatnot then um you can [3673] kind of just shoot you in the foot [3673] because now you're kind of restraining [3676] the the the flow um because you know one [3678] flow might look one way in make and it [3680] might look a little bit different in [3681] zaper and that sort of thing the last [3683] thing I'll mention is uh we're just [3684] doing this the hardest way possible by [3685] by looking at API calls but you can also [3687] just do this using like make modules if [3689] you're using make.com so you could add [3691] another step before this uh that says [3693] you know just like check to see if [3694] there's a make.com module for every step [3697] uh what I'm finding is for platforms [3698] that you're unfamiliar with they usually [3699] aren't which is kind of annoying I know [3700] for Simo for a fact that it's just a [3702] very new plat or not a new platform it's [3703] just a very like old school platform and [3705] so they don't they don't have a lot of [3706] that stuff um so by knowing whether or [3710] not it works via API I usually know [3712] whether or not it's going to work via [3713] the modules too and that's usually [3714] enough but obviously you know you can [3715] you can mix and match and stretch and [3718] pull this workflow however you like in [3719] order to get a good scoping system down [3722] what I would do in this case is if I was [3725] building this out internally this is [3726] what I'd share with my team and then if [3728] I was um building this out for a client [3731] um you know and and I wasn't sure [3732] whether or not this project was feasible [3734] I would tell them during the sales [3735] process like hey I want to do a detailed [3736] scope for you to figure out whether or [3738] not this works um what I'm going to do [3740] is I'm going to send you that detailed [3741] scope afterwards you can take a look at [3742] it and if there's any clarification that [3744] you need or whatnot we can cover it on [3745] another call this is technically a [3747] two-step scoping procedure which is kind [3749] of a pain in the ass uh sorry two-step [3751] close which is a pain in the ass and [3753] sort of like lower uh likelihood of [3755] closing at least if you're trying to [3756] sell automations professionally in my [3758] experience but uh you know for more [3760] complex projects whose apis you don't [3762] really know uh you know it's pretty [3764] important and it also just make sure [3765] that the client can kind of see the [3767] various steps and the logic that you're [3768] going to be building out for them [3770] essentially going to be your scope of [3771] work right and then you can also ask [3772] them questions like hey you know for the [3773] SLE engineer step um I could just update [3776] a status in Simo saying that the form is [3778] completed what we can do then is we can [3781] just have an sop where the engineer [3782] checks it every day and just checks the [3784] Quee of form completed statuses uh would [3786] you prefer that or do you want me just [3787] to send them a quick little email so [3790] those are those are important um [3792] yeah last thing I'll do before I finish [3795] here is I'm just going to change the [3797] steps that the customer is going to end [3799] up seeing and I'm just going to change [3801] them [3803] to colored steps because I think it's [3805] important to represent what steps people [3807] see and which people don't and yeah [3810] that's uh that's about that I hope you [3811] guys enjoyed this video on scoping I had [3813] a lot of fun putting it together [3814] hopefully it wasn't too mind numbing and [3815] boring uh but you know this is just a [3817] pretty standard process if you're [3819] getting started with automation um the [3821] last thing I'll mention here is one of [3822] the main reasons why I like using so few [3825] software platforms and now I use like [3826] the exact same platforms for basically [3828] anything even if they're not exactly the [3830] best platforms to use to do the job is [3833] because when you know a platform inside [3834] it out you can at the scoping process [3837] basically completely cuz off the top of [3838] my head I know exactly what padog can do [3840] and what it can't do I know exactly what [3842] type form can do and what it can't do [3843] right so I don't actually have to go [3844] through the API stuff which to be fair [3846] is the most laborious of of it all I bet [3848] you if you counted the minutes over the [3849] last 45 minutes or whatnot or maybe an [3851] hour of scoping um probably like 70% of [3854] them would just be mind-numbingly [3855] reading through API docs so that's that [3858] if you guys have any questions about a [3859] specific scope or how to how to get it [3861] done uh just feel free to leave a [3863] comment down below otherwise like [3864] subscribe do all that fun YouTube stuff [3866] and I'll catch

Title: How to Send & Track Invoices Automatically With Stripe In Make.com
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here in [1] this video I'm going to run you through [2] basically the stripe API from top to [4] bottom or at least everything you need [5] to know about the stripe API in order to [7] send invoices watch payments and then [10] use that to update either a CRM a [12] spreadsheet some Financial dashboard or [14] anything else you could possibly want [16] this is a really common use case um I [17] use it a lot in my own business and [19] basically every client that I work with [20] that uses stripe also eventually ends up [22] asking me for some sort of system like [24] this so hopefully this helps you this is [27] something you've always wanted to [28] improve on your ability to process and [29] watch payments then this is a video for [31] you stay tuned and let's get into [35] it all right first up the stripe API can [38] be pretty difficult to understand [39] especially if you're a newcomer to it or [41] you've never sent or received an invoice [42] using the API before uh and this is both [45] a good thing and a bad thing I mean it's [46] a good thing because the reason why it's [48] so intense is because it's um like [51] extremely comprehensive and so it covers [54] every possible use case you could ever [55] want if you want to send or receive [57] money on the internet and you want to do [58] so with stripe um you know you're going [60] to be able to do like any conceivable [62] use case that's why all the SAS [64] companies use stripe that's why all the [65] e-commerce companies use stripe that's [67] why the vast majority of like agencies [68] like myself use stripe um it's just the [70] gold standard and uh the potential of [72] what you can do with it is is unreal but [74] because of that they've had to make some [76] weird changes I want to say to some of [78] the concepts in their API to to make [80] this accommodating and um like I'll [83] abstract all the way all the complexity [84] because I don't really think it matters [85] that much but the the points that do [87] matter for us are there are two objects [90] in the [92] API um that usually trip people [96] up the first is the payment intent [99] object versus the invoice [101] object and so you know I'm not going to [104] talk about this academically because we [106] don't really care about the academics [107] here we care about making money with it [108] but um most people confuse these two and [112] to to make it really simple an invoice [116] is basically just a statement that [118] somebody gets it has nothing to do with [121] the the payment it just it's a statement [123] that includes a link to a little payment [126] form where somebody can fill out their [127] payment info so that's what an invoice [129] is a payment intent on the other hand is [133] like a concept that's very unique to [135] stripe that represents a transaction [138] that goes through like physically [140] somebody intends to pay you as then they [142] put their credit card in the form they [143] press the enter button or whatever that [145] is a payment intent and so um invoices [149] can generate payment intents if they're [151] sent to the right customer and the [152] customer wants to pay they they put in [154] your info uh but a payment intent is not [156] the same thing as an invoice and this is [158] where a lot of people um sort of make [160] missteps like I have a little scenario [162] up in here if I just go over to stripe [164] and then I do watch [165] events and I don't know which one's [168] which I'm just going to go add and I'll [169] say um payment intent [173] example if you like use the watch events [175] module basically what you're doing is [176] every time something in your stripe [178] account happens you're going to receive [179] a notification it's like a web hook [180] driven flow um and you know if you want [183] to receive a transaction every time a [185] payment comes in which is very common [187] this is probably like the number one [188] most common reason why you want to use [189] this thing um the group that you have to [192] use is payment intent and what you're [194] looking for specifically is payment [195] intent succeeded and and all this means [197] is that like the payment intent somebody [199] put their credit card info they click [200] enter that process actually succeeded [203] and money was made into your money was [205] put into your bank account um contrast [207] that with like invoices [209] you know an invoice being created [211] deleted finalized marked on collectible [213] even an invoice paid these are these are [215] very different things than just like a [216] transaction occurring in your stripe [217] account because an invoice is a specific [220] um like type of payment you can create a [223] payment without creating an invoice an [225] invoice is just one type of payment it [226] refers to the statement that's sent out [229] so for instance if you only wanted to [230] track invoices that were paid and maybe [232] not like recurring monthly subscriptions [233] that don't have invoices you would use [235] this endpoint but if you just wanted to [236] track every payment that's ever happened [238] ever then you would use the payment [239] intent [241] um uh you know endpoint and then you do [243] payment intent [244] succeeded so I'm just you know going to [247] make a little Whimsical here I think I [250] probably I think it's probably pretty [252] simple at this point [254] but you know if a payment intent is over [258] here basically like when you send an [260] invoice an [262] invoice will generate a payment [267] intent so you know if you think about it [270] as you as a user up here I don't know [271] what happened to my [273] beautiful thing oh I must have done an [276] outline so the user can generate an [282] invoice and then the invoice is what [284] generates the payment intent but at the [288] same time the user can also just [289] generate a payment intent immediately [291] sort of aside from an [295] invoice and this flow is perfectly fine [297] too the issue is in order to generate [300] the payment intent you need their card [301] information because obviously you can't [304] create the intent for them to pay if you [306] don't have their card info um and that's [308] usually most of the time why the invoice [309] is handy because Stripes invoice [311] functionality will automatically ask the [313] customer to put in their payment [315] information if you don't have it already [317] uh which is quite useful for us so what [319] I'm going to do in this video is you [320] know now that we understand this concept [322] generally uh and you don't need to know [323] more than this trust me but now that we [326] understand this concept generally I'm [327] just going to use this in a real flow [328] well an example flow that may be real uh [332] that you can make real very easily where [333] I have a CRM setup from a previous build [335] I did called slack CRM and I'm just [337] going to be tracking you know prospects [339] coming through my Pipeline and then [340] after the prospects make it to a stage [342] called send invoice this is going to [344] trigger a flow that goes into stripe and [346] then creates an invoice for the amount [348] over here and maybe I'll also change [351] this field so that it says like service [354] name maybe it'll be like my package name [357] or something I don't [358] know uh um yeah let's do package [361] name uh and basically you know maybe [364] while you're selling your product or [365] service or whatever you are um marking [368] down what package they want from you and [370] so this is going to be like uh I don't [373] know maybe they want like cold email [375] system or [377] something right for this for this amount [379] over here and it'll just pull all the [381] information directly from the [383] clickup and that's what we what we use [385] as the trigger to send the [387] invoice you can use any platform you [389] want you don't have to use clickup I'm [390] just using clickup because I had it open [391] literally just in front of me and I was [392] like a crap I got to record this video [394] let me just use clickup um so don't feel [396] compelled to use click up you could use [398] a Google sheet if you wanted you could [400] just trigger this whole thing manually [401] you know you got a lot of [403] options okay so what I'm going to do [404] here is I'm going to start with the [406] clickup flow just to show you how I can [409] get an event and actually um let's use [412] web hooks for this this will be much [414] better so um clickup allows you to send [417] a web hook or send data to a web [421] hook and I'll say um status equals send [428] invoice so I'm going to copy this web [430] hook address to my clipboard I'll go [432] back here and what I want is I want this [434] automations function and I want to add [436] an [436] automation they've just added this [438] automate with AI feature which is pretty [439] neat I find it doesn't work with custom [441] Fields unfortunately but um I don't know [444] when oh jeez I forget what this is [446] called when stage is equal to [450] when stage equals send invoice send web [458] hook so yeah no it didn't work [461] unfortunately classic AI t t why would [464] anybody ever use AI so silly um what we [467] need to do is go to custom Fields [468] because this is a custom field and then [470] I'll go stage and then stage is from any [472] and then two I just want to send invoice [474] and then what I want to do here is I [475] want to send a web hook or call a web [478] hook I'm pasting in the URL over [481] here okay great I have this set up now [483] so I'm going to go back over here I'm [485] going to run this this is now just [486] waiting oops sorry I didn't put the [488] trigger on the right one make sure you [490] move this little trigger I'm going to [492] run this it's now waiting for that call [494] I'm just going to pretend that this uh [496] record just came in and I'm going to [497] move it back to send [498] invoice we just changed it to send [500] invoice so it's passing through the [502] clickup automation automation says hey [505] if it send invoice um fire it off to [507] this web hook and then it sends it we [509] have a payload here with all the [510] information that we need and then what [512] we want specifically is um in this [514] custom Fields array we have uh one of [517] these here is what we want we got a lot [520] of first names I remember when I made [522] this video I made way too many first [523] name [525] fields um we have a mount that's what [527] we're going to want but you know I'm [528] looking at this I don't really like how [530] this is spread into 12 different custom [532] Fields I'm just going to say get a [534] task um with custom Fields yeah I'll [537] just say get a task [540] what I'm going to do here is I got the [541] web Hook from click up and inside [543] there's a payload with an ID and a very [545] simple way to like not have to deal with [548] all that custom field is just [549] to um actually let me test this I'm [552] going to grab I'm going to copy the ID [554] from the payload and then I'm just going [556] to run this one specific module here um [560] and we get the same task but if you [562] scroll down to uh custom Fields uh right [566] over here it actually just has the the [567] name of the field so don't have to deal [569] with like you know iterating through an [571] array or whatever and so you see we got [572] the data we need which is a package name [574] and then amount we can use this to like [575] generate an invoice pretty pretty easily [578] but remember this is a test I'm just [579] grabbing the data hardcoded here and [581] eventually we're going to have to go [582] back into the web hook and then pull in [584] this ID [585] field okay so I'm going to move this [587] trigger here so I can just start [589] everything there and then what we're [590] going to do now is we're just going to [591] go to stripe and we're actually going to [593] get through we're going to get going [594] with this um now as I mentioned [597] previously you know the first thing that [598] will pop up when you create is create a [600] payment intent so you do not want to [601] create a payment intent payment intent [603] is a transaction and in order for the [605] transaction to occur you know if I if I [607] drag this over here it'll actually ask [609] me for my customer ID it'll it'll ask me [612] for um you know the person that I'm [615] sending the payment intent to but we [617] don't actually have a customer ID [619] yet uh we need to create a customer ID [622] anyway in stripe um if I do create an [625] invoice down here um It'll ask for the [628] customer ID as well as well uh and so I [631] mean to be fair yeah I guess either way [633] you're going to need a customer ID uh [634] but what we're going to do is we're [635] actually going to create a customer [636] using the data inside of the um clickup [639] task but a customer doesn't necessarily [641] mean that they've paid you yet the [642] customer like having a customer just [644] means that somebody's information is in [645] the system uh and that's that's what [647] we're going to use to build out this [649] customer ID thing you'll also see if we [651] click on this create an invoice um field [653] here there's a collection method that [655] says send invoice or charge [656] automatically and if we don't have the [658] person's payment information yet we're [659] going to have to um send the invoice so [662] that they physically receive the [663] statement and they can click through [665] onto the payment form and I'll show you [666] what all this looks like in a second but [668] when they click through on the payment [669] form It'll ask them for the credit card [670] information and it'll do so in like a [672] safe secure uh and pretty like pretty [674] straightforward way there are a few [676] additional fields that we can add here [677] which I'm just going to point out before [678] I move on um like the metadata field has [681] keys and values this is really useful [683] because you can pass this into an [685] invoice and then you can later on let's [688] say in like 2 months when somebody pays [689] the invoice if for whatever reason the [690] customers are paying with net 60 terms [693] you can then watch the completion of the [695] invoice and then you can get this [696] metadata back so for instance you could [699] say like click up or you know CU ID I [703] think this is customer facing so you [704] have to kind of like be a little sneaky [706] about it and then you could feed in the [707] task ID here and then when the payment [709] goes through on the back end you know [712] however long from now when you watch [713] that task you could or when you watch [715] the invoice you could grab the task ID [718] you could check the clickup ID and then [720] you could use it in your flow later to [722] maybe update the clickup task with like [723] the amount that they paid or something [726] so you can do a lot here you could I [728] don't know do like upsell items you [729] could do a lot uh you could add your own [731] custom Fields you could add a footer you [732] could add a statement descriptor I'm not [734] going to worry about the advance [735] settings but I just wanted to run this [736] through you guys in case you were [739] unfamiliar okay so let's create an [741] invoice what we actually need cuz I'm [743] being silly is we need to create a [746] customer so we're going to drag the [748] create a customer module [750] here you're going to have to do your [751] stripe connection I've already done this [753] um and then as you see what's really [755] interesting about the Crea a customer is [756] like technically it's not saying that [757] anything's required you know in make.com [760] any time a field is required it'll bold [762] but uh in this case they're all just [764] like plain text description email name [766] phone but you do need to have an email [769] address I believe if you don't have an [771] email address you're going to have a bad [772] time so what I want to do is I want to [775] pull this data from my um custom Fields [778] array here and I'm just going to add the [780] email in I'm not going to add a [784] description the name uh I should have a [787] name field [788] here crap I don't have a name field in [791] the [792] clickup I have so many first names [796] but I didn't actually write one down oh [799] wait a second I can just grab the name [800] of the record what am I doing we'll just [803] use task name okay so now that we've [805] created a customer what we have to do is [807] sort of counterintuitive [809] um and this is a part of the stripe at [812] least in make.com the process that trips [814] a lot of people up now that we've [816] created a customer you might think that [817] we can just go to create invoice [819] immediately and this is what I [821] personally thought um when I was [822] starting with the the stripe invoice [824] sorry the stripe API as well you can't [827] actually create an invoice right away [829] what you have to do instead is you have [830] to create an invoice item and then you [832] have to sign that invoice item to the [834] customer and then later when you create [836] the invoice it'll just add up all of the [837] invoice items so again this may seem a [840] little bit weird but the real reason why [842] it's [843] happening uh is just to give people that [846] are using the strap API developers [848] substantially more freedom even if they [851] don't necessarily you know if the flow [852] isn't as simple um to understand or [855] conceptualize um that all that [857] complexity is hidden from the End [858] customer and you end up just being able [859] to do a lot more with it so um for [862] currency I'm just going to type USD for [863] amount I'm going to type 100 stripe will [865] multiply or rather it'll divide any [867] amount by 100 because they charge in [869] cents they don't charge in dollarss so [871] this is the integer amount in cents what [873] I'm going to do is I'm going to create a [874] a draft invoice for myself just for $1 [877] um just to show you guys what the [878] payment procedure or payment process [880] looks [881] like uh the description that I'm going [883] to put in here is going to be the [885] package name because that's what's going [886] to show up on that line [888] item then if I scroll down here um [891] there's nothing else that I want you can [893] do tack stuff too I've never really [894] worried about attaching all this stuff I [897] just get up and going um and then I I [899] worry about it afterwards so we've not [902] created the invoice item now what we [903] have to do is we have to create an [905] invoice so I'm going go over here create [907] an [908] invoice I'll attach that to the end of [911] the create an invoice module and then we [913] will select the customer ID that we had [916] from our previous module [918] here the collection method we're going [920] to have to use is send invoice the [922] reason why we're going to have to do [923] that is because we don't actually have [925] the customer payment information yet we [927] only have um their email address and so [929] what we're going to need to do is we're [930] going to have to send over a request [933] that has a little payment form with [934] credit card information and a bunch of [936] other things that we asking I alluded to [939] the address earlier um the next thing is [941] we're going to have to put the number of [942] days until due or we'll have to put the [944] due date this is sort of interesting but [946] a lot of people like screw screw up with [948] this because they um well I don't say I [952] don't mean screw up but a lot of [954] agencies that are just starting out they [955] think that you need to provide like net [957] 30 payment terms so they think that you [959] know in order for this to seem legit you [960] need to make the due date like a month [962] out or two months out or whatever this [964] is really silly you shouldn't do that if [966] anything you should explicitly stick to [968] like very short days until due and I'll [971] usually just do two or three days the [973] idea is you know when the customer gets [975] an invoice um it's because I want them [976] to pay it now I don't want them to look [978] at it and be like ah I'm going to pay [979] that in 30 days I don't want them to [981] forget about it and then I have to like [982] follow up with them religiously I'd [984] rather just make it so that the invoice [985] is just the really like this is the next [987] step in whatever trans action that we're [989] doing in my CRM you know um it's only [992] after they pay the invoice that'll move [993] them to close and actually begin the [994] process nothing gets going until you [997] know that invoice is is handled so [1000] that's personally what I do and I'd [1001] recommend you guys do not use Net 30 [1003] Terms or whatever in your [1004] agency um description you don't have to [1006] fill out the description no subscription [1009] ID no pending invoice items [1013] behavior um hold on a second [1018] yeah okay so I think we have to do [1020] include we'll give this a try [1022] together but anyway this will create the [1024] invoice so why don't we run through [1027] this we created the customer we then [1030] created the invoice item we then created [1032] the invoice so that's nice and then [1034] let's see if we got it in my mailbox [1039] here okay so I still didn't get it I [1042] think I might need to finalize it yeah [1045] okay so I have to finalize the draft [1046] invoice my bad [1049] um for the purpos of the demonstration [1050] I'm just going to grab the invoice ID [1052] that I just generated and I'm just going [1054] to tack this on to the end and I'm just [1056] going to run just [1059] this so finalize a draft [1064] invoice um we have the invoice PDF [1067] now so for instance we can actually like [1069] jump into the payment PDF sorry we can [1072] jump we get the the PDF here and this is [1075] what it looks like essentially the PDF [1077] that gets emailed you get the [1078] description of the item you get the unit [1080] price the quantity the amount and then [1082] you have a button where you can pay [1083] online which is pretty [1085] neat um we've received the invoice on [1088] the other end now um this is what it [1090] looks like new invoice from 1 second [1092] copy note this will take a couple of [1094] minutes um they need to obviously [1097] process the invoice on Stripes end they [1100] need to make sure that I guess things [1101] are legit but this is what it looks like [1103] when you get it in your inbox and if you [1105] go down to pay this invoice by open this [1106] in a new tab this is the experience that [1109] a customer has if they've never had to [1111] um you know pay your invoice before or [1113] if you don't have their credit card [1115] information I should say so as you see [1117] it says you know payment due June 9th [1119] 2024 due in two days to me you know 1 [1122] second copy invoice blah blah blah I [1125] always attach a memo is just a default [1127] that says thanks for your [1128] business um and then yeah we can we can [1131] go through and then we can fill the rest [1132] of this information but before I do [1135] that sorry this is the wrong workspace [1138] let's go back here [1139] before I do that I'm just going to go in [1142] and fix all of this so this is no longer [1145] using um test info it's using like real [1148] info just that when I save the blueprint [1151] for you guys it's um it's the right one [1153] the amount previously I just put $1 in [1156] and I'm actually going to pay the [1157] $1 I'll pay 30 cents of processing fees [1160] to show you guys what this looks like um [1162] we need to multiply this out as I [1165] mentioned earlier um by 100 because this [1167] is currently charging in sense [1169] so the $2,500 amount here would have [1171] actually only been like 25 uh so we need [1173] to bring that back up to $2,500 by [1175] multiplying it by 100 uh everything else [1178] here looks good so just doing some final [1180] checks create an invoice here that looks [1183] good that looks good awesome and then [1184] finalize a draft invoice right I just um [1187] copied in the [1188] ID so what I'll do is I'll just use this [1191] invoice ID field [1192] here so I'm going to save this let me [1195] call [1196] this click up status equals send invoice [1199] and then I'll say send stripe [1202] invoice that looks good to me let me [1204] just copy this really quickly and Export [1206] the blueprint save myself a bunch of [1209] time [1210] later and then what I want to do now is [1212] I want to show you guys how to watch [1214] payments and see when a payment goes [1216] through and then maybe do something with [1217] it so what I want to do is create [1220] another scenario [1221] here I'll say watch payment [1225] intent and I'll say update click up [1229] so what I'm going to do is I'll go to [1230] stripe again this time I'm using the [1232] watch payment events module I'm just [1235] going to add a new one here and I'll say [1237] test [1238] build watch payment event I really need [1242] to come up with a naming convention for [1243] this because I have so many things to [1244] say test build right now and then what [1247] we want is payment intent we're going to [1248] scroll down to payment intent succeeded [1251] save and then I'm going to click okay [1254] and what I'll do here is I'm going to go [1256] back into [1259] this is annoying because I didn't um put [1261] the the invoice metadata with the ID but [1264] I guess what I'll do is I'll go to click [1265] up I'm just going to grab the [1268] ID sorry I'm going to list tasks in a [1272] specific list and I'm going to filter [1275] them based off of the uh email address [1278] of the person on the record this will [1280] work just as well as what we're doing [1282] before but basically when a payment [1284] comes in I'm going to watch for that [1286] payment I'm going to grab the payment [1287] I'm going to get the customer ID that [1289] the payment was made with I'm then going [1291] to find the customer [1293] email it may just be under this customer [1295] field I don't entirely know but then [1298] once I have that I'm going to use that [1300] to search through clickup find the [1301] specific guy that just paid by his email [1304] address so in this case it'll say Nick [1306] or Nick left [1307] click. and then I'm just going to use it [1309] to update to Clos and that's what my [1311] workflow is is going to be like you know [1314] in this way you sort of have like a [1315] dynamic system but anyway what I have to [1317] do is I'm going to go to select the list [1320] what I want is in the 1 second copy [1323] workspace then I want the test build [1327] space then the folder is going to be [1329] folder lless [1331] list and then what I want is slack CRM [1334] this is my little tester [1335] ground I'm not going to worry about [1337] assigning ideas I'm not going to worry [1338] about any of the stuff [1342] um uh yeah and I guess I could go [1346] email is equal to [1349] custom field value I just don't know [1352] where the email is here there's so many [1353] fields I don't remember if it's in [1355] customer or if it's something [1357] else yeah I might uh I might just try [1361] customer for now we'll see if it doesn't [1363] work then I'm just going to hard code [1364] the data in and then I'll just update it [1366] afterwards so you guys all have the [1367] right web hook um number of tasks to [1370] return I only want one ideally I only [1372] want one with the custom field value set [1373] to the email so we'll give it a try [1376] anyway now I'm going to run this by [1378] running this I'm watching for payment [1380] intents on the account now I'm going to [1381] go back here to this link that I just [1384] opened and I'm going to pay using their [1386] link thing okay so I'm now paying and [1389] then what I'm going to do is go back to [1391] this web hook and you see awesome so we [1393] got the the [1395] information um but I was wrong that the [1397] customer field had the email yeah so it [1400] only has the ID so what we'll have to do [1402] then is I'll drag this over here and get [1405] the search customers filtered by [1408] criteria we actually don't need even [1410] need the search customers we need the [1412] get or let me see retrieve a customer [1415] there we go that's what we need and then [1418] I'm going to feed in the customer ID [1419] that we got from the watch [1421] events for my one whole dollar and I'll [1425] put that right there I'm just going to [1427] select all it'll just give me all the [1428] data oops I clicked [1432] cancel sorry I'm stopping the video here [1436] had enough of all of you okay so put the [1438] C customer here go [1440] okay and then once we retrieve the [1442] customer we're going to have access to [1443] their email address so then we can [1444] search by the presence of this email [1448] field that will return Nick left [1451] click. and then what we have to do is we [1453] have to go to click up and we have to [1454] update a task or edit a task with custom [1457] fields that one right [1459] here what we're going to do is we're [1461] going to grab the ID of the task that we [1463] just got from list all tasks and I have [1466] to go through this rigma roll again you [1468] know select the right space and that [1469] sort of deal so bear with [1474] me and then once we found the um [1477] specific task we're going to map this [1480] what we want is the task ID [1482] parameter we're not going to change a [1484] task name we're not going to change the [1485] content we're not going to change any of [1486] this stuff we're not even going to [1487] change the stage or uh status because [1490] that's not the field the field that I [1491] want is stage because I made a custom [1493] FAL for this it'll move this to [1495] closed there's also an amount paid um [1499] um column here that I added quite a [1501] while ago which we may be able to use at [1502] some point in part of the flow if you [1504] want and then yeah that looks good um [1507] I'm just going to test out the list all [1508] tasks here make sure that this works for [1511] my specific record [1514] nick. looks like it got the specific [1516] record um that I wanted I'm just not [1518] going to run it through from the [1519] beginning again because I don't want to [1520] create another payment but rest assured [1523] this is uh this works and then I'm going [1525] to pretend as if I got the payment I'm [1527] just passing the data through module so [1528] I have the task ID now I'm just going to [1530] edit the task with custom Fields I'll go [1533] back to my saxum and you see that it [1534] just automatically updated it to closed [1537] so in this way basically what we did is [1539] we started with um just a record that [1542] had you know maybe like an intake stage [1543] or like an empty stage and then when it [1546] was moved to send invoice we [1547] automatically sent an invoice to the [1549] person whose email is over here for the [1551] amount that is assist sit over here for [1552] a line item that is called whatever the [1554] package name is then uh however long it [1557] took them to pay doesn't matter when [1559] they did pay we ended up automatically [1561] catching that payment getting the [1562] customer ID then searching through our [1565] list here for somebody with the same [1566] email finding that email updating them [1568] to closed and then now that they're [1569] closed you can imagine how in any [1571] project management flow you could do a [1572] ton of stuff with this you could start [1574] the onboarding send them a quick [1575] onboarding email welcoming them and [1577] thanking them for the payment um sending [1579] them a calendar link to book an on a [1581] kickoff call there there's a lot [1582] obviously you can do behind the scenes [1584] you should also in my humble opinion be [1585] doing some sort of bookkeeping so every [1587] time a payment comes through you should [1588] be logging that to a Google sheet or [1589] something like that the value there is [1591] that you can later create a dashboard [1592] with this information and you know uh [1594] flesh out your your business finance [1597] tracking as well so I hope you guys [1599] enjoyed that video had a lot of fun [1600] putting it together the stripe uh [1602] payment intent versus invoice API can be [1604] kind of difficult if you're first [1605] getting started but I think that I [1607] simplified things as easily as humanly [1609] possible with that cute little Whimsical [1611] uh if you guys have any questions about [1612] this leave a comment down below [1613] otherwise like subscribe do that fun [1615] YouTube stuff I'll catch you on the next [1616] video thanks so much

Title: Watch Me Build A LinkedIn/Facebook/Twitter/Instagram System In 30 Min
[0] what's going on everybody I've had a [1] blast building social media automations [3] for you guys over the last few days and [4] I thought I'd cap this whole series off [6] with a video that effectively allows you [8] to cross poost content to Facebook [11] Instagram Twitter LinkedIn and then even [13] create a medium newsletter all without [15] even the click of a button so it's a [17] social media content curation or [19] syndication automation it's super easy [22] to set up I did it in maybe 20 or 30 [24] minutes and what I'm going to do in this [25] video is just run you through how to do [27] it completely from start to finish [29] either for you your own companies or [30] maybe for client companies that you're [32] working with this could be a system that [33] you could sell so if that sounds like [34] something you guys want to improve or [36] figure out how to do this is a video for [37] you stay [41] tuned first things first this video idea [43] was requested by the lovely at high [45] greef 551 he asked for LinkedIn Twitter [49] and a Weekly Newsletter can you please [50] make a video regarding that I thought I [52] would uh one up his request and I I also [54] do Facebook and then Instagram in [57] addition to that plus medium for the we [60] newsletter delivery you can obviously [61] use whatever platforms you want they're [62] all pretty straightforward at this point [64] what we're going to be doing is we're [65] going to be pulling instead of a Google [67] sheet this time I thought I'd switch [68] things up uh and we're going to be [69] pulling from an air table and what I've [71] done here is I've created an example [73] content calendar which has three rows at [75] present and inside of those three rows [78] are four columns the first column on the [80] left hand side here is date this is the [81] date that the post is supposed to go out [83] across all platforms then there is post [85] copy this is basically like I don't know [88] two or three paragraph piece of copy [90] about whatever topic that we're talking [92] about I guess in our case we're doing [93] recycling um and then we're going to [95] make that content bigger or smaller [97] depending on the social media platform [98] we're going to use AI for that and then [100] there's an image URL here uh this looks [103] to be something pretty relevant to [104] recycling I'd imagine so uh we have that [107] you know this photo here is just a bunch [109] of cardboard and what's this photo this [111] is uh looks like a bunch of people uh [113] cleaning up the ocean that's pretty cool [115] and then on the right hand side here we [116] have an air table multi select field [118] where we can just put in the platform [119] that we want so Facebook and Instagram [121] for this post this post is only [123] Instagram this one's Twitter and X why [125] don't I add in a LinkedIn here yeah [128] that's one thing that I haven't done [130] because I'm going to do LinkedIn as well [131] so we're just going to pump in [133] LinkedIn and the idea here is basically [136] this is just one example of how a [139] company could set up a Content calendar [140] in reality it's usually a lot more [141] complex than this there's like a million [143] extra Fields but this is what I'm [145] choosing here just as a demonstration um [148] and the the the Crux of the system is [151] the fact that you can just choose with [153] one button click which PL which [154] platforms you're going to be sending it [155] out to and then later on you can imagine [157] now you might be able to run some [158] analytics to see how many Facebook posts [160] you've done versus Instagram posts maybe [162] uh how much volume to which one's [164] delivering you the best results that [165] sort of thing so you have a lot of [166] freedom here and I've just designed this [168] to be a very simple stem that you could [169] use for basically anything but anyway in [171] terms of what we're actually going to do [173] turns out the most difficult part of [174] this flow isn't actually connecting the [176] flow it's just authenticating the [177] various apps that you want to post to [179] social media apps have really been [181] locked down in recent years like way [183] back in the day you know 2019 it was [186] like the wild wild west of social media [187] automation you could post whatever the [188] hell you wanted anywhere you wanted and [190] there were never any limits but nowadays [192] um like the Twitter API for instance has [194] been locked down like crazy and it's [195] quite difficult to get the [196] authentication they've tried to make it [198] a little more advanced so casual users [200] uh you know can't really get up and [201] running that in security of course a [204] sensibly say security but in reality I [205] think they just want to disincentivize [207] people from posting a bunch of low [209] hanging fruit content same thing with [211] LinkedIn same thing with Facebook same [212] thing with um uh with Instagram as well [215] so essentially what you need in order to [217] make this work is you need some business [218] profiles and I have a bunch of business [219] profiles set up which is why I can do [221] this um but you know you're not really [222] going to be able to do this in like a [223] personal profile uh at least for [225] Instagram so yeah this is the make.com [228] scenario flow here and what I'm going to [229] do is first thing I'm going to do is [230] just pull this air table data so I'm [232] just going to go air [233] table and I'm just going to search all [235] records so my idea is I'm just going to [237] list every single one just so we could [238] see and then what are we doing here um I [243] guess I'm hooked up to a different one [245] yeah this must be left click so I'm [247] actually going to go um do the [250] connection here and maybe this will be [252] helpful for people that need to connect [253] to their on your [255] table select the oo one the reason why [258] you select oo oo it just means open [260] authentication and it allows you to do [262] the connection without necessarily [263] needing a key now these guys don't have [265] a web hook or rather a callback URL [268] which is why it goes to Resource not [269] found but don't worry about that that [271] doesn't actually prevent the connection [272] from going through anytime you see that [273] just exit it out and the connection will [275] work now I created a base called content [278] calendar that's this one up here and [279] then I have one view this grid view so [282] table [283] one and the way that air table searches [285] work is you can select What fields you [287] want to Output now um this is just to [290] like limit the bandwidth or the data [292] that your make Doom instance is using [294] but I have never in my whole entire life [296] ever had an issue with data in make.com [298] I've never really used it for like [299] really heavy applications so I always [301] just leave all of this stuff blank then [303] I don't do any view I don't do any [304] sorting I don't do any formula and then [306] I'm just going to leave a limit at 10 if [308] I right click this now what it's going [309] to do is it's going to go out and it's [311] going to pull those air table records [313] and you'll notice that it pulls it uh [315] bundle by bundle so we're outputting [317] multiple bundles here for every bundle [319] we're going to run the scenario once so [321] if I'm pulling three bundles that means [322] we're going to run the scenario three [323] times now just because I'm about to test [325] this flow and I just really want to be [327] able to test it on one output at a time [329] I'm just going to go limit equals 1 and [331] then I'll worry about like the the [333] successive posting later and I'll also [335] worry about the date filtering later for [337] now all we're going to do is we're going [338] to be outputting um just one at a time [340] just to kind of make it [343] work so the one we got was 202 24607 so [348] that's uh this one I think did you know [351] that recycling one aluminum can can BL [353] blah right so that's what we're going to [354] be using for this [356] test why don't we do content syndicate a [360] onto Twitter Facebook Instagram and [364] Linkedin oh uh let's do medium [369] too this is what I'm going to be calling [371] the blueprint for everybody that uh [373] chooses to download it afterwards okay [375] great so we've searched the records what [377] do we do next well every social media [380] platform has different rules and [381] regulations surrounding stuff like the [384] number of characters you can have in [385] your caption there's also a different [387] tone of voice that's used from platform [389] to platform they have different [390] conventions some platforms still use [392] hashtags others don't and because every [394] single one is different what we're going [395] to want to do is we're going to want to [396] split up the flow and then alter the [399] source content slightly based off [401] whatever the platform is this doesn't [403] have to be crazy uh and I'm not going to [405] go like super deep into the weeds here [407] I'm not going to like change the aspect [408] ratio of the image or you know do like [411] super crazy tone of voice stuff because [412] I'm not going to spend a million hours [414] writing a prompt most of you guys are [415] probably going to want to develop that [416] for yourself and um you know custom [418] tailored to your brain voice and that [420] sort of thing but I am going to show you [421] just the simple way that you could do it [423] very quickly and [424] easily so in order to make this work I'm [426] going to go to router and then what I'm [428] going to do is I'm basically going to [429] create one new route for social media [431] platform so uh this first one here I [434] already have selected them all here but [436] for instance you know if we start with [438] Facebook go to Facebook pages and then [441] we're going to want to create a post [443] with [443] photos that's sort of going to be our [445] first route next Instagram now I've [448] gotten an Instagram for business um [450] connection already I did that connection [451] behind the scenes so what I want to do [453] is I want to create a photo post so [454] going to connect that there LinkedIn I [457] have a LinkedIn module set up here and [458] what I want to do is create a user image [460] post um I'm not going to be posting on [462] my page for LinkedIn I'm going to be [463] posting personally and then x.com or [466] formerly Twitter this is probably the [468] most difficult one um and I'll run you [470] through the authentication in a second [472] but we actually need two things here [473] first of all they have multiple versions [475] of their API and so we're going to need [476] one module from V5 another module from [478] V6 so the one that we're going to want [480] from V6 is we're going to want to do [482] create a [484] post but then we're also going to need [486] another one from V5 and that one is [489] upload a [492] media and so this is at the end of it [494] what our flow is going to look like at [496] least to start we're going to have this [498] x with these two up arrows which I [500] believe just means like a previous [501] version um for uploading a media and [503] then we're going to be creating a post [505] then here we're going to create a user [506] image post for LinkedIn we're going to [507] create a photo post for Instagram then [509] we're going to create a a post with [510] photos for Facebook now if you think [512] about it we need to filter um because [514] we're not going to be sending one piece [515] of content to all of these routes right [517] we're going to be sending them dependent [518] on whether or not the platform's array [520] includes the item that we are looking [522] for and so I'm going to click on each of [525] these here and then I'm going to say you [527] know Facebook the condition is going to [529] be a [530] platforms we'll say contains in Array [534] operator Facebook now I'm just going to [536] copy this over so I can quickly do this [538] for the other three [540] so that's for [541] Facebook this is going to be [549] Instagram this one here is going to be [553] LinkedIn so we're going to go Linked In [557] contains array and then oops sorry we're [559] actually going to do the [562] opposite and then this last one here is [564] going to be Twitter SLX I think is what [567] I called it [570] so we'll go contains and then if I'm [572] understanding correctly it's Twitter SLX [575] right now I'm doing this um just [578] contains not contains case sensitives [580] just make sure your um punctuation and [583] your your capitalization is correct here [586] and so I think mine is okay so I should [588] be good all right so that's the very [590] first thing that we're going to do and [593] actually now that I'm thinking about it [594] it's probably dumb for me to do that [595] because of how filters work yeah [597] that was pretty stupid um [600] the way the filters work in make.com is [602] if I try and add something else [605] here hypothetically I wanted to download [608] Media and then I wanted to put this here [611] now the filter is going to be between [612] these two which is kind of dumb so [614] that's that's annoying we're probably [615] goingon to have to redo that now that I [616] think about it whatever not the end of [618] the world I wonder if we could duplicate [621] this oh yeah great we can just duplicate [623] these so what I'm going to do is I'm [625] just going to copy and paste all these [627] here and then actually I'll actually [628] remove these to start um the reason why [631] is because uh we need to use an AI to [633] edit the [635] content so there are a couple different [637] ways you could do this in practice uh [639] the first way you could do it is you [641] could [643] theoretically put your GPT module here [646] and then you could have it output a [648] bunch of [649] Json um with every uh specific platform [653] so you could say you are a helpful [655] intelligent writing [657] assistant then you could say [660] convert the following post into formats [664] for the specified social media [667] platforms then you could feed [669] platforms here and then you could give [672] it an example where you know it says [674] like [676] Facebook sorry Instagram uh LinkedIn and [680] Twitter and then what you do [682] is maybe I go content here and then I go [685] platforms uh what I do in the assistant [688] is I would output Json that goes like [689] this [691] Facebook copy um [694] Instagram copy [699] LinkedIn copy or Twitter and then go [703] copy and the benefit of doing it this [705] way is it's only going to run once and [706] then you're going to get what you need [708] for every subsequent platform uh it's [710] going to be substantially fewer Ops um [713] because it's longer the quality is [714] probably going to go down a little bit [716] if you think about it logically the [717] other variant of what you could do is [719] you could copy this and then you could [721] have four of [724] these and have one per [726] platform have let's say this one be for [729] Twitter this one be for Facebook this [730] one be for Instagram this one be for [731] LinkedIn and then you could like feed [733] them into the platforms after [734] that that said this sounds a little more [737] interesting to [738] me and I like the idea of just doing it [741] all in one shot by iterating through the [743] platform so that's what I'm going to do [745] that said I want the instructions to be [749] um understood very well and I don't [750] trust that gbt 40 is going to do this [752] because gbt 4 is a little bit dumber [754] than GPT 4 it's faster and cheaper but [755] it's Dumber so I'm just going to use gp4 [757] for this feel free to change it um if [759] you want later on uh but what I'm going [761] to do is your helpful intelligent [762] writing assistant conf convert the [765] following post into formats based on the [766] social specified social media platforms [769] and I'll put the copy in [773] Json um for Twitter ensure posts are [778] short and punch I'm not going to use [779] like actual character limit well maybe [781] under 280 [783] characters for Facebook and sure posts [786] are I don't [788] know [790] um medium sized and [793] engaging I'll say for Instagram and your [796] posts are short and [798] Punchy let's say under 400 maybe under [801] 500 characters let's do [803] 400 and then for um what else do we have [807] LinkedIn Ure post [809] read corporate and [813] professional and then I'll say [818] platforms and then uh sorry I don't [820] actually put the platforms here what I [822] do is I will put the content [832] here and then I'll say platforms [834] Facebook Instagram LinkedIn Twitter and [835] then I will yeah okay so that this is [837] what I'll do and then I'm just going to [839] copy this over here now and then I'll [843] copy platforms over here that'll iterate [845] through the platforms and then I'm just [848] going to give it one little example here [850] um I needed to generate another [853] example so I'll say write me a great [856] post about [857] recycling for I don't know for Facebook [859] or [862] something longer no hashtags [871] okay uh we'll put this [877] here let's make a little bit [882] shorter I'm just going to use AI to [884] generate the content to train the AI I [886] don't actually usually recommend this [887] but I just want to do this video um just [889] in one F swoop as opposed to cutting and [890] stopping and cutting um [899] so this is going to be my Twitter [900] example which I will feed over [904] here um I'm going to [906] say make this more corporate and a [909] little longer for [916] LinkedIn that's uh pretty busy and [919] annoying but [921] sure I don't oh oh jeez that's really [926] [Music] [927] annoying um man [930] um [934] I pressed control I pressed escape and [937] when you press [938] Escape it uh removes a lot of the copy [941] for you which is really annoying but [943] anyway whatever [945] um I'll have to do some rewriting here [948] unfortunately that looks good I have the [949] four platforms here so Facebook [951] Instagram LinkedIn Twitter okay and then [953] I should be able to just do the same [955] thing [956] here um the post copy I'm going to [960] include is going to [963] be here and then platforms I'm going to [965] put under here and then up here I [968] basically just need to take whatever the [970] post is that I generated [974] before [976] um and then convert it so let's just [979] take this and we'll paste it in okay [982] great now I'm going to press okay I'm [983] going to save this thing before I clown [985] my eyes out and essentially what we have [986] here is we have a system prompt you [988] helpful intelligent writing system then [990] we have a user prompt which gives it [992] instructions it says Hey convert the [993] following post copy into formats for the [995] specified social media platforms output [997] in Json each platform is different so [1000] make sure you conform to the [1003] following um [1006] specifications if Twitter if Instagram [1009] if Facebook if [1011] LinkedIn then I'm giving it an actual [1014] example here so I gave it a post small [1016] actions big impact I gave it for example [1019] platforms just so it understands the [1020] Json Facebook Instagram link and Twitter [1022] and then um you know I give it an [1024] example big Json object or JavaScript [1027] object here with all of that this means [1029] that the next time that I feed in or ask [1031] it to do this for me I'm going to be [1032] using live post copy and it's going to [1034] adhere as closely as possible to this [1036] format which is going to help quite a [1037] bit I'll go back to show advanced [1039] settings here and then for temperature [1041] I'm going to bring this down to [1043] point7 and then frequency penalty I'm [1046] going to do like .3 or something I [1049] basically just wanted to use different [1051] verbiage okay now that I've done all [1054] this I should be good to start adding [1056] back these social media [1062] platforms oops that's kind of annoying [1065] looks like the Instagram one got tacked [1066] onto the Twitter one so I'm just going [1069] to give a little disconnect there and [1072] then this Twitter one I'm going to add [1073] over here and I'm going to Auto align [1074] them all again and now just for testing [1077] purposes I'm going to see what the out [1078] put [1081] is so we got the record we're feeding it [1085] into gbd4 it's quite a fair amount of [1087] text so just keep in mind you know [1089] anytime you're feeding like a large [1090] amount of text in you're going to be [1091] waiting a little bit longer and now I [1094] have the [1096] result I don't want it to Output this [1099] Json character so I need to tell it not [1100] to do that because I'm just going to be [1102] parsing this directly actually why don't [1104] we try pumping this through a parser and [1107] let's see if that actually matters I [1108] mean not we'll go to parse Json I'm just [1111] going to feed this back in [1113] here and then for the purposes of [1115] demonstration I'm just going to copy and [1116] paste all of [1121] this and then I'm just going to run this [1124] yeah so it doesn't work because of those [1126] um kind of uh three [1131] lines I'll say don't include back Texs [1139] okay that should work and then I'm just [1141] going to feed in the data directly from [1145] here and we'll see what the Json module [1151] does still says the source is not valid [1153] Jason why is [1155] that um it looks like it's because it [1157] put new lines in so because we asked for [1160] the LinkedIn content to be a lot longer [1162] uh it's going to be adding in new lines [1164] but when you have new lines in Json it [1166] breaks it and so what we need to do is [1167] we need to go through we basically need [1168] to to replace all these new lines with [1171] um uh back sln so we're just going to go [1174] replace and then I'm going to pump [1176] in KN line here and then we're going to [1179] replace it with a backlash [1180] in I'm going to ignore this warning [1183] because this thing keeps on popping up [1184] and I hate [1187] it and then fingers crossed we get the [1190] green thumbs up okay we still did not [1193] get the green thumbs up why is that [1195] source is not valid Jason um oh because [1198] at the beginning had a new line and you [1200] can't have a new line outside of oh [1202] right right right [1205] right [1206] okay I'm just going to tell [1210] it use backlash n in place of new lines [1214] there you [1215] go and then I'm just going to go back to [1217] feeding the result in I would like a [1218] procedural way to do this unfortunately [1220] it doesn't look like that is going to be [1223] feasible for me at this moment in time [1226] um [1228] yeah it's not using the new [1232] lines so the reason for that is because [1234] I'm just not training it to use new [1236] lines so let's go to this LinkedIn post [1239] and then just add a [1248] bunch okay that looks pretty good I'm [1251] just pretending that this is what the [1253] post wanted to [1256] say um [1260] this should now be good and if it's not [1262] I'm going to eat a [1264] shoe wonder how many shoes I've eaten up [1266] until [1267] now okay great so this one worked uh and [1271] we parsed out every social media [1272] platform in this case we had Instagram [1274] and Linkedin so we had two um and when [1277] it parses the backlash n you can see it [1280] converts it right back into text with [1282] new lines in between so we want it to do [1284] a pretty good job here um and I'm just a [1286] little concerned about the variability [1287] so I'm going to go in [1289] and I'm going to reduce the temperature [1291] further and then I'm just going to [1292] remove the frequency penalty if you [1294] think about it every time the backlash [1295] end comes up it may decrease the [1297] likelihood of the next back backslash in [1299] from being generated so I just want to [1300] remove that from basically um being a [1304] possibility okay so we have almost [1306] everything we need I know that we need [1308] one more thing and if you've been paying [1309] attention up until now um you'll [1312] probably have figured it out as you know [1314] if you notice when I click on um most of [1318] the these modules [1320] here it asks me to upload a file and [1324] this isn't like a link to an image it's [1326] an actual file specifically it asks me [1328] to map so if you're familiar with how [1329] make.com handles these files you'll know [1332] that because of the way that the error [1333] table is set up right now the error [1335] table is just listing the URL of a file [1337] we're basically going to have to [1338] download that file and then re-upload it [1340] into each of these so what we need to do [1342] is we need to download a file the way [1343] that we do it is we go to http and then [1345] get a file and then pump this in in and [1348] what we're going to do is we're going to [1349] feed in the URL of the file that we want [1351] to download which is this one here and [1353] for demonstration purposes I'm just [1355] going to do all this directly in the [1357] module just to make sure it works we're [1361] going to right click this download a [1362] file it'll give me a 200 and then we'll [1364] have a bunch of data this data is the [1365] file itself and then we can use this [1367] data to map into all of these um you [1371] know the these uh uh Fields here now I [1374] need to actually add this to the flow [1376] which is unfortunate um so I'm going [1378] going to just leave this here and then [1382] I'm going to feed in the actual image [1384] URL let's use up some [1387] Ops and then you'll notice that some of [1389] these modules still have little um red [1392] circles around them that's just because [1393] we haven't filled out the all of the [1396] information or all the required Fields [1398] but if they're not part of the main flow [1399] then they don't really matter for [1401] us okay so we just ran through we [1403] downloaded the file which is cool I'm [1405] going to connect this now and then and [1408] I'm just going to reconnect each of [1410] these because sometimes you need to [1412] reconnect them in order to get the data [1414] inside um a module that you just ran [1418] let's start with this LinkedIn [1420] here LinkedIn makes use of the HTTP get [1423] a file module here you'll see it [1425] automatically selects just any buffer um [1427] from a module previous to that so that's [1430] nice uh the content that I'm going to [1432] feed in is I'm going to feed in whatever [1433] this is called LinkedIn but you'll [1434] notice that I only have Instagram and [1436] Linkedin I can't access Facebook and I [1437] can't access Twitter Twitter so you're [1438] probably wondering what the hell how am [1439] I going to get it well I'm going to get [1440] it pretty [1443] easily let me just select a page [1446] here um I want to upload a photo oh for [1450] whatever reason this buffer is [1451] inaccessible that's odd um it's [1454] inaccessible because this filter would [1456] not have ran that's why it's [1457] inaccessible but that's okay um that's [1459] all right uh for the caption what we [1461] want to do is you see how before it said [1463] Instagram and Linkedin but if I paste it [1464] in it's 25. Linkin well if I just go 25. [1469] faceb I know that the variable is going [1471] to be called Facebook and that is what [1472] will enable me to pump my variable in [1474] even though it's uh white with sort of [1478] this like outline effect um that is just [1480] make referring to the fact that I [1482] haven't seen that before and that's all [1485] right what we want is we want this 28. [1488] dat buffer from this um in order to put [1490] into the Facebook module here so I'm [1492] just going to put this in and then for [1495] file name I'm not going to worry about [1496] the file name I'll just call this image [1498] um I think this is a JPEG so I'll just [1500] use [1502] JPEG and I realized this is the caption [1505] actually and not the uh the right place [1506] to put this should be in the [1508] message so that's good um we need to [1511] upload media here as well so all you do [1514] is you click and then it'll just [1515] automatically get the file for it that's [1516] nice and then I'm going to go to [1518] Instagram for business uh this is a [1520] photo URL which is interesting so [1522] whereas the other modules here wanted uh [1525] us to upload an image here we can [1526] actually just feed in our photo URL so [1528] I'm just going to feed in the image URL [1530] here not that the maximum file size is 8 [1532] megabytes and I didn't actually check to [1534] make sure that all of these images were [1536] less than that um so we may have an [1538] issue there I don't [1540] know looks like there's still a problem [1543] with the Twitter field now why is [1546] that imag or GIF less than 5 [1551] megabytes okay I think that was just a [1553] little bug and now we're going to create [1556] a post with the text content [1558] the way I'm going to do this is I'll [1560] just go 25. [1561] Twitter and then if I go to show advaned [1564] settings you'll see that there is now a [1565] media ID field and what I want to do is [1567] just select the first media ID field [1569] from the upload to [1571] Media okay so um keep in mind I am [1575] posting to a bunch of my own social [1577] media platforms so what I'm going to do [1579] is because I want to actually run this [1581] test live for you and show you guys what [1583] it looks like I'm going to open up all [1585] of my social media platforms and then [1587] I'm just going to delete the post as [1588] they come in so I have my Twitter here [1590] and I believe I'm posting on my personal [1592] Twitter right let's see here yes uh got [1595] Instagram here and I'm posting on 1 [1597] second copy I believe so I'm going to [1599] have to jump over to my 1 second copy [1603] profile over here I'm posting on [1605] LinkedIn and that's my personal [1608] LinkedIn and then Facebook should be one [1611] second copy as well so I'm going to go [1612] to Facebook one second copy all [1616] right that should be fine [1619] fine I also mentioned medium here now [1622] that I'm thinking about [1623] it but we can just make medium like a [1626] like a you always um post to medium and [1629] actually why don't I just why don't I [1631] add that in afterwards as opposed to [1632] having to like reset the whole flow but [1635] okay great um I think we have everything [1636] that we need now to do this one post and [1638] to you know format it into four [1639] different tones of voice hypothetically [1641] so why don't we run once and why don't [1643] we see what happens there'll probably be [1644] an issue with at least one of these I'd [1645] imagine [1649] okay LinkedIn was uploaded fine and then [1650] Instagram for business was uploaded fine [1652] that's [1652] great well we didn't know yet but [1655] usually when it takes that long that [1656] means that it did a good job so I'm [1659] going to go to my profile here just [1661] check that Instagram [1663] post this looks nice this has all the [1665] text that we wanted before I'm going to [1667] delete this [1669] now and then if we go back here we'll [1672] see that LinkedIn um successfully posted [1675] our thing so this is probably on my [1676] personal here [1678] and let's see what the LinkedIn post [1680] looks like it's a lot longer a lot more [1683] fleshed out looks a lot better in my [1685] humble opinion so that's [1686] great so that's that post why don't we [1690] try um something with what did we have [1692] there I think we only had uh Facebook [1695] sorry LinkedIn and Instagram right so [1698] why don't I just change this content [1700] calendar to also include Facebook and [1702] Twitter just that we can test all of [1704] them at one go there you go [1708] okay we're going to click run once here [1711] I'm interested in seeing how this [1712] Twitter post Works honestly that's the [1713] one thing that I'm worried [1715] about Facebook page seems to be doing [1718] well the fact that it's taking time is a [1719] positive [1721] signal and then media was uploaded and [1724] then it looks like it was uploaded to [1725] Twitter as well so for the Facebook page [1727] I'm just going to jump back here to one [1728] second copies Facebook so I can delete [1730] this really quick don't want anybody [1732] thinking that I recycle that would be [1735] terrible [1736] um how the oh sorry I have to change my [1739] Association [1741] again jump over here and then I'm going [1744] to delete this move it to trash let's [1747] not move it to the recycling bin let's [1748] move it to [1749] trash and then on x.com I'm going to [1752] scroll down here and then I already got [1754] some likes that's pretty [1756] funny terrible terrible okay great so [1760] yeah that's the flow for social media um [1762] the one other thing I'm going to do is [1763] I'm going to fulfill this newsletter [1765] request by um having it write a little [1767] blog post here [1768] and I'm not going to use like an [1769] advanced content automation I built a [1771] bunch of content generation systems up [1773] until this point in time that are much [1774] much better much more flushed out they [1776] allow you to do really cool things um [1779] you can even now add images if you use [1781] like Source unsplash thing that I showed [1783] in a previous video um you know the [1785] quality is way better but in this video [1786] all I'm going to do is I'm just going to [1787] do short like a short medium post I'm [1789] going to pretend it's like a newsletter [1791] um and what I'll do is I'm going [1793] to copy this GPT module [1798] and then the content that's coming in [1801] just because I'm going to have to [1802] rewrite this post it's going to be a lot [1803] longer of a post I'm going to get it to [1805] do it [1808] um uh it's like its own designated [1813] module so turn the following [1818] post [1821] into excuse me let's [1824] do Punchy onepage newsletter [1830] um make it long and [1835] detailed use markdown ATX [1840] format so I'm just going to keep this [1842] extremely simple as I mentioned earlier [1845] uh what we're going to be doing is [1846] feeding in the post copy [1849] here and then why don't I actually just [1851] test it [1854] out using the same copy from previous [1859] so sorry [1861] um I'm going to do this [1864] here and then I'm just going to go into [1865] chat GPT and again like write my own [1867] training [1871] material I'll say convert this post into [1875] a [1876] newsletter about the topic write in [1879] markdown ATX format make it long and [1882] detailed this doesn't have to be perfect [1884] just for the purposes of demonstration [1893] wow this is a lot longer than I was [1895] expecting [1899] honestly okay [1902] well that looks good to me so we're [1905] going to take this [1907] in and then I'm going to train quote [1910] unquote train this [1912] model and what I'm going to do is I will [1914] just give it one example of me doing all [1916] this markdown format stuff [1919] and then I will go [1921] post [1923] copy I'm just going to use these uh [1925] three horizontal lines here just to [1927] space it out a bit and then the specific [1930] example here was this post so I'm going [1932] to use this as training material I'm not [1934] doing Json or anything I'm just feeding [1935] it plain text and then the actual thing [1937] I'm going to feed it here is the post [1939] copy and then I'm going to go dot dot [1942] dot and now that should give me um you [1944] know the markdown ATX [1946] format we use slightly higher [1949] temperature um and then maybe I'll do [1951] like a 0.1 frequency penalty and then [1954] because I've already tested these other [1955] four and I just don't want to have to [1957] like post them on my social media again [1958] I'm just going to remove all of these [1959] routes and then connect this and then [1961] before I export this blueprint for all [1963] of y'all I'm going to reconnect them all [1964] just so you have it so unlinking these [1968] four this is now the only module here [1971] that really matters um I'm anticipating [1973] this is going to do well it's going to [1975] do a good job [1978] now that I think about it we also need a [1980] title [1983] um okay so this will [1986] be um right platform specific [1990] posts this one here be WR markdown [1994] article and then I'm just going to have [1996] another one here that's going to write [1998] all the metadata that we need I'm just [2000] going to call this [2002] um oops that's not what I wanted to do [2005] write [2006] metadata and then what do we actually [2008] need we need oh uh we can do markdown [2011] here um we need a [2014] title we need [2017] tags [2019] interesting and publish status I'm just [2021] going to leave this as draft for now [2023] okay so I'm not going to put any tags in [2025] but you can put tags if you [2027] want uh that'll just help your post get [2030] seen on medium it's a medium specific [2032] thing really the only the only metadata [2033] that we actually need is the title so [2035] that's all I'm going to [2036] do so I'll just say write title and then [2040] here I'm just going to use GPT 40 [2042] because it's much cheaper much [2045] faster [2047] um write a title for the following [2051] post then I'll [2056] say recycling is an aure and here's why [2061] and then I'm going to do the same thing [2062] here and then we can just feed in the [2065] results to medium so this right metadata [2068] or right title this is going to be the [2069] title of the post the content here is [2071] going to be the markdown article I'm not [2073] going to have a canonical URL and I'm [2074] going to publish this as draft so I'm [2077] just going to open up my medium now [2078] because I have like a million profiles [2081] up we'll go to my profile I think or [2084] maybe we'll go to [2086] right okay we will not go to right [2088] Library [2090] maybe oh boy it's been a while since [2092] I've used medium I don't even remember [2094] where my stories are okay they're right [2095] over [2096] here okay yeah yes this is all stuff [2098] that I wrote like forever [2100] ago wow I have so much content here that [2103] I could probably write that's funny um [2106] awesome now what I'm going to do is I'm [2107] just going to plug this in and I'm going [2108] to post it on [2111] medium and I'm just going to see it pop [2113] up here under [2116] draft so this isn't writing the whole [2118] markdown [2120] article keep in mind this um is a [2122] simpler version of the content [2123] generation system that I've shown you [2125] previously like this is is just a single [2127] modu if you really wanted to generate [2129] good AI content you would uh loop over [2132] multiple times and you would have [2134] contacts from headings and that sort of [2135] thing I bet you in a generation or two [2138] you won't need to do that the will just [2139] be good enough to write a whole article [2140] on its own but we're uh we're still not [2142] there yet [2143] unfortunately so because I'm asking for [2146] quite a lot and I'm using gp4 here it's [2148] taking its sweet ass time but anyway the [2150] title was basically instant because I'm [2152] using gp40 and it's a very short piece [2153] of text and then it ended up creating [2155] the post unfortunately uh with the title [2158] it's a title so that's really annoying [2161] if I refresh this you'll see the [2164] post somewhere [2166] here I don't actually know where this [2168] post [2170] is maybe oh sorry this is this is on um [2173] 1 second copy which is different yeah [2175] yeah this isn't my actual um yeah this [2178] is my actual uh this isn't the account [2180] that I'm already R this a different one [2182] anyway uh you see that it was posted it [2184] had a bunch of points on how why should [2187] make you know recycling a habit and so [2189] on and so forth um and it actually [2191] worked pretty well it looks like the [2192] title was was pulled incorrectly [2194] newsletter the power of recycling so I [2197] like it any who um a lot that you could [2199] do with this for sure uh you know I [2201] think what I would do if I wanted to [2204] create like a full-fledged content [2205] solution and this is um we we had a [2207] Community member named Alex Hogan asked [2210] a great question in the weekly office [2212] hours the other day he asked uh [2215] something about [2218] let me see what's your approach to a [2220] completely integrated and Automated [2222] Business social content media image [2223] automation customer feedback inbound and [2225] upbound engagements Etc and my reply to [2227] him was that you know you you shouldn't [2229] really fully automate your business [2231] because there are some points of human [2232] leverage that are a lot more important [2234] and uh we just hit 400 members by the [2236] way thanks to everybody that's watching [2237] it's in the community and um this is a [2240] great example of a system that I feel [2241] would multiply human leverage because [2243] you're still getting a human being to [2244] write presumably the post copy here so [2246] you're still getting somebody at very [2248] high level to idate you're getting [2249] somebody to choose what platforms to use [2250] that sort of thing um but you know it's [2253] sort of like automation that does all of [2254] the rest so yeah that's that uh what I [2257] would do to flesh this system out maybe [2260] a little bit further maybe it a little [2261] bit better is right over here when the [2264] content is sent to gp4 here to write the [2267] markdown article I would probably [2269] instead do like an HTTP module instead [2273] and I would send a request to um another [2277] scenario that generates the whole [2278] article using the method that I've [2280] talked about before so this is the one [2282] that procedurally Loops over and adds [2284] different sections based off context [2286] makes it really long get up to like [2287] three four 5K word articles there that [2289] are reasonably good and then I would uh [2292] have it um send back a web hook response [2295] to this essentially and then i' get the [2298] result from this and then I would use it [2299] to do the actual medium post that's one [2302] thing uh the next is the content [2303] calendar scheduling automation side um [2306] we need to create like an air table [2308] formula basically to filter these [2309] records to only show the specific date [2311] that we want air table formulas can be [2313] sort of annoying so um I don't fully [2316] know how I'm going to do this I could [2318] probably just use chat gbt now I'm [2319] thinking about [2320] it let's [2322] see write an error table [2326] formula um that filters for the date uh [2330] oh boy what do we want here 66 2024 [2341] and [2343] then the date field here would just be [2345] called [2346] Date okay I just had to take a minute to [2349] get the air table formatting but [2351] essentially it's [2352] isore same and then the field that I'm [2354] looking for is date and then we have the [2356] date that I'm pumping in and then day um [2358] so this is I think day no this is month [2362] day and then year so what we could do is [2364] we could just um format date now and we [2368] could have it be um month I think mm DD [2374] year year year I believe maybe mistaken [2378] there we have to close this [2382] bracket maybe it's m Mo yeah let me just [2386] look up integrat date time [2389] tokens and it'll just show you all of [2391] the tokens that you can use in order to [2393] format a specific date so what I want is [2396] I want D I guess not d d I just want D [2401] and then I want M and then I want y y y [2405] y so we go back here and then we'll just [2409] do sorry m d and then y y y y y so then [2415] we can run this puppy and then boom we [2418] got the current post for today um so [2420] what you could do then is you could set [2422] it to run once every day at I don't know [2424] like 6: [2425] a.m. and then now this a automation will [2427] run every single day and then it will [2429] take the content in the content calendar [2432] that's specific for that day and then [2433] it'll post it you can also have it run [2435] multiple times a day uh you could also [2437] probably make use of our tables like [2438] date time formatting not just like the [2439] date right now this is just a date you [2441] can actually add like a date time I [2442] believe so there's that any who hope you [2445] guys enjoyed watching had a lot of fun [2446] putting that pretty interesting contents [2448] indicator together um Facebook Twitter [2451] Instagram LinkedIn and medium all in [2455] basically the click of a button the sort [2456] of thing is [2457] basically the the prototypical flow that [2459] um a lot of companies are looking for [2461] usually companies have like three or [2463] four people that are doing this sort of [2464] thing at all times uh which is sort of [2465] annoying the sorts of companies that I [2467] work with anyway then if you think about [2468] it they're each being paid like two and [2470] a half three $4,000 a month to manage it [2472] so this is an easy way to like shave off [2473] 10K granted I wouldn't just eliminate [2475] the team completely and then just have [2476] them use an automation because the [2477] quality is going to be way worse than if [2479] you had some human beings in the loop [2480] what I would do is I would Empower them [2481] to use these automations to improve the [2483] quality of the output and their speed [2485] and and Agility uh so maybe instead of [2487] posting it directly what you do is you [2489] would have this automation run and then [2490] just dump it into another air table with [2492] the post for every platform and then a [2494] human being could just go through and [2495] just QA make sure they're all good maybe [2497] make a couple of minor edits before [2499] sending but that is what I would do and [2501] I hope you guys enjoyed learning how to [2502] do it for yourselves if you guys have [2504] any comments leave them down below [2505] otherwise like subscribe do all the fun [2507] YouTube stuff I'll catch you on the next [2508] video

Title: How to Unlock Thousands of Quality AI Models In Make With HuggingFace
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here and [1] in this video I'm going to show you how [2] to integrate make.com with the hugging [5] face API I'm going to walk you through [6] everything you need to know about the [7] API in order to get up and running in [9] just a few minutes why hugging face [11] because the vast majority of the flows [13] that I built so far have been open AI [15] specific but with hugging face you [17] essentially get to unlock several [19] thousand AI models that can do [21] everything from generate your favorite [24] anime wau to uh you know process text at [28] 100 times the speed to substantially [30] lower inference costs so you can usually [32] save a fair amount of money if you use [34] one of these models versus say open Ai [36] and throw bck or something like that uh [38] and you just have way more freedom and [40] sort of accessibility to do the sorts of [42] high-end automation builds that a lot of [44] us here want to do so if that sounds [45] like something interested in you stay [47] tuned let's learn how to use one of the [48] most popular AI apis out there [53] today okay this video was suggested to [55] me over 3 months ago by the lovely at [58] caram wise one he asked Nick is there [61] any way to integrate hug and face and [62] make and there absolutely is that's what [64] I want to talk about in this video so [67] for people that are unfamiliar with [68] hugging face what exactly is it well [70] hugging face is basically like a web [73] repository for artificial intelligence [76] models specifically really good [78] artificial intelligence models uh these [81] guys came out I think over 5 years ago [83] now and really they've been more or less [86] like the open source uh I guess [88] behemoths in the space I don't think you [91] necessarily have to be open source to [93] upload your model onto hugging face but [95] I think the vast majority of the models [97] here are and basically instead of you [99] being forced to use just one big llm or [103] AI image provider like uh you know open [106] AI or maybe anthropic these are models [109] that are generally sourced by the [110] community or sourced by people that are [112] very proficient at handling and managing [114] artificial intelligence models and then [117] a lot of these models are also just [118] available through API for people like [120] you or I additionally there can be [123] substantial cost savings to using [125] hugging faces apis the their inference [128] API specifically for their AI models and [130] then you also just get a ton of [131] diversity like you can do so much with [134] the AI models here it's not just you [136] know like like a text generation model [138] so I have a couple open here and I'll [139] just show you what I mean like um this [141] is a stable diffusion flash model which [144] is basically I think an improvement on a [146] stable diffusion XL and you can B [149] basically just generate really really [151] high quality images um I think with [154] their own Dimensions like I think the [155] vast majority of uh these like example [157] ones are square but I think you can [158] generate them in like portrait mode [160] landscape mode uh to you know I don't [163] know like add images to blog posts or [165] automatically generate images for social [167] media posts or really just to do a ton [169] of things so um they have a little [171] tester here on the right hand side after [172] you sign up where you can actually try [174] out the model and what I'll do here is [177] I'll just say like uh beautiful smiling [181] woman acrylic painting [185] stylized and I'm going to click compute [187] and uh this is essentially going to be [189] the exact same thing that we do when we [191] hook this up to make.com and then call [194] Via API endpoint the same model right or [197] the same function so I mean this took [199] what like 5 Seconds to generate it was a [201] beautiful smiling woman indeed uh [203] acrylic painting stylized I mean [206] obviously play around with the prompts [207] until you figure out uh the best one for [209] you for your use case I imagine any [211] realistic use case for this would [213] involve some user input coming in and [215] then a model specifically to create a [217] bunch of prompts with that user input so [219] that it's like you know as optimal as [221] possible for this this is just one of [223] the many models here um there's another [224] one here called mistol mistol is a text [226] model the big difference between mistol [228] and um gp4 aside from quality because [231] mistol is a lot smaller um is is how [233] fast it is so for instance right I just [235] said hi hello how can I assist you today [238] I want to talk about penguin [240] teach me about penguins I love penguins [243] um now just watch how fast it is when I [245] click the send [247] button I mean that took less than like 5 [250] seconds or something and it generated I [253] don't know maybe like 50 to 100 wordss a [255] gbt 4 is way slower than that gpt3 is [258] even way slower than that this is [259] probably one of the fastest models [261] currently available today and so you can [262] imagine there are probably some use [263] cases in which you might need to use [265] smaller faster models like this uh for [268] you know work that really isn't as [270] cognitively dense maybe you have some uh [273] categorization requirement or something [274] or you're just attempting to Route uh [276] flow in your make.com scenario you don't [280] necessarily need to use the full brunt [281] of one of the most advanced models on [283] planet Earth to do that you don't need [284] gbd4 and you definitely don't need to be [286] paying whatever their token costs are [287] now you could use a much cheaper model [289] that does the job well enough and then [291] use that instead I have another one open [294] here for all of my anime fans this one's [296] like an anime uh generator essentially [298] and it's super high quality you know if [300] we zoom in here this is uh Luffy from [303] one piece I don't know who that is but [304] you know they're they're just such high [306] quality models out there and you can [308] actually access these entirely through [310] API so you can realistically generate [312] like I mean up until quite recently this [315] type of artwork would have taken people [317] days to put together and now you can do [319] it in literally the palm of your hand [320] using an inference API so what I'm going [322] to do over the course of next few [324] minutes is I'm not going to use this [325] anime one uh I'm not going to use the [326] Myst one I'm just going to use the [327] stable diffusion one because I think [328] this is probably one of the more [330] interesting ones for most of you and [331] we're just going to um automatically [333] generate images for social media posts [336] I'm going to attach that to a flow that [337] I built previously and then I'll run you [339] guys through how to connect the hug and [340] face API to things just generally [342] speaking give you guys a leg up on you [345] know artificial intelligence don't feel [346] locked into just one of the uh big [348] providers like anthropic or [350] whatnot so first things first I'm just [352] going to pop open my scenario Builder [357] here and I'm just going to say generate [360] image for social media [363] post excuse me and what I'm going to do [367] the very first thing is I'm going to set [368] up the hugging face connection now if [370] you've never set up a hugging face [371] connection before don't worry they have [373] an extremely simple API with pretty [376] straightforward authentication and I'm [377] just going to show you how to do it all [379] completely uh using my own account here [381] which I set it for free by the way it [382] took me less than 3 minutes to set up so [385] all I have to do first and foremost is [387] Type in hugging face INF API that's what [390] you want and it needs to say [393] serverless and then go down to overview [396] and it'll teach you how to do this so in [399] order to get your API token you first [400] need to register or log in which I did a [402] moment ago then you need to get your [404] user access or API token in your hugging [406] face profile settings you'll see a token [408] that has this format HF [412] xxxxx uh and then basically every time [414] you run an API call you need to include [416] this token in your request the format [420] that we're going to need and anytime you [421] see an API and maybe if you're [422] unfamiliar with like how exactly this [424] API translates over to make just look [426] for curl or like request uh curl is just [430] like the um I guess like terminal way to [434] make requests like you can actually just [435] spin up uh an instance in your terminal [438] here and uh you know I could copy this [440] code and fill in this token and then I [442] could actually like access the API just [443] through my terminal but um the reason [445] why this is beneficial for us is because [447] it gives us the URL that we're going to [449] use and we can you can just copy and [450] paste that plug that directly into uh [452] you know our make https HTTP requests [455] module it tells us the method which in [458] our case is going to be post it tells us [460] the data so can you please let us know [462] more details about your and then it lets [464] us know how to do the authorization and [465] the way you do the authorization here is [467] called the authorization Bearer uh [468] format which is where you do [470] authorization as the key and then Bearer [473] and then the API token as the value so [477] let's set that up right now we need to [478] go to the h face profile settings [481] first and now it says make sure to never [483] post your tokens publicly so you should [485] absolutely never ever post your tokens [487] publically like I'm about to do um what [489] we want to do is uh this is for my [492] YouTube [493] video I generate this token then I'm [497] going to copy [498] this and then I'm going to go back over [501] here and then I'll select an HTTP module [504] and this is how I'm going to make a [505] request the one that I care about [506] specifically is the make a request [508] module here there are tons of request [510] modules but this is the only one that I [511] really care about and then uh you know [514] for a test why don't I go back to um [517] this overview here and why don't I just [519] reference gpt2 just like this is telling [521] me to this isn't going to be the model [522] that we're going to use but I just want [524] to get the format down and really just [525] like in my head anytime I'm doing an API [527] integration I was like hey let's just [528] connect to the API and let let's make an [530] authorized request first doesn't matter [532] how easy or difficult or or what I'm [533] doing specifically with that I just need [534] to like at least get the 200 and then [537] once I have the 200 it's very easy just [538] to make some tweaks to the API call so [541] this is the URL I'm going to put in the [542] URL field the method as I mentioned [544] previously is post this H stands for [546] headers and so this is where we need to [548] put our our Bearer token and stuff oh [550]  I think I okay I just screwed up [553] because I lost my uh my token so I'm [556] going to invalidate and refresh this and [557] then I'm going to copy this again okay [560] um so I need to put a header in and uh [562] the header that I'm going to do is [563] called authorization and then Bearer and [565] then I'm going to paste in my token and [567] let me just double check that this is [569] correct corre so authorization um [571] there's going to be this colon here but [572] make actually automatically puts that [573] colon in for you um so you know if [575] you've done this before and you've [576] screwed up this is probably why then we [578] have a space then we have Bearer and [579] then we have the API token so [582] authorization Bearer and there's my API [584] token then you have some data uh this [586] data is looks just to be a string so I [588] think the input to this is literally [589] just a string can you please let us know [591] more details about [592] your so I'm just going to go body type [595] I'll go raw content type I think just [598] text plane I'm just going to try feeding [599] this [600] in and see what happens and I'll click [603] yes to parse [604] response so I don't know if this is [606] going to work um immediately no it [608] doesn't look like it so let's see [610] authorization header is correct but the [611] token seems invalid this is this token [614] so it's possible [617] that um [621] wait it's possible that I need to add [624] something else here let me scroll back [627] up and see [629] HF uncore whatever so let's go back [634] here let's edit these permissions and [637] just do read WR to [639] everything that's probably what I messed [641] up here yeah make calls the serverless [642] inference APM my bad so you have to you [644] have to set the permissions on this um [646] realistically this is probably the only [647] one I need but I'm just going to do [649] everything here make my life a lot [650] easier and then I'm going to right click [653] and it'll run again this is a 415 now [656] expected request of content type [658] application Json okay so that's good um [661] somewhere on this API page it told me [663] that I need to be [664] using um content type Json application [667] Json so we're getting closer run it [670] again this one's a 422 fail to [672] deserialize the body into the target [674] type inv Val type string can you please [676] let us know details about your expected [678] strut okay and then in terms of the data [680] that we need to send over there um [681] earlier I just put uh you know like a a [683] string but you actually have a format [685] that all GPT calls need to have um and [688] that is this you need to have [693] inputs and then uh you need to have [695] whatever your prompt is so this is an [697] example here where I just did um curly [699] brace inputs curly brace sorry um curly [703] brace quotes inputs end quote colon [707] quote the answer to the universe is end [709] quote right curly brace I'm going to run [711] this [712] puppy and the fact that it's taking [714] longer to respond now is a good sign [716] that's basically telling us that uh you [718] know it's running and indeed we got a [720] 200 status code there which is positive [721] if I go to data you'll see that there is [723] a generated text item then it says keep [726] in mind this is gpt2 so this is quite a [728] while ago a couple Generations the [729] answer of the universe is clearing out a [731] recent paper published by Wing Chun [733] International has picked up the Cold War [734] buzzwords for the WTC dust cloud can [736] promote an even more Visionary approach [737] to building a nuclear warhead so I don't [740] really know what the hell that means but [742] hey uh we're getting somewhere we've [744] actually called an API now but this is a [747] gpt2 model we don't actually care about [749] the gp2 gp22 model what we want is we [752] want um uh you know one one of these [755] models here so sdxl flash specifically [758] that's what I want so you can just copy [759] over this and then you can paste it in [762] the end there and I don't know if I need [765] the SD Community but we're going to give [767] it a [770] try it's taking a fair amount of time [772] which is a good sign I think the SD [774] Community was the right [777] call now keep in mind because this an [779] image generator it's not going to be [780] anywhere near as fast as a text [781] generator if you think about it you know [783] how many letters are there 26 well how [785] many possible color values are there [786] there are 256 * 256 * 256 right anyway [791] you end up getting a buffer with like a [794] binary um data if you guys watch my my [796] last video on this you'll know that all [798] that binary data is is it's just like [800] the type of thing that you want just [802] converted into a different language so [804] for instance I wanted an image file [806] instead of it giving me an image file it [808] gave me binary which is just like like a [810] translation of the image file you can [813] convert binary into an image file [815] extremely easily if you want to and the [817] way that you do this is the the simplest [820] way that I do it I should say is I go [822] onto Google Drive and then I click [824] upload a [826] file and I need to select the right one [829] here so I think I have to reconnect just [831] give me one [836] moment let's do this [840] and let's do [841] that I have to do so many connections [843] here just as part of the videos that I [845] record so sometimes I have too many on [847] the same account and then it kind of [848] kicks me out I have to redo it [850] all so I'm giving this permissions to my [853] Google account okay once you refresh the [864] connection it's going to ask you to um [867] basically pull data in from this data uh [872] variable here then you can call it [873] whatever file name you want I just want [875] like image dot I don't actually know [877] what kind of image it generates I don't [879] know if it's like a PNG or a JPG or [882] PNG yeah I think it's a PNG so we're [885] just going to save this like an [886] image.png just going to save this in the [888] root here and then uh we'll do that and [892] then I'm going to instead of this I'm [894] going to say um I don't [897] know handsome and [900] DSLR um closeup grizzled beard let's do [905] that then we'll run this once what the [908] upload a file module does is it'll just [910] take the binary that you have and then [912] convert it into um whatever the file [914] type is that you do the dot you know PNG [916] the the file ending uh and then it'll [919] put it on your Google Drive which will [920] make it accessible for any other flow [921] that you want which is quite helpful for [923] us cuz that's what we're going to be [924] using this for um to take a finished F [927] uh like file and then turn that into um [930] you know like a like a social media post [931] or whatever the Google Drive upload a [933] fall module and then out puts a web view [935] link so I'm going to copy that and paste [936] that into my [938] browser and then you can see we indeed [940] have a handsome grizzled looking man [941] here with a hell of a beard that this [943] more beard than I will ever be able to [944] grow in my life nice one man AI can do [947] that for us in a second huh rip um but [950] anyway okay great so now we have the [951] image uploaded basically in our Google [953] Drive which is pretty cool um you know [955] we verified that we can in fact use like [958] some end point on hugging face um to [961] quickly generate images that I [963] personally feel are probably higher [964] quality than the images that doll e [965] generates right now uh but you know that [967] probably won't remain true forever what [970] we need to do now is you know now I want [971] to show you guys an actual use case [973] where you might be able to employ the [974] hugging face API in your own flows to do [976] something that's like you know business [978] worthy um as I mentioned I'm going to [979] stick to the sdxl model here uh but you [983] can do the exact same thing that we just [984] did with any of these models all you [985] have to do is just copy this little um [988] endpoint and then just paste it in um on [991] top of like the root API which was this [993] one right here API inference huggingface [996] doco model SL whatever the heck you just [999] copied so now that we have the setup [1001] here I'm going to rename this module [1005] to um send API request to hugging face [1010] that might be a little bit long and then [1012] this is going to be convert image to [1017] PNG let's just say send request to [1019] hugging face actually let's just [1022] do there you go that should be pretty [1025] simple for anybody that's downloading [1026] this blueprint later um now I'm just [1028] going to go to a Google [1030] sheet I'm going to just search rows as I [1033] usually do um just to show you guys you [1034] know how you can iterate through [1036] multiple examples at the same time I'm [1037] going to connect this puppy and then we [1039] need to make a Google sheet so I'm going [1041] to go to the account that I know is [1044] connected [1045] here then I'm going to do a blank [1047] spreadsheet [1050] and then I'll just say social media [1053] posts I'll say um date I'll say [1064] um [1070] message I could do Platform but I'm [1072] going to leave platform out of it for [1073] now and now I need to actually go [1075] generate some social media posts so I'm [1076] just going to go to um open AI I'll say [1079] generate three short social media [1085] teasers for Green Day I'm going to [1089] pretend that this is for Green Day um [1091] I'll say we're posting these on [1095] Facebook along with a specific image [1098] that represents the environment or [1103] something uh let's make them longer [1105] [Music] [1108] there you go that looks good so we got [1110] our three posts here I'm just going to [1112] what was I going to say dump this in [1115] wonderful and then I'm going to remove [1120] this hypothetically we're just [1122] pretending that you know this is my [1123] social media calendar um the date for [1126] this one would [1128] be uh let's say the 5ifth the 6th and [1131] the seventh I don't know I don't think [1133] Green Day is actually is it called Green [1135] Day oh it's called Earth Day [1140] that's [1141] brutal man really showing my age [1144] there um okay that looks pretty good [1147] World Green Day I got to fix this man [1150] this is going to keep me up at night [1152] cannot believe I thought that Earth day [1154] was called Green [1157] Day yeah the environment's getting [1159] pretty angsty um anyway so we're going [1161] to pretend this is a bunch of post for [1162] earthday that we're posting uh today [1165] tomorrow and the next day and then what [1166] I'm going to do is I'm going to take [1168] these and then I'm going going to feed [1169] these through an AI model which will [1170] generate like an image request and then [1172] I'm going to use that image request uh [1174] with all the bells and whistles to turn [1175] that into an image and then I'm going to [1177] go on Facebook and then I'm going to [1179] post it now I'm not actually going to do [1180] the whole posting part I'm just going to [1181] show you how to set it all up because I [1183] don't want to post these to my Facebook [1185] page um it's not that I'm sure people [1187] don't care about Green Day all of my [1188] followers are obviously [1190] environmentalists and very altruistic [1193] and stuff but uh I'm just not going to [1195] do the actual posting but I'll show you [1196] how to do everything else [1199] okay great so first things first we're [1201] going to search these rows I'm just [1203] going to connect this to my uh social [1206] media calendar that's what it's [1211] called I'm going to select sheet one [1214] which is the name of the sheet that has [1215] the post that I want then for the [1218] purposes of this demo I'm just going to [1219] select maximum number of sheets one and [1222] then going to select this little bubble [1224] and then just see my post let's [1226] celebrate Earth Day by taking small [1227] steps that lead to big impacts whether [1229] it's recycling reducing ways planning [1230] trees every action counts go green # [1232] World Earth [1234] Day awesome what I'm going to do next is [1236] I'm going to actually create and this is [1238] a very common design pattern by the way [1240] I'm going to create an image sorry I'm [1241] going to create a prompt that I'm going [1243] to feed into the image model the reason [1245] why you have to do this is because if [1246] you think about it if I were just to [1247] feed in um that prompt back there let's [1250] celebrate Earth Day by doing whatever [1252] the image that's generated would not be [1253] very descriptive um so what I'm going to [1255] do is I'm going to like train a model [1258] basically to Output a prompt that I can [1260] then feed into another model and that [1262] will generate a much higher quality [1264] image than if I just you know feed in [1265] the prompt [1268] directly so I'm going to say you are a [1272] prompt [1273] generator for an image AI you take in a [1279] social media [1282] post you take in social media post [1285] copy and convert it into a detailed [1289] highquality description of an image you [1292] have creative license to [1296] choose an image [1299] prompt let's do prompt for an image you [1302] have creative license to choose an image [1303] prompt that represents the social media [1306] post now I'm going to train it once I'm [1309] going to go again user so we're doing a [1310] system prompt then a user prompt and [1312] then another user prompt where I give it [1314] an example um let's go back to my [1316] assistant and just get it to generate [1318] one more more so we're going to go over [1319] here and then um I'll just say one [1323] more and it's Earth [1326] Day okay great uh and then I'm going to [1328] go back over here feed this [1332] in and then generally speaking um for [1336] something like this you're going to want [1337] to [1338] generate like [1341] uh [1342] beautiful [1346] picture of the Rocky [1350] mountains high [1352] quality [1355] DSLR [1357] um let's say [1360] detailed uh let's say [1363] bokeh we'll do landscape [1367] photography um I don't know you're just [1369] going to want to generate like a we're [1372] going to pick a thing to generate and [1374] then we're going to do a bunch of like [1375] descriptor terms which improve the [1376] quality of the generation [1379] um we'll go [1380] artistic uh we'll go [1383] colorful and then that should be good [1386] sharp we'll do sharp as well and then [1388] for the user input I'm just going to now [1390] feed in the [1393] message and then I'm going to send the [1395] image request to hug andface and the way [1397] that I'm going to do that is the prompt [1398] that I'm feeding in is now going to be [1400] the result from the previous gp4 [1404] module then we're going to take that [1406] image convert into PNG and then why [1408] don't we plug this [1411] in to a social media flow actually let's [1414] generate the image first and then we'll [1415] worry about plugging in the social media [1417] flow [1419] after so let's see the prompt that it [1422] generated an inspiring image of a group [1423] of diverse people planting trees in a [1425] lush green park with bright hopeful [1426] sunlight filtering through the leaves [1427] the genius should evoke a sense of [1428] community environmental stewardship and [1430] positive action include visual elements [1432] like recycling bins people holding [1433] reasonable bags and children [1434] participating to highlight the [1435] collective effort of sustainability so [1437] that's okay it's not the perfect prompt [1439] but uh the thing that I'm worried about [1440] here is the fact that it outputed a [1443] quote so it looks like that's fine the [1445] quote worked all right you know [1447] sometimes if you do two quotes it sort [1449] of cancels it [1450] out then I do not have oh sorry I double [1453] clicked web content link what you want [1454] is web view [1456] link let's give that a click awesome [1459] this looks uh pretty good um [1462] realistically if you're doing this you [1463] should probably stay away from people [1464] because people you know sort of Do The [1466] Uncanny Valley effect so I really like [1469] what's going on here but just because [1471] I'm going to be sharing this blueprint [1472] I'm going to edit the prompt a little [1474] bit and I'll say don't create any [1480] prompts with people in them people [1483] elicit an uncanny valley [1490] effect okay that looks good I could add [1493] a few more examples here if I wanted it [1495] to be like perfect uh perfectly similar [1497] to the prompt that I had before but I'm [1500] not extremely worried uh what I will do [1502] is I'll change the temp a little bit so [1504] that it doesn't just go off kilter [1507] completely and then we'll try that [1511] again again the reason why I'm showing [1513] you all this and not just skipping to [1514] the finished product is because um this [1516] is the exact workflow that I would do if [1517] I were building a social media [1518] automation like this I would test look [1521] at the results iterate test look at the [1523] results iterate I do this probably 5 to [1525] 10 times until I'm satisfied with what I [1526] get because of how I've tested this flow [1529] from um sort of like the end part back [1531] to the beginning part I'm confident that [1533] everything here works and then it's just [1534] a matter of steering correctly at the [1536] very front of the flow this is my [1538] methodology most times when I'm Building [1539] Systems like this I find it's just way [1541] more effective than I don't know trying [1543] to wireframe the system in Whimsical or [1545] something I did the same mistake there [1547] you don't want web content link you want [1549] web view [1551] link okay this looks great to me this is [1553] more or less exactly what I was thinking [1555] about this is quite stylized which is [1556] nice it's like a a painting style you [1558] could totally see this on a Facebook [1560] post about Green [1561] Day World Earth Day okay what I'm going [1564] to do now is I'm going to post this on [1566] Facebook um I spent like 3 minutes [1568] thinking about this but I'm actually [1569] going to post this on my real Facebook [1570] profile just because I want to show you [1571] guys how the flow works and what it [1572] looks like in practice so in order to do [1574] this go over to Facebook pages that's [1577] the module that you [1578] want a little click and then what we [1582] want is create a post with photos [1588] you're going to have to do your Facebook [1590] connection of course um the page that [1592] I'm going to do is 1 second copy that's [1594] my writing business and then what we [1596] want is we don't actually want to upload [1597] this photo we want to download sorry we [1599] don't want to download the photo from [1600] you we want to upload the image and it's [1602] the exact same thing that we did [1603] previously where we um fed in the binary [1606] data from this [1608] buffer here and then the file name uh [1611] I'm just going to call this like [1614] image.png you can have ai generate a [1617] caption for you with as well if you [1619] think about it logically what we could [1620] have done is we could have went back to [1622] that AI module and then we could have [1625] had it um output in Json [1628] instead so maybe it would have been like [1631] I don't know like [1634] prompt and then we would have had [1636] another one called caption where it [1638] generates the caption um but for the [1640] purposes of this I'm not going to [1641] complicate it just keep in mind you can [1643] always do that when you're querying for [1646] a piece of information um and you're [1649] just doing in plain text just know that [1650] you can always wrap little Json notation [1653] around it and then have it generate like [1654] three or four properties that are [1655] related to it basically no extra token [1657] cost maybe like an extra one tenth of a [1659] cent every 50 requests or something and [1662] then the last parameter here that's [1663] that's useful for us is this date [1665] parameter so Facebook actually allows [1667] you to automatically schedule your posts [1669] and if you remember way back when when I [1671] was setting up this Google sheet I set [1673] up a date field so I could feed the date [1675] field in here and then it would schedule [1677] my posts for the future when that date [1679] arrives I'm not actually going to do [1680] this cuz I want to show you guys what [1681] this looks like right now but just keep [1683] in mind you know if you want to feed in [1685] that date parameter uh you may have to [1686] do some formatting I'm not entirely sure [1688] if it accepts the DayDay SL Monon Monon [1691] year year year might accept a time stamp [1693] or something instead but whatever okay [1695] great so now we are searching our Google [1697] Sheets row we're now sending the image [1699] request to hug and face we're converting [1700] the image to a PNG simply so that we [1703] have a backup of it in case we need it [1708] and this better be a damn good image [1711] this one's taking its sweet ass [1712] time this may be because [1715] of volume on the [1718] endpoint uh and then we're creating our [1720] Facebook post and that looks successful [1722] I'm just going to go back to my Facebook [1724] page this is my Facebook page here for [1725] one second copy we have an astounding [1729] 152 likes and then if we scroll down [1732] here we'll see the post that was [1733] generated all righty thanks so much for [1735] watching this video guys hope you [1736] enjoyed learning how to use hugg and [1737] face in on flows keep in mind that we [1739] could have used basically any endpoint [1741] that we wanted here we could have used [1742] that mistal really fast text responder [1744] we could have generated some anime wuss [1746] whatever the hell you guys want to do [1748] you can with hugging face and I didn't [1749] really break down the costs in this [1751] video but feel free to head over to [1752] their pricing just to get an indication [1753] of what like API inference um calls are [1756] they're usually substantially cheaper [1757] than gp4 or uh you know some of the [1760] other big models out there that can that [1762] can cost us a fair amount of money when [1763] we run them a volume if you guys have [1765] any questions about this video just [1766] leave a comment down below more than to [1768] get to it at some point otherwise do all [1770] that fun YouTube stuff like subscribe [1771] and I'll catch you in the next one [1773] thanks

Title: How to Automate Webflow CMS Content With Make.com
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here in [1] this video I'm going to show you how to [2] post content automatically onto webflow [4] using make.com there are a number of [7] gotchas in web flow specifically related [9] to its text formatting that have made [10] this very difficult for a lot of people [12] I am here to dispel those myths [13] completely I'm also going to be talking [15] about some Advanced automation Concepts [16] today like buffers uh and basically just [19] some some future proofing that you can [22] do to ensure that your make.com skills [23] always stay ahead of the curve if you [24] guys want to get a handle on webflow [27] andm make.com improve your automation [29] skills a little bit about buffers text [30] formatting all that stuff then this is [32] the video for you stay tuned and let's [33] get into [37] it so two reasons why I'm doing this [39] video the first is webflow has a lot of [41] gotas when you try and publish content [44] automatically whether or not you're [45] using make or just their API or zappy or [47] whatever web flows formatting can be [50] pretty tricky and so in this video I'm [51] going to show you how to convert from my [53] preferred format which is just a Google [55] doc um into a format that is perfect for [58] web flow and that allows you to get like [60] nice headings get things like nicely [62] spaced and that sort of deal U basically [64] if I just go on a web plus site that [66] I've whipped up here click through one [67] of their blog post you'll see that I [69] have these beautiful headings the [70] spacing is perfect I have bullet points [72] I have all that stuff so I'll show you [73] how to do that uh and the second reason [75] I'm doing this is because I actually [77] show in my community um essentially like [79] a method to build a whole automation [81] agency within 14 days and the very first [83] video was me building an automation [85] agency site in less than an hour but I [87] did it on web flow so just yesterday I [89] post posted another video showing people [91] how to Syndicate content in WordPress [92] and I had a bunch of people in my [93] community be like yo Nick we're building [95] this stuff out in webflow can you make a [96] video for how to do it on that as well [98] so that's sort of the inspiration for [99] this um pretty straightforward stuff I'm [102] being honest and if you watch the [103] WordPress video you're probably 70 or [104] 80% of the way there I just know the web [106] flow is a very different platform and so [108] they require different formatting and [110] you know we have to be a little bit [111] smarter about how we're how we're going [112] to lay the content out I'm also going to [114] show you how to get images um I'm not [115] going to be AI generating these images [117] I'll just be using a very again another [119] hack that I use for um unsplash it [121] allows us to generate or rather pull [123] stock images that are overwhelmingly [125] likely to be relevant to whatever it is [127] that you're blogging about um and and [129] you can just plug and play this into any [131] blogging flow you don't need to like you [133] know the purpose of my systems is [135] usually just to be as high RI as [136] possible and fast and easy to implement [138] as possible so this is just like the [140] quick and dirty super slick way um you [143] know to to to put a blog post with an [145] image together in web [146] flow okay without further Ado let's get [148] into it uh we're going to be pulling [150] from this content calendar it's the same [151] content calendar that I was pulling from [152] before essentially what this is is this [154] is a title a word count primary keyword [157] secondary keyword internal link external [159] link additional instructions then we [161] have an outline Dock and then we have an [163] article doc so if I click through this [165] article doc for um Ai and process [168] automation expectations versus reality [170] we see here that we have a Google [172] document that was created um by AI an AI [175] system that I generated uh quite a while [177] ago um and then this AI system wrote an [179] article on on this topic what we're [180] going to be doing is we're basically [181] going to be taking this and then putting [182] it on a web flow and you know there are [183] a bunch of like plugins and stuff like [185] that that do this for you but they're [186] paid I'm going to show you how to do it [187] in a way that's basically free aside [189] from the make.com operations and also [191] infinitely scalable which is pretty cool [193] so the goal is we want to get this puppy [196] on this puppy well how do we do it [198] obviously we're going to be doing this [199] in make so let me just pop open a [200] make.com scenario [203] here I have insufficient rights make.com [207] is taking my rights away um okay so I'm [210] going to call the scenario let's just do [212] like Google sheet to [214] webflow [218] blog uh maybe we'll do search Google [221] sheet row post on webflow blog okay [224] great so that's number one uh number two [226] Let me just show you what actually [227] posting on webflow looks like if you [229] click on this button and then type [230] webflow you'll see that they have an [232] entire Suite essentially an entire [234] family of uh modules that you can use to [236] do a variety of things not necessarily [238] just publish a Blog but you can do [240] things like get a site you can publish [242] sites automatically um you can get items [245] create items that's what we're going to [246] be doing you can add products um add SKS [249] if you're running like the e-commerce [250] offer that they have create folders form [253] submissions and then you can also make [255] an API call and if you go to the webflow [258] API this is probably one of like the [260] dopest apis of all time it's huge you [261] have just so many different things you [262] could do um so the fact they allow you [264] to do all this stuff is pretty sick if [266] I'm being honest and we're going to be [268] using a very small fraction of that but [270] what I'm going to do here is because [271] what we're doing is we are updating a [273] collection that's technically what this [274] is called inside of a collection [276] collections are made of items what we're [278] going to be doing is we're going to be [279] um essentially creating an item inside [281] of a collection and that collection is [283] going to be our blog post collection so [285] you don't need to know too much about [287] this it's quite self-explanatory but for [288] now just use the create an item um [291] endpoint so if you do this you're going [293] to have to connect to your web flow um [295] you know you're going to have to make [296] your web flow connection and I have [298] another scenario editor open here so I'm [300] just doing this to show you guys what [301] this looks like you have to click save [303] and then you're going to have to log [304] into your webflow [306] site and then down here you're going to [308] have to authorize I'm going to go to [309] workflow Loop which is the name of my [310] website and I'm going to authorize [312] that now um if it says request failed or [316] something don't worry that happens [317] sometimes uh the the connector isn't [319] perfect um all you do is you exit out of [321] it and the connection will still have [322] occurred now we're going to choose the [324] site and I'm going to be choosing my [325] site workflow [326] Loop and then I can choose my collection [329] now the template that I use to create my [331] website has a bunch of collections built [333] in you have like careers work categories [335] team members um collections are [337] basically just sort of like a like an [338] abstraction that it's like your own [340] little database that allows you to [342] create um templated content for each [344] element in the collection like for [346] instance uh you know instead of me [348] manually creating the element for every [350] individual team member I can now just [352] create um one element for team members [354] and then I can just populate that with [355] all of the team members in my team [357] members collection so it's my own way of [358] like basically making like a a data type [361] if that makes sense any who uh what I'm [363] going to be doing is I'm going to be [364] adding to the collection blog [367] posts and then you'll see that webo [369] reveals a bunch of fields to you like [370] name data publishing [373] author category thumbnail image this is [376] going to be important post summary and [378] then post body as well there's also slug [380] I believe if we don't put a slug in [381] it'll just automatically generate one [382] for you so we're not going to be putting [383] a slug in I'm going I'm going to try [385] that out but you'll you'll see that if [387] you click on these most of these fields [388] are required and in make.com anytime a [391] field is bolded like the title here like [392] collection is bolded uh that means that [394] it you know is something that is [395] required for the scenario to work so [397] we're actually going to have to go [397] through and we're going to have to add [398] all of these fields for now because I [401] just want to show you guys what an [402] example post looks like I'm just going [403] to go this is an example the date of [406] publishing I'm just going to choose now [408] so I'm going to go over to my calendar [409] and then go to variables click now for [412] author I'm just going to pick a random [413] person here um it's pulling the author [415] from the list of team members which [416] makes perfect sense so um this is a [418] template where there was a team member [419] called Diane Russell and that's what I'm [420] selecting category I'm just going to [422] hardcode this as entrepreneurship for [423] now thumbnail image uh I'm just going to [427] go to unsplash because we're going to be [428] using unsplash to do my cute little hack [430] as I [431] mentioned and then I'm just going to [432] open this image in new tab and then I'm [434] just going to copy this image URL in and [436] that that's sufficient there's not going [438] to be any alternate text so this is an [441] example post summary this is an example [444] article body and I'm not going to do a [447] slug because as I mentioned I want to [449] test this [450] so now we have our create an item module [452] ready all I'm going to do is right click [453] it and click run this module only this [454] is only going to run that module not [456] like there are too many other modules [457] let's be real um but this will be [458] sufficient for our purposes and then [460] what you end up with is you end up with [463] a basically just recapping all the [465] fields that you added now is the [467] variable that I put in it's saying that [469] it is June 4 2024 at 7:31 p.m. that's [471] probably because uh the time zone for [473] this is in like Vancouver and I'm out [475] here in Calgary so it's about an hour [477] difference just verifying all the [478] information here that I've uploaded [480] which is neat but let's actually go into [482] web flow and see it for ourselves so I'm [484] going to exit out of all of these things [488] and go right over here this is just a [490] blog post that I did when I was testing [491] this out and then if you're unfamiliar [494] with the web flow layout that's okay you [495] don't have to be um I'll just head over [497] to the CMS button and then blog [501] post and then it's telling me I don't [503] have any because I need to refresh this [504] I've essentially automatically been [505] signed out um and it does that for [507] security purposes let me just resign in [511] good Lord I have too many password [514] managers okay so um we want to go to the [517] CMS and then go to blog post and then [519] the one that we just published was this [521] is an example so it was created June 4th [524] uh 10:31 p.m because this is in a [526] different time zone I got a lot of time [527] zones but you'll see that it says this [529] is an example this is an example this is [531] an example article body this is an [532] example post summary then we have our [533] image as well with our category author [535] all that stuff if we actually want to [536] see this live um just for the [538] demonstrative purposes I'm going to I'm [539] going to go to page I'm going to discard [541] these changes I'll go to page and then [543] blog and then you'll see this is the [545] blog post that I just [547] uploaded and if [549] I click on this blog post we'll go to a [552] Blog Page where I can see just the image [554] and then the body and then you know [555] there's some templated features here [557] like the the name of the team member is [559] here and then there's a related blog [560] section down below okay so this is [563] pretty cool right we just built a very [565] simple oneclick manual automation which [567] manual automation is a funny term what [569] oxymoron but we built like a oneclick [572] you know um uh to run automation that [574] creates an article called this is an [577] example and that's not super helpful but [579] there are a couple other things that we [580] need to do in order to make this work [582] what you'll notice is down here just as [584] this is an example article body so the [586] question then becomes okay like what if [588] we want different types of text what if [589] we want like a header H1 and H2 and H3 [591] what if we want like bullet points right [593] how do we represent that in a format [594] that web flow understands uh and [596] unfortunately webflow only takes in HTML [599] it doesn't take in markdown it doesn't [600] take in any really other format and so [602] in order to make the content work for [604] webflow we basically need to take [605] whatever the content is and then convert [607] it into HTML and then post it on webflow [611] um so you know if I go to my Google doc [613] that I had earlier this content calendar [615] and then I go to this article [618] doc like this text here um this is an [622] HTML like if we wanted this to work in [625] web flow we'd basically need to find a [626] way to do this oops good God my typing [629] Port today this would be like an H2 this [632] would be like a back SL H2 right we need [635] to go through all of the the article [637] essentially and then um add these these [640] tags and in the previous video on [642] WordPress I showed a way that you could [643] use AI to do this and I think the way to [645] do AI is cool I'm just going to show you [647] another way to do it um that I think is [649] a little bit more procedural and that [650] saves you from having to maybe like [652] spend AI credits on digesting a large [654] chunk of text and this this way works [657] just as well um some would probably [658] consider working better since it retains [660] the exact format of the initial text uh [663] that's that's what I'm going to do next [665] so you know why don't we why don't we do [668] this just for demonstrative purposes why [670] don't I get a Google doc and let me just [673] show you what this looks like if I were [674] to um try and just publish this Google [677] doc as is I'm going to hard code the ID [679] in uh you can get a Google doc ID by [681] going after the back slash um D backlash [684] and then before the backlash edit so I'm [687] just going to go to this make scenario [688] and then I'm going to get the document [690] ID the count I'm going to be using is [693] probably this one I don't actually [696] know let me see we have to do some [699] connecting [703] here yes um and then I [708] should oh oh man I think I wrote the [710] wrong email there that's funny whatever [712] um let me just get the content of this [714] document so I got the content of this [715] document um we have the article title we [717] have the body we have this big content [719] object just super long and very [722] overwhelming really the the one that we [724] have and the one that most people are [725] going to want to use is this text [726] content here where there's like an H1 it [729] says 10 effective voice in nurture [730] mental health at work back slh1 right [732] this is the change that I just made to [733] this article um and I'm I'm pulling it [735] in so you know if we just try and dump [737] this directly into webflow as is and I'm [740] just going to do this as an example um [743] let me take the H1s out so you can see [745] what it's going to look like this isn't [748] enough we're just going to get a bunch [750] of ugly text laid out all over the place [753] you know so if I go down to [756] um text content just pump it in and then [759] run [761] on the element that we have now created [763] in our web flow um [766] blog if I go back to my CMS and then go [769] to blog post here's now seven items uh [771] it just looks like [772] this what we really want is we want oops [775] no we do not want that hold on what we [778] really we want is we want this and then [782] we want you know this and we want to do [786] that for basically all the headings and [787] the text we want to do that for all the [788] bullet points and yada yada um so the [791] way that we're going to do this is uh [793] it's going to be pretty [794] straightforward uh first things first I [796] just have a bunch of these so I'm just [798] going to close them all make my life a [799] little bit easier first things first um [801] what I'm going to do is I'm just going [802] to test this using the um one Google doc [805] whose IDE I know and I'm hard coding and [807] then after I'll show you how to like um [809] take one step back and Abstract it away [811] to a list of Google docs like on this [812] sheet but first things first is get [814] content of a document module this is the [816] module that the vast majority of people [817] use to deal with Google Docs we're not [819] actually going to be using that we're [820] going to be using one called download a [822] document instead which is pretty neat [823] and the reason why uh I haven't really [825] talked about this yet in any of my [827] videos is because it makes use of binary [829] and binary is uh a lot of the time like [833] a very difficult concept for people to [834] understand and you know most people [835] don't want to have anything to do with [837] it um I like to stay away from wherever [839] possible because it just over [840] complicates my life but uh you know in [843] this video I'll show you how to use it [847] basically um the download a document in [851] contrast to the get a content of a [853] document allows you to hard code a doc [855] just like I did before so if I grab this [858] and then I paste this in here um what [861] we're going to be doing is we're going [861] to be downloading an HTML version of [863] this document that looks like this if I [867] click run this module only instead of me [869] getting the content I'm actually [870] downloading it you'll see the only two [872] Fields here are file name and then data [875] and data is this huge string or [877] basically huge buffer filled with binary [879] which is really really ugly and you know [881] most people don't know how to do [882] anything with it well uh if I could just [884] peel back the curtain a little bit all [886] that binary really is is it's just like [888] another format of your data and you can [891] convert between binary and then all of [892] the other formats text number string PDF [896] uh you know MP4 whatever um as long as [898] you have have the correct function and [900] so what this is is this is basically the [902] HTML content of my of my document it's [905] just this is translated into a language [907] that I'm I'm currently unable to [909] understand or view but what we can do is [910] we can take this and then translate that [911] back into HTML and so that's what we're [913] going to be doing in the set multiple [914] variables module so I'm going to be [916] calling this just HTML and then all I [918] need to do is I just need to wrap this [920] binary data in the two string function [923] and it will take the data which is [924] currently in the format binary it'll [926] convert it into a readable string for me [929] um and ultimately for web flow so if I [931] click on this set multiple variables [933] module now you'll see that I've taken [934] all of those weird numbers and and [936] hexadecimal figures and I've turned them [939] back into HTML which is what I have [942] here and it's very long HTML and it's [945] not actually going to work for our [947] purposes um which is why you need to do [949] a couple of hacks like I'm going to show [950] you uh but it is HTML nonetheless so [953] that's pretty neat now uh what I'll do [956] is I'll show you what this looks like if [957] you just dump this in a web flow and [959] it's still not going to work and then [960] I'll show you how to how to fix it and [961] how to make it [963] nice so I'm just going to dump in the [965] post body here and then I'm going to say [968] this is an example HTML article we're [973] going to run [974] once it's going to do the whole flow so [976] it's going to download the document it's [977] going to convert it from buffer um from [979] binary and the buffer into HTML then [982] it's going to create the item in web [983] flow and if [985] I discard these changes and then um [989] refresh the CMS we'll see that we [993] have uh oh I guess my mine hasn't [996] actually popped up I'm I need to just [997] refresh [1000] totally let's go back to the CMS here [1003] okay we have our this is an example HTML [1005] article and then what you see is we have [1007] the headings and stuff like that but we [1009] also have a bunch of silly stuff that [1010] looks really dumb and what this is this [1012] is basically like CSS styling and if I [1015] go to my blog post here oops if I go to [1018] the blog [1021] post and then just give it a little [1024] click you'll see that this looks really [1026] ugly you know it's closer to what we [1028] want than what we had before but it's [1030] still pretty ugly and you know it kind [1031] of like doesn't take any of the style [1034] that the rest of the web plus site has [1036] it's sort of spaced out weirdly um it's [1038] weird indents you know things aren't um [1041] the lines aren't very pretty if you [1043] contrast that at the beginning of this [1044] video where I showed you like a stock [1045] article one was that was just templated [1047] you know there's a lot to be uh lot is [1049] left to be desired and so the way that [1051] we're going to fix this is we are going [1052] to do a couple of very interesting [1058] procedures so the first thing that I'm [1060] going to do is I'm going to take this um [1063] string this [1067] HTML and then I'm going to and you can [1070] do this um not just for this use case I [1072] do this stuff all the time it's going to [1074] seem pretty silly but you can convert [1077] the HTML to to [1080] markdown so we're going to feed in this [1082] HTML converter to [1083] markdown and then I'm just going to run [1085] this and show you guys what that looks [1086] like markdown is another language [1088] similar to HTML that just has different [1090] formatting um instead of you doing like [1092] a a colon H1 or left carrot H1 and then [1096] right carrot and then you know backslash [1098] thing to do the H1 it's just like a [1100] number sign so you save a few characters [1102] which makes it really useful for [1103] artificial intelligence applications [1105] with these large language models um but [1107] you see you know that the the format [1109] is similar right it's the same sort of [1111] idea you know one um number sign for an [1113] H1 two number signs for an H2 that that [1115] sort of thing so what we have now is we [1117] have everything in markdown format but [1119] what we can do now is now we can very [1121] quickly and easily um process the string [1124] in make because it's just a lot simpler [1125] for us to do so uh and then what we can [1127] do is we can take that markdown we can [1129] reconvert it back in HTML and that's [1131] going to look perfect and it's going to [1132] work really well um so that's what I'm [1134] going to be doing [1136] here essentially we have this HTML to [1138] mark down right I'm going to be feeding [1140] this back into a markdown HTML module [1141] but what I'm going to do is for the [1143] purposes of this I'm going to test this [1146] out I'm just going to paste all this in [1149] what we're going to do is we are going [1151] to take all of this text and then we are [1153] going to um remove all of this styling [1156] stuff up at the top so that when we [1158] reconvert it back in HTML it only has [1160] like the the number signs and that's [1162] going to make an H1 this is going to be [1164] an H2 this is going to be an H2 there's [1166] going to be bullet points just going to [1167] look a lot prettier [1169] so what we have to do is we have to feed [1170] in that markdown and then if you click [1172] on this you'll notice that there's a [1173] pattern here that this is always going [1175] to follow basically um what I'm going to [1177] do is I'm going to split this string and [1179] a lot of people would probably split [1180] this just by like uh I don't know like [1183] the presence of this hashtag but I'm [1184] going to be a little bit more precise [1185] I'm going to do it by the presence of [1187] this hashtag then I'm going to do two [1188] number lines and then I'm going to do [1189] the presence of this like left curly [1191] bracket and that's just going to enable [1193] me to basically um take this which I [1195] think is quite unique it's the [1197] likelihood of this reoccurring in [1199] uh one of the articles that I'm I'm [1200] doing is extremely small um and then it [1203] it enables me to like hone in on that [1205] and split only that and then I can [1206] regenerate the rest later so I'm going [1207] to take this mark down and then I'm [1209] going to split it by the presence of I [1211] think it was a left curly bracket and [1214] then a new line and new line and then uh [1217] number sign and then I'm going to split [1220] it that [1222] way and then I'm going to run this and I [1224] just want to see what pops up [1227] here so [1229] so oh sorry I used a markdown HTML [1232] module I shouldn't be doing that I [1233] should use a um one of [1236] these uh we need to use the set variable [1238] here so recreate this I'm going to call [1241] instead of convert to HTML I'll say [1244] strip [1245] CSS what I'm going to do is I'm going to [1247] take this markdown and then do that [1249] split again so split that markdown by [1251] the presence of this and then two new [1254] lines and then um one of these yeah we [1259] can actually do the text processing and [1260] the mark down to HTML [1262] module so what we have now is we have [1264] HTML and then we have an array with two [1266] objects the first is this CSS which was [1268] sort of mucking up our style and it [1270] looks really ugly and then the second is [1271] the actual article now I used the [1274] hashtag as a character to do the [1276] splitting with so it's removed it but we [1278] can just like regenerate it pretty [1280] easily what we want to do is we only [1281] want to get the second result and then [1283] I'm just going to regenerate the um [1285] hashtag by adding it here and then doing [1287] a space so now if I run this once this [1290] will be in perfect U markdown format and [1293] now if I pass this into my markdown my [1296] HTML to or sorry markdown to HTML module [1298] here oh this is also called HTML so let [1301] me say stript [1303] HTML let's see stripped markdown it's a [1306] more descriptive term and then we want [1308] seven stripped markdown you can't see it [1311] because I need to reconnect the module [1312] but this is just a quick hack that [1313] allows us to do it [1315] faster okay now what we have is We have [1318] basically taken the um markdown and [1321] we've converted it just into like [1322] vanilla HTML which doesn't have all of [1324] the other information that the first [1326] HTML um had which was all the way back [1328] over here and this first HTML just [1331] looked really ugly it had all these [1332] weird Styles it was just this was the [1334] reason why our um you know our our our [1337] web flow stuff wasn't working but it's [1338] sort of like hidden behind the scenes [1340] right uh but now we just have like no [1342] style characters no nothing it's just [1344] the pure H2S and then it's even done the [1346] favor of um attaching IDs to all of the [1349] headings so that if we wanted to like [1350] hyperlink them later we could and that's [1352] just you know makes vanilla marked down [1353] to HTML [1355] processor so now if we take this article [1358] and then we pump this in to post [1361] body and run this completely and let me [1363] just change the title here so I can this [1368] is a beautiful [1372] properly formatted HTM article now um it [1377] will look gorgeous [1380] I'm going to go back here to my web FL [1383] site I'll just go back to blog for [1386] now and then I need to refresh uh the [1389] CMS actually so let me go back to blog [1392] post um now we see that we have all [1394] those nice sexy headings and then if we [1397] go back to this blog post here and then [1400] I got to refresh the [1405] page we'll see that uh we have this [1407] beautiful proper formatted HTML article [1409] if I give it a click we now have all the [1411] text um basically looking exactly like [1413] how we want it to H2S are huge right [1416] granted I'm realizing that if we have [1417] the title up here we're probably not [1418] going to need this title so that might [1420] be something that we can fix right now [1422] but uh the rest of this is is quite nice [1424] we have the bullet points we have like [1425] the the number signs uh everything is is [1428] nice and taken care of and just part of [1430] the style of our of our template which [1432] is what we wanted initially okay now [1434] while I'm still do while I'm still here [1436] I'm going to like make a couple of [1437] additional edits to this and I'm just [1438] going to make the flow a little bit [1439] sexier uh I'm going to get the title in [1442] and then I'm going to show you guys how [1443] to generate or pull relevant images so [1446] first things first why don't we fix that [1449] title we need this to be 10 effective [1452] ways to nurture whatever right so we [1454] basically want this to be the title of [1456] the [1456] piece uh we could do some text [1459] formatting on this yeah it's probably [1462] simpler okay that's that's much simpler [1464] if the format of this is going to be the [1466] same as that all the time then that's [1467] pretty easy [1469] so what I'm going to do is I'm going to [1469] feed in the file name here which is an A [1472] and then it's a colon and then it's the [1473] title of whatever we want and then [1475] afterwards it's a HTML so what we want [1477] to do is uh I'm just going to split this [1480] at the um colon [1484] space so I'll do colon and then I'll do [1488] space and then I want to get the second [1492] result and then I want to split this [1494] again at the HTML and then I want to get [1496] the first result this may look like [1498] black black magic to you but you can [1500] just pause the video and run through the [1501] logic unless I screwed up in which case [1503] uh I will eat my words but this is just [1506] going to um allow us to extract the [1508] specific part of the file name that we [1509] care about okay the data publishing now [1512] that seems correct to me um category I [1514] mean you can just set up the categories [1516] however you want you could for instance [1517] have like a category column here in the [1519] Google Doc uh in the Google sheet or [1521] something that allows you to generate [1523] this um so I'm not going to worry too [1524] much about that I'm just going to cck [1525] entrepreneurship let's talk about the [1527] thumbnail image what a lot of people [1529] don't realize is unsplash one of the [1531] best stock photo image resources on [1533] planet Earth has like a very sneaky [1536] hidden feature where if you type source. [1539] unsplash.com random and then you put a [1541] question mark and you put whatever you [1544] want and then press enter it will [1546] actually go and generate or pull an [1548] image from their API that corresponds to [1550] your search term and so what we can do [1552] is we can actually employ this in web [1555] flow to pull a random image every time [1558] we um create a blog post even if you [1560] know we don't have an image in our blog [1562] post at all this saves us from having to [1564] do the manual step of maybe getting [1566] somebody to go and pull an image uh [1568] because now we can just use uh you know [1570] this this feature so I could just type [1572] in business here or something like that [1574] or you know I could pull in from my [1575] keywords I could do um I don't know just [1579] like the primary keyword uh that might [1581] be a little bit rough just because I [1582] don't know how many stock photos have a [1584] tag called process automation [1585] realistically so I'm probably just going [1587] to do business uh but this will still [1589] enable us to basically have like a new [1591] post that is business e every time and [1592] I'll show you what that looks like in a [1594] second post summary uh there are a [1596] couple things that you can do to [1597] generate post summaries one you could [1599] automatic like you could have it in the [1600] Google sheet as I mentioned earlier as a [1601] column U or you could just have ai take [1604] the article and then like generate a [1605] post summary and so that's what I did in [1607] the previous um video that I did on [1609] WordPress so I'm just going to do the [1610] same thing here I'm going to go to open [1612] Ai and just add a completion at the very [1615] end here and then I'm just going to do [1618] 496 Max tokens GPT 40 will be my model [1622] and then the role will be system I'm [1624] going to have it identify as a helpful [1625] intelligent writing assistant is is what [1627] I always [1628] do although make sure if you make it [1630] identify as a helpful intelligent [1631] writing assistant it doesn't screw up [1633] the word writing or assistant uh and [1635] then I'm going to say [1637] read the following [1639] article and write a [1642] short um one [1645] sentence summary [1648] this summary will be posted on our [1654] blog write nothing except for the [1657] summary then I'm going to go to user and [1659] I'll say article I'm just going to feed [1661] in the strip markdown because that seems [1663] pretty simple to me and then we'll just [1665] await the uh the assistant response and [1668] then down here I'm just going to pump in [1670] that summary to the post summary page or [1674] post summary field using the result [1676] variable that pretty good to me okay why [1680] don't we run through this and see what [1682] this looks [1683] like should get the title correctly [1687] unless I'm a I might just be an [1690] idiot okay yeah it looks like the name [1692] was correct so 10 effective way cerg [1693] mental health at work the post summary [1695] was to Foster mental wellness and boost [1696] productivity this guide outlines 10 [1698] effective strategies for creating a [1699] mentally healthy work environment that [1701] sounds like a great summary to me then [1703] if I go back to web flow if I go back to [1707] our blog here oh I keep on forgetting [1711] where I am in web flow it's pretty [1714] embarrassing then if I refresh this [1718] puppy you will see that we now have a [1720] new blog post and we have automatically [1723] generated or pulled an image from [1725] unsplash that looks fantastic for our [1728] article 10 effective ways to nurture [1729] mental health at work which even [1730] includes this little excerpt which is [1732] nice when you click on [1734] it you have the oh yeah sorry we didn't [1737] fix that I'll fix that right now um but [1739] we have the entire article which is [1740] nicely formatted with the headings and [1742] with uh you know the formatting that I [1744] was talking about before bullet points [1745] and all that stuff okay great so while [1748] I'm at it let me just uh fix this and [1749] the way that I'm going to pull the title [1751] out of the the text so that the only [1754] title is up here is I'm just going to do [1756] some some text splitting we know that [1761] the markdown [1764] here [1766] um let me think [1768] we could just pull like the second line [1772] only we could just take out the first [1774] line so we could go up until a new line [1779] and then we could just remove it that's [1781] something that we could do actually now [1782] that I think about it an easier way to [1784] do this would probably be just to strip [1785] out the H1 so I could just go split [1790] this and then I [1794] could split it at the presence of this [1797] H1 [1799] then I could [1803] get no sorry the presence of this [1805] backsplash back slh1 and then I could [1807] just get the second [1809] result because then I would [1813] get um only the stuff that I want and [1817] because I'm doing it in the HTML not in [1819] the uh markdown I'm not going to have to [1822] make use of any new lines which is nice [1824] okay so that should solve my problem so [1826] while I'm fixing that I'm also just [1827] going going to plug this into our Google [1829] sheet instead so I'm going to go to [1831] sheets and then what I'm going to do is [1833] I'm just going to go search [1834] rows I'll make this the beginning of my [1836] scenario instead of the Google Doc [1838] module the reason for this is because I [1839] would just want to show you how to [1840] iterate through [1841] multiple so uh I need to click here and [1844] I need to find the sheet that I am [1846] interested in in order for that to work [1847] I'm probably going to have to uh what's [1850] this content [1851] calendar just going to have to match [1853] this up the sheet name I want is sheet [1856] one maximum number return rows for now [1858] is just going to be [1860] one and let's just run this and see what [1862] we get okay we get the article and then [1866] the thing that's relevant to us down [1867] here is this [1868] um uh article doc and we're going to [1871] extract the ID of the article doc and [1873] then use it to feed into the Google Docs [1875] um you know download a document here so [1878] the article doc is formatted like [1882] this so if I just um paste this in [1885] you'll see that it's htps SC backb [1887] doicle [1888] .dd and then we have what we want and so [1891] as I've been doing this in a very hacky [1893] format until now I'm just going to [1895] continue uh I'm going to feed this [1898] in and then I'm going to split it and [1900] I'm going to split it at the presence of [1903] this back SL D back [1906] slash and then I'm going to get the [1910] second result then I'm going to split [1913] this at the presence of this back slash [1916] edit [1919] and then I'm going to get the first [1922] result so now if we were to just hard [1925] code this in let's just download a [1927] document and feed in the [1930] URL the document that was downloaded um [1933] was the correct one and so we we only [1934] stripped the ID that's really the only [1936] thing that mattered to [1937] us okay great and now we can pump this [1940] into three returned rows which are all [1942] the documents in our flow right now and [1944] then we can click run once and now this [1947] is going to do everything that we just [1948] did but it's going to do it three times [1950] instead of just once so we're going to [1951] have three publish articles in webflow [1953] um we'll have done basically [1954] automatically which is pretty [1958] nice so if I go back to web flow and I [1962] go back to this lovely blog I got to [1963] refresh this [1966] again you'll see that not only did we [1969] get the one that we wanted which was [1972] this 10 or sorry the first one 10 [1973] effective ways of nurture mental health [1974] at work which is now using you know a [1975] different image because we're sourcing [1977] it differently every time time we also [1979] have 50 plus RPA use cases and then we [1981] have what is client onboarding [1983] automation so if I just give one of [1985] these a quick little [1987] click we have um you know what is client [1990] onboarding automation you know uh brief [1993] little um I guess summary or excerpt we [1996] have an introduction then we have a [1997] bunch of our headings and so we [1999] basically just automated the process of [2000] getting three of these on webflow in [2002] like a second so I mean you probably [2005] wouldn't do it like this in practice but [2007] you'd probably do is you would have an [2008] automation set up you know instead of [2010] iterating through all of them you'd [2012] watch new rows like [2014] this and then every time you know [2016] somebody in your team adds a new article [2018] or a new row this would trigger and then [2021] it would pull only the specific row that [2023] is in question here so I don't know [2025] let's say we added this row here three [2028] it would pull only what is client [2029] onboarding automation the automation [2031] would run it would pull the Google Doc [2033] slice it up like we did uh convert into [2035] HTML back to markdown HTML all that fun [2037] stuff do the exert and then publish it [2038] on we flow and then here is where you [2041] could tie this into um as I mentioned in [2043] my previous video um just a bunch of [2045] systems that enable you to I don't know [2047] maybe you want to like post this on [2049] Facebook or something you want to do [2053] Facebook [2055] um Pages uh create a post and then down [2058] here you want to go [2060] Twitter and then you want to do uh [2063] create a post and then I don't know you [2065] have you have a bunch of other ones here [2066] for different social media platforms [2068] maybe you want one for LinkedIn as well [2070] you can do like [2071] LinkedIn we could create a user text [2073] post or an organization post or whatnot [2076] and down here is where you would uh you [2077] know use AI to write these specific [2080] teasers or make them as long as you need [2082] them to be or whatnot um and you know [2084] there there's a lot of I guess freedom [2086] from that point on you can do basically [2088] anything you want with that repurpose it [2089] turn it into a video you could throw it [2092] into like a bunch of other apis and have [2093] it do something neat uh really the [2095] opportunities are endless all right [2097] thanks so much for watching this video [2098] on uh posting content automatically in [2101] webflow using make.com as I mentioned [2102] earlier there are a bunch of gotas so I [2104] hope that everything that I've talked [2105] about with my little text formatting [2107] hacks uh help if you have any questions [2109] about this feel free just let me know in [2110] a comment down below I sourced the vast [2112] majority of my now of my Now videos for [2114] my community so if you're interested in [2115] checking out my community as in the time [2117] of the recording I have like 10 spots [2119] left or something like that before we [2120] hit

Title: Watch Me Build An AI WordPress Content Syndicator In Make
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here and [1] in this video I'm going to show you how [2] to connect WordPress with make.com we [4] are going to use AI to take a bunch of [7] posts in a Google sheet our content [9] calendar and then turn those into [11] full-fledged beautiful WordPress posts [13] I'll show you how to uh install the the [16] make connector onto WordPress how to do [18] the connection properly this is an [19] integration I know some people struggle [20] with and ultimately I'm going to show [22] you how to build a stem for one of the [24] highest Roi WordPress content production [26] machines You' probably think of so you [28] could sell the system to people you use [30] the system in your own business or maybe [31] your client's businesses whatever you [33] choose to do with it is up to you that [34] sounds like something youall are [35] interested in stay tuned and let's get [37] into the [40] clip all right first thing we have here [42] is our WordPress instance open I have a [45] page called sample page I've just opened [47] this one up just to show you guys what [49] WordPress looks like today haven't done [51] anything to this website aside from like [53] just spin it up I have the site ground [55] instance that's my host just create like [57] a new WordPress page on nickw 102. SG [61] host.com it's a totally new website and [63] over the course of the next few minutes [65] I'll show you how to connect make.com [66] effectively and then what I'm going to [68] do is I'm going to connect this to a [70] Blog Page so that will pull from this [74] spreadsheet that I just set up and what [76] the spreadsheet is is this is a list of [78] blog posts that are hosted as Google [82] Docs uh that is basically like being [84] arranged in sort of a Content calendar [86] here whatever you want to call it like a [88] queue a calendar whatnot [90] and these are posts that are generated [93] fully using artificial intelligence [94] using one of the um outline sort of [97] article generation systems that I've [99] developed before uh The Columns here are [102] first we have the title then we have the [103] word count and we have the primary [105] keyword the secondary keywords uh we [108] provide some internal links external [110] links there's some like instructions [112] that we give to the AI model then we [114] have an outline that's generated if I [116] pop open the outline this is basically [117] what they look like article is 10 [119] effective way nurture mental health at [120] work and you see there's some bullet [122] points here on you know how to do so and [124] and that sort of thing and then there's [126] the actual document that is that is [128] generated and this is the thing that we [130] are going to be putting on WordPress [131] we're going to be uh basically pulling [134] this document from this Google sheet and [136] then automatically populating uh a [138] WordPress instance and it's going to [139] look really nice and pretty one really [141] unfortunate thing about Google Docs is [143] it doesn't default add spaces between [145] paragraphs so um you know like it [148] doesn't really look as presentable sort [150] of right off the bat but WordPress [152] nowadays handles a lot of that for you [153] so this will be perfectly formatted with [156] all the WordPress stuff the the font [158] style the color choices everything's [160] going to be really nice and yeah the [162] purpose of the system is you know again [163] just to automate the process of posting [166] content um I don't think that the [168] posting should be a very intensive a [172] Time intensive activity considering like [174] most the leverag isn't producing the [175] content making sure that it's really [177] good editing it QA it that sort of deal [180] like there's no real reason why just the [182] physical action of posting has to take [184] more than 2 seconds nowadays we [186] basically live in the future so yeah I'm [188] going to be setting all this stuff up in [189] make.com and I have a little scenario [191] instance open here but in order to [193] connect uh WordPress to make it's not [196] enough just to like open up a a make [198] scenario and then click a button and [199] then automatically connect you actually [200] need to go on WordPress and download a [202] plugin called the make connector and [204] this is where most people I think sort [206] of muck up uh the make connector looks [208] like this it's by makes parent company [210] here and essentially it's the um it's [213] just the way that you know make gets the [215] API keys and the credentials uh from the [218] WordPress instance in order to just make [219] everything nice and hunky dory so first [222] thing that I'm going to do is I have [224] another page here called blog and this [225] is where we're going to be populating [227] the blog posts um so what I'm going to [229] do is I'm going to go over to [231] plugins then I'll go to add new plugin [234] then I'm just going to type in make [235] connector [236] here and then the very first result the [239] one that we want is the one that has [240] over 20k active installations um from [243] personal experience be careful when [245] you're downloading WordPress plugins cuz [247] sometimes people will try and like copy [248] the design and the title and all that [250] stuff of a WordPress plugin uh just so [252] they can get all your you know your your [253] website data they say that everything on [256] the store is nice and checked and and [258] that sort of thing but I don't know I [261] don't always believe that um anyway once [264] you're done click refresh now when you [266] go back to the installed plugins you'll [267] see this make connector here and then if [270] you scroll down there'll be an API key [273] and this API key is essentially the [274] thing that allows you to directly [276] connect make to this WordPress website [278] so what I'll do now is I'll go to my [280] scenario and the first thing I'm going [282] to do is I'm going to connect to Google [283] sheet and I'm just going to go to the [284] search row module because that's just [286] what we're going to be using for this um [288] and I'm just going to verify that you [289] know the the output of the search row [290] module [293] works now I [296] think um we're getting a failed to load [298] data here probably because I need to [299] make a new connection which is [300] unfortunate let me see if maybe there's [302] a new one yeah you know what I think [304] this is the new one I was doing some [306] other scenario earlier today and uh I [309] was running into the same [311] issue so every now and then your [314] scenario is going to sorry your [316] connection is going to disconnect and [319] I'm doing it on this web uh on this uh [321] email address so I'm just going to pump [323] this in and then I'll manually redo the [328] connection okay [332] so now I'm connected to the email that I [334] want and then what I'm looking for is [336] something called content calendar so I'm [338] going to go content [341] calendar and then I'm just going to [342] leave maximum number of returned rows to [346] one excuse me and I'm just going to test [348] this [350] puppy I think I closed it just a little [352] bit too [353] fast let's open this back up click okay [356] those little red dots are going to [357] disappear [360] and then right click run once and then [362] boom I got exactly one result and the [365] way that this result is organized is it [367] is the um first one in the row so it's [371] just pulling kind of like number two if [373] I were to get two results at a time I'd [375] pull number two in three if I got three [376] results it' be 2 to four and then 2 to [378] five and so on and so on and so forth [379] for the purpose of demonstration I will [381] do multiple but I just want to test it [382] on one first and I highly recommend that [384] anytime you guys are developing mate.com [386] flows you just test it on one but anyway [388] this isn't really the secret toss we're [389] just like pulling a row from uh Google [392] sheet right what we really want is we [394] want this WordPress [395] module so go over to Wordpress and then [398] the one that I want is down here called [400] create a post but I encourage you guys [401] to spend a few minutes and just scroll [403] through all of the other ones as well [404] like what you could do is you could [405] connect your make to Wordpress and then [407] you could watch to see when a new post [408] is updated and then that might trigger a [410] bunch of other stuff so um one flow [412] that's pretty common is you'll have some [415] secret secret you'll have one like [417] single source of Truth for all of your [419] content maybe that's like this Google [421] sheet here and then all of the scenarios [423] will be updated based off that so [424] there'll be a scenario that watches new [427] rows in the Google sheet and then when [428] somebody puts in a new row with a Google [430] uh document or something it'll trigger [432] this scenario maybe and then this [433] scenario will add it to WordPress but [435] then you have a bunch of other scenarios [437] that will watch the WordPress post then [439] when a WordPress post is generated it'll [440] then uh I don't know summarize that turn [443] that into like a LinkedIn teaser a [444] Facebook teaser an Instagram teaser [446] it'll generate some images using AI or [448] something like that and then in that way [450] it'll like Syndicate it to 10 15 20 [452] different places maybe it'll autocross [454] post it to Media maybe it'll make a [455] Reddit post right you have a lot of [456] potential in um multiplying the [459] effectivess of your content efforts and [461] usually like excuse me having all of [463] your content in a single source of Truth [465] is the best way to accomplish this so [467] any who scroll through here and look to [469] see all of the other options there are [470] tons the one that I want is the create a [474] post and now comes the magic we're going [476] to create the [477] connection first thing we have to do is [480] I'm going to go back here copy this API [482] token paste it in here then I need to [485] get my rest API base URL now the rest [488] API based URL sounds really fancy but [491] it's not it's just the the URL of your [493] website so mine's Nick w102 sg- host.com [497] because I'm doing this on site ground [499] what I want to do is I basically want [501] to um do this and then just go wp-json [504] so get the URL of the website that I [507] have Nick w102 sg- host.com and then [509] just [510] gowp dojon and then do a final backs [514] slash at the end there then I click [517] save this is now connected to my [520] WordPress instance and now I can [521] automatically just generate posts as is [524] right and what we'll do is we're just [525] going to test to make sure this works [527] I'll say this is my test [529] post this is my test [532] content this type is a post in WordPress [535] you have different types you can do like [536] a page you can do a u a post you could [538] do like a navigation menu font family [541] whatever um and then the exert we're [543] just going to like I don't know this is [545] an example of the power ofm make.com and [549] WordPress the date I'm just going to [551] store it as now slug you can even [554] generate a slug if you want so I don't [555] know we could just [557] um grab the title and then lowercase it [561] and then you can choose whether you want [562] to publish it whether you want to draft [563] it when you want to pending it whatever [564] I'm just going to click [566] publish you have a bunch of different [568] formats here because uh WordPress like [570] every new generation of Wordpress [571] includes like a bunch of new features [572] for blog post so this is like an aside a [575] chat it could be like an audio a video [577] whatever I'm I'm not going to put any [579] information in here because it's not [580] relevant to me if you had categories you [582] could categorize it um you can also [584] categorize it automatically we could do [585] that using AI or something we're not [587] going to do that right now um the author [588] is just going to be me and we could do [590] the same thing we automatically generate [592] tags if you wanted to but I'm not going [593] to worry about it since we're just [595] testing I'm going to right click and run [596] this module only [599] and this is now going out it's actually [601] publishing all of the the data that I [603] sent it so this is my test post post [604] this is my test post author is me just [606] one uh publish this is my test content [608] this is an example the power of make.com [610] in WordPress so if we go back here and [612] then I go to posts we now see the test [615] post that has been published and it was [617] published just now my time zones are a [619] little bit wonky but this is basically 6 [621] hours ahead um and yeah it was published [623] at 28 a.m. which is exactly 6 hours [626] before if I click view you'll see the [628] post first we have the title then we [631] have the content field and then we also [633] have the excerpt you can't actually read [634] the excerpt um unless you're like at a [636] page that is listing all of the the blog [638] posts but yeah it has all the data that [640] we need so that's pretty straightforward [641] why don't we actually do this in [643] practice now if I go back to my blog [644] just refresh let's see if this pops up [647] too um no it's not popping up I wonder [650] why maybe it's laggy or something like [652] that may we got to purge the cach oh [655] yeah yeah we did have to purge the cach [656] CU when I went to edit you see the test [657] post here um that's pretty cool I like [659] that all the stuff's popping up but this [661] has already given me WordPress PTSD I [663] used to be a WordPress Dev way back in [665] the day and holy crap the the cash was [668] like the worst my worst nightmare it was [670] insanely buggy um and it would just [674] constantly like defy logic I'd be like I [677] swear to God I did that and then you [679] know cuz the cache wasn't updated or [680] whatever it wouldn't show up so that's a [682] good example of that um but yeah why [684] don't we actually do this with real data [685] now so I'm going to keep the row count [687] to just one because we're going to test [690] this out on one row at a time and then [692] I'm just going to pull in like the title [693] field I'll pull in [694] everything uh so the title is here the [697] content is going to be the content of [700] the Google Docs we're actually going to [701] have to pull that up here I uh got a [702] little bit ahead of myself but well I'll [704] show you how to do that in a second um [706] then we need posts uh then we need the [709] excert the way that we could do the [710] excert is we could just feed in the [713] content and then we could split the [716] first sentence so we could only get the [718] first sentence of the post and then we [720] could just standardize that and make [722] that the excert we could also feed this [724] into Ai and have a generate an excert [726] that might be pretty neat make this [727] video a little bit chunkier Yeah okay [729] maybe I'll do that uh the slug we could [731] just grab the title and then um we could [735] strip all of the characters that like [737] break [738] titles so a character that breaks a [741] title is like um like a colon for [743] instance we could strip those um that [745] may be more trouble than it's worth if [747] I'm honest might be better just use the [749] primary keyword and then just to make it [751] lowercase and then to replace all new [754] lines or spaces sorry uh with dashes [757] that's probably better that way we'll [760] you know potentially gain a little bit [761] of Link juice from the primary keyword [763] as well maybe that's helpful yeah let's [765] go with that uh then the rest this is [767] going to be that so let me just put an X [769] in the content and then why don't we go [770] get the content from the Google [772] doc I'll go to Google [776] doc then I want to get the content a [780] document I'm going to need to feed in [783] this new connection and then okay so we [785] have kind of a kind of a problem here [787] right because this Google doc module in [789] order to get the content of the document [790] we need to feed it a document ID but if [792] you go over here to the article doc like [794] there's no just article ID field here [797] it's actually nestled within the URL [799] basically everything after this backd [801] back SL this is the ID before the back [802] sledit question mark um so if we assume [805] that this format is going to be the same [806] all the time then we can actually [807] extract the ID pretty easily just using [810] uh just using a little bit of um like [813] make logic but what I'll do here is just [815] to make this even simpler and easier for [818] people that are doing this at home or [819] maybe downloading the blueprint is I'm [821] going to set a variable actually not [822] just one I'll set multiple [827] variables and then I'm going to call [830] this um just Google doc [833] ID and then what I want is we we just [837] want this section here [839] basically all of this so if you think [841] about it there are multiple ways that we [842] could do this we [844] could split this for instance uh at you [847] know back SL doent [849] backd and then we could split it again [851] at back sledit and then we could grab [854] the first result of that second split uh [858] and then the second result of the first [859] split um we could we could Rex this so [863] we could pump in this URL and [867] then um have like a little bracket here [870] and then just say [873] this you know if there was like a Rex [875] module which there isn't it would [876] probably look something like this uh we [878] got a lot of options but for [880] interpretability reasons I'm just going [881] to do like the split thing um because i' [884] I've talked about it a lot in previous [885] videos and I think that's just a little [886] bit faster so I'm actually just going [890] to do it down here I'll say [893] split and then I'm going to feed in the [895] article doc and where I want to split it [898] is I I want to split it at um back SL D [901] back slash and basically at back SL D [905] back slash I want everything before this [906] to be one and then everything after this [907] to be another part essentially I'm [910] splitting it right down that um slash D [913] back slash this is going to be like a [915] like a knife through this whole string [917] and then what I want to do is I want to [918] get the second result if we split this [922] string into two parts the first part we [923] don't really need it's just the Google [924] Doc part right it's kind of pointless [926] and useless to us what we want is we [928] want this chunk and then what we want to [930] do after this is we want to split this [931] again but I want to split this based off [933] of the U presence of this back [936] sledit and then I want to get the first [939] result so what doing this will do [942] essentially what I'm going to do by [943] doing this is uh I'm just going to like [946] cut this twice and then every time I cut [947] it I'm just going to grab the specific [949] part of the string that I want and for [952] the purposes of this demonstration let [953] me just copy and paste this [955] in and run this module separately I just [959] copied in one of the ID one of the big [961] URLs here and I'll show you how this [962] works first we're going to cut that out [965] and we're going to get all this and then [966] next we're going to cut this out and [970] then we're just going to get this so [973] let's click okay and then the end result [976] is we have the ID U basically listed [978] under the Google Doc ID parameter and [981] that's good for us because now we can [982] just feed in that Google doc ID to the [984] get content of a document module and I'm [986] just going to test this first three [987] sections I'm just going to disconnect [989] this and then I'm just going to run this [992] puppy so we're getting the URL that we [996] just got the Google [997] Doc okay so what happens after you get [1000] the content of a document we got the [1001] correct one right a uh 10 effective way [1003] interent all that work as you get a [1005] bunch of different fields here you get [1006] body you get document style you got name [1008] styles list inline objects right text [1010] content you also get this content um [1012] array which is very interesting but it's [1013] like way too complicated for our [1014] purposes basically it's like a line by [1017] line breakdown of every piece of content [1020] uh including like the title and the [1021] title style and you can technically use [1023] this to rebuild the entire article if [1025] you want but personally I find that this [1026] just way too much work and it's not [1027] really not really worth the time so what [1029] I do is I just kind of cheat and I go [1031] down to text content which is just a [1033] giant text Chunk of the whole article [1035] and then I'm just going to be pasting [1036] that in so that's what I'm going to use [1039] here if I go create a [1040] post we can now feed in the text [1047] content which was where the hell was [1049] text [1052] content am I completely [1055] blind totally got some text content [1059] right but I'm not seeing this text oh [1063] yeah okay I am actually blind uh okay [1066] great and then the [1069] excerpt [1072] um why don't we do some AI stuff it'll [1076] be funky to show you guys the power of [1078] the dark side now to show you how useful [1082] uh some quick and simple GPT prompts can [1084] be when you Chuck them in I'm going to [1086] use GPT 40 here going to drop in a [1089] system prompt call this uh a helpful [1092] intelligent writing [1094] assistant I'm then going to say your job [1098] is to [1099] turn is to create [1102] short [1104] excerpts from [1107] articles for WordPress [1112] posts excert should be between let's say [1116] like 20 to 50 words long and Briefly [1121] summarize what the article talks [1125] about I trust this so much not even [1127] going to feed in any training I'm just [1129] going to feed in the text content and [1131] we're just going to grab whatever the [1132] output of this is we're just going to [1134] feed this into WordPress as the excerpt [1143] so I'm just going to grab the result [1145] variable here and then uh yeah that [1148] should be good why don't we actually try [1150] this out now just save the scenario [1152] going to click run once and we're just [1153] going to do this on one article at a [1155] time see how fast that that was super [1159] quick then I'm going to go back to post [1161] here give us a quick refresh and we'll [1162] see that we now have an article called [1164] Ai and process automation expectations [1166] versus [1167] reality now um the big problem that you [1170] probably see immediately is that this is [1171] not formatted correctly uh this looks [1173] kind of ugly if I'm being honest and I [1176] imagine the main reason [1178] why is because there's no formatting so [1181] what would be pretty cool is if we could [1183] turn this article into like a WordPress [1187] acceptable format uh which would have to [1189] be marked down essentially um and then [1192] have that like markup headings and stuff [1193] like that what I mean is if we go like a [1195] I don't know something like this for [1197] instance [1199] um then we automatically turn that into [1200] a heading [1202] right so that's my personal take on [1205] things I think we could probably improve [1206] this substantially [1208] um so let me just see here yeah okay [1213] well first of all I I have no idea if [1214] this is going to work so why don't we [1215] actually test this out why don't we [1217] create a post [1220] here and why don't I copy this [1223] first and I'm just going to edit this [1225] really quickly uh we're just going to do [1228] like example markdown post what I'm [1231] going to do is this is an introduction [1233] and then I'll go this is a heading [1237] to uh then I'll go this is a bullet [1247] point and then I'll [1250] uh I don't think I can do that I kind of [1252] forget how to do a markdown [1254] link I think it was like something ah [1258] whatever I don't know I need that this [1259] will be sufficient to tell me whether or [1260] not this works um we're not going to do [1263] any excerpt here and then this log's [1266] just going to be [1267] example MD [1269] post that looks good to me and then I'm [1272] just going to run this and see if we can [1273] just convert this thing a markdown [1275] that'd be really helpful so why I go [1277] back to the blog now and just leave this [1279] ugly post where's this example markdown [1282] post and no it's still not uh being [1286] converted into word into sexy headings [1289] and [1290] stuff we may need to use HTML now that [1293] I'm thinking about [1296] it why don't I [1298] go [1303] H2 and then why don't I go list item [1307] list [1311] item uh I think we got to go unordered [1313] list and then we got to go back SL [1316] unordered list this might work [1319] if it doesn't I'm going to throw my head [1321] at the wall [1323] violently uh VI this one here okay great [1326] yeah so HTML works we can't actually use [1327] markdown my bad um so what I'm going to [1329] do is I'm going to take this now and [1331] this post um you know if we if we run [1335] this thing up into the AI part again [1338] just to get a feel for what the the [1340] content looks [1342] like um this text content here is not [1345] really in a format that we can use to um [1349] like it's in an okay format uh but it's [1351] not like we can't use it to [1354] automatically um add headings and stuff [1356] like that where we need to what we could [1357] do is we could go through this body [1358] content and then iterate through this [1360] whole thing uh what we' do is we we'd be [1362] building the WordPress post through this [1366] essentially like getting the HTML of a [1367] document um I'm not going to do that [1370] what I'm going to do instead is I'm just [1372] going to have ai convert the plain text [1374] back into HTML format and then I'm going [1376] to publish that HTML format in said so [1379] we have a couple of modules here [1380] obviously this is a really simple one [1381] which creates an excert I'm just going [1382] to run [1384] these um in [1387] succession and then this one's going to [1390] be convert to [1394] HTML and then I'm going to go over here [1396] and then I'll say your job is to turn [1398] plain text into HTML markup for [1406] WordPress wrap [1409] headings with h [1412] tags um bullet points [1416] with [1419] li [1421] Etc I think it's probably going to do a [1423] pretty good job of this as [1425] is so I'm just going to let that be and [1428] then I'm going to take this HTML and I'm [1430] going to use this HTML not this [1433] markdown [1435] to let's see um feed in this text [1438] content [1439] here I'm going to delete this other [1442] post okay we got some realtime problem [1444] solving over here [1447] beautiful so creating the exerts pretty [1449] fast converting this to HTML is probably [1451] going to be pretty fast as well keep in [1453] mind this is sort of silly because the [1455] previous step in my AI content generator [1458] is it like does it all in HTML or sorry [1460] it does it all in markdown and then it [1461] converts that into HTML anyway so uh if [1465] you wanted to connect this directly to [1467] that part of the flow it' be [1468] substantially easier because you just [1469] feed the HTML indirectly but whatever [1472] we're just assuming that you're faced [1474] with a with a big Google sheet of a [1475] bunch of URLs here and I think that's a [1477] reasonable use [1478] case now because this is way longer [1480] right um we're basically feeding in a [1482] full article and I think that article is [1483] like a th 500 words or something like [1485] that it's going to take a fair amount of [1486] time to generate it's not going to be [1488] you know immediate not like this excerpt [1490] the this excerpt is like one paragraph [1492] right so we're probably going to need [1493] like at least 20 or 30 times that and [1496] you know you are going to be spending a [1497] little bit of money into token cost we [1499] can calculate what that looks like by [1500] doing the math here but I imagine still [1503] it's really not going to be that much [1505] probably going to be like an extra few [1506] seconds uh sorry [1508] extra um I don't know [1511] like [1513] um like few cents so this looks pretty [1516] good to me converting them into P tags [1519] and H2S and so on and so forth there are [1521] some issues here with this HTML like it [1523] it added a triple back slash or sorry [1526] triple little back tick or whatever it's [1528] called HTML and that's just because this [1530] is like uh it's just a convention when [1533] you're generating code to say what the [1535] coding languages so we could probably [1538] solve this by training the model a [1539] little bit better or adding like an [1540] additional prompt before this um to [1543] remove this part and we could also train [1545] it to not include this first uh this [1547] first heading the way that you do that [1549] is you just write you know don't include [1551] the first heading don't include BL HTML [1552] and it probably be fine so yeah why [1555] don't I do that [1561] don't include the first heading um don't [1565] include HTML wait three [1569] yeah message except for the [1573] article itself okay uh and I'm just [1577] going to run this again just so we can [1578] do it while I'm running through the rest [1579] of this piece so when we take these out [1584] oops uh we're going to convert all these [1586] to blocks and I'm going to go over here [1588] here what's going to happen is this will [1591] be gone and then this will be gone as [1593] well which will you know make it nicely [1596] formatted essentially and it looks like [1598] everything is pretty good um there was [1600] an extra bullet point here just one not [1603] really sure why that happened could just [1605] be the AI bugging out and then these [1607] will be removed when it picks up our [1610] instructions so that's pretty good yeah [1612] I'd like that I mean really the only [1615] thing um that's left would just be that [1617] random bullet point so let's see what [1619] happens with it okay just made a couple [1620] of final edits to the uh prompt here [1623] basically just telling it what I want it [1625] to do I said something along the lines [1627] of don't include a title uh don't [1629] include a heading and then make sure [1632] that the first section immediately after [1633] is like a like a paragraph or something [1636] you know I was considering doing this [1637] procedurally and um you know if you're [1639] watching this I I obviously left in the [1640] video because I wanted to show you guys [1642] what the workflow looks like but when [1643] you do have extremely powerful [1645] artificial intelligence a lot of the [1646] times just better to use it so this is [1648] the post that I just generated with the [1650] title and then we have the U kind of [1653] introductory section here and then yeah [1656] looks very nice so um nicely formatted [1659] now which is cool and it was [1661] automatically posted for us which uh [1662] which I also enjoy quite a bit so that's [1665] fun uh yeah that's more or less how you [1667] do it in you know gosh I guess uh I [1671] guess now you can realistically publish [1673] a new piece of content every 30 seconds [1676] or so you know if you procedurally [1677] generate it using my outline tool or uh [1679] my AI outline to article tool which is [1682] pretty neat what I'm going to do now is [1684] why don't I just pump all of this [1686] through let me just delete all of the [1688] other posts here I don't really care [1689] about them and they're kind of ugly and [1690] then why don't I um why don't I generate [1693] all of them [1695] simultaneously so I'm going to go over [1697] to my scenario editor [1699] here and then I'm just going to say how [1702] many articles do I have 1 two three four [1704] um let's just do three I don't want this [1706] to take forever so just to show you guys [1709] that I can actually like generate [1711] multiple simultaneously we do [1713] three let's do that and then that should [1716] be good we're going to click run once [1717] and I'm just going to talk over it while [1719] it's doing its its cool sexy thing in [1722] the background um basically it's now [1725] feeding in all of this information [1727] diving into the article doc let's open [1729] up this one now this is number two uh [1731] diving into the article doc it's then [1734] pulling in all the text and then [1736] essentially using it to recre create the [1738] HTML um with artificial intelligence and [1741] then uh it is pushing that HTML to [1744] Wordpress WordPress is then rendering [1746] that HTML in its own fancy way uh let's [1750] check out the first post here it's then [1752] rendering the HTML in its own fancy way [1755] with its own little heading format and [1756] kind of its block editor here um and [1759] then uh it's actually going through and [1760] it's publishing it which is pretty neat [1763] so that was number one we're now waiting [1765] for number two keep in mind if you're [1766] doing this at Home Folks you may not [1768] have the um you know you always have to [1770] worry about like the the rate limits I [1772] have an extremely Advanced like whatever [1774] the top tier is on the open a account [1775] cuz I've been using it for quite a while [1777] but uh you know if you're just getting [1779] into open ai's API they rate limit you [1782] reasonably heavily until I think you pay [1784] like at least $50 or $100 or something [1786] so if you're starting to get some errors [1787] or whatever that's probably [1789] why I'm just going to leave this screw [1793] it in addition to the like explicit rate [1795] limiting you also sort of get soft [1797] throttled um the responses take longer [1799] to get back to you the more usage that [1800] you're you're doing granted I'm still [1802] only doing what like three tokens or [1804] something 3,000 tokens or something so [1805] it's really really not that big of a [1807] deal but yeah I guess what I'm saying is [1809] just don't be surprised if it if it ends [1811] up taking a little bit of additional [1812] time ways that you could uh add on to [1815] the system as I mentioned previously you [1818] could uh like one thing that I see a lot [1820] of people do here is they will go to [1821] this WordPress module after it creates a [1823] post and then they will add a router and [1826] a router just allows you to split the [1828] put into like a bunch of different you [1829] know [1830] trajectories um so what you could do is [1832] you could have a router and then the [1834] first link of that router might be like [1837] a Facebook module and it might like [1839] cross post this article to your Facebook [1841] instead or it might take the link that [1843] the WordPress is um outputting you know [1846] you know how we have like a slug um we [1848] have a slug from a previous module we [1850] could take this slug add it to the base [1853] root URL and then we could create a [1855] Facebook teaser that basically says hey [1857] how's it going um you know just publish [1858] this new article check it out here and [1860] then it like actually attaches the URL [1863] to the post and we know it's the right [1865] URL because we just created that URL [1866] ourselves right uh you could then do the [1869] same thing with like uh like an [1870] Instagram business account maybe for [1872] Instagram you have another route that [1874] like actually goes through generates [1875] some image with AI because you know it's [1877] more of an AI platform you do this with [1878] like Twitter you could do this with [1881] LinkedIn linkedin's really big nowadays [1883] um people really like that so maybe you [1885] could do it on like your own page and [1886] then you might actually do it as your [1887] own personal profile as well make a [1889] little snippet um you could cross post [1892] this to medium so I used to run a big [1894] medium blog which I ended up getting [1895] about 2k Subs which is the crown jewel [1898] of my life and uh uh they they have like [1901] uh the mechanism to crossbow stuff to [1903] medium automatically which is pretty [1904] cool um so if I were not to actually [1907] make what I was about to tell you about [1909] but I'd add a router and then I might go [1911] like Facebook pages and then I might say [1913] create a post this might be like route [1916] number one [1918] then LinkedIn we might create a user [1920] text [1921] post and then we might create like a [1924] like a page text post or you know you [1928] could do it in the same route if you [1929] wanted [1930] to you could then add a I don't know [1933] like a Twitter I think you can do this [1935] with our API haven't done this in quite [1937] a while I know there was a big hubub [1939] because they changed it voila you can do [1941] that um you know you imagine how [1943] different social media platforms may [1945] require different work so what you could [1946] do is you could like add gpt3 modules [1949] that do LinkedIn specific things and the [1951] LinkedIn route Facebook specific things [1953] and the Facebook route you got a lot of [1954] options here I guess is what I'm trying [1956] to say um and that's you know that might [1958] be how you do like a big content [1959] syndication machine store everything in [1961] the Google sheet once a day or something [1963] or maybe um instead of use the search [1964] Rose module use the like U watch new [1966] rose module every time something's added [1968] then run this puppy and then send it to [1970] all your different social media [1971] platforms I need something like that for [1974] YouTube you know I'm talking about this [1975] and I'm like huh that' actually be [1977] really convenient if I did that with [1978] YouTube okay final check through here [1981] um from a formatting perspective looks [1984] great you even got like the the list [1987] items um just copied over these these [1990] case studies which is nice yeah and you [1993] you know you can see that this works [1994] really well with like arbitrarily long [1995] posts too right like it doesn't need to [1996] be really short like this first one [1998] which is probably like, 1500 words or [1999] something I don't know a lot of [2000] potential here hopefully you guys give [2002] it a try and yeah a lot of potential [2004] here um you know if you want to use this [2005] for your own social media platform or [2007] sell this to other people I think a lot [2008] of people would be down for that [2010] hopefully you guys enjoyed learning how [2012] to connect WordPress with make.com make [2014] sure to use that make connector um super [2016] valuable stuff and uh if you guys have [2018] any questions about you know maybe [2019] syndicating content or crossposting to [2021] various platforms or whatnot just let me [2023] know I know a lot of these apis have [2024] gotten a little more locked down [2026] especially in recent years with uh GPT [2028] spam I mean some might consider what we [2030] are currently tempting to do here GPT [2032] spam I don't personally think so but uh [2035] yeah you know I know these platforms [2036] have gotten a little bit more locked [2037] down so maybe they're not as [2039] straightforward as they used to be but [2040] more than happy to help you just leave a [2041] comment down below uh the last thing [2043] I'll say is I really appreciate [2044] everybody that's joined my community [2045] over the course of the last few days we [2046] are now at [2048] 373 or something we're very close to the [2050] top uh the cap of 400 which was much [2054] faster than I thought I figured this [2055] would take like at least a month and a [2056] half but I guess the market demand for [2058] make.com and Community coaching and you [2061] know um a culture of of constant [2064] Improvement is is really there um but if [2066] you guys haven't joined yet just know [2068] that uh the window of opportunity is [2070] closing and uh you know if it makes [2072] sense for you then I'd encourage you to [2073] hop on thanks so much for watching [2075] everybody please do all that fun YouTube [2076] stuff like comment subscribe I'll catch [2078] you on the next one bye-bye

Title: Watch Me Build An Automatic Trello Onboarding System In 25min
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here and [1] in this video I'm going to show you how [2] to build an extraordinarily simple [4] client onboarding system using Trello [6] email and Google Sheets if that sounds [8] like something you guys want to learn [9] stay tuned let's get into [13] it all right so first things first this [15] video is requested by the lovely Matthew [16] Larson guy is a freaking killer he's a [18] good friend of mine he actually lives [19] out here in calary Alberta at least [21] right now uh he essentially runs a big [24] agency training program and a lot of [26] that agency training program centers [28] around Trello so they use Trello to [30] track progress over time they do Trello [32] for internal tasks they essentially just [33] use Trello for the vast majority of [35] their project management and he just [37] asked me hey man can you make an [38] automation that essentially um when a [41] payment comes in we create a new Trello [43] board to represent a client and maybe do [44] a couple of things associated with that [46] and that's reasonably straightforward [48] I've also had a few other people ask me [49] for Trello for my community and so I [51] figured you know with this Confluence [52] events screw it I'll make a video on [53] Trello even though I don't really use it [55] super often now what is Trello if you [57] guys aren familiar essentially this is a [58] project management platform um that's [60] similar to a lot of the other project [62] management platforms the only difference [63] is instead of it being like a table or a [66] list it's what's called a can band board [68] these guys are definitely um popularize [70] the Canin board layout and a Canin board [72] is essentially these cards and inside of [75] each of these cards there are a few [76] other cards sorry lists I think inside [78] of each list is a few cards and then you [81] move these tasks essentially from left [83] to right to represent their progress [85] through the queue Trello is pretty [87] flexible they do this one thing and they [89] do this one thing extraordinarily well [91] um but it's it's pretty flexible with [93] how you design these kenben lists you [95] know you can change the status names you [96] can do a lot there um but essentially [98] it's just like a simple version of a [100] project management system that a lot of [102] people prefer strips away a lot of the [104] BS associated with project management [105] and for a lot of people it's like the [107] 8020 they've also recently provided some [109] other views so you don't just need to [110] use board you can use table calendar [112] timeline dashboard and map although you [114] know again this is just like this is [116] what they do really well they just do [117] the left to right sort of coment board [118] layout thing now um the reason why this [121] is so important is because you know if [124] you're using kin boards and you want to [126] represent some type of like new client [127] project it' be very inefficient to [129] represent every new client as like a [130] card inside of each board probably be [133] much more efficient to represent a [134] client as a whole board itself so you [137] know this main board might not be called [139] main board might be called like left [141] click you know this other example board [142] might be called 1 second copy and inside [145] of each of these client boards then you [147] have a bunch of tasks for that client [148] like a 2d list then stuff that is [150] currently in progress and then stuff [151] maybe that's done you can also add lists [154] and that sort of thing so other statuses [155] if you want um but you know it [158] essentially this just like a [159] straightforward I'm just going to use [160] the stem and then you guys can customize [162] this however you want onboarding is [164] extraordinarily important if you want to [165] grow uh a successful business because [168] the second that a client pays you you [171] need to minimize their buyer remorse [172] essentially to improve the longevity of [174] the contract and also just to like give [176] them a great experience nobody likes [177] parting with money so the second that [179] they do just make sure that you know you [180] give them something positive and in this [182] in this case the onboarding is going to [184] be us creating a trell board us sending [186] them a quick little email about it uh [188] and then you know us getting them set up [189] in the system so yeah nice and [191] straightforward this is what the flow is [192] going to look like I'm going to create a [194] fake payment event uh this fake payment [196] event is just going to be a basic [199] trigger is going to more or less just [203] be payment event we'll do payment status [207] this will be true this will be I don't [210] know email [212] address and maybe we'll also do like an [216] amount this is [218] USD this basic trigger just uh fills in [222] the spot that you would use let's say [223] like a stripe module to watch your [225] payment maybe like Panda do to make sure [227] that a contract or invoice has been has [228] been filled out uh this is just going to [230] be a placeholder that we're going to use [232] cuz anytime that you're screwing around [233] with payment automations and that sort [234] of thing unfortunately a lot of these [236] platforms don't have like a test feature [237] and you know I just don't want to muck [239] around with that so I'm just going to [240] pretend that this is a [241] payment [243] completed and we're going to say payment [247] completed create Trello [249] board and send [252] email okay so what do you do in order to [254] actually go there and then make a Trello [256] board well um we just going to type in [259] trilo Trello and there are a bunch of uh [263] modules here that are quite useful you [264] can watch boards so you could have [265] another automation that's dependent on [268] this automation for instance and when [269] you create a new board you can do [270] something else with that flow you can [272] edit a board you can get a board uh [274] search assign team members to boards you [276] can do a fair amount uh with [277] this I'm not going to go through every [279] single one of these endpoints but rest [281] assured the Trello um and I think [283] they're owned by a bigger company called [285] atlassian or something like that um are [287] like very very good with their [288] Integrations and automations this is [290] something that's quite quite common so [292] we're going to go create a board [296] here and I just need to select the [298] correct account the integration is super [300] simple takes like half a second um what [302] I'm going to do here actually I'm going [304] to add one more variable I'm going to [305] pretend I have like the client [307] name for the purposes of this we'll call [309] it left click and [311] then let's say company name we'll say [315] first [316] name then we'll also do last [319] name uh did I put an email in here yeah [322] okay great so that should be all the [324] information we need because I haven't [326] put this in I just need to cancel this [327] out and then reselect this it's going to [330] enable me to grab the the previous [332] modules and then I'm just going to call [334] this um company name board and the [337] description is going to be left blank [339] now in contrast to a lot of the other uh [341] modules that you can use in make.com the [344] trailer board I find is like [345] extraordinarily simple above the fold [347] but then when you click show advaned [348] settings it is super complicated there [350] are like a million different um rules [352] here self jooin default labels default [355] list board Source ID card covers [358] background you can you change the [359] background color if you want let's just [361] set everything to Sky card aging uh they [364] have pirate mode versus regular mode I'm [366] not going to go into detail about each [368] of these things suffice to say you can [369] you know check out trello's [371] documentation on the various settings [372] that you can enable or disable for [374] boards um but there you know there are a [376] couple of things that we are going to do [377] we're going to do self jooin we're going [379] to put that at uh leave that as a yes [381] I'm going to say members and [382] administrators can make invitations I'm [385] going to say anybody can make a a [388] comment anybody can [390] vote the permission level of this board [393] is going to be for the purposes of this [394] we're going to leave it as public that [396] doesn't necessarily this isn't like it's [397] we're listing this on the stock exchange [398] it just means that you need the link uh [400] in order to access the board so if you [402] don't have the link you're not going to [403] be able to board uh access the board at [404] all and then we're not going to mess [406] around with any of these others oh uh [408] there's one more that might be valuable [409] called board Source ID uh you can [411] essentially create like a board template [412] and you can just copy that board over [414] just by hard coding the ID right in here [417] and so this is pretty useful if like say [418] you wanted to create create a structure [420] that's different from this main board [421] structure If instead of Tod do doing and [424] done you wanted let's say five statuses [426] um a guy called Brett at design Joy does [428] this design Joy TR let me see if I could [431] see a a photo [432] here yeah so Brett I think the guy does [435] like well over a million dollars in [437] profit a year just as a solo [438] entrepreneur this is what his board [439] looks like there's a start here which [442] includes uh like an introduction there's [444] a how to use this board there's a Find [446] Your Design files branding manager [447] subscription he's essentially like doing [449] design as a service and he has a bunch [451] of templated um onboarding docs that he [454] includes in every trailer board to just [455] make it really simple and easy for [456] people to manage so you could do this [458] super easily if you wanted to take the [460] time to set up your own onboarding board [463] where you have you know instructions hey [464] here's what you do first here's what you [465] do second here's what you do third um [467] all you'd have to do is copy the ID of [469] that board which you find right after [470] the back SLB um and then yeah you'd be [472] able to um just plug that into this [475] module and then automatically create [477] said board but for the purpose of this [479] the first thing we want to do is just [481] test whether or not this works right so [482] I have the payment completed over here [483] we're going to create the [485] board it's saying that it was [488] successful if I go back to example board [491] here and then I just go boards maybe do [494] a quick little [496] refresh uh we will see oh weird we don't [499] actually have a board [501] odd I might have created this in the [503] wrong account yeah I created this in the [504] wrong account my bad let's go back here [506] run this again okay [510] so I give this thing a quick little [511] refresh we now have a left click board [514] which is a board for the specific client [516] um and then maybe on this board [519] we we will always create a few tasks and [522] we have like onboarding tasks those [524] tasks are [526] um you know our team needs to invite the [529] client or something to uh like a [532] password manager then we need to send [535] them a welcome email well no we're going [538] to automate the welcome email so we [539] don't actually that to be a task [543] maybe I don't know we will [547] um update their payment information or [550] maybe we will create oh I I know what [552] we'll do we will assume that you know [553] this is an automation agency that we're [555] building after the client pays us we get [558] their information uh and then we [561] basically like buy them a little bit of [562] Swag or something like a welcome gift [564] thank you for you know jumping on my [565] retainer uh we have two simple [567] onboarding tasks extraordinary [569] straightforward that's my new favorite [570] word today um the way that you do that [573] here is you would create a [576] card now the thing about [579] Trello is Trello uses as I mentioned [582] these lists but these lists each have [584] different IDs so if you wanted to create [585] a card you need to um enter a list [591] ID you know we can't exactly hardcode [594] this [595] right so we have to actually go there [597] and select the list ID which is going to [599] be do then we have to add the name and [601] the description maybe a file and that [603] sort of thing so this is sort of [604] annoying to do right because the ID of [606] every cards list of every um board's [608] list is going to be different so in [610] order to do that we have to actually get [615] lists and so we need to uh pull the ID [618] of the specific list that we are going [619] to be creating the card in the way that [622] we do this is we map the board ID we [623] feed in the board ID from the created [625] board earlier I'm going to do all lists [629] Max number is going to be [631] three and then um I'm actually just [634] going to hard code this in for now that [635] way I don't have to create another board [637] so give me one second to test [640] this we're going to see that this [642] returns three this returns a twoo this [644] returns a doing and this returns are [645] done and now that I'm thinking about it [647] it's always going to return the um [649] earliest uh list before the later lists [652] and if we're going to be adding just [653] some onboarding tasks in to do pretty [655] straightforward I'm just going to get [656] the one and then I'm going to feed in [658] the one to the create a card so then we [661] go to trell and I'm just going to type [663] in card here and then it's going to be [665] create a [667] card and then all we need to do is just [669] feed in the list ID from the previous [671] entry because the one list ID that it [673] returns is always going to be to do for [675] us now the first thing we're going to do [678] is um I already forgot my onboarding [681] task from earlier that's really [683] funny uh what are we going to do we are [685] going to send [688] them a Swag Box um there are tons of [692] these Services out there like this one [694] called swag.com swag boox send curated [696] swag boxes at swag magic.com essentially [700] the way that it works is it's usually [701] like your company branded on a bunch of [703] items or materials and so you know you [705] can send your clients a nice cup with [707] your logo on it maybe some socks or uh I [709] don't know like a t-shirt this sort of [711] thing is EXT extremely popular recently [714] uh people really seem to like it and um [716] you know I think that this makes a [717] massive difference when you send [718] something physically to to a client um [720] if they're paying you you know5 10 [722] $15,000 a month very small little [724] investment to make to probably increase [726] your consolidation uh and decrease turn [728] like another few percent so look at this [731] you know us fulfillment from $20 a [733] recipient Global fulfillment is $100 per [736] recipient super super cheap um you know [738] if you think about the margin on one of [740] these things it's uh it's fantastic so [742] I'm just going to say send them a swag [743] box then the description of this will be [745] log [747] into swag.com [751] enter the client [753] information and ship their Swag Box [757] Let's Pretend there are different types [759] and we're doing type a uh there's no [761] files here so we're not going to be [762] uploading a file if you go to uh show [765] advance settings you can change the [767] position of the card that you're [768] creating so we want this one to be up at [770] the top and then you can also set a due [772] date for the card and you know just like [773] any project management system um we're [775] probably going to do a pretty quick due [777] date we'll just say add date is now and [779] then two this will be do in 48 hours [781] from now there's going to be no file URL [784] um and then you can also um do this this [787] similarly to creating a board where you [789] copy a card template somewhere else in [792] Trello and to do that you could [793] automatically you could either feed in a [796] manual card ID that you have just a [798] specific card and a specific board and [800] have it pull from it all the time [801] hardcoded or you could uh you could oh I [804] guess you could either like add the ID [806] or you could just select it manually [807] here so either one is fine I we're not [809] going to be doing that here because [810] we're just creating the card from [812] scratch and then we need some other [814] activity for [816] this so I'm just going to copy this and [818] create another card this one's not going [820] to be at the [823] top this is going to be at the bottom [825] I'm pretending that there's just two [827] instead of send them a Swag Box H what [829] are we going to do [830] here instead of sending them a swag box [834] maybe uh we will [836] record a video introduction that sounds [840] nice salesperson to record a brief 3 [845] minute video [848] introduction let's do like a customized [851] 3 minute video introduction to welcome [854] them aboard and [857] improve consolidation reduce churn maybe [861] they do this in like a loom video or [862] something pretty [864] straightforward and you can also spe [866] specify a specific member to assign this [868] to I'm just going to leave this as blank [869] for now and we'll say that that is [871] hypothetically due in 3 days just to [873] have a couple of differences here okay [876] so what do we have we have the payment [877] completed then we create a board we get [879] the list of the board here I'm going to [881] feed in the ID here just fixing this I [883] had it hardcoded because I was [884] testing that's going to get the ID of [887] the to-do list we're then going to [888] create two things inside of the to-do [890] list you know I'm just doing this as a [892] straight flow from left to right but [894] something that a lot of people will do [895] is they'll break this flow [898] up where if you're just doing the same [900] thing over and over and over again you [902] will um essentially have a router [906] somewhere where this occurs off of the [909] main branch so you can keep your main [910] branch pretty clean logic wise uh [913] another uh design pattern I've seen is [914] where you will store this data inside of [916] the set multiple variables module [918] instead and then um you'll iterate over [921] whatever is in like an array let's say [923] and then you'll just have one create a [925] card module instead of two to sort of [927] like a weird number though where you [929] know if you were to try and do any of [931] this it would end up you'd end up with [932] more modules than if you just did one uh [935] you know just laid them out like this so [936] I personally just going to leave it like [938] this even though I personally think [939] doing two things in a row that are the [941] exact same is sort of [943] lame and then yeah let's test out the [946] trell flow and see what happens so we're [948] pretending the payment was completed the [949] millisecond the payment's completed [951] we've already created a board for them [953] we've gotten the board list we gotten [956] the ID of the Todo then we've created a [959] card the card is in the to-do at the top [962] the card's called send them a swag box [964] and it's log into swag.com enter the [965] client information and ship their Swag [967] Box and then we also have a record a [969] video introduction task now I have two [972] left click boards so I'm just going to [973] close the one that I'm currently [974] accessing so I can access the new one [976] and then you see that we now have two um [979] you know two items here essentially [980] which is pretty cool um you'll notice [982] that I set this board to public so it's [984] giving us a quick little note the reason [986] why I set this board to public is I just [987] wanted to show you guys that you guys [989] could actually um just share a board [991] with a link and then if you paste in [995] oops that's not what I wanted to do if [996] we go back [998] here we copy this link paste in Trello [1002] then you can actually invite a client to [1004] a board if you wanted to work with them [1005] collaboratively like what you were doing [1007] in design Joy so uh if you were to do [1009] that obviously it wouldn't be tasks like [1011] send them a Swag Box it might be tasks [1013] like um you know hey welcome to this [1015] board we're really excited to have you [1017] thanks so much for doing blah blah blah [1018] blah [1019] um you know you might actually be able [1020] to still do this I've seen a couple of [1023] companies I've worked with a few [1024] agencies at this point where they will [1026] do their project management on some type [1028] of project management software platform [1029] like Trello then they'll actually just [1031] invite the client so the client can at [1032] least see what's going on this is great [1034] if you have strong project management [1036] and if people are actually using the [1037] platform the way it's supposed to so [1038] maybe we actually can yeah maybe that's [1040] uh maybe that's sort of like our our [1042] pitch here we're like a very transparent [1044] agency that does this sort of thing and [1046] we actually allow you to see our project [1048] management so even know where things are [1049] in the pipeline that might be pretty [1050] cool what we'll do then is we'll create [1053] an email so I'm going to [1055] do send an [1059] email I'm going to pretend that we're [1061] sending this from boy I have a lot of [1064] emails here that is not right okay I'm [1067] just going to pretend I'm sending this [1068] from here the email address we have from [1070] the payment information so we'll stick [1072] this here we'll say welcome aboard now [1075] we're going to put their first name in [1078] then I'm going to say [1079] hey first [1081] name brbr this just allows me to add two [1085] spaces through HTML you don't have to do [1087] HTML you could do plain text if you want [1089] but then you can't add links and that [1090] sort of thing so we're going to do hey [1094] brbr just wanted to extend a warm [1102] welcome warm welcome uh I don't know you [1106] can have like a templated thing you know [1107] if the salesperson your team is always [1109] going to be the same salesperson or if [1110] you get that information when the [1111] payment is completed you could say [1112] something like you know Peter ran me [1114] through um you know your [1119] company let's say company [1122] name I'm [1124] excited to build together that looks [1131] nice below you'll find a link to our [1133] project management [1135] board unlike other companies we actually [1138] show you exactly how far along we [1142] are in every project that we do for [1146] you clients love this level of [1150] transparency and [1153] anecdotally I find [1158] people I find [1160] it leads to [1163] healthier communication and expectations [1167] that's nice jeez I'm giving my myself [1168] any business idea here be pretty neat uh [1172] we're just going to paste in the Trello [1174] link so let's see here where is this [1177] link okay URL right [1184] here um let's go a h [1191] Ru I can't do that so I have to paste [1193] this [1194] in then we will add a short URL over [1197] here just so they could see it if they [1199] need to copy and paste or if their email [1201] platform for whatever reason strips [1206] URLs looking [1213] forward kicking this off for you let's [1217] do br br then we'll just do uh I don't [1220] know [1222] thanks then we got to do another BR of [1225] course uh and I'll just pretend that my [1226] name is Nick even though the first name [1228] there is oh it's not actually we're good [1230] even though I'm sending the email to it [1232] myself um that's nice so I like that a [1235] lot and now we have some onboarding done [1237] in Trello basically automatically let's [1239] run through this from top to bottom just [1241] make sure that the email um syntax looks [1244] good no major issues [1247] there awesome this is coming from the [1249] company that I'm working with hey Peter [1250] just wanted to extend a warm welcome oh [1252] I guess Peter is the same name here that [1255] looks really stupid I need to change [1257] that [1259] pretend that Peter is the [1261] salesperson let's say [1264] um commission [1266] salesperson we'll say Peter is the [1268] salesperson and then we will say that [1273] Sarah is the person that we just sold [1276] that'll be a little bit better that way [1278] this is [1280] dynamic so maybe this is like you know [1283] how you keep track of the [1286] salespeople and then I'm also going to [1288] show you guys a quick little Google [1289] Sheets automation after this as well [1291] which I think will be valuable um for [1293] now let's just run this flow [1296] through awesome I've now shot myself an [1299] email the email is pleasant and it says [1302] welcome aboard Sirah just wanted to [1303] extend a warm welcome Peter R me through [1304] left click my company name and I'm [1306] excited to build together below you'll [1307] find a link to our project management [1309] board unlike other companies we actually [1310] show you exactly how far along we are in [1311] every project that we do for you clients [1313] love this level of transparency and [1314] anecdotally I find it leads to healthier [1316] communication and expectations here's [1317] the link looking for to kicking this off [1319] for you I personally love this this is [1322] fantastic you can see that uh you know [1325] since I open this in an incognito and [1326] the board is public I actually have full [1328] visibility and access into where things [1330] are in the process so very very cool um [1333] and you know I think the sort of [1335] approach to agency management is uh is [1337] much dearly needed a lot of the time of [1339] course you know you don't want to give [1340] up away too much of your power by doing [1342] something like this make sure that you [1343] be smart about it um you know if a [1346] client sees that you're overdue or late [1347] or something probably be a silly move [1349] but uh yeah you know you can combine [1351] internal project management with this [1352] sort of external Lea facing view uh and [1355] it's still pretty nice and then you know [1357] if I'm doing something like this um I [1358] would always log the fact that I got a [1360] new client somewhere so I would probably [1363] go [1365] into a Google sheet somewhere [1368] realistically I'm just going to create a [1369] new one here I'm going to call this [1374] um uh I don't know sales dashboard or [1377] something like that and then I would add [1379] a few columns here that I want to track [1381] I'd add the date I'd add the company [1382] name I'd add the amount I'd add the um [1387] client first [1389] name client last [1392] name uh what other information did we [1394] have [1397] here commission [1403] salesperson and then I would make all of [1406] this enter Because I freaking love enter [1409] and then I'm going to go back here to my [1411] Google sheet and basically I'm going to [1413] choose this sales dashboard um and I'm [1416] just going to pretend that I'm logging [1418] this [1419] sale you know I don't show enough of [1422] this in the videos and this is something [1423] that somebody specifically asked me to [1425] do so um I thought that I'd include it [1428] this time so we're just going to pretend [1431] that you know we just did all of this [1432] and now that we've done all this we can [1434] log all of the company information so [1435] company name I'm going to log the amount [1438] this is US Dollars I'm going to do my [1440] client first name client last name make [1443] it abundantly clear what every stage [1446] here means and then we'll do commission [1448] salesperson and I realized now I didn't [1450] put an email address so we'll do email [1451] address down here [1454] too and then I'll do email address here [1457] you don't actually need to define the [1459] board before you set it up um because [1462] the way that all of these fields work is [1464] this is just a column so column F column [1466] G column H because colum G didn't have a [1469] header in it uh it's just being referred [1471] to as column G here but even though I [1473] have gone through added it now I haven't [1475] refreshed this which is why it's still [1476] says G even though there was no header [1478] there that's okay the automation would [1479] still work regardless because it's it [1482] sort of knows to dump it on the the [1483] second row after the uh the rest of the [1485] headers on that line so very simple [1488] payment completed create trailer board [1489] and send email automation as you see [1491] this sort of onboarding thing is EXT [1493] extremely simple and it take it took me [1496] less than probably 15 maybe 20 minutes [1497] put together and that was while also [1499] walking you through sort of the the you [1502] know Trello 101 here you can take the [1504] same approach and you can make this as [1506] complicated as you want you can add as [1508] many steps as you want you could hook [1510] this up to like email newsletter [1511] software and have like a 30 step flow [1514] you could realistically um template out [1517] all of these boards so that they have [1518] EXT extremely granular steps you could [1521] you know invite the person to um three [1526] or four of these maybe for different [1527] retainer verticals or maybe different [1529] service sub offerings that you are doing [1531] for them I I really mean it when I say [1534] that the potential here is Limitless and [1536] I hope that me walking you through the [1538] trell flow and also just showing you [1540] what it might look like to run slightly [1541] more transparent of an operation gave [1543] you guys some ideas all righty uh that [1546] is it for this system let me just do one [1550] final thing it's good practice to um do [1554] all of your data entry before you do the [1556] email so before the client facing stuff [1558] so I'm just going to close all of this [1562] Auto align save run this puppy one last [1566] time I'm going to export the blueprint [1568] so I have it and then for sanity we're [1571] going to go back here and just quadruple [1573] check that it looks good and it looks [1576] fantastic can access our new super [1579] custom [1580] board and if we go on the Google sheet [1583] we'll see that a new record was added [1585] the record uh was bolded just because [1588] Google Sheets will always take the style [1590] of the previous row when new rows are [1592] being added automatically but yeah that [1594] is the system in a nutshell hope you [1596] guys enjoyed that if you have any [1597] questions about how to use Trello [1598] whether uh simple ones like this or [1600] maybe more complex ones for use cases [1602] that I haven't explicitly covered feel [1603] free to drop them down below I'm more [1605] than happy to help thanks to everybody [1606] that's joined my community we're about [1608] to cross 300 members I feel like every [1610] time I record a video every single day [1611] it's like yesterday we're at 100 now [1613] we're at 200 well yesterday we were at [1615] 250 now we're at 300 uh the community [1617] grown

Title: Watch Me Build A Video Generator With Bannerbear & Google Sheets
[0] hey everybody Nick here have you ever [1] wanted to procedurally generate hundreds [3] of videos in maybe a few minutes uh well [5] in this video I'm going to show you [6] exactly how to do that I'm going to use [7] one of my favorite apis in the world [8] Banner bear and I'm going to connect it [10] to make.com uh to essentially allow you [12] to procedurally generate whatever [13] content you want just using a [14] spreadsheet if that sounds like [15] something you guys want to learn then [17] fantastic this is the video for you stay [19] tuned and let's procceed you generate [20] some [24] video first up really really want to [26] thank everybody that's joined the [27] community so far uh when I recorded the [29] video yesterday we're about 150 or so [31] members today we're at 246 so little [34] over 24 hours about 100 people in um [36] capping the community strictly at 400 [38] just to let everybody here know and the [41] reason why is I want to ensure the the [43] communication and the the discussions [44] are consistently high quality I also [46] want to ensure that it's manageable for [47] me and that I don't have to degrade the [49] quality of I'm providing people just [50] because of all of the people inside of [52] the group so that's my goal I firmly [54] believe this is going to be one of the [55] best automation communities on planet [56] Earth if not the best automation [58] community on planet Earth uh you know I [60] really appreciate everybody's help in in [62] making that so this video was suggested [65] by this user here comicazi ub9 KZ who [68] asked I would be really interested in [70] seeing you artificially generate videos [72] based on columns please and thank you [75] and not only am I going to show you how [77] to artificially generate videos based on [79] columns I'm going to show you how to [80] generate essentially any type of Av [83] content well except for just strictly [85] audio but you'll be able to generate [86] like static images you'll be able to [88] generate gifts and we'll also be able [89] ble to generate [91] MP4s um the way that we're going to be [93] doing this is using one of the coolest [95] apis on the planet called Banner bear [98] you may or may not be familiar with [99] these guys but I follow their founder on [100] Twitter and I just really like their [102] their product um these guys are [104] extremely simple most other software [107] platforms or apis that allow you to [109] manipulate images videos templates that [111] sort of thing tend to be really crappy [113] and out of the 15 or 20 that I could [115] have picked I picked Banner bear just [116] because it's basically like one module [118] the great news is they integrate with [120] make so we don't even have to do a bunch [121] of API Shenanigans although I am also [123] going to walk you through that just in [124] case you want to do maybe some more [125] advanced features that sort of thing [127] what we're going to be doing is you know [129] as the video um suggestion requests they [131] say artificially generate videos based [133] on columns so what we're going to be [134] doing is we're going to be um feeding in [137] just a bunch of data to a Google sheet [139] we're going to pretend uh I don't know [141] we can pretend anything maybe I'll do [142] like real estate listings or something [144] we're going to pretend that we have some [145] real estate listings here and then we're [146] going to pull from these real estate [148] listings to populate a template the [150] template's going to I don't know include [152] the price probably of the listing um [155] maybe some brief words about the listing [157] maybe like the address or something like [158] that and then we're actually going to [159] include an image of the the background [161] as well uh so we'll generate a bunch of [163] photos that way um if I can find like [165] some videos of houses or that sort of [166] thing I'll do that as well um and then [170] yeah I'll show you how to generate like [171] actual full length videos too benar also [174] has a transcription feature which is [175] pretty cool so if you guys are doing [176] some type of reals or Tik toks or shorts [180] or something like that you can also just [181] feed in like a video of you talking like [183] literally me talking to you right now I [185] can feed that into Banner bear and it [187] can automatically transcribe it and then [188] do like a cool subtitle overlay so [191] honestly the the um opportunities here [193] are Limitless and I'm just going to give [194] you a broad overview of what you can do [196] I'll make sure to keep it simple um but [198] detailed enough that anybody can take [200] any of the stems that I'm going to build [201] out today and then use them to create [202] their own content production [204] machine okay sweet so without further [207] Ado um let's actually get into it got [209] the banner bear website right over here [212] and I've actually already signed in in [214] another tab I believe it's this one here [217] so I'm just going to close that up um [218] they offer a free trial I think you get [219] like 30 free API calls or something [221] certainly more than enough to test [222] although note that if you do want to do [224] anything substantial with this you are [225] obviously going to have to um you know [228] you're going to have to make an account [229] and pay I think their prices are like 30 [232] 40 or 50 bucks a month okay so a little [235] bit more than that as of right now it's [236] 49 USD a month uh but you know you can [238] produce uh with like a th videos with [241] that which is pretty neat any who this [243] is the essentially dashboard of manner [246] bear what I'm going to do here is the [247] way the man works is it's all based off [249] templates and so essentially they have a [251] bunch of templates that you can choose [252] from and they also have templates that [253] you can create um but you have to you [255] know use I think some special playground [258] or something like that that they have uh [259] what I'm going to do is I'm just going [260] to use one of their default templates [262] just to get up and running quickly make [263] sure this is a 4our video and then uh [265] we'll populate it with photos and then [267] uh I'll choose a video template and then [268] we'll we'll populate with video [270] so in order to do so obviously it's very [271] simple you just click create a project [274] and there are a bunch of templates here [276] um looks like they automatically [277] populated with a welcome template which [278] is pretty easy it says this example [280] template has one text and one image [281] container change the data in the API [283] console to try it out the API console is [286] down here essentially we have uh some [289] Json that it is pretending that we are [291] sending to their API and it allows us [294] just to see how the modifications to [296] this Json reflect as modifications to [298] the template at the end of it so for [300] instance it says this example template [301] has one text and one image container [302] change a data in the API console to try [304] it out this is the text container right [306] here this object so you can change this [309] text I'll do um I don't know welcome to [312] make money withm [316] make.com um the thriving automation [319] Community this is just going to be a [321] giant advertisement and then uh we need [324] a face H I don't actually know if I have [327] a picture of my face let's jump on [330] LinkedIn here LinkedIn to the rescue I [334] want this cheesy photo the way I made [337] this photo the very first time was [338] really interesting I um had a photo of [341] myself oh where am I I had a photo of [344] myself doing the same pose and then I [345] put it through like an AI um filter to [347] make it look like it was drawn and then [350] after I had it drawn I pass it through [351] some other AI filter uh so and it ended [354] up being like 3 a filters and then I [356] pumped it into Photoshop and made it [357] nice and green but you know you can you [359] can see that uh we just sent a request [362] to their API essentially using this mock [364] API tool and then it filled in the text [366] here so now it says welcome to make [368] money withm make.com the thriving [369] automation Community it's got my my face [371] down in the bottom right hand corner the [373] really cool part about Banner bear that [374] a lot of other platforms don't do is [376] these guys do like uh almost like [378] responsive text sizing so if you add way [380] more text in here they'll just make the [382] text smaller to accommodate and they try [383] very hard to make sure that the text [385] fits and everything like that like this [386] is a little bit bigger font than uh than [388] this for instance [390] um so yeah that's pretty neat uh you can [392] change a lot of other things too [393] obviously we can change the background [394] if we wanted to we can change the color [396] of the text we could probably change the [397] font of the text I believe um not super [400] clear on exactly where to edit that but [402] I'm not going to use this in welcome [403] template so I'm just going to throw that [404] away we're going to go back here I'm [407] going to delete [409] this and then we're going to create a [411] template and [413] um actually let me go back here I think [415] there's a quicker and easier way there [416] go browse template library and that's [418] what I'm going to do [420] oh perfect and so there are tons of [422] templates for Real Estate tons of [423] templates for products and everything [425] which is fantastic looks like here is [427] one for some e-commerce product you can [429] imagine how this is going to have some [431] category up here then a title a price [433] and then maybe a list of features with [435] like a logo and a brand um with the [437] image in the background you could [438] procedurally generate these in like 5 [441] milliseconds using Banner barar andm [442] make.com you could probably uh I don't [444] know generate an entire product line of [446] images whether for some type of social [448] media advertisement PPC [450] anything like that but I really like [453] this one here I think which is just a [456] price and then the wow it's really windy [459] outside and then the name of the [461] property and then like marketed bu and [464] that seems pretty simple so I'm going to [465] I'm going to do this uh just so that we [467] can see what this might look like in in [470] practice obviously this is an image of a [472] house you know I know that this is an [473] image of a like a real house um sorry [475] it's a stock image of a house because [477] I've actually used a stock image of a [478] house before that's funny um and then we [480] have a price up here so what I'll do [481] then is just to sort of demonstrate how [483] you can do this procedurally I will um [486] create like my my thing here will be [488] real estate [490] listings actually let's just call this [492] listings and then uh what I'm going to [495] want is I'll want like an image [498] URL I'll want a [501] price and let's just do dollars instead [504] of pounds let's do the [508] title and then and let's do the um [512] realtor maybe we'll do like brokerage is [515] that what that's called real estate [516] brokerage real estate brokerage yeah [520] okay uh great so this is just going to [522] be my data and I'm just going to feed in [523] a bunch of like example data here and [525] then I'll show you how to manipulate [526] this um obviously we should test this [528] before I go much further than that uh so [530] we [531] have um let me see [536] here okay it looks like they've actually [538] added uh sample data feature so I could [540] just add some sample data in here um [543] let's just pretend we're doing like [546] Barcelona and it looks like we can't [549] actually pick like a price okay well [550] that's sort of annoying okay let's do [553] this let's do [554] that let let me just see uh exactly how [557] the tax is laid out on the [559] page okay um so that nullum Vera was [565] marketed by that's what that means so we [567] can actually change what this is we [568] could uh potentially make this like a [569] feature or something but I'm probably [571] just going to use the same phrase like [572] marketed by uh but yeah that looks [574] pretty neat to me um you could probably [576] change the colors too right yeah color [577] null background null I'm just going to [579] keep the same colors CU this looks [580] pretty good to me I mean looks [581] reasonably professional I like it and [583] then uh I'm just going to add a bunch of [585] sample data so I like this sample data [588] like the fact that this [589] is um Barcelona's pretty cool but but [592] actually why don't I just go into I [594] don't know unsplash or something and do [595] this manually that'll be better I'm just [598] going to type in house [600] um orientation I'm just going to say uh [603] probably portrait no that's a little too [606] big we'll just do landscape this looks [608] like a nice house but the plus means [610] that it is licensed so I can't do that [612] there you go these all look nice houses [614] these look like nice [616] houses let's do these three these are [620] going to be my house images and then I [622] believe I can just open these in new [623] tabs and then feed the URL [627] in uh if I can't then I'm dumb and a [631]  but I think that this is going to [635] work um I'll do this one as [638] well and then I'll do this one [642] third we're going to say that this is um [647] I don't know $1 [648] [Music] [649] million it's probably way more than a [651] million dollars realistically this one's [653] $2 million and this is $3 [656] million um the name of this house is is [659] I don't know what does this look like to [660] me this looks like an estate I'll call [662] this like Greenwood estate this one here [666] looks like a I don't know like a like a [669] mountain Villa we'll call this mountain [672] height and that last one will be um H [678] Sunset Lane that's nice and then all [681] three of these brokerages will be Nick [684] let's call it left click [687] Brokers there we go [690] okay great got our sample data set up [691] here and we're going to essentially hook [693] this up to make now and then pump a [695] bunch of image data in and I don't know [697] if that link is going to work uh you do [699] have to provide like an external link as [700] you see here they have an https CDN bner [702] bear instead of you having to like deal [703] with uploading an image downloading [705] image um they just do it really simply [707] like this but uh yeah let's see where we [710] go from here okay so uh we do need to [713] connect our Banner bear account [714] obviously so I'm just going to jump in [716] here and see if there's so they use some [719] API key verification I think we'll we'll [721] just be able to jump in without that I'm [722] just going to go to Banner bear first um [724] you just type in Banner bear and you'll [725] see a listing here and then what we want [728] is we want [730] to [732] um create an image I imagine using a [736] template we'll call this Banner bear [738] test build May 28 [741] 2024 and I have to plug in my computer [744] so give me a second here sometimes this [746] screws up my video recording so if that [747] happens I'm just going to cut out [752] okay I give it like a 50% chance that [754] that video cut out no I'm still good [758] okay so now I'm going [759] to okay so now I'm going to pump in an [761] API key um where do I get this API key [764] from I need [767] to probably go back [772] here oh there we go settings API key in [775] the top right um project API key is [777] probably the one that I want may be [779] mistaken here but it's probably project [781] API [782] key going to paste that put me in and [784] see what [785] happens great looks good now we just [787] have a template uid it's this blue gold [789] modern elegant real estate listing thing [791] um we can add some modifications in here [793] if you wanted to change layers this is a [794] little bit beyond the purposes of this [796] um video but you could like change where [798] the text aligns you could change whether [801] it's on the left or if it's up at the [802] top or if it's up on the bottom they [803] have a list of preset effects that you [805] can add um you can anchor things I don't [807] know exactly what that does but I think [809] it's uh I think it's relatively [810] straightforward when you look through [811] their documentation essentially you have [813] a lot of freedom here and you can do a [815] lot more than what I uh what I'm showing [817] you I just wanted to keep this as simple [819] as [820] possible anywh who um okay great and [823] then yeah so let's pick this and then uh [826] we could basically say whether it's [828] transparent or not we could say whether [830] we're rendering a PDF of the image or [832] not and then uh we could also store some [835] metadata which is interesting so [836] essentially if you wanted to store this [838] data elsewhere you could create a unique [840] identifier here and then pass it to [842] Banner bear to create the image Banner [844] bear would create the image and then it [845] would send it back to this web hook URL [847] you put up here um I'm realizing [849] actually we we do need to add an image [851] here so image URL is the one that I want [854] um what I'm going to do now that I've [856] set up the Manar module is I'm going to [857] add that Google sheet module from before [860] and I'm just going to say like search [861] rows that should be [863] sufficient let me attach the search row [865] module and then what I'm going to do is [866] I'm just going to list all three of [867] these or search through them essentially [869] and then I'm going to feed the results [870] of that data into the banner bear module [873] so I need to pick the right account I'm [875] using this one here and then this one's [877] called AI something AI video content [881] calendar there we [882] go sheet name is going to be listings [885] that's what I'm using for this if you [886] remember I changed the name there [887] because I know we're going to use [888] several and then let's just return one [890] row for now make sure that everything's [891] hunky door it looks like there's an [893] error in here let me just verify uh [895] where that is [900] okay no looks good I'm going to give [902] this a run looks like I got the data [904] from the sheet specifically I got the [906] very first one from Greenwood estate [908] which is nice and then uh I'm going to [910] do this like test data so I'm going to [912] feed in just one entry initially um to [915] this looks like the name is required I [917] don't know exactly why name is [920] required um you I'm not 100% sure so let [924] me just jump over here and [927] see um um oh I got it the name of the [930] layer we want to change is this one here [931] image uncore container so I'm going to [934] go over here call this image uncore [936] container I'm going to feed in um this [940] image URL here from my Google sheet [943] unfortunately this is not allowing me to [946] because um I need to cancel out of this [949] and I believe I need to reconnect [953] this let me just make sure yeah okay now [955] I have access to it sometimes you have [956] to do that it's unfortunate um but make [959] doesn't automatically update the [960] variables in previous modules unless you [963] force it yourself so I got the image URL [964] there that's nice um anyway now I need [967] to add a couple of other modifications [968] essentially the way that this API works [970] is you go through your template which is [973] I don't know over here now okay uh you [976] go through your template which is over [977] here and then every modification has a [979] name and then it has a couple of other [981] variables here like color and all so the [983] name of the modification here is um [984] image uncore container and it has a [987] property called image URL which is what [989] we are editing in that modifications tab [991] so I'm doing all I'm doing is I'm adding [993] the URL of the image here and that's [994] going to modify this um but there's [996] another thing that I want to change as [997] well I want to change the price and then [998] I want to change the text right then I [1000] want to change a few other layers so I'm [1001] just going to go through these [1002] sequentially the second modification I [1005] want to make is going to be to [1008] price and the replacement text I want to [1010] use to this price is uh this dollar [1013] Figure 1 million I'm also just going to [1015] add a dollar sign in front of it so that [1018] should be suff [1019] I'm going to add another modification [1021] and this time I'm going to add the [1022] modification [1023] for uh [1025] location I believe right yes this one's [1030] going to be called location this time [1032] the text is going to be the title of the [1035] property so the name of it Greenwood [1037] Estates and then this one here is going [1039] to be U marketed [1042] by and marketed by I'm just going to [1044] keep as um marketed by [1050] so I'm basically hardcoding the text [1052] every time we run through the scenario [1054] and then marketer is going to be the [1055] last one so marketer and then the text [1057] is going to be the name of the brokerage [1059] left click [1060] Brokers okay great I'm going to run this [1062] thing let's see how this [1065] goes okay it's generated oh I forgot a [1068] web hook URL that's what happened um [1070] essentially what happens is you know [1071] because these image Generations can take [1073] a while they're not instant these apis [1076] don't actually like Run in real time and [1078] then return the result at the end what [1080] they do is they send a web hook [1081] somewhere or sorry they send a request [1083] to Banner Bear's API and then they tell [1085] Banner bear hey when you're done send a [1087] request to this web hook somewhere and [1088] so we're actually responsible for coming [1090] up with that web hook what we need to do [1092] is we need to supply that in this API [1094] call that's what the if I just make all [1096] these smaller [1097] here that's what that web hook URL [1100] column or uh um field is for essentially [1102] so this is going to have to be a minimum [1104] of two [1107] scenarios so what I'll do is is I'll go [1109] to example builds I'll create a new [1110] scenario and I'm just going to call this [1112] catch web Hook from Banner [1116] bear and I'm going to create a web hook [1119] monitor here call this custom web [1122] hook I'll say new Banner bear [1127] um I don't know [1130] generation I'm going to copy this [1132] address of the clipboard and then I'm [1133] going to add it over [1135] here so now when this is done it's going [1137] to send the complete result to this web [1139] hook and I'm just testing this so I'm [1141] just going to run this on its own and [1143] then I'm going to run this scenario one [1144] more time and I'm only using one um you [1148] know uh entry here so it's only going to [1150] run once but you'll see because this was [1152] an image it's done pretty quick you'll [1154] see that the output is image URL and [1156] there's also image URL PNG image URL jpg [1159] and if you remember you could also [1161] produce a PDF if you wanted to so I'm [1163] just going to copy this image URL and [1164] then open it up over here and then [1165] you'll see that nice we actually have [1167] everything that we wanted we have that [1168] beautiful image we have $1,000 green [1170] wooden State marketed by left click [1172] Brokers so why don't we do a couple of [1174] other things just while we're here to [1175] show you the power of this you remember [1177] how there's like a [1178] metadata so I'm going to call this um [1182] row number and then I'm going to feed in [1185] this and so now I'm actually going to be [1186] feeding in the number of the row and [1189] then I also want to actually uh I don't [1191] know if this should be an integer or if [1193] there should just be a um like you know [1195] how I'm not wrapping quotes around it [1196] I'm not sure if this should be an [1197] integer if this should be text but we'll [1198] give it a try and then I'm also going to [1200] feed in spreadsheet [1201] ID and if you're very keen you'll notice [1204] that I'm using a different um kind of [1206] capitalization uh variable naming [1208] convention previously I was using camel [1210] case and I'm using this under score case [1213] uh you can use whatever you want I'm [1215] just trying to be [1217] fancy and then I'm going to uh just test [1220] this once again same idea with this web [1223] hook I'm going to run it I'm going to [1225] run this request Banner bear is [1228] processing it and it's going to send it [1229] back to this web hook and you'll also [1231] see that we now have some metadata and [1233] that includes the row number and the [1234] spreadsheet ID well the really cool [1236] thing about that metadata is now we can [1238] parse this and we could say parse Jason [1241] stick this puppy here what I'm parsing [1243] is I'm uh parsing this metadata row [1245] number whatever now just to save on me [1248] having to like Banner bear only gives [1249] you a certain number of credits or [1250] whatever so I'm not going to actually [1252] generate this I'm actually just going to [1253] go into the output um and just like go [1256] and find the metadata and copy it and [1257] then I'll use it to like C code um into [1260] this parse Json module just to test this [1262] first you see that it comes with these [1263] new lines I don't actually know if these [1264] new lines are required let me see yeah [1267] yeah the I think that just happens when [1269] you present it like when I went and I [1271] clicked um you know look at the output [1273] so this doesn't actually come through [1274] and the text is just an artifact so um [1277] when this runs you won't actually [1278] normally have to do that but anyway I'm [1280] just going to run this parse Json module [1282] and now we have access to row number and [1283] spreadsheet ID and that should be [1285] sufficient for me to go back into my [1286] Google sheet [1290] and then uh I should be able to [1294] update a [1296] cell right over or maybe even update a [1299] row I mean you can do it in a couple of [1301] other ways you could like specify the [1304] exact sheet that you wanted and then the [1307] exact cell number that you [1311] wanted [1314] um yeah that's what I'll do okay great [1316] so anyway we have the spreadsheet ID [1317] from this variable here [1319] the sheet name in my case just going to [1320] be listings right now the cell is going [1323] to be interesting we have the row number [1325] so we know that it's however many down [1327] but we don't actually have a column here [1328] with the name of the generation so I'm [1331] going to call this um let's call this [1334] generated [1337] content and then notice how this is in [1339] the E column right well if I know that [1342] all of my generated content um values [1344] are going to be in the E column and I [1345] know the row number 2 3 4 I have [1348] everything I need to automatically fill [1349] out this cell as part of my flow so I [1352] have the row number first or sorry um I [1354] have the E first and then I have the row [1355] number immediately after then it says [1357] enter the cell ID I D3 well this is [1359] going to be e you know two initially [1360] then E3 then E4 and the value that I'm [1363] going to put in is just going to be this [1364] image [1365] URL and now I basically have like a [1367] two-step pretty like dynamic system [1370] honestly um that uh you know passes a [1373] minimal amount of information between [1375] the two [1376] um what scenarios and then still manages [1379] to do the job so I'm going to return all [1382] three of these rows now I'm going to [1384] save this and then I'm going to run it [1386] and then I you know because I'm running [1388] this multiple times I'm not actually [1389] going you're not actually going to see [1390] it all over here cuz I'm not going to [1392] test the run I just turned this on [1393] instead but if I go back here you'll see [1395] that it's already dumped in the first U [1397] result which is pretty cool and let me [1400] see if there is an issue with the second [1401] result CU it should have dumped in like [1403] basically [1404] immediately yeah know it just dumped oh [1407] right I'm hard coding the data like I'm [1408] more on my bad I've she feeding all this [1411] on let me um go back to web hook uh no [1416] metad data over here my bad I fed the [1419] the data in for the same row so let's [1422] delete that and then let's give that a [1424] another [1426] try this is now running I'm going to [1429] give this one final run let's see if I [1431] ran out of tokens or credits or whatever [1433] okay there we go so we have the first we [1436] have the second we have the Third [1439] first was this green wooden State second [1441] was this mountain Heights estate and [1443] this third one was Sunset Lane very very [1445] nice very very beautiful you'll see just [1448] how quickly and easy it is to generate [1449] this now what if instead you wanted to [1450] weave this into a blog post generator [1452] like one of the ones that I showed you [1453] guys before and instead of just [1454] generating these one-off real estate [1456] images you just have a template where [1459] you feed in maybe the title of the post [1461] and then like an image that you can [1462] Source randomly if you want or maybe you [1464] Source um manually I don't know but then [1467] uh you use that to generate this very [1469] nice templated image which will always [1470] have the dimensions you want it'll [1472] always have the sort of style that you [1473] want and then maybe put that somewhere [1475] in your blog post you can use this to [1476] automatically generate infographics [1478] based off like data or statistics like [1480] honestly the use cases for even just [1481] this simple image generator are pretty [1483] crazy and you know I think that's one of [1485] the reasons why a lot of people like [1486] using Banner bear it's like a oneclick [1487] sort of integration okay but how exactly [1489] do we start creating video now that we [1491] know how to create images well [1493] fortunately for us the Bedrock of our [1494] knowledge is already all good to go all [1496] we need to do is change um the image [1499] part to a video part and that's just one [1501] module and a couple of Minor stylistic [1503] Adjustments um which you know was just [1505] going to take us a couple minutes so I'm [1507] just going to create a new scenario here [1508] called list Google sheet rows and then [1510] create video using Banner bear instead [1511] of image it's going to do the same thing [1513] we're going to search through the [1515] rows I'm just doing this manually but [1517] you could have just copied the previous [1518] scenario if you wanted [1520] to um what I'm doing here is AI video [1523] content calendar right over [1525] there sheet name is oh great we need to [1528] create another sheet my bad let's do [1531] video content [1533] um let's just do Vacations or something [1537] uh yeah let's do vacation videos that'll [1539] be [1539] straightforward uh because I just added [1541] this in I have to refresh this so oops [1545] that's annoying um we're going to click [1547] that little refresh icon it's just going [1548] to go and pull new sheets so we have [1550] vacations instead of [1553] listings and then we're not going to do [1555] any of this uh maximum return R is going [1557] to do one and and then Banner bear has a [1560] create an image module which is what we [1561] used before but also has create a video [1563] module and that's what we're going to be [1564] using now the create a video module is [1566] very similar there are a couple of [1568] differences U the main one being that [1569] instead of choosing an image template [1571] uid we're going to choose a video [1572] template uid and then we actually need [1574] to add an input media URL so I'll [1576] explain all that right now basically um [1579] if I go to this myu project here Banner [1581] bear separates all of your work in a [1582] project so my new project which is the [1584] first one that I created um I've gone [1585] through and I've created a video example [1587] here I just did that a couple minutes [1588] ago when my recording broke but [1590] essentially we have this video example [1592] if I give this a click you'll see that [1595] um there is basically this green bar in [1598] the background and this green just [1599] represents whatever your video will be [1601] and then there's a dark overlay and that [1603] overlay includes some text so the way to [1605] get to that is if you go to my new [1608] project and then you press um create [1610] video [1611] template I just went to test this out [1613] with Sample video template and that's [1615] what it created um there are a bunch of [1617] different options for you you can do an [1620] overlay and an overlay is what I just [1621] showed you it's where you have like a [1622] background video it's some green bar and [1624] then you have like an overlay on top uh [1626] you can do transcribe and transcribe is [1628] what I was alluding to earlier where I [1629] was saying you know you can essentially [1631] have a talking head video just like me [1632] and then you can slam a bunch of cool [1633] captions down there if you've ever seen [1635] these YouTube shorts or you know Tik Tok [1637] reels or whatnot a lot of the time [1639] they're either using Banner bear or [1640] they're just using like Premier Pros [1641] built-in captioner and then you can also [1643] do multi overlay multi overlay is where [1644] you're trying to weave together three or [1646] four Clips instead of just one uh so if [1647] you want have like a 30 second video [1649] with three clips of 10 seconds each you [1650] can kind of finagle that there but [1652] because I'm trying to keep this as [1654] simple as possible we're just going to [1655] be doing a sample video template which [1657] includes just the overlay so that's what [1659] I'm doing here back uh at this video [1661] template here once you create the video [1664] template um you know mine's just called [1665] video example it'll populate underneath [1667] the video template section and then you [1669] can just do all the same stuff that we [1670] were doing previously there's an API [1671] console where you take an input media [1673] URL bunch of text and and that sort of [1675] thing and what I'm going to do right now [1676] is I'm I'm going to show you what a [1678] couple of these Generations looks like I [1680] went through you know about 20 minutes [1682] ago and I was recording the second half [1683] of this before my mic uh bugged out on [1685] me and I generated a couple and this was [1687] sort of what I what I came up with [1690] essentially we have a video in the [1691] background and then this overlay section [1692] is slightly darker which allows us to [1694] see white text on a little bit better [1696] and then there's an array for you to put [1697] like a logo or something so what I did [1699] was I was like hm I'm going to pretend [1701] that I'm a vacation company and I'm [1702] selling Vacations or something you know [1704] I'm company name Logo down here I didn't [1706] want to use real vacation company just [1708] because uh I heard that that affects [1709] your monetization potential and that [1710] sort of thing so I am now using example [1712] logos uh the death of creativity um and [1716] then you know maybe I'm just trying to [1717] advertise these vacations based off a [1718] big database of like new deals that come [1720] up for like a flight or something you [1722] you can visit Portland Oregon for just. [1724] 199 I don't know if this is Portland OR [1725] again now that I'm looking at it looks [1727] more like Europe to me but uh why don't [1729] I change that in my in my new um [1732] generation here any who uh what I'm [1734] going to do is I'm going to go to [1734] listings and then this looks pretty good [1737] the image you I'm just going to change a [1738] video URL price I'm going to change an [1741] image URL we're going to need this for [1742] like the logo let's call this logo [1744] URL um and then we'll just have a text [1747] section and then we'll just have a [1748] generated content link same as before [1751] and we're just going to go through this [1752] in more or less the the same fashion um [1756] you know I'm going to populate this [1757] sheet with some content here uh what I [1759] need is a video now previously I used [1762] these were images uh previously I used [1764] pixels for this and I got a video from [1766] Alexander Bob um before my mic bugged [1768] out on me so I'm just going to get a [1769] different one and maybe instead [1771] of I don't know Portland Oregon or [1773] something now we're doing Niagra Falls I [1777] don't know I don't actually know where [1778] this is this almost looks like the Great [1780] Wall of China or some crazy crap like [1782] that but that looks pretty nice um what [1784] I've done here is I've gone to [1785] pexels.com and um pexels is just like a [1787] free video and photo stock site you know [1790] they do both and then I'm going to [1792] download this here now unfortunately [1794] because of some quirks and how like MP4s [1796] are hosted a lot of the time it's very [1798] difficult to do this so I've created a [1799] Google drive here called Banner bear [1801] test content and I'm just going to [1802] upload this video here and essentially [1804] what we have to do is cuz we're [1805] providing a URL of the content we're not [1806] actually providing like uh the you know [1810] um oh jeez which one was it two two 26 [1813] uh we're providing a URL to the content [1815] we're not actually like uploading the [1816] content we just have to make a couple of [1818] tweaks the way that we're hosting stuff [1819] on our own Google Drive uh but you know [1821] as long as you get the content in a [1822] downloadable format it's fine uh it just [1824] doesn't work from pixels directly they [1825] probably have some rate limiting or [1826] something going on so anyway I've [1828] generated a Google Drive Link here and [1830] then um you know I have to do some uh I [1833] have to convert this link to a direct [1835] download link the reason why is cuz if [1837] you're trying to use Google Drive to do [1839] this um notice how this generates like a [1841] preview but it's not actually like to [1843] download the image if I want to download [1844] the image I have to click another button [1846] which is this one here and then this URL [1848] up here this is my actual like download [1850] so um you know another hack to do that [1853] is just to use this Google Docs um to [1856] direct download link visibility [1859] uh you know website so I'm just giving [1860] this a right click I'm going to share [1862] copy link and then I'm pumping this in [1863] here and you'll see that it just like [1864] moved the the IDS around a little bit [1867] and this is just you know Google dries [1869] Syntax for direct downloads so you know [1871] I wouldn't worry too much about that the [1873] vast majority of URLs are going to work [1875] um but you know in our case because I'm [1876] using this Google Drive I sort of have [1878] to do it this way any who we're going to [1880] use this video example and then uh the [1883] video URL I'm just going to paste in [1884] here and I'm just going to hard code one [1886] row here instead of like 20 rows like [1887] like I was doing before or three rows um [1889] just because I want to make sure that [1891] I'm being cognizant of how many manner [1892] bear API credits I have I think I'm [1894] probably like one or two more uh I'm [1896] just going to type in example logo for [1898] the [1899] image I just want something that looks [1901] kind of hotell that previous one did not [1903] look hotell at all definitely no use [1907] Starbucks um this example logo looks [1910] reasonable right click open a new tab I [1913] have a JPG which is good and then I can [1915] just copy this URL and paste it in my [1916] logo URL column the text I'm going to [1918] say visit um oh man I have no [1924] idea uh where would that possibly [1930] be let me do a shout out to my people [1933] this this could be some Bulgarian River [1936] somewhere visit Bulgaria from just let's [1940] do 599 and because we're talking Europe [1944] here why don't we slap a euro in there [1947] how do I do a Euro like [1949] this oops let's not do that O [1953] Beautiful yeah that looks kind of like [1955] Bulgaria I want on a few hikes I know [1956] what I'm talking about surely um and [1959] then yeah we we should have everything [1960] we need we have the video URL which is [1961] going to be that green background [1962] replace with this we have a logo URL [1964] which is going to be that bottom left [1965] hand corner image and then the text is [1967] going to be white so it should be good [1969] um input media URL uh oh what I have to [1973] do here is I have [1974] to first of all I have to cancel this [1977] and I have to unlink that [1978] this and then you'll notice that there [1980] are some red circles around [1983] things so I'm going to redo that I'm [1985] going to run this module and the reason [1986] why I'm going to run [1989] it is because I want to get the actual [1992] data and then I'm going to connect this [1993] Banner bear module and it still has a [1996] red circle around it because you need to [1997] cancel this [1999] out and then uh open it up again and now [2002] we should have access to the Google [2005] Sheets data which we now do the input [2007] Med URL is going to be this video URL [2009] and then we're going to need to make a [2010] few changes in our modifications if you [2012] guys remember what we did previously [2013] with Banner bear we basically just [2015] looked to see what the variables were so [2017] there are three variables here input [2018] media URL which we've already filled out [2020] text and then Avatar so I'm going to do [2022] one called text I'm going replace it [2025] with this text then I'll do one other [2028] modification and I'll call it Avatar and [2030] I'll replace the image URL with this [2033] logo [2035] URL and uh the only thing we need to do [2038] now is we just need to create another [2039] web hook flow so I'm going to just copy [2043] this [2045] URL yeah so um let's [2049] do so yeah this was the video one so I'm [2052] going to um copy this uh web hook and [2055] I'm just going to use it in the flow [2057] here and now uh Banner bear is going to [2060] send the completed result after this is [2063] done to this web hook URL if you guys [2066] remember previously we also had some [2067] metadata so I think there was [2068] spreadsheet ID so I'm going to add in [2072] this spreadsheet ID then I'm also going [2074] to do row number and then I'm just going [2076] to feed in this variable or this number [2079] here and then there's one final variable [2081] called trim to length and seconds I'm [2082] just going to do six seconds if you [2084] think about the generation time that [2086] Banner bear will use versus uh when [2087] you're doing a video versus an image [2089] it's going to be a lot more because an [2090] image is one frame and then a video is [2092] 24 frames per second so I don't really [2095] want to spend an hour testing this but [2097] obvious so you can make the length [2098] whever you [2099] want okay should have everything done [2101] here let's go back to this web hook [2103] catcher just verify that everything's [2105] good so we have parsing Json from the [2107] metadata then we're going to update a [2109] cell um the cell that we need to is if I [2112] go to the sheet name it's Vacations so [2115] we're going to call this vacations and [2117] then the row that I want is whatever the [2119] row number will be so we're going to add [2120] that in and then we'll do column D so um [2124] it'll be D and then row number and then [2126] the value of that is going to be [2129] something called video URL here okay [2131] that looks good to me all right so I'm [2133] going to run this now and then I'm going [2135] to go back to this initial trigger [2137] module and then I'm just going to give [2138] it a [2139] run I'm going to click on this Banner [2141] bear button here and then um you'll see [2144] the status has changed to rendering that [2145] means that it's actually working right [2147] now and so instead of it doing a photo [2149] request we're doing a video request but [2151] as I imagine you know it's going to take [2152] a lot longer because we're doing 24 [2153] frames a second time 6 seconds my math [2156] Ain't So Good 144 [2158] um it's not going to take 144 times the [2160] length they're a lot more optimal than [2161] that but it's still going to take a lot [2162] longer and then it'll go through and [2164] it'll update the cell and so now we have [2165] a generated piece of content right over [2167] here and just to be safe I'm going to [2171] um pause this immediately okay great and [2175] then I'll run it [2176] again yeah that to me looks awesome now [2178] imagine you could procedurally generate [2180] 50 of these if you wanted to doesn't [2181] just have to be one right you could run [2183] the search rows um Or List yeah search [2186] sheet module every day you could also if [2189] you wanted to be fancy about it you know [2190] how I call this a Content calendar you [2192] can have a date [2194] field um what month 3 [2197] we5 and you could have a bunch of [2200] different post scheduled for different [2203] days I don't know if there's um another [2206] day in May probably not and then what [2209] you could do is you know when you do the [2210] the search you could for [2213] instance set it so that you know the [2215] date has to be equal to whatever the [2218] current date is and the way that you do [2220] that is uh you just do like format date [2223] now and then you just pump in whatever [2225] the format here which I think was [2228] DayDay uh month month and then what year [2232] year [2233] year you know hypothetically and then [2236] this way uh if you run it on a schedule [2238] so that it runs once a day every day [2240] that this runs it will only filter [2242] entries that have the date equal to the [2244] current date so assuming you're doing [2246] one post per day then youd get those you [2247] generate the content then maybe you [2249] could have like a posted column for like [2251] project management maybe a virtual [2252] assistant or somebody else in your team [2253] is going through this once a day and [2254] just like taking the generate content [2256] and posting you know you can do so much [2257] with these sorts of flows it's [2259] mind-boggling but yeah that's how you [2260] generate a video um aside from that yeah [2263] no real nuances uh you need to know [2265] there there are a couple of other [2267] modules here too like um update a video [2270] where you could take a video that you [2271] have created previously and then change [2273] it and then Banner bear also has its own [2275] project management where you can approve [2276] a video and do a couple other things um [2278] and then you know you can also create an [2279] animated gif down here which is [2281] basically the exact same flow as what I [2283] mentioned in the video uh it's just now [2285] you're setting a frame rate essentially [2288] in addition to uh what we were doing [2290] previously then you also have the [2292] opportunity to add individual frames [2293] which is pretty neat as well I really [2295] like Banner bear as I mentioned [2297] extraordinarily simple uh and there's [2299] just so much you can do with it okay [2300] thanks so much for watching this video I [2302] really appreciate everybody that's [2304] either joined the community or even [2306] given me a small slice to their [2307] attention today on YouTube uh the the [2309] growth over the course of the last [2311] couple of months has been honestly quite [2313] quite shocking um you know I knew that I [2315] was delivering value but I just didn't [2317] realize that it was uh impacting as many [2319] people as it has been so I feel very [2321] blessed and very grateful to be uh to [2323] have been given this opportunity and uh [2325] yeah I'm looking to make the most of it [2327] for everybody in my community and [2328] everybody in my audience if you guys [2330] have any more questions about this flow [2332] just drop them down below as a comment [2333] I'm more than happy to help you if you [2334] guys have any uh comments or suggestions [2337] for future videos I'm also more than [2339] happy to do them I Source most of my [2341] video ideas at this point for my [2342] audience people just ask hey how do I do [2344] this or hey how do I do that and I'll [2345] literally just sit down record a 45 [2347] minute or 50 minute video uh and then [2349] tag you with it so pretty cool stuff [2350] other than that please like subscribe do [2352] all that fun YouTube stuff I'll catch [2353] you on the next video thanks so much

Title: Watch Me Build An AI Parasite SEO System Using Medium
[0] hey everyone Nick here and in this video [1] I'm going to be building a medium [3] parasite SEO scraper this is essentially [5] going to run an entire parasite campaign [8] for you using Medium as the data source [10] it's then going to process the Articles [12] rewrite them using Ai and then in our [14] case it's going to publish them on uh [16] just a Google sheet for for simple [18] project management access but I'll also [19] show you guys how to hook this up to [20] Wordpress so you can basically create [22] like your own automatic content Mill if [24] you would like I'm fully aware that this [26] is a very dangerous topic to choose [27] especially now with Google changing so [29] many it guidelines but I just had so [31] many people ask me for how to do this [33] that I thought I'd just dropped the [34] knowledge anyway if you guys want to do [36] this for yourselves if you guys are [37] curious about how parasite scrapers and [39] parasite SEO campaigns work this is the [41] video for you stay tuned and let's get [43] into [47] it okay first things first thanks so [49] much to everybody that's joined my [50] community I was not expecting to hit 150 [52] members in like 72 hours uh I've capped [55] this at 400 so no more people than 400 [57] can enter this community simply because [59] I want it to remain very high value I [60] want it to remain consistently valuable [63] and useful to everybody that's in it um [65] I'm increasing the price by $10 every 40 [68] people that joined so the price that it [70] was 3 days ago was 28 I think now it's [71] up to 58 or maybe $68 and the reason I'm [74] doing that is just to represent the [75] additional value added to the community [77] and also uh you know logistically how [79] much time and energy it takes me and and [81] maybe other people to manage it but if [83] you want to get in uh I encourage you [85] guys to you know give that a quick look [87] through and again I want to thank [88] everybody that's joined so far it's been [89] been super great having youall without [91] further Ado let's get into how to build [93] this medium parasite SEO campaign first [97] thing we need to understand is how [98] medium Works medium is a Blog service [100] essentially it's like Facebook mixed [103] with a WordPress blog you have all of [105] the same functionality of most other [106] social media platforms so you have the [108] ability to like a post you have the [110] ability to comment on a post um if you [113] click through you'll be able to [114] obviously read the blog post and one of [116] the really valuable things about medium [118] is it essentially allows you to [120] like you can post on medium and then you [122] can also just post on your own blog and [123] sort of cross post the two and then [125] because medium is a social network [126] medium will advertise the blog post for [127] you so that's sort of the value for a [129] lot of these medium bloggers I used to [131] be a medium blogger as well not to toot [133] my own horn but I think I uh Once Upon a [136] Time got 2,000 followers it's pretty [138] cool um and I've just found it to be [140] like a fantastic source for for blog [143] posts and parasite SEO campaigns I built [145] out one uh that's worked very well [148] although obviously this may be a little [150] bit controversial because it's parasite [152] and you know you're essentially [153] rephrasing somebody's content to rank on [155] social media sorry rank on Google but [157] let's be real here um search engines are [159] just a game at this point and if you can [161] game the game then you're probably in a [163] pretty good position to make a bunch of [164] money on the internet so we're going to [166] be scraping all these posts and then [168] we're going to be rewriting them using [170] Ai and then we're going to be uh posting [172] them uh and I'm not going to like do the [173] whole posting thing I'm just going to [175] show you how to do it if you wanted to [176] post on let's say WordPress or you [177] wanted to make a Google doc you know [179] that that whole step is pretty [180] straightforward um the way that we're [182] going to be doing that is we're going to [183] be scraping using apify apify is a web [185] scraping service that essentially allows [188] you to uh scrape anything in the whole [191] wide world that you could ever possibly [192] want you could scrape like Facebook [194] Instagram LinkedIn Tik Tok um literally [198] any data source that is publicly [200] available probably has an apify actor [203] which is the term for uh like a scraping [205] service that somebody's built for it so [208] the way that you do is first you sign up [209] and then very generous with their TRS I [210] think I've mentioned this a couple times [212] jeez I feel like I should be on their [213] advertising team at this point then you [216] go over to store and then you just type [217] in whatever you want so Instagram [218] scraper there are thousands that scrape [221] posts mentions reals um LinkedIn scraper [224] Google Maps scraper right the one that [226] we're going to be using is going to be [227] medium scraper so I'm going to type [229] medium scraper in here and then there [230] are two ones that we can pick from [232] there's um this one by Ivan vs and then [234] there's this one by qpa y re I was just [237] using the one by Ian vs but honestly [238] just to show you guys that that you can [240] use different um you know like different [242] scrapers I'm going to use this one looks [245] like this one takes an author name and [246] then a number of posts so you could set [248] this up to scrape like a giant list of [250] authors if you wanted to I'm going to [252] limit the number of posts to let's just [254] do three and looks like we can also [256] scrape the article content as well so [257] I'm going to click article content very [259] straightforward very simple um it looks [261] like there's a trial and then it's $20 a [263] month so I'm just going to go ahead with [264] the trial you imagine that if you wanted [266] to run a parasite SEO campaign the [267] potential upside of a campaign like this [269] scrap Shing 1,000 posts a month or [271] something is way higher than $28 so [273] you'd probably be more than happy to [274] spend it um but in our cases the free [277] usage that we have here it's going to be [278] more than enough we're not going to need [279] more than uh $5 of free usage in order [281] to run this any who I'm doing this [283] because I just want to test the data I [285] want to show you guys the data and then [286] I want to strategize and sort of figure [288] out live in front of you how we're going [290] to build out the rest of this um one [292] thing that a lot of people have [293] mentioned has been really valuable is [294] just hearing my thought processes out [296] loud not necessarily me just knowing [298] everything about the system that I want [299] to build ahead of time so that's what [300] I'm doing here okay looks like the [303] scraper worked great we received a [305] column called author another column [306] called author URL uh column called body [309] publish that and then we have raw [310] article and raw article is going to [312] contain all the text of the piece that [313] we're going to be attempting to rewrite [315] we also have the title which is valuable [316] then we have the URL if I don't know we [318] wanted to store the URL for our purposes [320] if maybe a human being was looking over [321] the system or something like that so all [323] these are very positive you'll notice [325] that the um raw body here is sort [330] of crazy it's just a bunch of HTML so [334] you know in my head I'm thinking okay [335] well you know if I want to rewrite this [336] I'm going to have to convert the HTML [338] into text so that's not going to be too [340] big of an issue and then I'm also [342] thinking okay we got a title so if I [344] want to make a parasite SEO [346] campaign you know it's going to be tough [348] to know the keywords but I'm just [350] assuming that we're just rewriting this [351] without care for the keyword uh it's not [353] perfect but it's not it's not the worst [355] either and it'll make our lives a lot [356] easier we could also have ai come up [358] with keywords of course um although I [360] think that that's a little bit beyond [361] the scope of this video so yeah that's [363] uh this should be everything that we [364] need in order to make the parasite [366] campaign so what we could do is we could [368] run this apify [370] scraper I don't know daily or something [373] like that you know let's say we're [374] following a publication it's not Nick's [376] arrive but it's just some account that [378] spits out 50 articles a day or something [380] we could run this daily and then uh [383] basically let's say we run it at 5:00 [385] a.m. uh at 5:00 a.m. we would take all [388] of these posts and we would dump them [391] into our make.com scenario make.com [394] would then do the rewriting and then we [395] could turn it into a Google doc or maybe [398] a WordPress post and then we could add [399] it to a Google sheet and then maybe in [401] this case we want a human in the loop so [403] the human would be responsible like [405] their job essentially would be [406] responsible would be to look through the [408] Google sheet like maybe once a day and [410] then just Mark whether or not the thing [411] was posted that sounds pretty simple I [413] think that's a pretty solid use case and [414] that's something that a lot of companies [415] could probably start implementing ASAP [417] so that's going to be what we're going [419] to do I'm going to assume that we're [420] just going to be scraping the same [421] publication so I'm not actually going [422] like I'm just going to be hardcoding in [423] Nix or just because I don't want to [425] scrape somebody's data that's not mine [427] um but yeah you know in the future you [430] could modify this to pull from a variety [432] of authors if you had like a 100 authors [433] and you want to do this once a day you [434] could do that as well um tons of stuff [437] that you could do I told you guys that [439] I'd be getting into trouble here from [440] making a parasite [441] campaign okay so I have a scenario open [443] here called parasite medium SEO system [446] and let me think what else do I need I [448] mentioned a Google sheet [450] so I'm going to want to create a Google [451] sheet here I don't remember what account [453] I'm in so just give me a moment [455] to uh no I need to make a web hook if I [458] use that unfortunately so let's just do [460] add [462] row and [464] then I think I want this [467] one and I'm just going to log back into [470] the service unfortunately it's very [471] finicky and it always logs me [474] out that's annoying that is also [477] annoying [479] is super [480] annoying I knew that would work [483] eventually okay great and then I'm going [485] to make a Google sheet and I'm just [486] going to call this Google sheet [488] um medium parasite SEO [492] scraper or let's just do medium parasite [495] SEO [496] campaign and then uh on this side I'm [500] just going to pick it up because I just [501] want to you know have it all open here [502] so I'm just going to connect to it [504] immediately [505] um we want [507] medium parasite SEO campaign there we [510] go sheet name is just going to be sheet [513] one and then that's all I just want to [516] connect to it and then um the first [518] thing that we need to do is we need to [520] uh get the apify run so basically for [522] scheduling this in API uh it's just [524] going to run every day at whatever time [526] we tell it to and what we need to do is [527] in make.com we need to watch for it to [529] complete and so I'm going to go over [531] here and I'm going to type in apify [532] there are a bunch of different apify [533] actor modules here and the one that we [536] want is watch actor runs this is a [538] trigger module that's why why doesn't [539] have anything on the left hand side of [540] it this is going to be the beginning of [542] our flow and I'm just dragging over the [544] uh basically like the trigger scheduler [546] here this used to be the trigger this is [548] now the trigger uh so we're then going [550] to create a web hook I'm going to call [552] this finished medium scraper the can I'm [556] going to use here is this one and then [558] the actor is going to be there two [560] medium scrapers I think it was QP that [561] was the one that I was using right so [563] we're going to do that then I'm going to [566] go to okay and then uh we have the watch [570] actor run now what I'm going to do is [573] I'm going to run this and then I'm going [575] to run this medium scraper again and the [578] reason why I'm doing this is because I [580] just want to um I want to test this flow [583] and I also just want to see the results [584] in make Now API is a little bit more [587] difficult to work with than maybe some [589] services that you guys could be familiar [591] with you don't just watch and grab all [593] of the data in that one module that we [595] have set up here this watch actor runs [597] we actually need to watch the actor run [598] and then we're going to get like a [599] thumbs up basically telling us that it's [601] run and then we're going to need to uh [603] make another call to apify to [605] specifically get the data that we want [607] um so it's going to be sort of like a [608] two-step thing but uh you know it's [609] still relatively simple and if you guys [610] have seen my previous apify videos where [612] I scrape like everything from Twitter to [614] Instagram uh you you you'll know what I [616] mean by how simple it is okay so this [618] just finished and then we receive the [620] result in make.com what we need is we [622] need the default data set ID here so [625] I'll go back in apify and then we need [627] to go to the get data set items module [630] and what I'm going to do is I'm going to [632] just feed in the data set ID hardcoded [634] here I just copied it directly from the [636] output of watch actor runs because I [638] just want to test this flow and this is [639] just going to be the beginning of my [640] test from now on so we're going to right [642] click this run and now we see all of the [644] data that we need we got the title we [646] got the URL we got the author we got the [648] raw article here this [650] HTML and uh yeah we got everything else [652] too so that's pretty [654] nice okay great so now that we have that [657] um I want to convert the HTML into raw [658] text [659] the way that I personally do this is I [661] go HTML then text par will come up and [664] then we just go HTML to [666] text and what we want to do is we want [668] to feed in this rawcore article here [671] which has all the HTML now if I click [674] run it'll watch the AP IFI act or run [676] again so what I need to do in order to [677] test just from the get data set items [679] onwards is I need to just move this [681] trigger over and then I need to run from [682] here it's going to tell me that a [684] Transformer should not be the last modu [685] on the route that's [687] okay what I'm going to do is looks like [689] I got three results here which is [690] interesting I don't know why I got three [693] so let's see what [698] happened okay so couple things here it [700] looks like I'm getting text that isn't [702] necessarily the article that I [706] want oh and I guess it's running three [708] times because they're three articles [712] duh yeah it looks like I'm not getting [714] just what I want I'm getting some [716] additional information um that ends in [718] share and then my post [721] begins [722] so this tells [726] me okay and then it ends with NI so this [728] tells me that um assuming all of the [730] posts have the same format where share [732] is the last thing before the article [735] begins we could [737] probably um sorry I'm looking at the [739] input there we could probably just parse [741] it with like a line like a separator [744] we'd split it at share and then we just [745] get everything Beyond this [748] line okay that looks good same thing and [751] then bundle number three share as well [754] so this looks pretty good to me yeah um [757] but aside from that we we just get the [758] text which is nice so we can feed that [760] text in AI these articles are pretty [762] short uh this may not work if your [763] articles are a little bit longer I don't [765] mean it's not going to work it's just [766] not going to work as well essentially [768] the way that you do rewriting is you [769] break down posts into bullet points and [771] then you re expand the post from the [774] bullet points back into full articles so [776] if it's super long sometimes AI won't do [778] a very good job of it but that's all [779] right what I'm going to do next just for [781] completeness of sake is I'm going to go [783] over here to set multiple [785] variables and then I'm just going to [786] call [787] this um raw [790] text I'm going to feed in raw article [793] and then oh sorry I'm going to feed in [795] text and I'm going to use the split [797] function and I'm going to split this [799] right at [800] share and then what I'm going to do is [801] I'm going to get the second result which [804] is everything after the [806] share now there may be multiple shares [809] so I'm just going to run this first and [810] see if there are multiple shares I'm [812] going to have to adjust my Approach a [813] little [817] bit but no it looks like this worked [820] perfectly and I got the second half of [822] the response which is just my article [824] which is what I [825] want now I can't guarantee this is going [827] to work every single time um let me just [830] see if there's perh perhaps anything [832] else that I could use instead of just [835] share so what I could probably do is I [837] could do new line share new line but I [841] don't know if that'll be perfectly [842] represented here so let me just [845] see we'll go new line share and then new [849] line going to run this [853] again yeah okay that's better if you [855] think about it the word share in and of [857] itself may come up again at some point [859] in this article you know since the first [861] few results look to be um they're just [865] showing other blog posts if one of those [866] blog posts had the word share in the [868] title it would have split [869] inappropriately so this way at least [870] insulates us a little bit and we're only [872] splitting if it's new line share new [873] line which is presumably a lot less [875] common so now we have a variable called [878] rawcore text which is our um you know [881] obviously our our AI [884] ready article and we need to rewrite [887] this so I'm going to add an open AI [889] module [891] here and I'm going to have to do a fair [893] amount of training on this to make it [894] work and I'm going to be including um [896] all of the uh you know prompt uh stuff [899] like that so you guys are going to have [900] everything that you need in the [901] blueprint at the end of this video but [903] uh I'll walk through some of it with you [905] guys and then I'll just skip ahead so [907] first things first I'm setting Max [909] tokens to 4096 if I go down to advanced [911] settings I set the temperature to 0.7 [913] all the time it's just my personal [914] preference but I find the results [915] usually a little bit better that way and [917] there are a couple things that we're [918] going to change if you guys have seen me [919] do previous AI stuff uh we're going to [921] set the frequency penalty and the [923] presence penalty to values above zero [925] the reason why is because the way that [927] frequency penalty works is it penalizes [929] is the likelihood of new tokens based [930] off of their occurrence in the text so [932] far if um they've occurred before many [935] times it'll make them less likely to [937] occur again so if you think about it [939] from a rewriting perspective if the my [941] text that I'm rewriting says hello my [943] name is Nick it will decrease the [945] likelihood of saying those exact same [947] words of verbatim um as an output if you [950] increase the frequency penalty and the [952] presence penalty the two work quite [954] similarly uh presence simply penalizes [957] if the text is Pres ever so it's sort of [960] like a 0 to one it's like is that text [961] present if no then same likelihood of [964] occurring if yes then penalize this flat [966] amount uh frequency penalty is [969] cumulative so if the text occurs more [971] often then it will penalize it more uh [973] but in my case I'm just going to do 0.6 [975] here and then I'll do a [976] 0.5 so those are sort of like the [978] advanced tweaks that I'm making next up [981] I'm going to Define some simple prompts [982] the way that I always do things is I [984] will always Define a system prompt ahead [985] of time where I have it Define its [987] identity basically and I'll usually say [989] something along the lines if you're a [990] helpful you're a helpful intelligent [991] writing [993] assistant and then for the next prompt [996] I'll do user and I'll say your task is [999] to convert a blog post into a list of [1004] extremely detailed bullet [1007] points what I'll do next is I'm going to [1009] train it and the way that I train it in [1011] my case is I usually provide it three [1013] examples of what I wanted to do and then [1015] on the fourth I provide it the actual [1017] data and I say go ahead show me what you [1019] can uh show me you can accomplish and [1021] the way to do that systematically and in [1023] a structured manner is you start off [1025] with a user prompt where you give it an [1027] example and then you have an assistant [1029] prompt where it answers the example then [1031] you do user again and then it does [1033] assistant again then I do user one last [1035] time and assistant one last time and at [1037] the end of this it's reasonably [1038] intelligent and it sort of knows what [1039] I'm looking for now this is beyond the [1042] scope of this video but what I'm going [1043] to do over the course of the next few [1044] minutes before I after I cut is I'm just [1047] going to go out find some blog posts and [1049] then convert them into very detailed [1050] bullet points just to give it an example [1052] of what I want it to do and then on the [1053] back end I'm going to do the inverse I'm [1055] going to create another GPT for our [1057] prompt our module and then I'm going to [1059] have it take a list of bullet points and [1061] convert that into a full article so [1063] again this is sort of manual work that [1064] you're only really going to have to do [1065] once um after you do it once you're [1067] going to be able to run systematically [1069] uh on Auto on autopilot but you know [1071] like any worth having takes a little bit [1074] of hard work at the beginning so I'll [1076] see y'all in a minute all right so we [1077] have two AA modules now the first was [1079] the same one that I showed you guys [1080] previously I've just went and I've added [1082] a bunch of examples uh just using my own [1084] data because I'm using my own data and I [1086] actually used to run a newsletter called [1088] the cusp which has a very particular [1090] format I imagine this probably going to [1092] do a little bit better on my articles [1093] than it will for most other articles but [1095] you guys can just change the prompt up a [1097] little bit and make sure that it's not [1098] super structured if you guys don't like [1099] the outputs essentially what I've done [1101] is I've went through my blog and then I [1104] got a couple of blog posts so this was [1107] one on how am models can now surf the [1109] Internet for you keep in mind this is [1110] like 2 years ago so things have gone [1112] really really far since then and then um [1116] I had an assistant prompt where I'm [1118] putting basically just a bunch of bullet [1120] points of the article and these bullet [1123] points are just summaries of what the [1124] article was about I had AI help me [1126] generate a fair number of these they're [1128] not perfectly formatted there's a bunch [1129] of random spaces and stuff like that I [1131] just don't really give a if there's [1132] additional spaces it's not going to like [1133] hurt the quality of the outputs at all [1136] um because I'm just going to be [1137] reconverting this back into text anyway [1139] so feel free to look through the [1140] blueprint if you guys want to take a [1141] peek at that uh and then what I did is [1143] for the other example I did the same [1145] thing I went through my blog and then I [1147] just copied in an article and then I had [1148] AI helped me generate some of these and [1150] then I went and I did some fine tuning [1151] and tweaking and then what I noticed is [1154] uh when I had three examples the output [1156] was a little bit poor I imagine this is [1157] because the articles are pretty long and [1159] so if you have three you know it's like [1160] 700 words each your prompt is now 2,000 [1163] words or maybe 2700 tokens and the [1165] longer the token count is initially [1167] typically the worse the performance gets [1168] so I sort of balanced it between the [1171] Improvement to the output that I got as [1173] a result of providing two examples and [1175] then the decrease in the quality of the [1177] output that I get by making it super [1178] long and this is what I ended up with uh [1180] my last prompt is just the user prompt [1182] from feeding in the Raw text from module [1184] number 8 over here and then I did the [1187] exact same thing just in Reverse over [1189] here and the good news is I was actually [1191] able just to copy over the bullet points [1194] from the previous and then just reverse [1196] the order so now the bullet points are [1198] in the user prompt and then the full [1201] article was in the assistant prompt and [1202] I'm just trying to get it to learn a [1203] relationship between um the bullet [1205] points and then the article just like [1207] previously I was getting it to learn the [1208] relationship between the article and the [1210] bullet points so excuse me the end [1212] result is actually pretty good quality [1214] wise if I click okay [1216] here if I go back to get data set items [1219] I Chang the limit to one just because I [1220] only want to test this out on one of the [1222] pieces that I want to do it three times [1223] every time I run a test that would just [1225] be a little operationally intensive for [1226] basically no positive benefit to me um [1230] it's going to take a little bit here so [1232] you know it is processing a fair amount [1233] of [1234] text so it looks like this is done this [1236] generated a bunch of bullet points if we [1237] go to result here we'll [1240] see you know it's changed the um [1244] headings has changed the output uh like [1248] text a little bit it's close enough that [1250] I imagine it would rank for the same [1252] thing that probably probably the OG [1253] article was ranking for although uh it's [1256] far enough away that you know you have a [1258] little bit of plausible deniability if [1259] somebody hasn't read the initial [1261] piece and then yeah we have the full [1263] piece over here you'll see that the full [1265] piece is written in markdown which is [1266] nice and it's very useful for us because [1268] uh we get to convert this right back [1271] into HTML and then we're going to use [1274] that to make a Google doc so I have an [1276] HTML to markdown module over here oh [1278] sorry wrong one we want markdown HTML [1281] module over here what I'm going to do is [1283] I'm going to feed in the [1285] output and then I'm going to make a [1288] Google do [1290] talk it's going to be create a document [1293] here and then I'm just going to select [1296] the account that's relevant this name of [1298] the article is just going to be um guess [1302] I'm just going to put the title in for [1303] now we can obviously have it generate a [1305] new title for us as well and then I'm [1307] going to feed in the [1309] HTML for now I'm just going to have the [1311] document location be the um main here [1315] and then what I'm going to do is I'm [1316] going to hook this up to a Google Sheets [1318] at a row [1319] now I'm going to want to store a bunch [1320] of stuff here um and I haven't actually [1322] looked through the data to do it so let [1323] me just look through this data what do [1324] we actually want to put well first we're [1327] probably going to want to put the title [1328] of the original article so let's do [1330] first let's do dat script we'll [1333] do original [1336] title we'll do original [1341] URL let's do author author URL publish [1347] that author URL published [1352] at and then we also have the body and I [1354] don't actually fully know what the body [1356] is okay I'm not going to worry about the [1358] body uh and then we can also just post [1360] in the Raw article honestly it's going [1361] to be a fair amount of text and data but [1362] screw it no real reason why not [1365] to um I think I just canceled out my [1368] published ad so we'll go raw article [1369] here and then I'm going to do [1374] um parasite title and then we'll do like [1377] parasite article [1379] keeping in mind that I haven't actually [1380] Rewritten the parasite title maybe I'll [1381] do that in a sec and then I'm just going [1383] to make this a nice [1387] color there you go that looks nice and [1389] then you guys will know if you watch my [1391] videos I'm going to change this to enter [1393] make it look nice and pretty space it [1395] out a bit and then I'm going to go back [1397] over here and I'm just going to refresh [1398] all the headers and the way that you do [1400] that is you just click this refresh [1401] button by table contains headers and now [1402] we actually have all the data that we [1404] need we have the date scrape we have [1405] everything so first I'm going to put the [1406] date in I'm going to do that by going to [1408] the calendar section here and then [1409] clicking now and then the rest of this [1411] is pretty straightforward I'm just going [1412] to go [1413] title URL author author URL published [1420] at um raw [1422] article then parasite title we don't [1425] have one of those yet so I'm not going [1426] to worry about that and then um parasite [1428] article parasite article let's just do [1430] the raw HTML or raw markdown coming out [1433] of this module um and then let me create [1436] a parasite title really quickly [1442] I'm going to call this rewrite [1444] title this will be um bullet point to [1449] blog and then this will be blog to [1452] bullet [1453] point just so I can keep myself a little [1455] more organized here and then I'll say [1457] your task is to rewrite a [1460] title um retain [1464] the topic and the purpose of the title [1468] write it in different [1470] words now I trust this so much because [1473] it's such a small um little request that [1476] I'm not even going to worry about giving [1478] it a bunch of examples I'm just going to [1480] feed it in a [1481] title and [1485] then write only the [1487] title your output should be only the [1491] Rewritten title nothing else there you [1494] go and then over here in the Google [1496] sheet I'm just going to add in that [1498] parasite title which will be in result [1502] here um and then uh there's a URL here [1505] sorry for jumping around all the place [1508] um I'm not going to write the raw text [1510] here in parasite article what I'm going [1511] to do is I'll do web view link there we [1513] go from the Google [1514] Doc okay [1517] voila let me save this puppy now let's [1520] give this a test run [1523] here so what it's done is it's grabbed [1525] our first data set item then uh from [1528] from the default data set that we sced [1529] previously it's then parsing it so now [1532] we have text it's then setting the [1533] variable where I split it based off of [1535] the presence of the new line share a new [1537] line we're then converting into bullet [1539] points then converting the bullet points [1540] back in a blog post we're then rewriting [1542] the title converting it from mark down [1544] to HTML using that HTML in a Google doc [1546] which I'll show you in a second and then [1547] we're adding a row to our Google sheet [1550] it's going to look kind of ugly here [1551] because Google Docs always does this it [1553] bolds and it doesn't sorry I'm going to [1555] unbold and then it uh uses kind of weird [1560] formatting here um and then I'm not [1563] actually going to double click this [1565] because it's going to make this whole [1567] thing super [1568] long but what I am going to do is I'll [1570] just make a couple of these a little [1572] wider so we can see the information that [1574] we want chat GPT [1578] scores okay maybe that's good we got the [1580] original URL here we got the author [1582] which presumably isn't super important a [1583] Euro which isn't super important raw [1584] article which isn't super important but [1586] we're going to keep it anyway then we [1587] have Paras it [1589] title now we have parasite article over [1592] here which I'm just going to make nice [1593] and wide okay and let's actually go see [1595] the finished product [1597] here okay that is ugly that is actually [1599] not what we wanted that's a shame um [1604] why seems like we have a bunch of P tags [1606] for some [1608] reason so let's see what did we output [1610] out of [1612] this yeah we did output a bunch of P [1614] tags which means what did what was our [1615] input [1616] here input was just just the text oh I [1620] got it because I didn't actually specify [1621] that it needs to write it and mark down [1623] that's my [1624] bad we'll [1627] say write the article in markdown ATX [1632] format and then I didn't actually go [1634] through and test this so we'll do [1638] this [1644] um we'll do this [1649] yeah I need to give it some examples [1651] here otherwise I'm not going to [1654] um get good [1657] results so this is me just basically [1660] having it right mark down for [1665] me and the way that I'm doing it is [1669] I'm actually going through and I'm just [1671] adding a bunch of headings [1680] okay that's number [1682] one we'll do number two here [1709] okay just about [1712] done all right there you go should be [1715] good we're going to give that a round [1717] two so I'm going to delete this old [1718] crappy terrible result that I never want [1720] to see again in my whole long life we're [1723] going to rerun this puppy and um gaze [1726] upon my work ye Mighty in [1729] despair I'm sure it'll be good quality [1732] this is [1733] cope no this is going to be [1736] great all awesome so we're creating the [1738] Google Doc this time let's just make [1739] sure this Google doc looks good I'm [1741] going to web view link and I'm opening a [1742] new tab looks nice looks very nice now [1747] I'm realizing because I wrote this [1749] article myself and I called my [1750] newsletter the cusp a bunch of times [1752] this isn't a very good example for a [1753] parasite purposes because this literally [1755] a summary of the cusp AI news and [1757] implications um we could improve this [1759] just by going through the prompt and [1761] just removing any terms that refer to [1763] the cusp um so that it doesn't like [1765] think that it's a newsletter so we could [1767] do that pretty quickly but anyway if we [1769] go back here um we just got to fix the [1772] color again because I deleted the last [1774] result and the last result is what tells [1776] the next result what color and format it [1778] should be uh we got everything that we [1780] want looks like the original title was [1782] Chad gbt score 70% of the sample USMLE [1785] exam and then this one was chat achiev [1786] 70% on a sample us mle just with the [1789] acronym written instead I think these [1790] are sufficiently different this could be [1792] like a news parasite probably reasonably [1794] quickly um and then we have the you know [1796] as I opened up previously we have the [1797] parasite side campaign here um you know [1800] keep in mind it's not super long it's [1801] about the same length as the previous [1803] one and you know it says Nix and all [1804] that stuff so uh this may need a little [1806] bit of tweaking whereby you jump into [1808] the prompts and then you say you know if [1810] like a name is reference or something [1812] then like don't include the name um just [1814] give it a bunch of don't do this don't [1815] do that don't do that probably do pretty [1817] well but you know even as it stands you [1819] could totally whip this up on a [1821] WordPress website and just set this to [1822] scrape every single day for uh Whatever [1825] frequency you want and then have it go [1827] off to the races [1829] the last thing that I'll do just for [1830] completeness the sake is if you wanted [1831] to say publish this on WordPress you can [1833] do so pretty straightforwardly um in [1835] make there's actually a WordPress module [1838] so we go to Wordpress here and the one [1839] that you want is create a [1841] post and then you need to create a [1843] connection and the way that you do that [1844] is you basically grab your WordPress URL [1846] so let's say my WordPress website is [1848] called my- WordPress site uh and then [1850] you go.com and then you just gowp Json [1854] and so whatever the title of your [1855] website is.com would be the rest API [1857] based URL [1858] and then what you need to do is on [1859] WordPress you need to go and download a [1862] um API connector so you need to go [1864] WordPress integrat connector [1868] here and then you need to download this [1870] plugin and stick it onto your uh your [1872] WordPress website and this will [1874] basically give you an API key that you [1876] can use to connect to integrad is the [1878] old name for make.com or you know [1880] make.com today uh and then you'll be [1882] able to actually jump in and create a [1883] post and you'll be able to define the [1884] title you'll be able to define the tags [1886] uh you may even be able to schedule I [1887] believe which is quite nice so if you [1889] wanted to run this puppy on autop pallet [1891] here that's how you do it last thing I'm [1893] going to do is I'll show you to schedule [1894] this just go back to apify go down to [1896] schedules go create new and then what we [1899] need to do is uh Whatever frequency you [1901] want this to scrape the data source um [1903] just go daily weekly yearly whatever and [1906] then under here where it says no actors [1908] or tasks yet just go to actor and then [1910] type in the scraper that you [1912] want um as I mentioned previously we're [1914] just feeding it the same um author name [1917] every time [1918] you don't have to do it this way you [1919] could feed it a different author name [1920] every time and if you wanted to do it [1922] that uh way so if you wanted to like [1924] store author names in a sheet and then [1925] call a sheet every time you would [1927] instead um trigger this in in make.com [1930] itself just going to apify and then run [1932] an actor and the way you do is youd [1935] basically select the [1938] actor here which would be [1941] um oh boy this one here and then you [1944] need to put in some input Json and the [1946] input Json you'd put in would look like [1948] this oops where Nix surf would be your [1953] variable from I don't know like your [1955] Google sheet author or whatever that [1958] you're pulling in from you can add [1959] another make module before that have [1960] that be the trigger it'll run and then [1963] you can have a separate scenario that [1964] actually watches the actor runs like I [1965] mentioned and um yeah you know look at [1968] it that way you can also click run [1970] synchronously back there and then it'll [1971] just like add it to the flow that we [1973] have here which is also quite useful any [1975] who I'm going to export this blueprint [1977] and then voila there you have it there's [1978] your medium to uh Google doc parasite [1983] scraper and I showed you how to do it in [1984] um in WordPress as well thanks so much [1986] for watching this video had a lot of fun [1987] putting it together if you guys want [1989] more videos like this then just leave a [1991] comment down below requesting maybe a [1993] specific scraper or a specific platform [1995] and I'll happily whip it up for you [1997] otherwise I'd love it if you guys could [1998] take a look at my community as I [2000] mentioned to you guys previously my [2001] community has been bumping recently I [2003] was not expecting to get 150 people [2005] within about 72 hours uh this is way [2007] surpass my expectations and there is so [2009] much juice dripping from every post here [2012] it's insane so if you guys want to join [2014] this community keep in mind the prices [2015] increasing every 40 members or so um [2018] it's coming up reasonably quickly take a [2019] look and if it makes sense for you hop [2021] on board

Title: Watch Me Build A Social Media Tracker In 30 Mins (+ Community)
[0] what's going on everybody in this video [1] I got two lovely things to talk about [3] the first is I'm going to show you a [4] stepbystep system that you can use to [7] build essentially a social media [8] monitoring tool with a dashboard [10] attached in looker Studio I'm going to [12] build all that stuff out live for you [14] it's the same thing that tons of [15] services out there now charging 105 $20 [17] a month for and the greatest part about [19] it is you can basically build an entire [20] backend for that app in make.com and [23] apify using a couple of cool techniques [26] I'm going to show you in a second the [27] other thing I wanted to talk about was I [28] just opened my Community it's called [31] makemoney withm make.com hopefully [33] appropriately named I'm going to include [34] the link down below but this community [36] essentially answers a lot of the [37] questions and problems that people have [39] had with YouTube so far I have hosted [41] every single blueprint that I've ever [43] created not just the ones that I have [45] previously put up but also a lot of the [47] ones that I have sort of hidden from [48] view like my content generator um upwork [51] RSS feed stuff uh proposal generator [53] flow basically just all of the secrets [55] sauce so if you guys want to get that [57] blueprint for yourself head down to my [58] community and sign up I'm also doing [60] weekly office hours where I can answer [62] questions in substantially more detail [63] than I'm really able to just through [65] comments and stuff cuz it's getting kind [66] of overwhelming I'm also creating [67] exclusive Community content including a [69] course that I'm calling 14-day agency [71] where I literally build an automation [73] agency live in front of you I make the [75] website I do my legal stuff I do my [77] positioning portfolio all that then I go [79] out and I find customers and I do it all [81] on camera I show you exactly what you [83] need to do in order to go and get your [84] own first second fifth or 100th and then [87] I'm also jam-pack this community with [88] extremely ambitious like-minded people [90] in both the automation space and then a [92] bunch of spaces that are adjacent to it [94] so like we have some AI prompt engineers [95] in the community we have a lot of people [97] that are doing over 250k a month that [99] run either coaching offers or info [101] product systems we have some e-commerce [103] entrepreneurs as well but the one thing [105] that ties them all together is their [106] love for Automation and more importantly [108] make.com so if that sounds like [110] something you guys want to get into I've [111] left the community link down below I'd [112] love it if you guys could check it out [114] I'm more than happy to have you on this [116] ride with me let's make this the best [117] community ever aside from that hope you [119] guys are looking for for to watching [120] this video on social media scraping and [122] dashboard creation see you in the [127] vid we're going to need three things in [129] order to get this system done the first [131] is we're going to need apify which I [133] have a free instance over here with a $5 [136] trial available for the next like two [138] weeks or so so that's what I'm going to [139] be using uh you can sign up for a free [141] trial as well just head over to ay.com [143] give that thing a little sign up and [145] you'll have way more than enough for [147] this system and probably many others the [150] uh apify team is extremely generous with [152] their trials so that's first second of [153] all we're going to need Google Sheets [155] Google Sheets is where we're going to be [156] storing all of the data for the [158] Instagram dashboard that we're going to [159] be building on looker studio uh the [161] reason why we're doing this in Google [162] Sheets is because Google Sheets plays [164] really nicely with Google products [166] obviously like Google Google's previous [168] data studio now it's called looker [169] studio uh and we don't need to do any [171] like special fancy database stuff in [173] order to make this work and then the [175] last system that we're going to need is [177] uh is looker studio so very simple and [179] straightforward sort of dashboard [182] Builder I'm going to be using templates [183] here and I'd highly recommend you guys [184] use templates as well when you're [185] building this out there's a lot Beyond [188] just putting the data on a dashboard [191] like uh you know design and that sort of [193] thing to make a dashboard look good and [195] moreover be useful so I just you know [197] encourage you guys to use templating [198] features wherever possible uh that's [200] basically going to be the flow once a [201] day we're going to run this apify [203] scraper that's going to get a bunch of [205] profile information including the [206] follower count uh number following count [208] maybe some additional info if we need it [210] that's going to dump into this Instagram [211] sheet and then this Instagram sheet is [213] going to feed into looker Studio I'm [215] obviously going to manage all of the [217] automatic dumping uh in in make.com [220] which is why I have a scenario open here [221] called scrape Instagram profile daily [223] and then add to Google sheet for Looker [224] studio and so we're just going to start [226] with that and then we'll build out the [226] actual dashboard and everything out um [229] afterwards okay so let's get going the [230] very first thing we need to do is we [232] obviously need to trigger an apify [235] run excuse me I'm a little under the [237] weather here uh instead of actually [238] triggering it inside of make.com though [241] I'm going to do something that I haven't [242] done in a previous video I'm actually [243] just going to do the scheduling in apify [245] alone apify lets you to do um lets you [248] do a lot of the scheduling there uh and [250] what we're going to do is we're going to [251] schedule it in apify and then in [252] make.com we're just going to watch for [254] the Run of that actor so presumably [256] that's going to happen like once a day [257] maybe 5:00 a.m. or something like that [260] uh and so apify is going to be the [262] trigger that is going to run the rest of [263] our flow if you think about it logically [265] that way okay so what I'm going to do [267] then is I'm going to watch the actor run [270] so I'm going to select the watch actor [272] runs module and then napify I'm going to [274] have to make um a web hook and I'm just [276] going to call this finished Instagram [279] scraper I have my own connection here [281] with my email and the actor I'm going to [284] select I've actually already opened it [285] up so I can find it here if you can't um [287] find it then you need to go into apify [289] first and then open it up I'll show you [290] that in a second but okay great I have [292] my web hook ready and essentially what [294] I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be [294] watching the actor Run next thing we [297] have to do is we have to go on apify and [298] let's actually test the scraper let's [300] make sure it works first thing we do is [302] we go over to store then I'm going to [304] just type in Instagram and then the [306] scraper that I'm going to be using is [308] called the Instagram profile scraper [310] there are many different Instagram [311] scrapers as you can see here you can get [313] hashtags follower account [315] hashtags um API reals mentions more [319] hashtags you can get a ton of stuff um [322] and it's worth mentioning if you haven't [323] seen my other videos on this you can [324] also get data from like literally any [325] other platform you want you can get data [327] from Twitter so if you wanted to do what [328] I'm about to do here for Instagram [330] except for Twitter you can just do the [331] same thing just go over to Twitter [332] profile scraper um right over here you [335] could probably do it from LinkedIn too [337] yeah you can do it for [338] LinkedIn um what other social media [340] platform you do for Tik Tok yeah you can [342] do it for Tik Tok so literally any [344] social media platform you can think of [346] you can just attach apify is like the [347] front end scraper and then you can have [349] that feed into a series of dashboards if [350] you wanted to keep track of say your own [352] social growth or maybe a client brand [354] account or that sort of thing I should [356] also mention and I talked about this a [358] little bit before um but you you can [359] basically build out an entire business [361] using exactly what I'm about to show you [363] this is the backend for a number of [364] services they do the exact same thing [365] that I'm going to be walking you through [367] here it's just instead of using make.com [369] they use code and really I prefer [371] make.com for simple scraping [373] applications like this because it's a [374] lot more maintainable you can jump in [376] and change the flow in seconds as [377] opposed to like the black box of code [379] which a lot of the time takes uh [381] substantially longer and you know is is [383] r with some other issues but anyway so [385] let's go Instagram and then profile [386] script that's going to be using and you [389] see the the look of this is pretty [390] straightforward essentially you just [392] have an input that you feed in with a [394] username and then you just click [396] Start and essentially what's going to [398] happen now is API is going to spin up a [400] server and that server is going to go [403] out and find the data that we're looking [405] for now the data that we're looking for [407] in this case is very simple you'll see [408] there'll just be a username here called [411] Nick dosar I'm doing this on my own [412] profile of course because I want to be [413] as um I guess kind to people's privacy [417] as [417] possible but what you see at the end of [420] it is you end up with a photo here you [422] end up with a full name if the full name [423] is accessible uh sometimes people don't [425] actually put their full names but I did [427] because I uh love people to know every [429] little thing about me [430] clearly we have the username here the [433] number of posts the number of followers [434] number of following whether it's private [436] verified business account then we also [438] have a [439] bio so I'm going to feed in as much of [441] this information as I can into the [442] system just CU I think that this would [444] be pretty interesting but obviously the [445] stuff that we're really caring about is [447] we're caring about the follower count [448] and the following count and what I'm [449] thinking we're going to do is we're just [450] going to do two things one we're going [452] to have like a little dashboard counter [453] that's just going to show us the [454] follower count and the following count [456] and then two we're going to have a graph [457] that's going to show us the change in [458] the following count over time since [460] we're doing this once a day it's going [461] to be very simple and easy to make that [462] graph uh it's just going to have like a [464] like every Notch is going to be one day [466] um if you're doing this you know on [468] demand if you're getting them to click a [470] button and then have that scrape maybe a [472] little bit more difficult to do but you [473] know as I mentioned this is an MVP [475] that's probably the simplest possible [476] application of this and the data that we [477] have here is is more than sufficient for [479] now [480] uh you could sell a dashboard like this [481] already for a few thousand let alone [483] when we actually go in and add [485] additional functionality to it so yeah [487] we have everything that we need here uh [489] what we got to do now is we basically [490] need to find a way to put this into make [492] and so what I've done is I have a watch [493] actor run module right here right if I [496] click run once what we need to do now is [498] we need to run this again so I'm just [501] going to go back to actor I'm click uh [504] start this is going to be running [507] again now while I'm doing that I'm also [509] going to add in the fields that I want [511] uh what did we mention so we mentioned [513] you know I'm just going to pump in all [514] the fields we have full name here we [516] have username here we have posts maybe [519] we could see the number of posts over [520] time too that might be interesting we'll [522] do followers [524] following um [527] private [528] verified business and then bio so we'll [531] do business and then we'll do bio and of [533] course uh we need one more thing here we [535] need the date that this is um scraped so [539] I'll just say say dat scraped I'm going [542] to bold these cuz I'm a huge horror for [544] Bolding and uh we'll jump back into make [547] here and we'll see that the scenario run [548] is actually already completed so I know [550] I'm dancing around a lot but I just did [551] that because I wanted to save a couple [552] of minutes um these runs usually take [554] between 60 to 90 seconds now that the [557] actor run is completed uh looking back [559] we have a bunch of information and data [561] the most important thing for us is this [562] one called default data set ID there's [564] no actual data from the run in this [567] module what we need to do is we need to [569] basically [570] watch the actor run and then grab the [571] default data set ID and then go out and [573] then pull um the data that has been [575] stored and an apy is really easy just go [578] to apify and then get data set items [581] drag that over there and then let me [583] just switch accounts here uh and then [585] feed in the data set ID now I'm [587] hardcoding this because I just want to [588] test this and show you guys what it [589] looks like you have a couple of options [591] here with the data transformation I [593] always use clean uh you can change the [595] format to be whatever you want if you [596] want to like download a CSV or something [598] you can do that I don't see any reason [600] to um and then you have a limit on the [602] number of items you can return so I'm [603] just going to return one item and then [605] because I'm just testing this on the [607] actual data set ID from last time I'm [609] just going to run that independently and [611] then I'm going to see all the data so we [613] have the username the URL full name [615] biography basically all the information [617] that we needed here uh we even have the [619] profile pick URL which is pretty [620] interesting so I have that little [622] profile picture that's cached and it [624] looks like they now store an HD version [626] of that so it's about as HD As It Gets [629] interestingly enough uh this picture was [630] AI generated completely um I just typed [633] in like Nick surar Burning Man and then [634] I trained a model on pictures of my face [637] and it actually did a really good job if [638] you zoom in you'll see that there's a [639] bunch of stuff that doesn't make sense [640] in this image like this person's like we [643] don't know if this person's walking [644] forward or backward it's sort of like [646] ambiguous that kind of looks like a tank [648] and then notice how none of these straps [650] actually have any ending or or real [651] purpose uh but I still look pretty fire [653] so there's that anyway um okay got [656] related profiles latest igtv video [659] videos and then actually a list of all [661] of my posts that's interesting I didn't [662] know that I had that um I don't think [664] I'm going to do anything with that maybe [665] we can get the last post I don't know no [667] I don't think I will but anyway we have [669] all the information that we need now um [671] now all we have to do is we have to add [672] this to our Google [674] sheet and the reason why we're doing [676] this of course is because we want to um [679] do this once a day and I'll show you how [681] to do that in a second we're going to go [683] down to spreadsheet [685] ID excuse me we'll go to um Instagram [688] dashboard [690] that's the name of this one [692] here the sheet name is just going to be [694] called sheet one and then we have a [696] bunch of values here that we need to [698] enter so date scraped is going to be [699] simple we're just going to go over to [701] the date um and time module here and [704] then I'm just going to type in [706] now the full name if we go back to our [709] data here we'll see that in this the [711] username is up here number of posts we [715] should be able to see the post count [716] there it is uh we'll do followers count [719] and then following count we'll go [722] private [724] verified business so if the person has a [728] business then this is where we'd put it [730] it's going to type in business up here [732] that's is business account and then I'll [734] type in bio as well and we see that we [737] have a biography right here um and I'm [739] just going to store that just because [741] you know the marginal cost of storing [742] all this information is very low and [744] it's not necessary that we're going to [745] use this to build out our dashboard [746] right now but who knows maybe I don't [748] know maybe we're going to want it in a [750] year my general rule of [753] thumb is I always keep more data than [755] less there's no real reason to to store [757] less data if you can store more takes [759] like two extra seconds and then you just [760] never know if you or your client is [762] going to want that at some point in the [763] future so any who voila we have a system [766] now that dumps new records into a Google [768] sheet uh what's left I'm just going to [769] run this [770] thing and I'm going to sorry there's one [773] more thing I got to do we have to jump [775] into the data set ID we just have to [777] make sure that this is actually pulling [778] for from the uh the actor it's not just [781] hardcoded so all I did was I grabbed [783] default data set ID over here I'm going [784] to click run I'm going to wait for new [786] data cuz I want only to be running on [788] the new stuff then I'm going to go to [790] the Instagram profile scraper and I'm [792] just going to um I'm just going to give [793] this one more [796] run okay so now this is running this is [799] going to take again you know maybe 30 60 [801] 90 seconds um we're just going to watch [803] it this time because we just want to [804] make sure that there's no issues with [805] the flow and also want this to be a [807] little bit more Dynamic for you guys I [808] want you guys to be able to to see [809] exactly what's happening the second that [811] the actor is [812] done oh looks like it's already finished [814] that was only 15 seconds or so much [816] faster than I thought um three things [818] happen here first we watched the actor [820] run the actor run concluded and so we [822] received a status of succeeded here then [824] we got the default data set ID and then [826] what we did is we fed that into get data [828] set items this gave us all of the data [830] that we needed from [831] previous including the follower count [833] the following count and then what we did [835] is we dumped it into a Google sheet so [838] you'll see we basically have a list of [839] updates with the range that we've [841] updated the number of rows the columns [842] that sort of thing if we go back to our [844] Instagram dashboard here you'll see that [845] this looks great the only issue is um [848] that the additional like the data is [850] bolded so I just selected it and then I [852] unbolded it I'm also going to change the [854] font because I think that looks prettier [856] and then I'm just going to double click [857] these tabs that's just going to space it [859] out uh make it look a little better this [861] date scraped here may be somewhat [863] meaningless to you 20245 d23 t22 [866] 2439 um basically this is Mak dat time [869] format and it's storing the date first [871] separated by dashes in um year year year [874] year U month month Day Day and then [877] after the t is the actual like time on [879] the make server that we ran this [881] execution so it looks like this make [883] server is running on like C time or GMT [887] plus 1 or plus two or something because [889] it's saying that it's 10:24 p.m. um [891] right now it's 4:25 p.m. here so you [893] know there's about an 8 hour difference [896] um 6 hour difference I should say uh but [898] the rest of the data here looks good [899] which is nice we got the follower count [901] we got the following count we got [902] everything that we need in order to [903] build out our [905] dashboard now I'm just going to do one [907] more thing here and that's that I'm [909] going to add a little bit of fake data [910] because I want to like when I build a [913] dashboard I don't want it to be super [914] disappointing I want I want us to be [916] able to see a little bit of data [917] increase and decrease and the way that [919] I'm going to do that is I'm just going [920] to copy [922] this paste this in then I'm just going [925] to add a bunch of these and then I'm [927] just going to pretend that this started [929] on the 20th went to the 21st we did the [933] 22nd we did the 23rd and then we did the [936] 24th so I'm pretending that essentially [938] we've scraped this for 5 days and I'm [940] going to start at like 11:39 we'll go up [942] to [943] 1222 we'll go up to 12 93 [947] 1344 3043 and then 1452 that'll be the [951] last one and then we'll go 500 510 520 [956] let's do 521 so it's a little cooler 533 [959] and then 557 this will just allow us to [961] see a couple of like data points over [963] time which I think is pretty important [965] um and maybe we'll do something with the [967] post too let's go [969] 78 okay and then the other thing I'm [971] going to do is I'm just going to [972] schedule this to run every day very [973] simple and easy way to do that in apify [975] you just go down on the left hand side [977] here to schedules and then I set up a [979] schedule before I'm just going to delete [981] all you need to do refresh this oops [985] it's [986] wrong um is we need to go to create [988] schedule here [989] and then all we have to do is go to the [991] Daily tab scroll down and then go to add [995] actor what we want to select is our [997] Instagram profile scraper and then the [999] input is just going to be whatever the [1000] profile that you want to scrape is I'm [1002] pretending that somebody just signed up [1004] for my service which is scraping [1005] Instagram every day um and monitoring it [1007] in social media tools and that sort of [1009] thing uh and they just gave me nick. [1011] surve so that's just what I'm hard [1012] coding in [1015] here and voila now we click save and [1017] enable excuse me now this is going to [1020] run every day at the time that we [1021] specified and the time that we specified [1023] I think was um I don't know whatever the [1025] default time was so not a big deal um [1028] now we have the trigger happening in [1030] apify once a day it's going to run [1031] that's going to run our make.com [1033] scenario and that's going to dump things [1034] into the sheet and then our sheets just [1035] going to be updated constantly and then [1037] we're going to use looker Studio to pull [1038] data from the sheet hopefully pretty [1040] straightforward at this point now let's [1042] actually get out and build something [1043] reasonably pretty I say reasonably [1045] pretty because I am not a very good [1047] dashboard designer so I'm going to go [1049] over to the template Gallery here um [1051] there are a variety of different [1053] templates that I think we could use I [1055] just want something that's [1056] straightforward and simple that I can [1057] just click on the data and then you know [1059] update it in one [1062] second [1064] so what looks reasonably [1068] sexier I always find myself like drawn [1070] to this Google ads overview but uh the [1073] Youtube analytics probably makes more [1075] sense for [1077] us yeah that probably makes more sense [1079] granted we're not using YouTube data [1081] we're using um other data [1084] so there are going to be a few things [1086] we're going to have to delete here but [1089] uh yeah I'm just basically what I'm [1091] going to do is I'm just going to grab [1092] this top section here I'm going to [1094] change this so instead of views it says [1096] like followers instead of uh ours watch [1099] it says following then maybe I'll have [1101] like posts down here or maybe what I'll [1103] do is I'll have followers be the top so [1105] I'll do like a really wide one yeah and [1107] then I'll do following and then do um [1110] post that looks pretty good and then you [1113] know we don't have access to any of this [1115] other information so we're just not [1116] going to include it I have to enter a [1119] bunch of information here because it's [1120] the first time that I'm creating one of [1121] these things with my [1123] um uh this specific account that I'm [1126] using we're not going to say yes to any [1128] of [1130] these just their data collection stuff [1132] Google wants a little bit of your [1134] data and then um I think I and just [1139] delete this [1142] now apparently I do not have permission [1144] that's kind of [1149] funny um the reason why I don't is [1153] because I need to create a new thing [1155] here and I'm just going to make a new [1156] data [1157] source I'm going to go to create data [1159] source and then I'll go to [1161] Sheets then I'm going to authorize [1164] sheets to access my Google [1166] account and then what I want to do is I [1168] want to select my Instagram dashboard [1170] here and I'm just going to connect this [1172] this will allow me to um copy the sheet [1175] over and then sort of substitute it with [1177] my own [1178] data granted you know there's a bunch of [1180] BS essentially where we need to swap the [1182] data I'm not going to worry about any of [1183] that now all I'm going to do is I'm just [1185] going to create the template and then [1186] I'll manually add the data in [1189] afterwards okay we're going to call this [1191] our Instagram [1194] report um we got a little picture of [1197] YouTube here let me go Instagram logo [1199] see if I can find a pretty nice [1201] one this looks pretty huge 2048x 2048 [1206] whatever we'll save it anyway then I'll [1208] see if I can just copy it that might be [1211] faster uh no I don't think we can copy [1215] it do some weird crap so we're not going [1218] to do that we're going to go down to [1220] here where it says YouTube logo and then [1222] I'm just going to type in Instagram logo [1224] um hopefully this actually works it's a [1227] SVG do [1229] another thing so I wouldn't actually be [1231] surprised if it didn't [1232] work okay let's grab another Instagram [1235] logo let make this look pretty and let's [1237] just do like a JPG or a [1242] PNG this looks a little annoyingly [1245] blurry that looks way too [1248] small is it seriously that hard to find [1250] a freaking Instagram logo no [1253] way that's [1256] crazy okay we'll do that [1259] so I'm going to go over here select this [1262] replace this with [1264] that [1266] nice that looks kind of cute we got our [1270] Instagram report tool here now wonderful [1275] um I think this is [1278] reasonable oh okay this may take a [1282] little bit more time than I [1284] thought [1286] nope ah there we go remember this isn't [1289] a graphic design tool this is a [1291] dashboard tool um I don't need this so I [1295] can just delete this I'm going to delete [1298] this and then I'm going to have this be [1301] my date range picker so I'm just going [1302] to put that actually I don't know why it [1304] needs to be down there let's put it up [1306] here and then why don't we grab [1308] everything and then move it all oh I [1310] guess we'll just keep everything up here [1313] I'm just going to select all these [1314] fields move this up higher and then uh [1317] first thing I'm going to do is I'm just [1318] going to hard code in the name you don't [1321] have to hardcode in the name of course [1322] you can make everything Dynamic and then [1324] first we're going to have followers and [1327] then down here we're going to [1329] do okay it looks like actually it [1331] already pulled everything that we need [1332] so here we want [1334] foll so I'm going to click on um if [1337] you've never used uh data Studio or [1338] looker Studio before uh it can be very [1341] intimidating at first glance but all I'm [1342] going to do is I'm going to give every [1344] one of these a click and then I'm going [1345] to go over to metric metric is the [1347] specific field that we want to to uh [1349] pull the field that we want to pull in [1350] this case is following so I just clicked [1353] following and you see that it's replaced [1354] with the following count but you'll see [1356] that there's a little bit of a of a [1358] knack to it because this is 2.6k what [1359] does that really mean so I'll show you [1361] in a second the other metric I want is [1365] post I don't actually need this one [1368] here uh looks like they're all grouped [1371] together which is why um when I selected [1374] that I deleted the whole [1376] thing but we can also delete these [1379] things [1381] individually so that's what I'm doing [1383] here then I'm going to drag this and [1386] make this a lot wider and the reason why [1388] is because I think that followers is [1389] probably the most important metric that [1391] we have and so I want to see all of it [1395] this is a chart so I'm just going to [1396] drag this chart all the way out Center [1398] it a bit okay now let's uh talk a little [1402] bit about what's going on here and why [1403] it say 6.4k followers well on the left [1405] of this tiny little metric here you'll [1407] see that there's the word sign [1409] and if you don't uh Define what you want [1411] like the operation that you want to do [1413] on the report metric it'll usually just [1415] default to sum so we don't actually want [1417] some um cuz we're if you think about it [1420] like this is currently going into our [1422] dashboard it's collecting all of the [1424] records and then it's just summing all [1425] these up [1426] 6,449 we didn't actually care about that [1428] what we care about is uh is the last [1430] record okay and so in order to make this [1432] show only the most recent result all we [1434] need to do is we need to click on the um [1436] metric here scroll down to default date [1438] range go to [1440] custom and then instead of the default [1443] which is auto date range here we go to [1446] today and logically if our system is [1449] scraping every morning let's say at like [1451] I don't know 12:00 a.m. or something [1453] like that then this will only show the [1455] data gotten that day which presumably is [1458] the thing that's important because this [1460] is the sort of like um scorecard metric [1463] that a lot of people are going to look [1464] at what what is my current follower [1465] account right they don't have to log in [1467] Instagram anymore they can just go right [1468] over here and they can see it so right [1470] now we have 1.3k followers now that's [1472] not as granular as I would like I want [1474] this to be more granular I don't want to [1475] compact the numbers so I'm going to go [1476] to style and then I'm going to click [1477] uncompact numbers and now we can see [1480] exactly how many followers we have [1482] 1,343 I'm going to do the same thing on [1484] this following [1485] metric and then this one says following [1488] here I meant to click post so I'm going [1489] to go back to setup and then instead of [1491] following we'll do [1492] post and then again this is summing we [1495] don't want this to sum we're going to go [1497] default date range custom and then I'm [1499] just going to set both of these to [1502] today both the following and then the [1504] post we'll [1508] go [1510] custom and then [1513] today so now we have 533 following today [1516] uh [1518] 1,343 next I'm going to click [1521] on this little [1525] metric and then I'm just going [1527] Tove you have to hold shift in order to [1529] move it a very tiny bit if you don't [1531] it's going to move a lot anyway I don't [1533] really like how this is sort of high up [1535] so I'm just going to Center all these [1537] make this a little bit prettier to me [1540] anyway there we go okay now it's time to [1543] do some editing to these charts here um [1545] I don't really like these charts I think [1546] they're kind of buggy so I'm actually [1547] just going to go make my new ones I'm [1549] just selecting these and then I'm [1550] clicking delete and then I'm going to go [1553] to add a chart up here and what I want [1555] is I want a Time series chart [1558] click to add or drag or draw um it looks [1562] pretty good already so I'm just going to [1564] make this a little [1567] wider and then I'm just going to put [1569] this I don't know something like that [1570] now you'll see that the date range [1572] automatically goes back to April the [1573] 25th and so the reason why is because we [1576] have a master date picker basically up [1579] here that's automatically connected to [1581] each of our charts and so if we want to [1582] fix this we need to click on this and [1584] then I'm just going to make this I don't [1585] know be the last 7 days I would say [1589] click [1591] apply um it's saying that we only have [1593] three oh yeah that's cuz the current [1595] date according to this is not right [1600] um this week to date sounds good so 20th [1605] 21st 22nd I think the reason for that is [1607] because 20 21st 22nd it's not getting [1610] 23rd and 24th just because of my um my [1612] time zone so I'm going to say let's just [1616] do 20th to 25th [1619] let's just set it manually for now I'm [1621] sorry 24th I [1623] guess yeah kind of annoying but my time [1625] zones are all mucked up on my Google [1627] account so I'm not going to spend all [1628] the time to fix it um and then I'm just [1630] going to make some minor like aesthetic [1631] improvements of this I don't really like [1632] the fact that [1634] uh right now you [1637] can uh I think the axes are good [1639] actually but I don't like the fact that [1642] we have like a [1643] label with a legend [1648] uh there we go so that's how I fix that [1651] make this a little bit bigger here and [1656] then I don't know I personally I think [1659] the colors have a lot to do with it too [1661] I also don't like the fact that uh we [1664] have a bunch of like lines here I wish [1666] we could remove these lines there's a [1667] way to do so I've just uh kind of [1670] forgotten how to [1671] here so we'll keep the follower count [1676] there oh grid yeah I guess it's grid [1679] okay I think I can probably make it [1681] transparent yeah nope that's not it do [1684] not do that hey there we [1687] go you know one second thought doesn't [1689] look that [1692] bad like it's okay I guess but it's not [1694] very informative this way so maybe we'll [1696] go to [1697] style and then um where it says [1702] grid over here will make the grid color [1706] like the lightest White okay that's much [1709] better hopefully you guys can see but [1712] there's just some very light White Lines [1713] there also the color while I'm at it is [1716] not very nice um this color should be [1718] much more representative of Instagram so [1720] I'm going to go over [1722] here and then what color is instagrammy [1725] I guess this pink yeah that looks sort [1727] of instagramy um we can obviously change [1729] everything else about this too we could [1731] change the colors of the uh border so I [1735] can make o nope don't do [1739] that you see how there's like this these [1741] dotted borders around the whole [1745] thing we should be able to change [1749] that um one of these is the dotted [1753] border either they keep moving it around [1756] or I'm just getting old beyond my [1758] years uh no we want a solid line maybe [1762] we'll change this to [1764] two and then what we want is [1769] we want this grid to [1771] be not transparent one of these chart [1775] border color [1778] probably okay well I don't know if we [1780] can escape the blue border just yet [1784] unfortunately um we could have follower [1785] count but we don't really need to so I'm [1787] going leave that [1790] out that's [1793] white that just changes the opacity of [1795] everything [1798] all right whatever I'm not going to [1799] worry about it anymore oh man it was [1801] just because I was freaking selecting it [1802] so [1803] silly anyway um you can obviously change [1806] this to to like a bar chart if you want [1807] I don't really find it as informative [1809] it's just a line chart so I'm going to [1810] leave it as a line chart and then I'm [1812] not going to ruin the placement at all [1816] uh great now that I have this follower [1817] chart I'm just going to copy it paste it [1820] so contrl c contrl v and then I'm just [1822] going to make a much smaller version for [1824] my following here [1829] and then I'm going to do the same thing [1830] for post [1833] here now in order to change your data [1835] I'm just going to scroll down to where [1836] it says followers I'll just change it to [1839] following [1841] voila it shows my increase in Following [1843] over [1844] time and then uh instead of followers [1847] here I'm just going to do posts now I [1849] can see my posts increase over time they [1851] increase sort of like linearly or step [1852] function cuz I just increased the hell [1854] out of them for examples I'm going to [1856] delete the rest of these [1858] I don't really need [1859] these and then I'm going to I don't know [1863] I mean we're trying to do this as simply [1864] as possible right so if I go theme and [1866] layout should be able to change the um [1869] height of this so yeah 1450 is a little [1872] too big so we'll do 900 to start then [1875] I'll do 500 to start oh well that's [1877] almost perfect 550 we'll do [1881] 575 okay we'll do 525 [1885] 515 510 okay 510 it is now I'm just [1888] going to make a couple of very brief and [1890] small aesthetic improvements because I [1892] want this to Look a Lot sexier um very [1895] simple stuff I'm just going to go to [1896] style in this um date picker and then [1900] I'm just going to set the Border radius [1901] to like four or something so I'm just [1902] going to round all the corners I'm going [1904] to do the same thing here with this [1908] white background [1911] section we're just going to choose four [1913] as like our default here uh maybe I'll [1915] do a little bit more actually [1918] this is so big I think it needs [1920] 10 and then if you copy a module [1925] here you can actually then click on [1927] another one and then click paste special [1930] paste style then it'll like [1931] automatically paste whatever the style [1933] is that you pulled in so I'm going to do [1935] the same thing here for this last [1937] section paste the style now we got these [1940] nice red Corners this looks a little [1941] sexier and actually you know what while [1943] I was doing that I should have made a [1944] couple of other changes here I don't [1946] like the Border color I think it could [1948] look a lot better if it was [1950] lighter so I'm going to go in there and [1952] just do the same thing [1955] copy then paste [1957] style paste style and then notice how we [1961] have this gray background here I'm not a [1963] fan of that either so I'm just going to [1964] go over here and I'll make [1968] that I we could just go [1974] white but I don't really like white [1976] either [1978] you can also select your own color so [1980] I'm going to go as close to white as [1981] possible maybe just a little bit darker [1985] like that there you go um this stuff is [1988] still visible now I'm going to click [1990] into each of these and then uh if I go [1992] to style you'll see that there's a font [1994] section it's currently selecting robotto [1997] there are a ton of fonts that you could [1998] use to really like make your uh make [2000] your thing pop a bit I think the one [2002] that I like using the most and I don't [2004] remember exactly where it was was [2006] Railway I believe it was Railway I don't [2009] know Railway looks a little less good [2011] now yeah uh or maybe it was quicksand oh [2014] sorry it was quicksand there we go um so [2016] what you can do is you can do the same [2018] thing you copy and then you paste [2020] special paste style it'll change the [2022] font to railway for me which is [2025] nice so that's cool uh then you can also [2027] do the same thing with these charts so [2029] I'm going to go to style and then all [2032] the way down here you'll see there's [2033] robato I'll change this to sorry I [2036] believe I was using quicksand yeah jeez [2037] Jesus that's what happens when you're [2039] sick ladies and [2041] gentlemen stay healthy eat your vitamin [2047] C um sorry I was only changing the font [2050] of the [2053] um yeah I was only changing the font of [2055] the legend there but I actually wanted [2056] to change the font of everything so let [2057] me just repaste these [2059] Styles then repaste these Styles awesome [2062] that looks a little nicer uh this [2064] section up here should be able to change [2066] the font on that as well [2068] way that I'm going to do that [2071] is I selected a bunch of these by [2077] mistake [2082] interesting oh it's cuz they're grouped [2084] so I'm going to click ungroup it's going [2086] to turn them into separate objects again [2088] and then I can click on [2089] them change this to quick [2092] sand and I'll change this to quick sand [2095] as well [2098] let's go to [2100] style and then the labels are going to [2102] be [2103] quicksand cool and then why don't I [2106] change this background color so instead [2108] of it being all dark and [2110] scary I [2113] use maybe something a little Pinker or [2116] maybe slightly orange or red or [2117] something [2120] instead I could even go light and then [2123] dark I mean damn I'm not a designer [2126] clearly Would S like [2129] this that looks a little scary I don't [2131] like [2133] that um okay what we'll do is we'll just [2135] go very dark pink this pink is here [2139] we'll go dark pink like [2142] this that looks a little better nice [2145] awesome and there you have it there's a [2146] quick and easy uh report essentially [2148] that took us I don't know probably about [2150] 20 minutes to set up realistically you [2151] could probably set something up like [2152] this in five if you were so inclined and [2154] you understood the steps but I was still [2156] mucking through a tiny bit of that [2158] keep in mind that you can do this for [2159] any social media profile doesn't just [2161] have to be Instagram you could for [2162] instance extend this and so you could [2163] have an Instagram report section a [2165] Twitter report section another report [2166] section you could run summary statistics [2168] on this quite simply um which is just [2170] beyond the scope of the video and the [2171] time that I have but you can essentially [2173] run comparisons on you know how much [2174] have it grown over the previous period [2176] This Might represent like an 8% increase [2178] or something so where do we see that you [2180] know uh how does this growth of this [2182] previous period compared to the last [2183] previous period you could sketch out [2186] some content ideas you could have gp4 or [2189] something go through this dashboard and [2191] then give you a list of content ideas [2193] based off of the posts that you had [2195] previously um we didn't enter the post [2197] information here but there was post [2199] information getting pulled out of the uh [2202] apfi scraper if you guys remember so you [2204] could feed that post information in and [2205] have it like generate you a new post [2207] idea and then say next post and then you [2209] know pull from there um there's just so [2211] much that you could do with a tool like [2212] this and the crazy part is is that there [2214] are a lot of SAS companies out there [2216] that essentially scrape data explicitly [2219] using tools like apify or their own [2222] back-end scrapers but then use looker [2224] Studio or some frontend app like this to [2225] just display it and then they charge you [2227] 15 or 20 or $30 a month for it multiply [2230] that by a th000 people you're making [2231] some pretty good money right great news [2233] is you don't actually need to be a [2234] programmer in order to do that you can [2235] do that with make.com pretty [2236] straightforwardly awesome thanks so much [2238] for watching this video guys a lot of [2239] fun putting it together I think that [2241] working with looker Studio as janky as [2243] it may seem from time to time really is [2245] a superpow if you consider the cost [2247] Savings of a platform like this relative [2249] to like pleo or one of these other uh [2251] dashboard services that cost like 4 or [2253] 500 bucks a month so that's pretty cool [2254] if you guys have any questions on this [2256] feel free to leave a comment down below [2257] more than happy to help otherwise thanks [2259] so much for watching please like [2260] subscribe do all that fun YouTube stuff [2262] and last but not least join my community [2264] I got the link in the description along [2266] with a link to the blueprint for this [2267] specific video thanks so much I will see [2269] you all soon bye-bye

Title: Watch Me Automate Indeed Job Applications (AI Resumes & CVs)
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here and [1] in this video I got a very interesting [3] system that I'm going to be building it [4] was recommended by one of my viewers [6] essentially we are going to [8] automatically go out scrape indeed [11] compile a bunch of job listings and then [13] use the copy in those job listings to [15] customize a CV or resume using AI where [18] they going to take all of these and dump [20] them into a project manager so that all [22] somebody that might want to apply to [24] jobs needs to do is just go down the [26] list and copy paste I love this sort of [27] system so much because there's just a of [30] options here you don't have to apply to [32] jobs you could tweak the same approach [34] and apply it to like an RFP platform [36] like upwork where you are scraping jobs [39] and then drafting up a proposal or [41] something like that for services [42] rendered you can do the same for leads [45] where you're drafting up automatic cold [46] emails that are hyper personalized and [48] customized to every individual lead [50] there are basically just a million in [51] one ways to tweak the system into [53] something that works for you so if this [54] sounds like the sort of skill you want [55] to develop stay tuned and let's get into [57] it [61] okay so first things first this video is [63] requested by the lovely user- wc8 yh4 [67] g2s apparently that's a guy called mark [70] thank you very much for this request [71] Mark what Mark wanted was he wanted a [74] similar automation that was a little bit [76] different essentially he wanted excuse [78] me he wanted a method where we could [81] scrape a website and then customize the [82] resume to that website just using chat [84] GPT that's very straightforward very [86] simple and uh you can do that exactly [89] that using the approach that I'm going [90] to show you so I figured what I would do [92] is I would do everything that he's [93] asking I just swap out the website part [95] with indeed instead because I think [97] that's a lot more popular of a job [98] application platform the data is a lot [100] more structured uh and then I'll show [102] you how to customize a resume and it's [104] actually a lot easier to customize a CV [106] than a resume believe it or not so um [108] yeah you know I'm going to knock this [109] out of the park and I'm also going to [110] knock out a lot of people that have been [112] requesting for information on API U so [115] that's nice now in terms of what we're [117] going to need to get this done obviously [118] we're going to need make.com [120] and I have two scenarios open here just [122] because of a quirk of the scraping [123] platform that we're using the first is [124] called run indeed bulk job scraper and [126] then the second is called get results [127] from indeed bulk job scraper and [128] customized resume we essentially need to [130] split this into two parts because um the [133] very first scenario is going to be our [134] trigger and that's just going to turn it [136] on but because scrapers take an [137] indeterminate amount of time to complete [140] uh we can't just wait for it to finish I [142] mean what if the scraper takes 30 [143] minutes you know makes an er's time out [145] after 45 so what if it takes 46 we [147] obviously don't want to run that risk [149] and so what we're doing are splitting [150] into two parts where the first Mak scar [152] is literally just like a scheduled run [154] where you know once a day or once an [156] hour or whatever uh we just give this [157] thing a run and then and then let it go [159] off to the races and then the second [161] scenario will be watching for the [163] completion of that and then when it's [164] completed then we can actually proceed [166] with the rest of our flow we're also [168] going to need apify apify as I've [169] mentioned to you guys previously is just [171] like the most fantastic web scraping [172] platform ever I'm not sponsored or [174] affiliated with them whatsoever I do [176] have an affiliate link if you guys want [177] to sign up for apify I'd appreciate it [179] um but but apify is just like the go-to [182] source for me when I'm doing these [183] Advanced web scraping projects nowadays [186] simply because you can do so with [187] proxies automatically handles a lot of [189] like the the the load balancing and [191] stuff that uh is typically a lot more [193] difficult to do inside of make.com and [196] it's just a really cool platform if you [197] ever want to get into like programming [198] and building out uh you know web [200] crawlers and that sort of thing yourself [202] essentially the way that it works is you [203] head over to the store and then inside [205] of the store are a bunch of pre-built [207] actors which are just their term for [209] scrapers which I think is a little bit [210] more marketable if I'm honest and then [212] you can just select for whatever does [214] the thing that you want so there's a web [217] scraper which is a general purpose [218] website scraper Google Maps scraper [220] Google search results scraper Instagram [222] hashtag scraper right there are [224] thousands what I'm going to do here is [226] I'm just going to type in indeed and [228] then I'm going to grab the very first [229] result indeed scraper this was uh [231] created by a guy called miseries [234] apparently and inside of here you see [236] how there are a bunch of options that we [237] can just change to you know adjust the [238] parameters of the search [240] well this is super straightforward I'm [242] just going to pretend that I'm looking [243] for excuse me uh data engineer inside of [246] the United States specifically in San [248] Fran you know I'm looking for 10 items U [250] and then all you need to do to get this [251] thing going is Press Start apfi gives [253] you I think $5 for free credits when you [255] sign up so you know my free usage is [256] almost maxed out here but um yeah it's [259] just extremely straightforward and very [261] good now I've actually already ran this [262] I don't want to run this again just [263] because of how close I am to the top [265] there uh so what I'm going to do is I'll [267] go over to the last run that I did just [269] to show you the type of data that you uh [271] you get as a result of running this and [273] you'll see that it's actually pretty [275] detailed if you go to all Fields here [277] you get the company name on the left [278] hand side then you get a description of [281] the job this is what we're going to use [282] to feed into chat [284] GPT you get an external apply length so [286] you can actually just do like a oneclick [287] button to go to the website that it is [290] hosted on even if it's not hosted on [292] indeed which is pretty cool then you can [293] also apply directly on indeed over here [295] we also have things like salary ranges [297] uh when the thing was scraped when it [299] was posted there's a lot that you could [301] do here you could theoretically organize [303] this in terms of priority uh by creating [305] a small little algorithm for yourself [307] that takes the high end or maybe the low [308] end of the salary scale maybe it like [310] takes the average of the two and then [311] multiplies that by uh whatever the [314] recency is how many seconds it's been [315] since it's posted normalizes it to one [317] now you have a score essentially that [318] you could use to say holy that [319] job's really high priority I want to [321] apply to that as quickly as I can a lot [323] of cool stuff that you could do very [324] very um fertile ground I would say for [327] Automation and there are very few people [328] that are looking for jobs that are doing [329] stuff like this so if you are looking [331] for a job and you're doing stuff like [333] this I mean they should hire you based [334] on the premise of of the fact that [336] you're doing this alone especially I'm [338] like data engineer funny if I uh was [340] looking for a data scraping job and then [342] I applied to it by scraping that'd be [343] pretty sick any who okay so this is all [346] the data that we get and why don't we [348] actually like put this in a make [350] essentially and then I can show you guys [351] how to customize a resume okay so very [352] first thing we have to do is obviously [354] create the scenario here and what I'm [356] going to do is I'll go over to apify and [358] then the one I'm looking for for is [360] called run an actor this is an action [362] not a trigger but that's okay we can use [364] the scheduling feature to trigger I'm [366] already connected to apify if I wasn't I [367] would need to go to add and then I need [368] to find my API token which they show you [370] how to do just on this page but any who [373] all I need to do is just go down here to [375] best or sorry a miseries indeed Das [377] scraper we're not going to run it [379] synchronously and then input Json build [382] timeout all that stuff um what I'm going [385] to do is for input Jason I'm just going [386] to leave it build I'm going to leave it [388] time out I'm going to leave it and then [389] memory I'm leave it um and this will [390] just take the default settings of [392] whatever I've I've set in the actor page [394] here so this should take in data [396] engineer if it doesn't then you know [398] I'll redo in a second but essentially [401] what's going to happen when I click this [402] button is this thing is going to run and [403] then when it finishes running um we need [405] to find a way to grab that data and then [407] do something with it and so just because [409] you know I only have six cents left and [411] I'm very mindful of how how close that [412] is I'm just going to set up everything [414] ahead of time and then I'll run it and [415] then show you guys what happens in our [418] second scenario that's going to be wait [419] for the actor to finish we're going to [421] get the results from that scraper and [422] then we're going to use that to [423] customize your resume and the module [425] that we're looking for here is called [427] watch actor runs so we give that a [430] click uh I can now create a hook and [433] that hook is basically going to be um [437] indeed bulk job scraper completed and [441] then I can go down here and select the [443] scraper that I want which is the indeed [444] scraper click save and now I basically [447] have like a dedicated module that is [449] just watch watching that scraper to see [451] if it's running or not I'm going to [453] click run once here because I I want to [455] get the completed uh run the second that [457] it's done I'm going to go back to the [459] first scenario and then what I'm going [460] to do is I'm actually going to first of [462] all let's schedule this for every day [465] hypothetically and let's just say we [466] want to run this at 10 [468] a.m. and then what I'm going to do is [469] I'm going to run [471] this and you'll see this completed [474] instantly but that doesn't mean that the [475] actor is completed instantly that just [477] means that the trigger completed [478] instantly we've we've gone out we've [480] triggered the flow and we've received a [481] thumbs up that the flow has now begun if [484] we go over here to U Back to apify [487] you'll see that there's now an in [489] progress actor an actor that's actually [491] going out there and getting data for us [493] and we can see this if we go to log [495] we'll see if there's just information [496] that's you know it's it's going oh [499] actually no there isn't any information [500] okay yeah so the reason why is because [502] we need the um the actor information my [504] bad okay so yeah so earlier when I [507] mentioned that uh we didn't have input [508] Json we we might need that we do [510] actually need input Json uh so I'm just [512] going to go back run the second scenario [514] again and then um in order to get the [517] Json that you need to feed into the uh [519] input module just go over to the apfi [522] actor page click Json and then just copy [525] everything that you have here then paste [527] it over here this is sort of ugly I [529] don't really like the way that this [530] looks so I'm just going to go to Json [531] for.org I'm going to paste this in I'm [535] going to format beautify this and then [536] I'm going to copy this and in this way I [539] I just get this nice beautifully [540] formatted JavaScript object notation [542] which just makes it really easy to see [543] what variables I have and which ones I [545] don't okay so now I'm going to click run [548] I'm going to receive an instant [549] verification that this has indeed ran if [551] you'll see the second scenario has not [553] completed yet because the run is [554] actually just in progress so if I go [556] back to the indeed scraper and show you [557] what I was trying to show you before [559] there's four runs now one of them is now [561] initializing the crawler uh and we [563] needed to we needed to supply those [564] details in order to uh get this thing [567] running this usually takes anywhere from [570] I don't know 30 seconds to maybe 2 or 3 [572] minutes depending on the bulk amount of [574] data that you are scraping if you go [576] back to the input here and you check the [578] uh the parameters I provided I set the [581] max items to 10 so it's really only [582] looking for 10 in D jobs that's probably [585] probably quite uh fast but if you wanted [587] to get like 100 or something it would [589] probably take you a little bit longer [590] just CU there's rate limits involved [592] there's a lot of stuff involved okay [594] anyway you see now that this is [595] completed and so if I go over here to [598] well it's not completed sorry it's uh 7 [600] out of 10 now it's 8 out of [604] 10 you know it uses rate limiting and [606] stuff like that so it doesn't pick them [608] all up instantly but this is good [610] because it makes the flow a lot more [611] sustainable okay nine and now that's 10 [613] out of 10 so if we go back to the second [614] scenario here um now that it's completed [616] its obligations it's going to wind down [618] we're going to get a completed little [620] bubble if I click on this you'll see [622] that there's a bunch of information here [623] and it's basically telling us the status [624] of this which is succeeded what we need [627] to do now is we need to feed in the [629] default data set ID which is over here [632] and then we need to make an additional [634] request to apify to basically show us [636] the data that was scraped so that's [638] pretty interesting um that they split it [639] into two parts like this but there is a [642] lot of reason for that and that's [643] because they want to minim minimize [644] computational load wherever possible [647] some people don't actually need to see [648] the uh data you know there's no reason [651] to bundle a bunch of data into a request [652] if you don't have to so it's sort of [654] what they're doing [655] here all I'm doing now is I'm actually [657] hardcoding in the data set ID from the [658] previous run because now I'm just going [660] to test this I'm going to make sure that [661] this gets the data that I want [663] eventually I'll replace this with the [665] actual data set ID default data set ID [667] variable but because I'm just testing [670] I'm trying to do this quickly I don't [670] want to have to run this scenario over [672] and over and over and over again every [673] single time I'm just putting it in [675] hardcoded then I'm right clicking [677] pressing run and then I'm getting all of [678] the data that I wanted so I get the [681] description which is the most important [682] part and then yeah I got everything I [685] need which is quite nice we have the [688] salary we have everything else [690] so now we are actually good to customize [692] a resume it's about as simple as that in [694] terms of the actual resumé customization [696] part I have drafted up a little Google [699] doc resume here called Max Davis resume [702] Max Davis is a highly skilled data [703] engineer with four years of experience [705] and developing implementation and [707] optimization of data plumbing and ETL [709] processes whatever the hell that means [711] doesn't really matter to us but uh what [713] does is I've added a couple sections [715] here like relevant [716] highlights and then I'm down at the [719] bottom B skills and competencies and the [721] idea here is that AI is going to [722] customize the hell out of those to make [724] it really relevant to every particular [725] job we're also going to get AI to [727] customize this part of course and um you [729] know the job um uh work experience as [732] well but these two I want to say the [733] relevant highlights and the skills and [734] competencies these are probably the most [736] relevant because they allow us to like [738] pitch Max's work um experience in a way [742] that that is most befitting to that [743] particular job of course keep in mind [745] that a hallucinates from time to time so [747] some of the things that it is going to [748] come up with may or may not actually be [749] factually accurate but you know I leave [751] that up to you guys to to worry about um [753] you know if you guys want it to be more [754] factually accurate then you can do some [756] prompt engineering to add some [758] additional steps here where maybe you [759] tell it all of the skills that you have [761] and then have it to mix and match and [762] choose skills to put on your resume um [765] any who I'll show you what it looks like [766] in practice so now that we have those [768] data set items what we need to do is we [770] need to create an open AI module and [772] this open AI module is going to create a [774] completion what we're going to do is [777] we're going to feed in an example of [779] this resume and I'm going to do it in a [781] pretty smart way oh I think a gbt 40 [785] just came out right yeah that's their [786] new system which is presumably better [789] and what I'm going to do is I've [790] actually already created a little test [791] here um so I I know more or less what I [793] want the prompt to be so I'm just going [795] to copy this from this previous [797] module I always do a system and then a [800] user prompt and then a bunch of user [802] assistant examples this time I'm just [803] going to generate the examples using AI [805] since I already know that they're pretty [807] good so that's my system prompt which [809] tells the system more or less what it [810] identifies as and then the next is going [813] to be below is a resume and job post I'm [817] going to say [821] customize the resume to the job post [824] keep the places work the same but modify [826] everything else in the resume to match [827] the job post requested skills and [829] qualifications pretty straightforward [831] right we'll say write the new resumé in [834] markdown ATX format this is a little [838] hack that I'm using us and I'll show you [840] why I'm using this hack in a [842] second next thing um is I'm going to [847] let's see [849] here I think I already had it generated [851] I think in markdown yeah I did right [852] over here which is quite [854] nice I'm not going to go [857] certifications oh I don't know what [859] happened [860] here and then um I I have an example of [862] this here so I'm just going [865] to copy this resume [871] I'll say [873] resume let's do [875] this paste this resume [878] in and then I'll go job post and then [882] what I'm going to do is [885] um for this let me actually grab an a [889] real job post and then we'll just use [891] this as the [892] example this looks [896] nice then we'll uh we'll have this run [898] once [901] and then for Max tokens I'm just going [902] to go 4096 and then temperature I'll go [905] 0.7 and then frequency penalty presence [908] penalty I won't do any of that and we're [910] just going to Output it as raw text [912] we're going to see what happens um again [914] I'm hardcoding the data here it's not uh [916] new data and so because I'm hardcoding [917] it I can actually just click on this and [919] then click run um so we'll we'll give [922] this a quick [923] try and you'll see why I'm using [925] markdown format in a second because we [927] need to turn this into a Google doc um [929] the second that it's a Google doc we can [930] do a lot more with it like you could [931] save it as a PDF if these platforms are [933] PDFs you could do more or less anything [935] you [935] want okay just gave it a quick run if I [938] look at the result here I have this [940] resume here and you'll see that it's [941] been tailored to the specific job um [943] it's no longer like data engineer it's [946] data loss prevention DLP analyst which [948] is quite [949] nice there's this relevant highlight [951] section which obviously is now specific [953] to words data loss prevention and then [956] you'll see that the job uh the jobs [958] themselves the work experience hasn't [960] changed which is what we wanted um all [962] that's done is essentially we've um had [964] the AI shift a couple of the words [966] around and provide more of an emphasis [967] on the data loss prevention side of [969] things rather than the data engineering [971] side of things so that's pretty cool um [973] the good news about this is this is in a [975] format now um that we can literally just [977] directly copy and paste and turn into a [980] Google doc really really [982] quickly now markdown is just like a just [985] another format um what we need to do is [987] we need to put this into a Google doc so [989] let me show you what'll happen if we [991] just try and pump this into a Google doc [993] immediately if we create a [996] document and then if we paste in this [998] content and let's just call this Max and [1000] Davis [1002] resume um the document location I'm [1004] going to save I'm just going to do the [1005] index that's just the backs [1008] slash if we just run [1013] this then if I grab the web view link [1015] and I open this in a new tab you'll see [1017] that uh this looks kind of ugly ideally [1020] what we'd want is we'd want all of the [1021] headers all of the um sections that have [1024] just one number sign we want these to be [1027] maybe like heading one and then we want [1029] everything with like two number signs to [1031] be heading two three number signs to be [1032] heading three that sort of thing and [1033] then we want to remove these that's [1035] basically what markdown allows us to do [1037] which is really cool it's just a [1038] compressed like language it's [1040] technically a markup language uh which [1042] allows certain parsers to turn this into [1045] you know nicely formatted headings and [1047] that sort of thing so um what we need to [1049] do now is we need to basically convert [1052] markdown into [1054] HTML and then by doing this we're going [1056] to feed the HTML into the Google Doc and [1058] then HTML is something the Google Doc [1060] understands which is quite nice so what [1062] I'm going to do here is I'll feed [1064] in this whole resume here and then I'll [1069] show you what it looks [1070] like you'll see the output of this mark [1072] down HTML module now has a bunch of H1s [1075] and PS and all that stuff and if I copy [1078] all of this into the Google Doc module [1083] instead and I run [1087] this the output of this module is now [1089] going to be basically beautifully [1091] formatted and it's going to be ready for [1093] us to use in you know an actual resume [1096] format you see how the headings are all [1098] beautiful the job titles are nicely [1100] spaced out and formatted we have bullet [1101] points we have all that stuff so this [1104] looks pretty good to me um you know I [1105] might I might shoot a couple of like [1107] training examples in this flow um if I [1109] were to do that I would use the output [1111] that I just generated as [1113] one so let's [1117] um let me [1120] see I'm going to G to give it just one [1123] example of [1124] training I'm going to say this is the [1127] oops that's actually really ugly there [1129] you go that's much better I'm going to [1132] go to user again and then what I'm going [1135] to do is I'll go resume actually let [1137] just copy all of this [1140] and then I'm going to replace this job [1142] post [1143] section with an actual job post which [1147] I'll get if I go to [1148] description so this is our basic resumé [1151] template here in markdown and then we're [1153] going to turn this into yeah that looks [1155] good and we've given it one example of [1157] what we wanted to do which is quite nice [1159] there was one line here that I didn't [1161] like I think it was all the way down at [1162] the [1164] bottom let me see yeah the fact that [1167] there's that additional line I didn't [1169] really like that so let's just remove [1172] this okay and it should be pretty good [1174] now um what I'm going to do here is now [1177] that this is all done I'm actually just [1178] going to like go through from end to [1180] beginning and I'm just going to fill in [1181] the actual variables that I want so in [1183] the Google Doc module I want the [1184] markdown to HTML [1186] output in the markdown module I want the [1188] gp4 [1189] output in gp4 I think we just made the [1192] edit [1195] right yeah we got the job post coming in [1198] um and apify we're looking at this data [1201] set [1202] ID so I'm going to go find the default [1204] data set ID and then this should be good [1207] because we're just waiting for the [1208] results awesome okay now that I have a [1210] Google doc um the last step that I want [1212] is basically what I want in this flow is [1214] I just want to dump all these results [1216] into a Google sheet and then I want the [1217] Google sheet to populate with like a [1219] link to the indeed drob post so somebody [1220] can just click once and then you know [1223] use the Google Doc or whatever to [1225] automatically apply um I think that [1226] would just be a very straightforward way [1227] of doing it uh you can apply [1229] automatically to indeed using apify um [1231] it's totally against all of their terms [1232] and services and to be real I wouldn't [1234] really recommend it I think there's just [1236] way too much reputational risk on the [1237] line if you're applying to jobs [1239] completely automatically like that U but [1240] you can certainly do it uh you would [1242] just need to build a custom scraper in [1243] API which is sort of beyond the the [1246] extent of this video uh but anyway what [1247] I'm going to do in order to dump this [1248] into Google Sheets is I'm going to add [1250] another Google sheet module I'm just [1253] going to call add a row and then I'm [1255] going to just create a new Google sheet [1256] I need to create this in [1259] oh that's [1261] annoying I need to create this in this [1263] account because that's where all of my [1265] important Google Sheets are held [1268] supposedly and we're just going to call [1269] this [1271] Indeed [1273] jobs now if you think about it there are [1275] a bunch of columns I'm going to want [1278] here I'm going to go to this Google doc [1280] and let's just see uh I'm going to want [1283] basically all of these so I'm going to [1285] want the position name first and [1286] foremost then the salary I'm going to [1288] want the job type I want the company [1290] location rating reviews count [1294] URL I might want a job description I [1296] don't know and then I'm going to want to [1298] link to the Google Doc as [1301] well um so that's what I'm going to need [1304] so I'm just going to go through here and [1305] add all these as headers the very first [1307] thing I'm going to want is position name [1309] so I'm just going to go position name [1311] and I'm not going to do the camel case [1313] um variable format I'm just going to use [1316] capitals go job [1319] type company [1322] location [1324] rating reviews uh I don't know if rating [1327] is really relevant doesn't look like we [1328] got anything from there so let's not [1329] worry about that let's just go to [1332] description we'll go [1337] URL and then we'll go um Google doc or [1341] maybe we'll go customized resume that's [1343] what we'll [1345] do and then what I always like to do um [1348] for stuff like this is always regardless [1350] of what sort of data I'm doing I'll [1353] always just go like date created and [1355] this just gives you a ton more freedom [1357] uh to sort the field however you want [1359] sorry sort the Google Doc however you [1361] want um we'll just be able to feed in [1363] scraped at for a date created actually [1366] why don't we feed in um posted at too [1369] we'll go posted at and then here we'll [1371] go scraped [1374] at okay and I'm just um selecting all [1376] and then double clicking on this just to [1378] space all of the columns out cu I don't [1380] really like when they're super close [1381] together I also like Bolding the uh [1384] headers of all of my Google Docs I think [1387] that's just like a very simple way of [1389] showing what the important data is and [1392] then uh I'm just a huge for a [1394] certain font called enter so I will [1396] always just choose enter regardless just [1398] my OCD talking in the top right hand [1401] corner you can then share this I'm just [1402] going to share this to anybody with the [1404] link I'm going to click editor [1406] here and now that we've set this up we [1409] can go to our make scenario and then we [1411] can actually select the U the exact [1413] spreadsheet that we want which will just [1414] be called Indeed [1420] jobs because we've added in all of our [1422] headers these headers will now be [1424] available to [1426] us and we can just go and map through [1429] the data that we've produced before so [1431] position name will be [1433] here posted [1436] at will be here [1439] scraped at will be here salary I believe [1444] it's going to be range job [1448] type [1450] company [1453] location [1456] description and then last but not least [1458] URL to apply that'll be this one right [1463] here and then customized resume we're [1465] going to use this web view link that's [1467] what we're going to dump in [1470] okay we are now good to actually test [1472] this out and see how it works now for [1474] the purposes of speed I'm only going to [1476] test out I test this out on three I'm [1478] not going to go any more than that I [1479] just want to make sure I don't get like [1481] um rate limited because I only have six [1482] cents left on apify we're going to run [1485] this once and then I'm now also going to [1487] click run once on the back [1490] end um and now we just have to wait and [1493] see what happens on the apify set of [1495] things I'm going to go back to indeed [1496] scraper click on runs we'll see that the [1498] current run is now initialized in the [1499] crawler go to all Fields here and we are [1502] going to sit and wait patiently until [1503] our data populates I'm pretty excited [1506] because uh if you think about it [1508] normally it takes anywhere from I don't [1510] know like 3 minutes to maybe 10 minutes [1512] to customize a resume to a specific uh [1515] job post this system allows us to do [1517] that basically instantaneously for like [1518] two cents and in addition to taking two [1521] cents and being an occurring [1523] instantaneously you don't have to like [1524] muck around in Google Docs and then I [1527] don't know like screw around with form [1528] forting or anything because the markdown [1529] to HTML modules just does all that for [1531] you uh the end result is you get like a [1533] very standard looking or maybe not [1535] standard looking but you got a very like [1537] clean looking resume um but it you know [1539] it's it's very high quality which I like [1541] now you'll see that everything after [1543] this module is running more than once so [1545] this is one one this is now on its [1546] second run everything here will be on [1548] second and then it'll go on third the [1549] reason why is if you click this little [1550] bubble we're just outputting multiple [1552] bundles and anytime that a module up [1554] puts multiple bundles this just tells [1555] all other future modules that hey for [1557] every bundle we want you to run at least [1559] once so that's what's Happening Here If [1561] we go back to our Google sheet here uh [1564] you'll see that this is pretty spread [1566] out and I think the reason why is [1567] because I didn't wrap the [1569] rows that's [1572] okay I also see that everything is [1574] bolded so I'm just going to unbold [1575] everything [1576] here and then why don't I just like [1579] standardize the heights of [1581] these uh nope too small that looks [1585] pretty [1586] good and then we'll just make the [1588] descriptions a little bigger URL to [1591] apply a little bigger customize Revenue [1593] a little bigger so you'll see that uh [1596] the job descriptions were pumped in [1598] directly um so that's nice Nuna Discord [1601] and looks like king.com no way it's just [1603] called king.com dude what the hell is [1605] king.com no way it's Candy Crash that's [1609] hilarious uh there's the URL to apply [1611] over here we can just click this one [1612] button and then we'll be taken to a page [1614] where we can just click apply now and [1616] then probably most importantly our [1617] customiz [1618] RS which I've just named Max Davis [1621] resume for all these but these are now [1623] custom tailored to the to the particular [1625] job you know the job role here is senior [1627] data engineer and the job role that we [1630] are supposedly um geared towards now is [1632] senior data engineer there's a bunch of [1634] data you know senior data engineering [1636] specific stuff that is now under [1638] relevant highlights um if we go down to [1640] this one guarantee you this is going to [1642] be about lead software engineer software [1644] engineering leader so I mean it's smart [1646] enough to even rephrase it so it's not [1647] the exact same thing [1648] and you know you you'll see that the [1650] skills and competencies the education it [1652] even added a Technologies use section [1654] because that's probably something that [1655] the job specifically asked for so yeah [1658] pretty cut and dry sort of system um off [1660] the top of my head if I were to try and [1662] improve this flow I would do a couple of [1664] things the first is I would generate a [1666] resumé not just in Google DOC format but [1668] I'd also convert it to PDF because a lot [1671] of these job websites for whatever [1673] freaking reason they want a pdf version [1674] of your resume and they also want a [1676] Google doc version of your resume so I [1677] do that and then i' have a column called [1678] PDF resume that you could just copy and [1680] paste in much [1682] faster um I would probably do most of [1685] this in air table uh just because I [1686] think the UI and ux of air table is a [1688] little nicer but it also costs like 30 [1690] bucks a month or something like that for [1692] what we need it for so it's not hyper [1694] relevant just makes it easier if you [1695] ever wanted to like design a front end [1697] to this later or do do little tweaks [1699] like that um I might pull in some more [1702] data and I might use Google Sheets [1705] filtering in order to show me only jobs [1707] that match my salary criteria and I [1709] might add like a priority field and I'd [1712] use a formula to take the um date that [1715] the job was posted and then I would [1718] calculate the distance between the date [1719] that the job was posted and then the [1721] current date so maybe I get some [1722] representation in seconds and then I'd [1725] uh [1726] I'd divide the salary by that so that [1731] the longer it has been since the job has [1734] been posted the smaller the priority [1736] score would be and then what I do is I [1738] just have a filter that automatically [1739] sorts the Google sheet based off that [1741] priority so that you know if I only have [1743] time to apply to 15 or 20 jobs a day [1745] let's say I can do so just by going [1747] through the top 15 or 20 on the priority [1749] list as opposed to having to muck around [1750] and not really know which jobs are the [1751] biggest bang for my buck that's what I [1754] would do to make this even better but I [1755] think that I've given you all the tools [1756] that you need to go out there and make a [1758] really Kick-Ass system by yourself hope [1759] you guys enjoyed the video that's it [1761] from me if you guys have any questions [1762] about system this one or systems like it [1764] feel free to drop a comment down below [1766] as you can see I Source this Direct

Title: Automation Agency Sales Process 101
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here and [1] in this video I'm going to break down [2] how to build a sales process for your [4] automation agency you can apply [6] everything that I'm going to show you in [7] this video to basically every other [9] service industry agency out there as [11] well uh but I'm going to talk [12] specifically about automation agencies [14] because I know that that's the bulk of [15] my viewers and the good news is it [17] doesn't really change the process too [18] much there are so many people out there [20] that are stuck at the 2K or 4K or 10K 15 [23] 30k a month Mark and they just can't [25] seem to grow no matter what they try and [28] the main reason why is because they [29] don't have a dialed in sales process [31] what I'm going to do in this video is [32] I'm going to break down exactly why that [34] is and what you can do to rectify that [36] by building out a very simple and very [38] streamlined sales system that you can [39] just copy and paste directly into your [41] business although I'd obviously prefer [42] that you know you watch the video and [43] you understand the concepts that I'm [45] going to explain so if that sounds like [46] something that you guys want to work on [47] then this is a video for you stay tuned [49] and let's get into [52] it okay so what I got here is a quick [54] little Whimsical board it's just a [56] graphic workflow design tool and what [58] I've done is I've mapped out the [60] simplest most standard flow that you can [63] use for any agency essentially but [65] that's particularly helpful or useful [67] when you're selling Automation Services [69] or automation projects this is not a new [72] business model if you're thinking about [74] you know like the agency the agency is a [77] very standard old business idea I mean [80] this sort of service model has been [83] around for well over 70 years and [85] essentially for the last 70 years people [88] have slowly evolved it and figured out [91] like the best most standardized way to [93] proceed forward with uh with closing [95] deals of more or less any size and this [97] is it you're looking at it right now I [99] didn't come up with this I didn't really [101] have to think super hard about this this [103] is more or less just what every agency [104] does so if you don't have a sales [106] process you don't rebuild the wheel and [108] try and come up with something new [109] something from scratch something [111] completely different that's going to be [112] amazing and better than what we have [114] because your job if you're starting an [115] agency let's be real it's not to change [117] the world your job is to build a machine [120] that's efficient and capable at [121] producing revenue and in particular [123] converting that Revenue into a [124] relatively High profit margin [126] consistently you're not going to be you [128] know launching a rocket to to Mars or [131] the moon anytime soon right they're [132] different business models for that sort [134] of thing that require a lot more R&D so [136] what I'm going to do over the course of [136] the next we minut is just run you [137] through this and then I'm going to [139] duplicate this model and then I'm going [140] to show you another variant that you [141] could use specifically for automation [143] agencies um that I think is probably a [144] little bit higher yield to most people [146] uh but feel free to use whatever model [148] that you want as long as you have a [150] model and understand the basics that I'm [152] going to be [153] explaining so first things first I don't [156] like over complicating things there are [157] dozens of these sorts of system graphs [160] with a million different um boxes and [162] there's way more complexity there and [164] the arrows feed in you know 50 million [166] times Cycles Loops all that I think [168] that that's sort of silly I think that [169] at the core you know the purpose of or [171] really the reason why um people are [173] successful in business is usually their [175] ability to strip away the complexity so [176] I'm going really simple here I know that [178] a lot of people are probably going to be [179] like you're missing all this stuff but [180] it's fine we're just focusing on the [182] fundamentals first and foremost um sales [184] is very different from marketing and so [186] you see there's some boxes around sales [188] and then there's another box around this [189] section called marketing um and I've [191] used different colors to disambiguate [192] them marketing is everything that leads [194] up to at least in an agency model you [197] having a conversation with the prospect [199] literally everything until you [201] physically either get on a call with [203] them or if you're doing some other type [204] of business model you're sending them [206] voice DMS or whatever than than than [207] that in our case I'm going to St [209] standardized and say meeting booked [211] everything before meeting booked is [212] marketing everything after meeting [214] booked is sales so just to be complete [217] um in marketing if you're running an [218] agency especially a digital one there [220] are a variety of ways that you can [221] obviously get people onto a meeting you [223] can go through cold email which is [225] something that I talk about a lot that [226] has recently been gaining a ton of [227] popularity because of AI personalization [229] and whatnot this involves you finding [231] lists of people that might be interested [232] in your service doing research on them [234] or maybe getting added to it and then [236] reaching out and presumably having some [238] type of email conversation where you [240] will funnel them into a meeting Buck [242] we're doing PPC ads you might be [244] creating some type of campaign maybe [246] you're selling a lead magnet maybe [247] you're just talking about you know hey [249] do you need marketing services for your [250] thing click this button but the purpose [252] of that whole that whole exercise is to [254] get them to click the button and then [255] scroll down the page and then book a [257] meeting with you right so then voila you [259] now have a meeting booked if you're [260] doing SEO same sort of deal as PPC ads [262] is just organic social media you know [264] you're branding yourself you're building [265] your reputation similar to to what I'm [267] doing now a lot of people want to talk [269] to you obvious obviously so what's the [270] way that you funnel that into uh you [272] know into some type of next step or next [273] outcome you book a meeting with them [275] referrals what do you naturally do when [277] somebody's like hey man I really liked [278] working with you I got a guy who's [280] fantastic and he wants the system you [282] say awesome you know what's your [283] calendar link let's get on a call and [285] the communities obviously in order to [287] take that to the next step when you're [288] having a conversation with somebody that [289] might be interested in what you have to [290] say sort of like organic networking [292] style um you need to book a meeting so [294] it doesn't matter what method you have [296] here the methods themselves are just [297] black boxes the only thing that matters [299] is that this helps you generate a [301] meeting and the second that you [303] transition from um you know like the [305] marketing step over here to a meeting [307] booked this is when the actual sales [309] process begins and this is when you know [310] you start essentially the decisions that [312] you make here start having a [313] disproportionate impact on your ability [315] to close so you need a sales system [318] first and foremost this sales system has [320] what seven different you know little [322] modules your sales system might have 500 [325] I've seen Sales Systems that work [326] extremely well with two the most [327] important thing isn't so far that you [329] have like the best sales system in the [330] world it's that you just have a sales [332] system I used to sell door to door I [334] sold door to door for a year and a half [336] so um this is B tobor I'd walk into [338] businesses and then I'd try and Pitch [339] them on local marketing Services I got [341] thrown out more times than you could [342] count but the main reason why I was [343] unable to grow my business more than [345] about1 to [346] $150,000 in the in the calendar year [348] that I was working at the time was [350] because I didn't have a standardized [352] sales process every single time I'd walk [354] into the door I didn't really like [356] scripts so every single time I walked in [357] the door I would say something different [359] now naturally the prospect would respond [361] differently naturally if the prospect [362] responded differently then I would say [363] something different every single [365] interaction was inconsistent and [367] non-standardized and it meant that as a [369] result the client always had just a [371] different experience with me if they [374] always have different and inconsistent [375] experiences then you're unable to [377] optimize every individual part of the [378] experience you're unable to systematize [380] and make it better so the most important [382] thing isn't that you have the best [382] system in the world it's just that you [384] have a system that you can start with [386] start using consistently and then start [387] thinking hm where are people dropping [389] off in my system are they dropping off [391] at the beginning with the first sales [392] call are they dropping off with my email [393] follow-ups are they dropping off here [394] are they dropping off there and then at [396] least you have a point where you can [397] start to make it better so this is one [400] sales system not all of them but it's [401] the one that I would probably recommend [403] most people start with first things [404] first is you have a lead and the meeting [406] is now booked well the meeting is booked [408] but that doesn't necessarily mean [409] they're going to show up to the meeting [410] right if somebody books a meeting with [412] you there's probably maybe like a 60% [414] chance that they'll show but on average [415] you know 40% of the time they'll flake [417] so we need to make allowances for that [418] let's say you book a for next Friday and [420] the next Friday shows up you're sitting [422] on the call nobody uh nobody's there [424] except for you we consider that a noow [427] obviously in meeting parlament and so we [428] need to do something with that no-show [430] what we do is we have some type of [431] follow-up cycle this is a very simple [433] and straightforward part of any system [435] that converts and makes a lot of money [436] you need to be following up with the [438] people that um have fallen out of your [440] funnel so to say or leaked through uh [443] you know like the holes in it and uh [445] with a followup cycle that might take [446] the place of like phone calls in your [448] CRM you might like schedule three or [450] four calls to follow up and make sure [451] the person gets rebooked you might do [453] some type of follow-up email sequence [454] you might just ping them once get their [456] SMS something like that whatever the [457] form of that is you just need to make [459] sure you have some type of follow-up [460] system in place or follow-up cycle in [462] place that ensures that the people that [464] don't uh make it to the meetings are at [466] least still being nurtured in some way [470] what happens when they get nurtured and [472] they want to rebook you know they're [473] like I'm so sorry my cat died and I had [474] to you know flake on our our scheduled [476] meeting uh well then they rebook and [478] then we go right back to square one [480] where the meeting is booked this process [482] here can occur five six maybe even seven [484] times I think I've had one extremely [486] annoying prospect that flaked on me over [488] a dozen times we ended up actually [490] getting together and the call ended up [492] not being a fit which is a huge pain in [493] my ass but the great news is we at least [495] we got on the call at least I figured [496] that out so um yeah it's sort of the [499] sequence between meeting booked and [500] follow-up cycle right now the more [502] likely thing and probably the thing that [504] we care most about is if they show so [506] what happens if they show well if they [508] show then you have a Sal meeting and [510] that's beyond the scope of this [511] particular video but I'm going to record [512] more videos in the future about my [513] specific sales process how to optimize [516] your like actual sales meeting um just [518] like I'm building out a system here for [520] the actual flow of a lead you can build [522] out a system for the actual progression [523] of every call you could have step one I [525] say that step two I say that step three [527] I say that and then again you can use [528] that as a starting ground to leap off of [530] and then optimize and iterate um from [532] there but anywh who the sales meeting is [533] going to occur if you think about it [535] logically there are few outcomes that [536] happen when a sales meeting is concluded [539] at the end end of the call the client [540] might like what you have to say and then [542] they want to move forward they might [544] hate what you have to say and never want [545] to talk to you again or they might think [548] that this is something that I may [549] potentially do in the future but I'm not [551] really interested right now so we're [552] going to go through all three of these [554] together the first thing is this is not [557] a fit right now and if this is not a fit [559] right now then think about it logically [561] they're saying it's not a fit right now [562] so it may be a fit in the future and if [564] this occurs then what do we do well in [566] this specific sales processes case we're [567] waiting 30 days and then we are pushing [569] back into a followup cycle to rebook and [571] so now instead of the loop being from [572] meeting book to follow-up cycle like [574] this now the loop is this and sometimes [578] clients or prospects will run through [579] this three or four times before you sell [581] but by having a system like this it [582] ensures that at least you're capturing [584] the people that otherwise would just [585] dripped through and leaked right so [588] that's number one this maybe happens 20% [589] of the time in my experience the other [592] outcome is that it's not a fit ever so [594] it's not just not a fit right now it's [596] like hey no we're not we're not a good [598] uh mix you know the services that want [599] are not the services I could provide I [601] really don't like who you are as a [602] person I think that you'd be a nightmare [603] to work with you're incapable of paying [605] whatever price I might be pitching you [607] yada yada the point that I'm making is [609] that person is never going to be a fit [610] and what do you do in that case you opt [611] out they are good to leave your sales [613] system you never need to talk to them [614] again amazing the third outcome is that [617] the sales meeting occurs and there's [619] some type of positive outcome so they [621] say you know man this this sounds really [623] great I really love your agency and I [624] love everything that it stands for I'd [625] love to work with you guys this is a [627] very positive outlook maybe they ask [630] what's next maybe you explain to them [631] what's next I'll show you what's next in [633] a sec but essentially this is outcome [635] number three and it's the best one it's [636] the one that we're shooting for where [637] they want to move forward so in this way [640] by having multiple outcomes essentially [642] to represent all of the various things [643] that could happen we're capturing the [645] vast majority of these leads regardless [646] of where they're falling through the [647] cycle and then we're pushing them back [649] through our standardized funnel um you [651] know the standardized funnel is just [652] everything in blue here that goes [653] straight from from top to bottom [655] everything in green is sort of like the [657] recovery um anyway so yeah they want to [659] move forward so what do we do when they [660] want to move forward well usually in the [662] agency space you don't need this and I [665] actually don't really like sending out [666] super complicated agreements or [668] proposals or anything like that I like [670] keeping it very straight very simple and [671] very to the point and a lot of the time [673] I don't even like write a contract with [674] somebody that I like and respect the [675] like and respect stands in for the legal [677] e some people may disagree with me and [679] say that that's going to burn me hasn't [680] burned me yet I've made a fair amount of [681] money so you know take that with the [683] Grandin assault do your own due [684] diligence but that's my recommendation [687] anywh who uh most agencies in order to [688] formalize the interest of the client [690] they need to send some type of detailed [692] proposal or some type of scope of work [694] so the scope of work might be a list of [696] deliverables that the client is going to [697] get for whatever you are offering it [699] might be a list of monthly obligations [701] for a retainer it might be um you know [705] some type of like annual obligation to [707] deliver X Y and Z or they get their [708] money back with some refund guarantee as [711] long as it's just an itemized uh [713] breakdown of what it is that you are [715] providing that's usually good enough you [716] can bundle in a contract with us you can [718] bundle in you know a big showy proposal [721] or whatnot that's totally fine if you [722] want to do that um but as long as you [724] just have some type of like itemized [726] breakdown you're basically good to go [728] now if you think about it this send [730] detailed proposal scope of work also has [732] a few different steps that people could [733] take at this point they could not sign [735] it maybe I don't know you have some [737] process in your system and instead of [739] not signed we say not signed after seven [741] days so if they haven't signed it after [742] seven days we need to do something right [745] um what we do then is we we add them to [746] the follow-up cycle we have another [748] follow-up cycle specifically for the [750] contracts as opposed to just the [751] meetings booked and now this follow-up [753] cycle is basically like hey how's [754] everything going with the contract or [755] how's everything going with the proposal [756] let me know if I can help I'd love to [757] check in you know you discussed X Y andz [759] I think we might be the right fit for [760] this uh what's going on you might you [762] know have a a system in your CRM that [765] schedules a bunch of calls for you to [766] book right so now you're you're jumping [767] on a call with them instead of just [768] sending them an email this might be a [770] fully automated system right there's [771] just so many options here but the point [772] is you just need to be following up with [774] them again if they drop off at The [775] Proposal Part another interesting tidbit [778] is if you consider the Val Val of a lead [779] at every individual step the value of a [782] lead here before they've really become a [784] a lead of yours like before they they've [786] gone through your funnel is pretty low [788] right and so if you think about like [790] your ad revenues that you spend um [792] buying Media or like the money that [794] you're spending on SEO and if you divide [795] that by all the people that are seeing [797] it like the cost that you're spending [798] per lead super low not really that big [800] of a deal but the second that they go [802] into meeting booked there's now like a a [804] value that's quite High that's assigned [805] to every lead like let's say you charge [808] $10,000 on on average um and then on [811] average it takes you 10 leads to turn [812] into one client that means that the [814] value of every lead as they get a [816] meeting booked is $1,000 so you actually [818] should be willing to invest in [819] infrastructure systems and and people to [822] try and squeeze as much value out of [823] those thousand leads as possible you [825] know if this meeting booked is $1,000 [827] then if the sales meeting occurs the [828] value of that lead might now be $3,000 [830] on average if uh the detail proposal so [834] uh scope of work step happens well now [835] the value of that lead might be [837] $5,000 right like at at every Point [839] through the process the value of the [841] lead is higher and so you can actually [842] spend more time energy infrastructure [844] resources and people to try and you know [846] squeeze the value out of them as much as [848] you can so you know as you proceed maybe [851] this follow-ups are more aggressive in [852] nature maybe they're in your city and so [855] I don't know I've seen Direct Mail [857] campaigns where you will send like a [858] funny picture or something like that [861] with some type of gift card inside and [863] then you know you mail it to their [864] address if they haven't signed the [865] proposal within like a week or two it's [867] just something essentially um to [869] illustrate the value that lead to you at [871] that particular point in time and you [872] should be willing to invest resources at [874] every step because of how much more [876] disproportionally valuable somebody is [877] at the end then at the beginning anywh [879] who um if you think about it they cannot [881] sign and if they don't sign then they're [883] part of the follow-up cycle and then we [884] resend not sign resign we can do this [886] all day but obviously the more important [888] and the outcome that we want is for them [890] to sign and for them to ultimately pay [893] and what I see so many people making a [894] mistake at here is notice how it's [897] assigned plus paid [899] if somebody hasn't signed and paid or I [902] don't know at least paid you right like [904] as I mentioned I don't really like [905] proposals or um contracts or whatnot so [908] the signatures aren't as important to me [909] but if somebody hasn't at least paid you [911] for the services that you are telling [912] them that you are going to provide them [914] then you can't start the project right [916] and if you think about this like super [917] old school agency model that's been [919] around for 70 years they understood this [921] a long time [922] ago if you have a system it's better [926] than having no system and then starting [927] to work for people before has changed [929] hands or starting to do something before [931] you've actually locked down that you [932] have enough Capital expense to make it [933] through this project um so you know just [936] never start the project until you [937] actually have some type of payment [939] coming through uh and you know if you're [940] sending a detailed proposal maybe that [942] includes a signature line or something [944] this right here is the standardized [947] agency template that I guarantee you [949] like probably more than 50% of All [951] Digital agencies are using they may vary [954] in small places like instead of um [957] sending the detail proposal or scope of [958] work at a separate step they actually [960] just show them in the S step and then by [962] doing so they get like a yes or no close [965] decision right there on the call that [966] can make things pretty quick but [967] obviously that's at odds with like the [969] comfort of the client and if it's like a [970] bigger institutional sort of Enterprise [973] business then a lot of the time it takes [974] a multiple steps so this is the base [977] template as I mentioned earlier why [978] don't we now duplicate this and then um [981] show you like a couple of different ones [983] that we can [984] build and I'm just going to delete this [986] other marketing funnel that I had here [988] because it's ug ugly and I hate it [992] okay so I'm going to do one on the left [995] and then I'm also going to do one on the [998] right oh I didn't copy all of them there [1001] let's do [1004] this okay and then I realized I didn't [1007] copy the section as [1011] well okay we're going to call this our [1016] base sales system [1021] and we'll call this our standardized [1023] sales [1027] system and [1029] then over here on the left I'm going to [1032] show you a one call close [1038] system over on the right I'm going to [1040] show you a two call close [1044] system and then maybe standardize isn't [1046] the right word maybe we'll just say like [1048] traditional agency sales system and I [1051] think a lot of people take traditional [1052] to mean bad it's not bad traditional is [1054] totally fine um and you know I used this [1056] when I started my uh my operations [1058] business it served me quite [1060] well all right so in the one call close [1062] system you know how earlier I mentioned [1064] that um some people like to eliminate [1066] the detailed propos scope work they just [1067] stick it in the sales meeting um that's [1069] that's essentially how this works you [1071] know I mentioned earlier that like the [1073] real key in running a successful agency [1075] is your ability to simplify not [1076] necessarily make things more complex and [1078] so so if you think about it like this [1079] sales system has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 eight [1082] boxes we can eliminate a couple of these [1084] boxes right now by turning this from a [1086] two two-step close system to a one-step [1088] close system sorry not from a two-step [1091] to One Step but from um this sort of [1092] like uh sales meeting and then send the [1094] detail proposal just bundling it all [1095] together so um how would you do that [1098] well I'm just going to make this a [1099] little taller oops I'm not going to make [1101] it that much taller [1112] essentially what we do [1113] is and this is frustrating but we can't [1116] get those perfectly straight lines so I [1118] guess we will we will [1121] not is instead of having two different [1125] steps [1130] here if you think about it on the sales [1133] call you actually have a ton of Leverage [1135] because you're there with the prospect [1136] in person and so instead of sending a [1138] proposal afterwards which you know a lot [1140] of people do especially people that are [1141] new to sales because they don't really [1142] like jumping on the call and then [1143] selling the person hard or that sort of [1145] deal um you can also just sell the [1147] person right there they say you know [1149] this sounds really interesting and [1151] you're like okay great well I have the [1152] agreement right here I'd love it if we [1153] could take a look at it together or all [1155] right awesome well I have some resources [1156] here I'd love it if we could take a look [1157] at it together and then wrap up payments [1159] if you think about it we've now taken a [1161] step that was previously eight boxes uh [1163] and we've turned it into just six so [1165] we've eliminated two and this is [1166] substantially simpler and substantially [1168] less complex what this means in practice [1170] is that you know usually the sales [1172] relationships are a little bit different [1174] because you know the client has been [1175] hard sold as opposed to you know having [1176] the time and energy to make that [1178] decision presumably for themselves [1180] obviously there are tons of different [1181] sales tweaks and quirks that you could [1183] use to uh you know still build still [1185] build a fair amount of comfort on the [1186] call not have them hate you and and that [1188] sort of thing but just keep in mind that [1189] if you do a system like this uh you'll [1191] usually see higher refund rates um [1193] you'll usually see higher [1194] dissatisfaction rates uh but you know [1196] you will you will usually close more and [1198] you'll usually make a fair bit more [1199] money which is quite nice the other [1201] benefit to this is it reduces [1204] the spending of resources on items that [1207] are not directly associated with closing [1210] the deal like by eliminating those [1212] follow-up steps that we had previously [1213] and then the proposal step in a separate [1216] um you know module uh we're just [1217] bundling everything into the sales call [1218] and so you can usually like structure [1220] your sales teams really really easily [1221] usually just have like a closer and that [1223] closer is very talented and you pay them [1224] a commission on the deal with maybe some [1226] like reasonably high flat base I don't [1227] know a lot of closers these days are [1229] just commission only CU they're that [1230] confident in their ability to close um [1232] but you know make Staffing really easy [1234] you don't really need to build any sales [1235] resources aside from what the closer has [1237] and uh yeah just sort of just sort of a [1239] one call close the whole idea is if you [1241] don't get a yes in the one call then you [1243] just don't really need to worry about [1244] them obviously in this case is not a fit [1246] right now but there are also tons of [1247] businesses that just do this you know [1250] it's either signed and paid or it's not [1251] a fit ever um and that's an even simpler [1253] system that's only five steps but any [1256] that's the patented one call close [1257] system that I totally just came up with [1259] completely on my own um the other step [1262] and this might be better for people that [1263] have a little less experience with [1265] scoping and automation projects in [1266] general and this is the system I was [1268] referring to at the beginning when I [1269] said this might be like an automation [1270] specific one um is the two call close [1272] system where there's an initial [1273] Discovery call it's called where you're [1275] feeling the the prospect out trying to [1276] figure out whether or not their right [1277] fit and then getting all the information [1279] you need to scope the project and then [1280] you actually scope because sometimes [1282] these automation projects be quite [1284] complex as you as you know and then [1286] after the scoping step you will have [1287] another follow-up call the prospect [1289] where you will then actually try and [1290] sell them or close them so if we wanted [1292] to convert this into a two call close [1294] system we would have to do a couple of [1295] steps here if you think about it first [1297] and foremost we're going to have to [1298] scope the project and that's really what [1299] happens after the discovery meeting so [1301] if we do a discovery meeting and then we [1303] say we want to move this forward then [1305] what we do is we would scope the project [1307] and maybe you're sending that to a team [1308] that does the scoping or maybe you're [1309] just doing it [1311] yourself after you've scoped the project [1313] you need to make sure that this is [1315] something we can do I'm just going to [1317] say we can do this [1319] then we have [1320] to um do a closing call so we have to [1323] say closing call [1325] booked and then after the closing [1329] call we [1331] also have to ensure that they show up so [1336] now you know the Clos and call has to [1337] occur I'm sure you could see right off [1339] the top of your head but there's so many [1340] more steps in a two call close [1344] system that said you know a lot of the [1346] time when you're working with bigger [1347] businesses that want much more more [1348] complex projects and that sort of thing [1349] you sort of have to do the two call [1350] close so depends on the size of your [1352] audience and that sort of deal um I [1354] don't actually like this um thing that's [1357] wrapping around here it's kind of [1359] messing with me so I'll just add that in [1360] later uh and then just like we had [1362] before a bunch of outcomes where you [1364] know you do your sales meeting there are [1365] three outcomes you can either move [1366] forward you can either wait or whatnot [1368] we we have the same thing over [1370] here so the Clos and call occurs you can [1374] either let me just delete this and then [1376] drag and drop this puppy in [1382] so if they [1384] show the closing call can [1390] occur and then uh the closing call might [1392] be where you present the contract or [1394] whatnot if it's not a fit right now then [1397] you add them back to some follow-up [1398] cycle and then this time instead of um [1400] booking that initial meeting you can [1402] just do the scoping uh project instead [1404] and so you can go directly from the [1406] closing call not being a fit right now [1408] to waiting let's say a certain amount of [1413] time and then instead of you having to [1415] book that initial Discovery call again [1417] you could just um res basically offer to [1420] recope the project which is a lot more [1422] straightforward than having to like you [1424] know actually jump back on a call so it [1426] looks something like [1427] this and then if it's a [1430] noow um then we opt out just like we did [1433] before if we want to move forward as I [1435] mentioned before there are a couple [1436] different options that you could do here [1437] after your closing call you could do a [1440] um detailed proposal in scope of work [1442] and this is what I would recommend if [1443] you're doing like a two-step system [1445] because odds are they clent the prospect [1447] has already weighted a fair amount like [1449] you know you trying to hard sell them [1450] now on the second call probably not the [1452] smartest move you know if you're attit [1454] to call close system the Project's [1455] probably pretty complex you're probably [1456] not it's not feasible to like get them [1458] to sign a deal right then and there they [1459] probably have multiple steps of approval [1461] um so you know you'll probably send a [1463] detailed proposal in scope of work with [1464] all stakeholders involved this is like a [1465] $50,000 project or something you then [1468] you'll do follow-ups if they haven't [1469] signed it and then at the end you'll [1470] finally start the project and so this is [1472] what I'd consider a you know um pretty [1475] realistic look at a two call close [1481] system but notice how many more modules [1483] are involved this system over here on [1485] the left has 1 2 3 four five so there [1488] are five steps in total five [1490] opportunities for things to go wrong [1492] this traditional agency Sal system in [1494] the middle is a little bit more complex [1495] but obviously it's like the safe Choice [1497] it's 1 2 3 4 4 5 6 7 8 but if you look [1500] at this two call close system you know [1502] Enterprise larger projects or just [1505] people that are a little bit less [1506] confident of their ability to close [1508] there are one [1509] two I have to do this just [1512] realized not a fit right now uh 1 2 3 4 [1517] 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Steps and [1522] the reason why it makes sense to [1523] minimize steps is because every time you [1525] have a step there's the opportunity for [1528] a lead to disappear at that step right [1530] so the fewer steps the fewer [1531] opportunities for leads to disappear the [1533] more steps the leakier your sales system [1535] is and um you know the more effort and [1537] time and energy you have to spend in [1539] basically just constantly upkeeping [1541] leads and making sure that you know they [1542] don't really fall through those cracks [1544] now the really cool part about running [1545] an automation agency is obviously if you [1547] run an automation agency you probably [1549] have the skills available to automate a [1550] large portion of this process so what [1552] I'm going to do now is I'm just going to [1553] run through the traditional agency sales [1554] system from top to bottom and just show [1556] you the things that you could automate [1558] first first and foremost um all [1559] marketing you can completely automate so [1562] you could completely automate cold email [1563] completely automate PPC ads completely [1565] automate SEO completely automate social [1567] media completely automate referrals and [1570] maybe maybe communities is the one thing [1572] that you can't automate because that [1573] depends on your personal reputation so [1575] maybe maybe I'll take that out but uh [1577] the point that I'm making is you can [1578] automate all of the the the booking that [1581] occurs as a result of efforts in each of [1583] these so you know in cold email you [1585] would just attach a meeting link PPC ads [1586] it would just be a one click to a [1587] website page with a meeting link SEO [1590] same deal social media might be a [1591] YouTube video with in the description [1593] there's like a meeting link referrals um [1595] you might have like an auto draft [1596] template that you use to copy and paste [1598] every time you get a referral it just [1599] swaps out their name and communities [1601] maybe even have like a spe a specific [1602] sequence that you guide people through [1604] although I find this is usually a lot [1605] less standard so you can automate all of [1608] that how about the sales cycle you can [1611] automate the follow-ups completely so uh [1614] what I've done before is in my CRM of [1616] choice which I was using clickup you can [1617] use whatever ever serum you want I had a [1619] bunch of uh triggers that would occur [1622] after a certain number of days where the [1624] prospect hasn't had any action or [1625] response you can hook up an email [1628] Watcher to a clickup um setup and you [1631] can do this in most crms where when you [1633] send an email to the prospect it'll be [1634] logged in clickup when they re when you [1635] receive an email from the prospect it'll [1637] be logged in clickup and essentially if [1639] the meeting occurred but then I Mark the [1641] meeting as a no-show then after three [1643] day or immediately after I marked as a [1645] noow they would receive a quick email [1646] being like hey how's it going I noticed [1647] that you didn't show the call I'd love [1648] to you know touch base with you and [1650] maybe book another meeting could use [1651] this link if after 3 days they still [1653] hadn't responded then I'd send them [1654] another followup after 7 days they still [1656] un respond I'd send another follow-up in [1657] this way this follow-up cycle was [1659] completely automated and I didn't [1660] actually require any like human effort [1662] here which is quite [1663] nice um the sales meeting occurs you [1666] can't really automate the sales meeting [1667] at least not yet until we have like [1668] super crazy killer Terminator style [1670] robots um so you can't really automate [1672] that but you can automate this part [1675] right so you could do the um the wait 30 [1676] days if you have a form or something [1678] after you fill out every uh after you do [1680] every sales call and you mark this one [1682] is not a fit right now well that's a [1683] simple automation you simply add [1685] somebody to a table and then every day [1686] just check if 30 days has passed and [1688] then on the 30th day when 30 days has [1690] passed add them back to that followup [1691] cycle that I mentioned earlier and now [1692] this whole thing's automatic if it's not [1695] a fit ever you know just set up a an [1697] automation where maybe you fill it a [1698] formance says this meeting sucked this [1699] is not a fit and it just deletes them [1701] from your [1702] database do you tell proposal in scope [1704] of work you can automate this for sure [1706] same sort of deal you might have a form [1708] that when you mark it as you know this [1709] is great they want to move forward they [1710] want a proposal it just automatically [1712] generates the proposal for you and sends [1714] it I've recorded a pretty good video on [1715] this that I think a lot of people have [1716] found valuable you don't have to [1717] automate it to that degree you can [1718] automate it like 90% of the way there [1720] draft up your scope of work with [1721] templated bits and that sort of thing [1723] and then you know add a couple of lines [1724] for customization but you can template [1726] the vast majority of that and then this [1728] system right over here with the [1729] follow-ups you can also completely [1730] automate that signatures and payments [1732] you can automate that right you can have [1734] um an automatic Link in the pandadoc [1736] that you send over or whatever proposal [1738] or scope of work software that you have [1740] that you know prompts them to pay if [1742] they don't pay by a certain amount of [1743] time you can do automatic follow-ups and [1745] reminders and that sort of deal uh and [1746] then you know the project starts so the [1748] good news is like if I were to talk or [1750] or show you guys the the points that [1752] actually require human intervention or [1754] like a human in a fully automated system [1756] um it's this right here so you need to [1758] hire for [1760] this and [1762] then yeah that's about it you just start [1764] the project down here um so you know [1766] only two steps where you actually [1767] require Humanity humans uh and then the [1770] other what's that like six steps that [1772] are um completely robotic process [1774] automated same thing here uh I'm not [1776] going to beat a dead horse because I [1777] think at this point it's pretty clear [1778] what you can automate but yeah you can [1780] automate basically everything um except [1782] for the actual calls themselves which is [1783] quite nice and this is you know an edge [1785] that an automation agency will have over [1787] most other agencies because most other [1788] agencies require humans to do all of [1790] this most other agencies biggest [1791] problems are their follow-ups they don't [1792] do anywhere near as many follow-ups as [1794] they should be and so if anybody doesn't [1795] show okay like 40% of all calls that [1798] ever happen um their their sales system [1800] is just instantly only 60% as effective [1801] as it'll ever be so that's 60% starting [1804] from here and then down over here you [1806] know maybe like another 50% fall off so [1808] they're actually only like running at [1810] 30% capacity right you as an automation [1813] or an automator or an integrator [1814] watching this video you could probably [1816] bump that up to like 70 80% uh [1818] essentially you could duplicate or [1819] double the value of a sales system uh [1821] versus a traditional agency that doesn't [1823] understand the value or the ability to [1824] automate stuff so that's pretty cool um [1827] yeah that's more or less at I would just [1829] make sure that whatever you do you have [1831] a system you don't need the system at [1833] the beginning but you do need a system [1835] and you need to make sure that at every [1836] Point clients just go through your [1839] system you're not going through theirs [1840] you know like when you're starting out [1842] and you're pretty small a lot of the [1844] time the inclination is the client will [1846] set the agenda you'll jump on the call [1848] the client will tell you what you're [1849] talking about you'll send them an email [1850] the client will tell you when you're [1851] chatting and who you're chatting with [1853] and I understand that it can be pretty [1854] intimidating when you're working with [1856] like a bigger company or a bigger um [1858] you're trying to offer a bigger service [1859] and maybe you don't have any experience [1860] under your belt but just no matter what [1862] you do make sure that you are guiding [1864] them through the process because the [1866] second that you standardize it and you [1868] make sure that every client that you [1869] have or every prospect that you have [1870] goes through the same flow um you start [1872] being able to point out the areas that [1874] are weak in your sales process and then [1875] every prospect that you have makes you [1877] 1% better and by the end of the month [1879] year or decade or whatnot uh you will [1881] have like a very bulletproof iron and [1883] extremely profitable sales system all [1886] right thanks so much for watching this [1887] video guys I know this is is a departure [1888] for my usual mic.com stuff if you guys [1890] want more videos on this sort of agency [1892] uh you know sphere of of knowledge or [1894] whatnot just drop a comment down below [1896] ask me what you'd specifically like to [1897] see more than happy to record a vid on [1899] it otherwise please like subscribe do [1900] all that fun YouTube stuff I'll catch [1902] you in the next video bye-bye

Title: How I Scrape Everything with Apify & Make.com
[0] hey everyone Nick here and in this video [1] I'm going to be covering Advanced web [2] scraping now I've had dozens of people [5] over the course of the last few weeks [6] ask me Nick how do I scrape this [8] resource or how do I scrape LinkedIn or [10] what do I do if I need Instagram posts [13] and in this video I'm going to show you [14] how to scrape the previously UNS [16] scrapable using a very simple thirdparty [18] tool called apify I'm not sponsored by [20] apify at all but I really love their [22] tool and I found myself using it on [24] basically any type of web web scraping [26] project nowadays so uh I'm going to run [28] you through it from top to bottom and [29] then going to go and use apify along [31] with make.com to build out a very simple [33] parasite SEO or parasite social media [36] Tool uh in about 5 minutes so if that [38] sounds like something you guys want to [40] learn more about if you guys have always [41] wondered what sort of rests in the [43] highest echelons of advanced web [44] scraping then this is the video for you [46] let's get into [50] it okay so first things first what is [52] apify apify is essentially just like a a [55] big Library which is now turned into a [57] store of scrapers that other people have [59] built with interface that lets you just [61] plug that scraper in to whatever flow [63] you want in seconds it's probably one of [65] the most cost-effective scraping [67] platforms out there and it's really [68] evolved into uh like an ecosystem just [71] for web scraping in general where you [73] can like create your own scraper and [74] then you can actually put it up online [76] and sell it or sell access to it I [78] should say for a certain type of [79] recurring monthly Revenue I've [81] considered building my own web scrapers [82] here I know a few people that have done [84] so quite successfully made a fair amount [85] of money and uh what I find so [88] surprising is this that there's so many [89] people that don't really know about this [92] um and you know if you don't know about [93] it then so much of of the web is [95] unfortunately inacessible to you so over [97] the course of next couple minutes I'm [98] just going to go through apify from top [99] to bottom I'm not going to like this [101] video is in a programming video I'm not [103] going to be running you through any [104] programming principles or programming [105] fundamentals obviously if you want to [106] build a reliable web scraper fast you [108] are probably going to need some [110] programming skills but uh in this video [112] I'm just going to be using pre-created [114] scrapers and there are a ton of them by [116] the way it's not limiting whatsoever to [117] use pre-created scrapers cuz there's [119] like 10,000 of them or whatever to [121] scrape data sources and I'll just show [123] you some examples of how you can use it [124] in your flow I'll show you how to [125] connect to make.com for the aspiring [127] automation Engineers out there uh and [129] then at the end I'm going to take one of [130] these scrapers and then use it to build [132] out like a Twitter parasite social media [134] campaign okay let's dive right into it [138] first and foremost the way that apfi [139] works is uh you know if I click sign up [141] for free and I go through that whole [142] rigma roll I'm going to be taken to a [144] page that looks something like this this [146] is the back end of API and there are a [148] couple things to keep in mind number [149] number one the way that you are build on [152] apify is uh through usage they offer $5 [156] of free usage per month to any user that [158] signs up in their free plan I also think [160] that they have like some pretty generous [162] trial although I might be mistaken there [164] um but the $5 of free usage is more than [166] enough for you one to probably like use [169] a lot of the scrapers that you'd want to [170] use to get all the data that you'd want [171] to get uh but two to like test [173] everything out um you know before you [175] actually go ahead and make a purchase of [176] some kind you're given a certain amount [178] of memory and all this really means is [180] that you know in order for the web [181] scraper to work it's essentially a [183] server somewhere hosted on the cloud um [186] and you have a certain allocation of how [188] much memory of that server cloud that [190] you can use at any given one point in [192] time on the free plan it's 8 gigabytes [194] uh you can upgrade your plan if you [196] would like and go substantially higher [198] if I go to pricing here you'll see that [201] you're given like a certain number of [202] monthly compute units you're given a [204] certain number of like data set reads or [207] data set wrs right this stuff is a [209] little bit more advance so if I just go [210] to the pricing page [213] here then essentially you'll see that um [217] yeah you know if you got on the $49 [219] month plan for instance then you would [220] get 32 GB of RAM for your actors which [223] are their terms for servers you'd be [225] able to run 32 things concurrently uh [227] you'd have access to you know proxies [229] and and all that fun stuff and um you [231] know I've like I personally subscribe to [232] the starter plan and it's more than [234] enough for literally all of my projects [235] and I probably have like over 10 [236] projects running constantly um on apify [239] so [240] it's like $5 a project consider the [242] average client for automation anyway [244] might be paying you know $500,000 $2,000 [247] a month for maintenance or some type of [248] retainer you could see why you know [250] mathematically apfi works out as a [251] solution here but anyway that's just the [254] logistics in terms of how to actually go [255] ahead and use apfi if you don't have any [257] programming experience the simplest and [258] most straightforward way is to head over [260] to this store so give that a click and [262] you'll be confronted with a page it [263] looks like this essentially what the [265] store is is it's just an ecosystem of [268] other scrapers that developers have [270] created to do things that most people [272] want to do and so if I go to All actors [275] and then I click view [276] all like let's just take a look at some [278] of the I guess some of the potential [280] here of what you can do there's like a [281] Google map scraper over here Google [283] search results scraper Instagram hashtag [286] scraper website content crawler Facebook [288] post scraper Twitter scraper Tik Tok [290] data extractor contact detail scraper [291] GPT scraper Amazon product scraper AI [294] product matcher Airbnb scraper YouTube [296] scraper Cheerio scraper Zillow search [297] scraper Trip Advisor scraper obviously [300] the options are virtually unlimited here [302] and that's why I mentioned earlier that [304] like you don't actually need to have [304] programming experience to use apify and [306] make a ton of money uh when you [308] integrate it with make.com because most [310] of the hard lifting uh heavy lifting has [311] actually already been done for you by [312] these developers like uh like quacker [315] for instance but uh okay I don't just [318] want to show you this I actually want to [319] dive in and and you know illustrate how [321] simple it is to use so what I'm going to [323] do is I'm going to go over to Twitter [324] scraper over here and I got one of my [326] buddies uh Twitter pages over here this [329] guy's named Matt Larson very intelligent [331] fellow um a lot of my followers I think [333] have heard of him he's in the agency [335] space feel free to give him a follow if [337] you'd like but essentially what I'm [338] going to do is I'm going to plug his [339] profile into this Twitter scraper and [341] then we're just going to get a bunch of [342] search results from it so I'm going to [344] click Start and let's see what [346] happens as you'll see this is just so [349] incredibly easy the fields a lot of the [351] time are literally just hey put in a [354] Twitter URL and you can imagine how you [356] know using make.com maybe you can [358] consult like a Google she sheet with a [360] list of Twitter URLs take every one of [361] those Twitter URLs and then just pump [362] this into the actor um what API is doing [365] right now behind the scenes is actually [367] going out setting up a cloud server with [369] a script and that script is basically [371] meant to go onto Twitter extract posts [374] um headings extract post data like date [377] time copy all that stuff uh and then [380] what it's doing is it's actually just [381] making that publicly available to us [383] here now I set my scraper at 100 tweets [386] but if we yeah so it looks like it it [388] all you know it just scrap the hell out [390] of it if we look at it now we'll see [391] that there are literally 100 tweets 50 [394] per page and there are two pages um [396] including like the full text including [398] the number of replies including the [399] retweets the favorites the views even [401] the URL which is uh which is fantastic [404] so there's just so much that we could do [405] with this you know I mentioned how later [407] on what I'm going to do is I'm going to [408] create a little repurposing or parasite [411] social media tool that basically takes [412] every one of these tweets and then just [413] rewrites them using AI maybe adds them [416] to like a Content calendar or something [418] but these sorts of flows are so so [419] incredibly easy to use with apify um all [422] you need to do is just hook it up to [423] make.com with like a one-click module [425] which I'll show you in a moment so [428] pretty neat huh you even get the images [429] as well not that you know I think that [431] it's super relevant but yeah you get a [432] lot so that's just the Twitter scraper [434] if we go back to the store here there [436] are way more like there's an Instagram [438] hashtag scraper for instance I received [441] um probably three questions the last [443] couple weeks about scraping Instagram so [446] uh you know all you need to do in order [447] for this to work is obviously just pump [448] in a hashtag uh the default here is web [451] scraping you know you can scrape a [453] certain number of posts per hashtag [454] let's just say I want to scrape 10 just [456] to make this a little bit faster you [458] have some run options and all that stuff [459] but generally speaking I don't really [460] ever use any of the advanced ones [462] usually there's an actor that does [464] exactly what I want which is so simple [466] uh and so I don't really have to muck [467] around on the back end or the code or [469] anything and then yeah you know this is [471] now again spinning up a server um the [473] server has a script and that script is [475] like log into well maybe not log into [477] Instagram but scrape Instagram for post [479] that include this hashtag it's going to [481] get like the post URL it's going to get [483] like the number of comments it's going [484] to get the first comment it's just going [486] to get a bunch of data for us which is [487] pretty interesting and uh you know you [490] can even get like the author and if you [492] guys are super um you know if you guys [495] pay close attention to a lot of the [496] other stuff I talking about videos [497] you'll see that there are tons of other [499] tools out there that allow you to get [500] let's say like an Instagram author and [502] then use it to scrape their posts so [504] what we can do is we can weave in three [505] or four of these like prebuild scrapers [507] together super easily Maybe apify in the [510] front end which scrapes hashtags and [512] then compiles a list of users and then [514] Phantom Buster takes in a list of users [516] and then gets their posts and then you [517] feed in those post images to AI to tell [519] you something about it and then what [521] your next step is is I don't know you [522] pre-drafted DM or something like that [523] and send it directly to the person the [525] options here are virtually unlimited uh [528] but you know this is just a quick [529] example of the Instagram scraper let's [531] check out another one one that I find [532] myself using quite often I used this [535] YouTube One in a previous video which [537] was uh super useful um I have a lot of [540] people asking me for um job uh post [542] scrapers and so one thing I'm going to [544] do sometime over the course of the next [545] couple weeks is I'm going to show you [547] how to basically apply to jobs [548] automatically or if not apply to jobs [550] automatically then like template out [552] your job post and CVN cover letter so [553] it's 99% of the way there but let's say [556] you know I want to scrape a job listing [557] website indeed the largest job scraping [559] website in the world and maybe I'm like [560] looking for jobs maybe I'm looking for [562] web developer web scraper jobs this is a [565] very quick and easy way to do so all you [566] need to do is you know put the location [569] down so maybe I'm in Seattle you know [571] I'm searching in the United States I [573] only want uh 20 jobs for for right now [577] and then I just click save and start you [579] know again within probably 30 seconds to [582] a minute this is going to go out there [583] onto indeed and then scrape the data and [586] then put it and transform it into Json [589] essentially like a completely platform [592] agnostic format that we can like plug [594] into make we can plug into like any [596] other Scraper on the planet uh and in [598] this way we can make like very complex [600] chains of scraping that enable us to do [602] super cool things so I love apify to [604] death um I've showed it to tons of other [606] people in the make.com zap you're an [607] automation space and one thing that they [609] always say to me is like oh man like I [611] wish I could use this but I don't know [612] how to program I feel like there's just [614] a I don't know if it's a like a [617] connotation or some type of like [618] cultural meme where people uh that try [621] and use apify are maybe put off by the [623] way that it's sort of pitched to [624] developers but you really don't need to [626] be a developer to use it as you see I [628] just got a bunch of um Indeed job posts [631] with job titles and you know a bunch of [633] information basically from these [634] companies um and I I didn't have to [636] really do anything right all I did was I [638] plugged in like three parameters the [640] place that I want to search in the job [641] post that I want to search in the city [643] and then it just pulled me up a bunch of [644] data that I could use obviously to do [646] some pretty cool stuff with so pretty [648] exciting for sure you know I can imagine [650] uh some some very interesting flows here [652] where I scrape a list of job URLs and [654] then maybe there's let's check and see [656] if there's another scraper that enables [657] me to get more information about every [658] job [660] just going to type [661] indeed so you see there's actually [663] multiple scrapers usually for um every [666] individual platform you know because [667] this is a store and there are developers [669] that are competing to try and come up [670] with the best product or the best [672] scraper essentially that allows you to [673] do that stuff so yeah uh pretty cool [675] looks like this one allows you to [677] extract detailed job listings directly [679] from indeed which is pretty exciting um [681] this one has a few additional parameters [682] I think which is pretty neat um you know [684] you can can plug that puppy in while [686] that's running I'm going to head over to [688] the store and maybe look for some other [689] scraper just while I'm here and I can [691] show you you know you can scrape like [693] booking.com stuff Google Trend stuff [696] Facebook ads which is pretty cool you [698] can even and this is something that um [700] somebody requested a couple of days ago [702] you can even monitor a website for [704] Content changes by screenshotting it and [707] so what you could do is let's say you [708] have like three or four competitors in [710] your Niche you can track a website every [713] single day and anytime that there's a [715] change to that website let's say there's [717] a new blog post add it or something the [719] screenshot will be different and you can [721] receive a quick little email or you can [723] use this in a flow that every time the [725] website gets updated you could have a [727] web scraper run which goes to the [729] website maybe scrapes the new blog post [731] or something and then rewrites it and [733] then posts it on your website like the [735] opportunities here are quite frankly [737] ridiculous and uh that's why you know [740] I'm convinced that that these sorts of [742] tools are just real superpowers they're [744] kind of [745] insane you know if you're into coding [747] and stuff you can kind of look on the [748] back end here you'll see that you know [750] there's a bunch of um comments that are [751] being left by the the scraper and and [753] that sort of thing um obviously I I [755] don't want to dive too deep into the [756] code or whatnot so I'm just looking at [758] the tabular data that's um that's sort [760] of output after every actor run but yeah [763] you have a real wealth of um I guess [765] potential here with apify so I would [768] highly encourage you guys to to jump on [769] and and give it a go I don't really use [771] anything except for the store and then [773] the actors unless I'm creating my own [775] flow um I have created a bunch of my own [776] flows basically in order to do so you [778] have to click velop new in the top right [780] hand corner and then you know for the [782] people that have more maybe programming [783] skills or are more like code inclined [786] than the rest of us um I usually use [787] Crawley Puppeteer and chrome and then I [790] actually need to go and then you know [791] use a template I always start with a [792] template and then I actually go and like [793] write my scraper when you write your [795] scraper you can actually Define like [796] what elements in the page you want to be [798] extracting where you want to be sending [799] the data to I've built a number of [802] really interesting ones where you know [803] I'll scrape some job listing data source [805] usually um and then with the do job [807] scripting data source I will like look [809] for the company name somewhere on the [811] page I'll use that company name to fire [813] another scraper which maybe looks on [814] indeed or looks on LinkedIn and then [816] I'll use that in order to like enrich a [818] bunch of emails related to that business [820] to like send cool emails to tons of [822] flows that you can build out if you know [823] you know a little bit of code as well [824] but yeah as I mentioned there's just [826] there's more than enough actors for for [827] most people aside from the store and [830] aside from the actor's page um some [832] other sections that may be of interest [834] to you I don't really know are schedules [836] so if you have an actor you can schedule [838] them automatically here I personally [840] don't use this because I usually just [841] schedule them in make.com which I'll [842] show you how to do in a second um there [844] is like a storage sort of database thing [847] here which allows you to keep track of [849] all of the outputs from your actors over [851] time and then there's a proxy over here [853] um I was receiving a couple of questions [855] from people about whether or not you [856] know we could scrape with proxies and [858] make.com I found a couple of ways to use [860] proxies and make they're very difficult [861] so what I usually do is I will just run [863] my scraping requests where I need a [865] proxy through apify I'll still trigger [867] it and make but I'll do it in apify and [869] then I'll use their billing uh in order [871] to you know use a data center [872] residential proxy for my scraping uh and [875] this enables me to you know scrape [876] essentially undetected and then to [878] revolve the location that I'm scraping [880] from a lot of the time so I never really [881] get pigeon hold or blocked or anything [883] like that but okay I think that's enough [886] of just talking about apify let me show [888] you how to implement it and use it in [890] make.com because I think that's uh just [892] as if not more [895] important first I'm just going to call [897] this like apify test bed and then what [901] you need to do is in your new scenario [903] um all you need to do is just write [904] apify and to see there are actually a [906] bunch of built-ins here um you know you [908] can also use API via like an API but [910] usually the built-in ones are more than [912] enough the two most important triggers [914] are watch actor runs and then watch task [917] runs I believe a task is like a specific [919] instantiation of an actor and then an [921] actor is just like more more generally [923] so I only ever use watch actor runs so [925] what you can do is you could set the [927] schedule in apify if you wanted to to [928] run every day then every day that the [930] run is done and it has a bunch of data [932] then you can just watch that actor run [933] and then get an event and then now you [935] know because you're running it outside [937] outside of make.com you still end up [939] with all the data and then you can use [940] it to like move the next part of your [942] flow forward alternatively what you can [944] do is you can run an actor using [946] make.com and so that's what I'm going to [948] do here once you open it you need to [949] make a connection in order to make a [950] connection all you have to do is just go [951] to this link right over here console. [953] ai.com account Integrations there'll be [956] an API key over here that you can just [957] copy and then paste so I just did that [959] offc screen because you know I don't [960] want to show anybody my API key for this [962] and once you're done with that all you [963] need to do is just click on this little [964] drop down then you now have access to [966] all of the actors that you just [968] connected to from the store so I could [970] scrape indeed over here I could scrape [972] Twitter over here which I'll do in a [974] second web scraper website content [975] crawler YouTube comment scraper YouTube [977] scraper um we're going to use indeed [978] scraper here which is quite exciting and [980] then there are a couple of additional [981] options there's input Json build timeout [984] memory um what I what I'll do is in [987] order to use use this with make.com you [990] have to find the specific actor so uh in [993] my case I want the Twitter scraper and [996] then you see how there's a regular [997] button here and then there's a Jason [998] button so basically these instructions [1000] that we're providing down here um this [1002] is just a user interface that apify is [1004] whipped up for us but if you look at the [1006] actual like code input that's provided [1008] to it um it's just a bunch of Json which [1010] looks like this so all we need to do in [1012] order to make this work is we go over to [1014] Jason [1015] here and then we just paste it in and [1019] you know if you wanted to pull this data [1020] from an external data source for [1021] instance that'd be pretty easy right all [1023] you do is you would like add I don't [1025] know a Google Sheets [1027] module maybe you search rows once a day [1029] or something like that you make this the [1032] input and then over here where we're [1034] feeding in the Twitter bio the people [1035] that we want to scrape uh you would just [1037] grab it from the Google sheet module [1039] back here so pretty simple pretty [1041] straightforward stuff um but you know [1043] there are a couple of a couple of things [1045] that may trip you up if you're [1046] unfamiliar with how that works now I [1048] want my stuff to look pretty so I'm just [1050] going to format this in Json for.org and [1053] go back here get a nice list of handles [1055] over here and for the purposes of this [1057] I'm just going to scrape my own PR [1059] Twitter profile which I believe is just [1060] NRA yes it is oops let's just do [1065] that now we can specify the build down [1067] here but if you look at this little um [1069] uh idea like light bulb icon it says by [1071] default the Run uses the build specified [1073] in the default run configuration for the [1074] actor which is typically latest so if [1076] you don't include anything it'll just [1077] always use the latest build this is more [1079] of a programming um concept than [1081] anything else and you don't really need [1082] to worry about it just know that I [1083] always leave the build blank I'll also [1085] always leave the timeout blank and then [1087] the memory I'll always leave blank [1088] basically if you leave it blank it's [1090] just going to use the default run [1091] config okay so what you'll do is when [1094] you click run once the actor um it's not [1097] like it's running live and just waiting [1099] for you basically what's happening is [1101] when you click run once it just sends a [1103] signal over to apify and then tells it [1105] to run so in make you're just going to [1107] receive a thumbs up up basically saying [1109] hey this is now running but that isn't [1112] actually super useful to us if you think [1113] about it because we can't actually do [1115] anything with that now what I'd [1117] recommend you do is if you're scheduling [1119] it like this you know schedule it using [1121] makes um whatever interval you want [1123] maybe you run it every day and you run [1125] it at like uh you know 12:00 [1127] p.m. I think I have to like hard code in [1130] here yeah and then what I do is I'd have [1133] a separate scenario and the way that [1135] this scenario would [1136] work is if I make an example build [1140] here we'll [1143] say watch actor runs and then get [1147] data so let's do trigger apify run over [1151] here for our first scenario this is just [1153] going to trigger apify to run once a day [1155] uh for the specific scraper that we want [1157] and then all we do with the other module [1158] is we go to apify and then we go watch [1160] actor [1161] runs we're going to create a web hook [1164] here using the connection that we just [1166] set up earlier which uh in my case was [1168] my AP by connection the actor that we [1170] want is that Twitter one then we'll say [1173] finish Twitter scraper as the web hook [1176] name going to save [1179] that and now what'll happen is basically [1181] if I run this anytime that my actor is [1184] done running I will receive a [1186] notification in that other window so [1188] this first scenario now I just triggered [1190] the apify run so it's now running in the [1191] back end and what this other um scenario [1195] is doing is just waiting so if I [1196] actually go back to apify I can see this [1199] run as it's happening [1201] live and so I triggered it in make and [1203] now it's actually happening in apify and [1205] we have access to the user interface [1207] here now I know that it's going to [1209] scrape this probably in the next 10 [1211] seconds or so and I just want to show [1212] you guys what it looks like on apify end [1214] so I'm just going to go back to watch [1216] actor runs there's one additional step [1218] that we need to do in order to make this [1219] work um watching actor runs isn't [1222] actually enough to get the data and pull [1223] it into make we need to add a second [1225] module called get actor data or get data [1228] set from actor something like that um [1231] and that's uh basically like when we get [1233] the ID of the actor all we do is we ping [1236] the actor again um with the get and then [1238] we have access to the whole database [1240] this is just a quirk of api's API you [1242] know every API is a little bit different [1244] with how they work in that sort of deal [1245] so this is just the way that API Works [1247] they sort of have like a two-step the [1248] first thing that happens is when the [1249] actor is done you receive a notification [1251] like this it says succeeded but you'll [1252] see there's actually no data here it [1254] just says you know we've did two [1255] requests two succeeded zero failed um we [1257] can't actually access the you know the [1259] memory and that sort of stuff but if you [1261] go back down to apify you can say get [1263] data set items you can just connect that [1265] to the flow and then if you click on it [1267] you'll see that really the field that [1268] matters here is data set ID and we can [1270] actually for the purpose of this I'm [1271] just going to hard code it there's um [1273] there's a data set ID over here and I [1276] don't actually remember if this data set [1278] ID is in the [1280] meta options or if we just use this okay [1284] I think we just use [1286] this I'm going to give this thing a [1288] click [1291] oh sorry there's default data set ID my [1293] bad that's the one that you use so just [1295] use this default data set ID now I just [1297] want to hard code this I don't actually [1298] have to want to wait for the actor to [1299] run again so I'm just going to look for [1300] default data set ID down here going to [1303] copy and paste that in for now um You [1305] can set you know your own um parameters [1308] here maybe you only want Json maybe you [1310] want it to be CSV maybe you're [1311] outputting in HTML for whatever reason [1313] what I'm going to do now is I'm just [1314] going to run this and you'll see that [1316] we've now received um basically a list [1319] of all of those posts and the get a data [1321] set module has a built-in iterator and [1323] so the outputs are in uh in bundle form [1326] so there's like one bundle per per post [1329] essentially at least for the Twitter one [1331] so it's pretty exciting uh because now [1332] we have all this data in make.com and if [1334] you think about it what we can do now is [1336] let's say I want to like create that [1338] parasite campaign I can go to open [1340] AI have a little completion endpoint [1343] here plug that puppy [1345] in and then I can go to model I'll do [1347] gbt14 turbo I'll do a system prompt [1350] first I'll say you're a [1352] helpful intelligent writing [1355] assistant then I'll say you know this is [1357] sort of cheeky this is like a parasite [1359] campaign um so you know morally speaking [1361] ethically speaking do with this what you [1363] will I'm not doing this because I want [1364] everybody to run parasite campaigns [1366] because I think they're amazing or [1367] anything I'm just showing you guys how [1368] to do it because this is a very common [1369] request that people are either willing [1370] to spend money for or it's just [1372] something that you can use to either [1373] keep an eye on competitors or you know [1376] improve improve your own like business [1377] standing so obviously use this sort of [1379] thing with caution um you know don't go [1380] creating parasites for for literally [1383] everybody uh but what I'll do is um I'm [1385] going to do a system prompt which is [1386] going to Define what the model is how it [1388] self-identifies then I'm going to do a [1390] user prompt where I give it instructions [1391] so I'm going to say hey I want you to do [1393] this and then the next step is just like [1394] a user prompt and then an assistant [1396] prompt and then a user prompt and then [1397] an assistant prompt and these are just [1398] examples of the input and the output [1400] that I want from the model before I [1401] finally um get it to do an output um on [1404] like real live data so what I'm going to [1407] say is you are [1410] a [1411] Content I don't know spinner your job is [1415] to take a post from Twitter and rewrite [1419] it in a way that encapsulates the [1422] original theme in different [1426] words output in [1428] Json now I'm going to give it a bunch of [1431] examples I'll go user then I'll go [1434] assistant then I'll do user and I'm [1437] actually just going to do one that's [1438] that's it um so what I'm going to do is [1440] I'm just going to go on my own Twitter [1442] here let's pop [1445] in let's see some posts that I myself [1447] wrote I think if I go to Highlights it's [1449] probably all stuff that I wrote yeah so [1450] it's just me bragging about my YouTube [1452] that's pretty [1453] funny um this is a good one I made [1455] $210,000 in the last 12 months on upwork [1457] work two to three hours per day spend a [1459] big chunk of the your traveling would [1460] there be interest in a long thread [1461] detailing how I did it awesome so I'm [1462] just going to paste this in as the post [1465] and the example is going to be over the [1467] last 12 months [1469] I made [1472] $210,000 [1474] on let's uh use a different word than [1476] maid because ma is here [1479] um I profited $210,000 on up on upw [1483] workk no that's not really super [1485] accurate made is different than profit [1486] and they have um like a revenue share [1489] generated that sounds kind of tacky okay [1494] whatever let's do with minimal [1498] work and a travel heavy [1502] lifestyle want to learn [1505] how and maybe just want to learn how [1507] that looks good okay great and now I'm [1509] going to um you know I actually don't [1512] even need to Output in Json I can just [1514] grab the text directly as is now I'm [1516] just going to feed in the actual text [1518] from the flow that'll be full text Max [1521] tokens going to be [1523] 496 let's just do that uh and then let's [1526] add a sheets module [1528] so I'm just going to do like content [1530] calendar or maybe I don't know parasite [1533] Twitter [1535] campaign I'm just going to share this [1537] with the account that I know has access [1539] to [1542] this then I'll go back to here and then [1546] I'll add a Google sheet and what I'm [1547] going to do is every time that we [1548] generate a new one we're just going to [1549] add a row to the [1550] sheet simple easy beautiful Cover Girl [1555] uh now we're going to [1558] select the spreadsheet I it's probably [1560] in shared with me now that I think about [1562] it let's [1565] see oh boy that icons taking its sweet [1569] ass time yeah shared with me there you [1575] go okay parasite Twitter campaign and [1577] then what we have to do is feed in the [1579] sheet name which is going to be sheet [1580] one table contains headers oh yeah [1583] I guess we need some headers um let's [1585] just do Post copy this is going to be [1587] the lazy EST um Google Sheets build I've [1590] ever done there you go and then now what [1593] I'm going to do is feed the result [1595] in you know let's [1600] do Source post and then we'll do Post [1603] copy if I go back here I'm going to [1604] refresh this again now I'm going to have [1606] access to Source Post in a then I'll [1609] have post copy in B The Source post is [1611] going to be full text from here post [1615] copy is going to be here so we're going [1617] to be able to see the rephrase [1618] um thing and then we're also going to be [1619] able to see the other let me just make [1621] sure everything else looks good uh full [1624] text there may be some issues here [1626] because some of the comments that are [1628] being scraped on the Twitter are people [1631] that aren't me so it has like an at here [1633] so this is like me responding to [1635] somebody [1637] probably um but that's [1641] okay yeah we could just okay let's do [1643] this just so that we don't actually go [1645] through the process of rewriting posts [1647] that suck if the text contains so I'm [1649] just going to say contains case [1650] insensitive and if it contains an [1655] at so if full text contains an [1658] at then um this is a [1661] reply and then if it's a reply sorry we [1665] want doesn't contain my [1670] bad we'll say not [1672] reply [1674] okay so the logic is going to be as [1677] follows we're going to run the apify [1680] actor over here which I just ran and [1682] then I'm going to run this just so you [1684] know when it finally finishes um [1686] scraping we're going to get the results [1689] but basically when it finishes scraping [1691] we're going to get this module to run I [1693] think there's a very loud motorcycle [1695] outside so hopefully you guys can hear [1696] me all right um then next we're going to [1699] reping apify with the data set ID to [1701] scrape the data once we have the data [1704] it'll be a list of all of the posts [1705] essentially from that person's Twitter [1707] profile that are relevant [1708] we're then going to pass it through a [1709] filter called um not reply this is going [1713] to look for the presence of an at symbol [1714] and that at symbol is just a quick [1716] little hack I'm going to use to filter [1718] out any replies and then after this [1721] we're going to send it over to chat GPT [1723] or gp4 that's going to rewrite the post [1725] for us and then after this we're going [1727] to go into Google Sheets we're going to [1728] add a new row that includes the source [1730] post and then also includes the [1732] Rewritten version so I'll be real I'm [1734] not expecting any Nobel freaking prizes [1736] here but uh yeah I think that there's [1738] probably a fair amount that you can do [1739] with something like this so let me [1741] expand this and let's see what's going [1744] on I'm going to make this a little bit [1746] shorter here because this is happening [1747] pretty fast and then I'm also going to [1748] unbold [1750] this and then because I'm fancy I'm [1752] going to use the inter font um looks [1756] like the [1757] original is kind of it's kind of a [1760] copycat you know I'm using the same [1761] emojis just kind of sucks um let's check [1764] out the second one program is one of [1767] those weird careers that gets EXP [1768] finially easier your first job is [1769] extremely difficult to acquire but every [1770] job after that pays you more for Less [1771] work when you're 10 years in it's [1772] uncommon to juggle it does or more [1774] offers while having a [1775] job this is one's programming was [1777] unusual career when things get [1778] noticeably easier over time Landing the [1779] first job can be tough but subsequent [1780] positions often come a better pay for [1781] better hours been a decade and it's not [1783] rare to handle multiple job offer [1784] simultaneously even while [1787] employed this one's good to be fair [1789] television shows are interesting [1790] primarily because the characters don't [1791] have their lives together honestly TV [1793] shows are captivating largely because [1794] the characters are still figuring out [1795] their lives I think that is a pretty [1797] clear ill illustration that you know [1798] we're basically saying the same thing [1799] we're just doing in different words if I [1802] could go back in time and change the [1804] prompt [1806] here I would I think using the term [1809] spinning is really hurting [1815] us yeah I think that when I say the word [1818] spinner um it like sort of pattern [1820] matches for just changing a couple of [1822] words as opposed to the [1823] meaning rewrite each message in a way [1827] that ENC plates the original theme but [1829] uses different [1831] words and let's [1837] um change this a little [1847] further this required very minimal work [1852] got to do a bunch of fun stuff like [1855] travel enjoy my life Etc [1860] I'm curious as to whether [1862] [Music] [1864] anyone [1867] wants a detailed breakdown of how I did [1870] it let's do that that should be [1873] sufficient you know if we had another [1874] example here it' probably be better but [1876] uh is what it is okay I'm going to run [1879] this here and then I'm actually just [1881] going to go through and then delete [1883] this because I just want to have it [1885] output with better data and then [1887] sometimes s uh in make you have to do [1889] sort of an annoying hack with Google [1890] Sheets where you just have to delete all [1891] of the rows so I just right click the [1893] rows here and then I click delete this [1894] doesn't actually do anything visibly to [1896] change the way that this is laid out [1897] because I'm deleting Row 2 to 16 but [1899] then 17 to you know 32 or whatever is [1902] just bumping down to 2 to 16 um but I [1904] find that you know sometimes there's [1905] like an index stored or maybe it's [1907] cached or something so if I don't do [1908] that sometimes the results will start [1910] populating here and I just rather they [1911] they start populating immediately under [1913] Source post up at the top but uh yeah [1915] you know I just made a quick little [1917] change here to the [1918] because I wasn't very satisfied with the [1920] quality of that prompt I think we needed [1921] to change it a little bit [1923] more um and you know ideally what we [1925] what we'd actually do um is like add [1928] three or four examples as opposed to [1929] just one but I was trying to be a little [1931] cheeky and short on [1935] time so let's see what we got [1942] here yeah so this is a good one [1944] television shows are interesting [1945] primarily blah blah blah honestly TV [1947] shows are captivating mostly because [1948] their characters are a mess it always [1950] seemed weird to me and the majority of [1951] conversations never asked a single [1953] question when I talk to people ask them [1954] tons of [1955] questions yeah so this is a pretty [1958] pretty cut and dry parasite campaign [1962] here I think that there's probably a lot [1963] that he could do to improve this um you [1965] might be able [1966] to take the post copy of the second [1969] thing and feed it back in AI or maybe [1970] you could just like increase the [1971] temperature or add a few more examples [1973] of just how intensely you want to change [1975] the original meaning um but you know I [1977] think it's clear at this point point [1978] that this is the stem that you could use [1979] to build out more or less any flow um of [1981] your own that is uh that is high [1983] performing and we did it all using apify [1985] which is a platform that I think a lot [1986] of people that are watching this video [1987] had no idea existed before you know 20 [1989] or 30 minutes ago so quite exciting what [1992] I'm going to do next is I'm going to [1993] save These Blueprints just so you guys [1994] can use them on your own obviously [1995] you're going to have to hook up your own [1997] apify actors and you know if you're not [1999] doing a Twitter parasite SEO campaign [2001] you're going to have to or parasite [2002] social media campaign you're going to [2003] have to you know change the prompt and [2005] that sort of deal but I think this [2006] probably sufficient enough to at least [2008] get you guys started and the great news [2009] about apify is you can get very far with [2011] just the $5 um monthly budget that is [2015] provided to you along with the default [2017] scrapers you don't really need to know a [2019] ton of programming in order to do this [2021] awesome thanks so much for watching this [2022] video guys had a lot of fun putting it [2023] together if you guys have any requests [2024] for similar videos just drop a comment [2026] down below with what you'd like to see I [2028] Source tons of my videos from just [2030] comments that were left um on you know [2032] Random clips that I recorded two and a [2034] half months ago uh but I'm working my [2035] way down the list now and uh it's really [2037] helping become more consistent and not [2039] have to think too much about what to [2040] post but I can actually just jump in and [2041] then you know create something of value [2043] to you otherwise please like subscribe [2045] do all that fun YouTube stuff I'll catch [2047] you on the next video thanks

Title: Watch Me Build An Order Management System in Slack Using Make.com
[0] what's going on everybody got a quick [1] and easy video for today on slack [3] specifically how to use Slack's [4] interactive block feature to automate [7] the hell out of your messaging platform [9] um this works really well with Discord [10] as well super similar sort of workflow [12] I'm just going to do it in slack because [14] I have a slack workspace setup uh and [16] I've also built this out a number of [17] times for coaching companies and that [18] sort of thing so as always I'm going to [19] build it for you live this is something [21] that you can actually go out and sell to [22] coaching companies or if you run a [24] coaching company or I mean to be frank [26] any type of agency that just deals with [28] leads through slack uh this is something [30] you're going to want to check out if [31] that sounds like something that's [32] interesed to you then stay tuned and [33] let's get into [36] it okay so to be brief essentially what [39] we're going to do is we're going to [40] build out a flow where when a record is [43] changed in a CRM let's say new lead is [46] generated our sales channel is going to [49] receive a message from slack that looks [51] something like this instead of you have [53] a new request it's going to say you have [56] a new [57] lead um we're going to have a a link [60] that basically goes back to the CRM [62] there's going to be some information [63] about the lead maybe I don't know like [65] the question that they submitted on a [66] form or whatever and then you'll have [68] two buttons you'll have like an either [70] an approve button or a deny button if [72] you approve it then the lead is [73] qualified and you know maybe this [75] triggers the next step of some super [77] intense sales flow maybe it sends them a [78] proposal automatically maybe it adds [81] them to you know a queue where salese on [84] your team call them whatever and then if [86] you click deny then it marks it as no [87] fit and the idea here is essentially you [90] can apply the same approach literally [91] anything um there's just some QA step [93] that needs to be passed before you know [96] the next stage in this transformation of [98] the lead you could use this internally [100] if you had like an article company like [102] I do one second copy um maybe when an [104] article is ready from you know your [106] rough draft writer you receive a new [108] slack message in you know like a QA [110] Channel and then you have to approve or [112] deny a request you could use this in [115] like a graphic design company same sort [116] of idea right new piece of creative is [118] created there's senior person that QA [121] I'm just showing you a lead generation [123] example because I always like to align [124] my stuff uh most with Revenue generation [126] because I find that that's usually the [128] most valuable and uh relevant but just [130] keep in mind that you can use this exact [132] same sort of flow that I'm about to show [133] you for literally anything now let's [136] actually dive into how to build [137] something like this so unfortunately [139] slack is notoriously quite difficult [142] with getting an app up and running and [144] that's why I wanted to make this video [145] uh to show you that you know you can [148] spend 5 million hours trying to figure [150] out the various scopes of permissions [151] that you need how to invite things to [152] your Channel all that stuff or you could [154] just watch me do it once and then you [155] could just use that same sort of [157] approach for any app that you make I [159] spent a lot of time just like waiting [160] through pretty deep Waters trying to [162] figure this stuff out um over the course [163] of the last couple years and slack has [165] unfortunately change their API and the [166] way that they work so I've had to [168] relearn it a few more times but uh my [170] way is probably one of the simplest so [171] if you're building out slack automations [173] or Integrations uh and you need like a [175] custom app or whatever then yeah I'll [176] I'll guide you through it here okay so [179] very first thing that I'm going to do is [180] I'm going to use clickup which is [182] essentially like a CRM or project [183] management tool and then I'm just going [184] to use it to represent like a CRM just [186] so that we have some external Source [188] where data is triggered as opposed to [190] just doing everything in slack I want [191] this to be as relevant to you as [192] possible so whether you're using clickup [194] or whether you're using some other CRM [196] um I'm just going to walk through what [197] what this process looks like for us [200] clickup is similar to the vast majority [202] of other Crums and that you can organize [204] Things based off of um stages you know [207] dates I'm like sorting by date created [209] here [210] what I've done is I have my slack CRM [212] set up and then I have a lead that I've [214] added here called Peter ELO who's [216] definitely a real person I created him [219] today the stage that he's at is called [221] intake this is just the default stage [222] when a new lead enters my system right [225] maybe I'm doing a cold email campaign or [226] maybe this is like an SEO funnel or [228] something um there's no due date let me [230] just get rid of that that's irrelevant [232] but I have his email I have his phone [234] and then I'm just going to add a column [235] here and I'm just going to call it like [237] you know form answer and I'm going to [240] pretend that maybe there's like a form [241] box on my website that he had to fill [243] out in order to get added to the system [245] and maybe here all I'm doing is I'm just [247] asking him you know what it is that he [249] wants so I'm looking [252] for an agency to help me with my graphic [257] design needs right and what we're going [259] to do is we're just going to like have [260] that form answer be the thing that we're [262] going to determine whether or not a lead [263] is qualified from so you know this is [265] just some entry in a CRM um what I'm [268] going to do is I'm just going to set [269] this to to to empty for now and then I'm [270] just going to add an automation inside [272] of clickup so that when I add it to [274] intake it um it automatically gets [277] sent to slack first things first is [280] custom field uh let's just say that when [283] this custom field stage changes anything [287] to [288] intake then we're going to fire a web [291] hook then I'm just going to go into make [293] I'll create a new scenario and this is [295] going to be a multiple scenario type [297] flow but I'm just going to create this [299] web hook custom web hook and then I'm [302] going to say new lead uh what am I doing [306] here slack block kit example [310] lead that'll help me hopelessly organize [314] this it's more like it's already [316] hopeless okay so all this is doing is a [318] very simple clickup automation that when [320] the stage changes to intake we're going [322] to fire a web hook and we're going to [323] catch that web hook in make so what I'm [326] going to do here is just before I do [328] this I'm going to make sure this is [329] running so I'm going to click run once [331] this is now on it's waiting and then I'm [333] going change the status to [334] intake and then click UPS automation [337] Center we see that and then they're [338] going to shoot that over [339] here and what I'm going to do is I'm [341] going to use this payload here just to [343] get a bunch more information about this [345] before I create the slack block message [347] um which will look like this and I'm [349] also going to show you guys how to like [350] format the slack block kit and you know [351] do do everything so stay tuned for that [354] uh but essentially we have all the data [355] about Peter here but what I always like [356] to do is I always like to requery the [358] CRM so if this is coming in on Monday [361] for instance you just do the equivalent [362] task in Monday um what I always do is I [364] always just do the get a task uh feature [367] basically every CRM has a flow where you [369] can just feed in the ID of the task that [371] trigger a web hook and then you can just [372] get more data about that so I'm going to [375] go back here and just pretend that I'm [376] doing all this over again I'm going to [378] run this once one more time and then I'm [379] going to go back here and change my [381] stage to [381] intake this is going to trigger the web [383] hook again but you'll see that now what [385] I'm doing in the second stage is I'm [386] getting that task and so um the reason [389] doing this is because I can access all [391] of the custom fields in this task I can [392] see the stage the email the phone number [395] then I can get this form answer which is [396] nice and sexy uh and then I can use it [398] to feed into my slack um [401] automation okay great so now that I'm [403] done with that let's actually go into [405] slack and let's create a a flow that [407] essentially sends a message into our [410] chat you know this is one of the [412] scenarios where I'm not starting at the [413] end I'm starting sort of at the [414] beginning but that's just because this [416] is quite conceptually simple and the [418] real Secret Sauce here isn't the [419] automations the secret sauces um the [421] stuff you have to do in slack to [422] configure it to make it [424] work I know that my channel type is [426] public what I've done is I've created a [427] channel in slack by going here clicking [429] create and then just typing slack block [431] Automation and I just click next and [433] then I created it you know this one's [434] already been taken so and that's that's [437] what I have over here um what I'm going [439] to do is I'll go to public Channel and [441] then I'll go slack block automation [443] right here and then the slack create a [445] message module offers you two ways to [447] make a message the first is you can make [449] a message just just do plain text and so [450] I could just say like hello how are you [453] if I run this puppy you'll see there's a [456] new message here from integromat which [457] is sort of makes old name uh and it says [460] hello how are you but this isn't really [462] that pretty and obviously there's no [464] interactive functionality here I can't [465] click on this and I can't use it to like [467] trigger a workflow or approve something [468] or deny something so we don't want to [470] use that what we want to do is we want [471] to go down here to blocks and you'll see [473] that you can use blocks to build an [475] interactive message to create blocks use [477] the block kit Builder so slack is very [480] good at educating people on how to use [482] their block Builder if you give that [483] button a click you literally just go [484] straight to like a big template page [487] where you can just select one of like a [488] dozen templates and as you see this is [490] actually the template that we we were [491] using initially and then all we need to [493] do to actually paste this in is just [494] copy this text go back to our [497] flow paste it in let me just zoom out a [501] bit because this uh screen's a little [502] small then if I run this again you'll [504] see that we now have a message in our [506] app uh in slack essentially saying you [508] have a new request here's Fred Enrique [510] new device request y y so that looks [513] pretty good to me obviously if we click [514] approve or deny we're going to get this [516] little app has not been configured for [517] this feature please contact the apps [519] developer that's just because we haven't [520] set up any of the actual slack app on [522] the back end in order to do this you [523] need to set up an app and everything [524] like that which which I'll show you but [526] what I'm going to do right now is I'm [527] just going to change this so that it has [528] the information that we care about so [529] that we could see the form answer and [531] you know the person's name and that sort [532] of thing so first things first the [534] simplest way to do this is always just [536] using the slack block kid Builder itself [538] because when you make a change here [539] it'll actually just immediately be [540] represented over here on the left hand [542] side so instead of you have a new [543] request I'll say you have a new lead [546] then we have a fake link to employee [548] profile what I'm going to do here is uh [551] this format is essentially maybe I'll do [554] it up here it's a smaller or a less than [557] symbol and then it's the [559] link and then it's a vertical bar and [562] then it's like the name of the [565] thing so if I added this in here I would [567] have a link actually why don't I added [569] in here just so you guys can [572] see I would have a link to my [575] website um left click. that reads left [579] click commas space Inc and so this is [581] just the format that we're going to use [582] what I'm going to do here is I'm just [583] going to put a first name so we'll just [585] say Peter Leia I'm just going to hard [586] code it in and then what I want this to [589] be is I want this to be a link to the [590] clickup record click Up's really easy [592] for this if I just click on this record [594] if I just click on this clickup record [595] dog then uh I already like click so I [598] put a click in your click uh I if you [600] just copy this over you'll see that the [602] format of this URL is pretty [604] straightforward it's app. clickup [609] docomo it's actually very [611] straightforward and very simple to do [612] this what I'll do is just paste that in [615] and now I have a button that literally [616] like when I click on this it takes me to [618] my clickup task for that lead you can [620] imagine how this might be valuable to [621] have when you receive a slack message [623] because that way you can just click on [624] it and maybe see all the history of the [626] lead or whatever uh so that's pretty [628] neat um um okay great so what else am I [630] going to do well I see there are all [631] these sections [633] here uh there's Fields field is a an [637] array that's broken down into a number [638] of objects there's type markdown okay [641] text uh type computer when last update [647] whatever so it looks like this is just [648] um yeah this whole section here is just [650] broken down [651] into um like one two three four five [654] things and all I want to do is I guess I [656] need maybe I want his email address so [659] I'll say [662] email then we're just going to do I [664] don't remember what I did here but I'll [666] just do my own email [667] here nice automatically links um [672] when I don't know if we need a when let [675] me just look through here and see what [676] information is actually relevant like [677] don't just put information there because [679] you need information or because you want [681] to fill a space put information there if [683] it's relevant so I'll put the phone [685] number as [686] well so we'll go phone [689] and I'm just going to do some pretend [691] phone number [692] here I did my own phone number again [694] didn't I yeah I did I've gotten some [697] calls whatever I'm putting it back up [700] feel free to ring me if you like getting [702] hung up on um and then last update what [705] I'll do here is I'll say this is form [708] answer and then here I'll just put the [710] form answer and that should be [713] good so let's paste this in that looks [717] pretty good and then um we'll just [720] delete these [722] two and you know it's not the prettiest [724] I kind of wish that I could like have [726] one more thing [728] honestly but whatever it's not a big [730] deal uh and then we have two buttons so [732] we have an approve button and a deny [733] button you'll see that the way that this [735] is laid out their syntax looks like [736] there's a type like to be clear I don't [738] actually know any of the syntax off the [740] top of my head or anything I'm just [741] making this up as I go along um I'm just [743] looking at the syntax I'm looking at [745] like comparing it back to the page then [747] I'm saying hm the text parameter is [749] approve I wonder if I change this to [751] qualify yeah and then it changes it to [753] qualify so I have basically the same [756] level of knowledge as you do about all [757] the stuff on the right hand side of the [758] page but regardless you know I'm able to [760] infer that if I make a change on the [761] right hand side it change the thing on [762] the left hand side I've played around [764] with this probably a little bit more at [765] this point than most of you so um that's [767] why I'm dancing around but yeah you know [769] just try one of these templates play [770] around with it and then um I'm sure you [772] you'll see what I mean it's quite simple [774] and straightforward to to do this [775] yourself but okay I see that there's an [777] elements array [779] inside of it there are two buttons [781] there's one called primary with the text [783] approve and then the value is clickme [785] one two 3 so what I'm going to do is I'm [787] just going to [788] change um this value to [791] qualified and then for the deny button [794] I'm going to change it to [796] unqualified and uh that should be good [799] and I imagine I'm going to feed the [800] value in later or something I don't [802] actually know so we're going to we're [804] going to do it together U but anyway I'm [805] going to copy this now and what we need [807] to do is we need to basically like [808] format our message message so I'm going [809] to paste this back in here and then [812] there's some variables that I want to [813] add so I just did this because um I [816] wanted to know how to like where to [818] replace the variables exactly so the [819] task name is Peter Leo that's where [821] that's going to go I'm going to leave [822] the link the same as it is and I'm going [825] to move this over here so you guys can [827] see this a lot simpler before I start [829] screwing around with this okay so where [832] was I um Peter Leo I'm going to replace [835] this with the task name and then this [838] link I'm going to to put in the task ID [840] so it'll say https app. clickup /t/ [843] whatever this will link us back to the [844] clickup record the email here I'm going [847] to fill with the email record from the [851] record here uh phone number I'm going to [853] fill with the phone from the record here [857] and then the form answer which ISS will [859] be the most important part I'm going to [861] add here and then I have [864] approve uh so I've qualified then I've [867] un qualific that looks good to be I'm [868] going to test so I'm going to see oh [871] never mind I'm not going to test this [872] cuz I have to do like a million things [873] I'm actually just going to run the [874] scenario from the beginning so I'm [875] actually going to catch the web hook and [877] then get the task and then paste it in [879] the way to do that here is I'm going to [880] switch this back to my nothing stage and [882] then I'll push this back to intake we'll [885] just pretend that intake is where we [886] actually just dump all leads to but um [888] you know just want to make it simple uh [891] and then we have our form so you have a [893] new lead Peter Leo if I give this a [895] click this will open up click up [897] wonderful if I go to my email I can [899] email myself I can call myself and then [902] form answer I'm looking for an agency to [903] help me with my graphic design needs if [905] I'm like a sales manager or something [907] and I have like a junior that's [907] generating leads for me whatever the the [909] the format is if I'm a closer and [912] there's a Setter out there that's [913] setting appointments I can forward their [915] information over to a message just like [916] this and then I can at a glance instead [918] of me going into a record or having some [920] daily task at a glance I can just verify [922] that this looks good you know I wouldn't [924] recommend this for all business types [925] obviously I don't like being chained to [926] a messenger personally and I do not [928] really work this way but there are tons [929] of coaching companies where you need to [931] respond to a lead within like a minute [933] and if you don't respond to a lead [934] within a minute that's $115,000 on the [935] table you just lost so that works quite [937] well obviously for that but anyway so [940] we've set this up now where we got the [941] message and the question is what do we [943] do with the message well obviously what [944] we want is we want a system that is [945] two-way not just one way when we click [948] approve something will happen to the [949] clickup CRM when we click deny something [951] else will happen to the clickup CRM and [953] this is where um the rest of the flow [955] becomes less of a make.com flow and it [956] becomes more of just like a slack setup [958] flow uh which is you know quite [960] intimidating to a lot of people and this [961] may differ a little bit from Discord if [963] you're going to use that platform um but [965] I will show you how to do it in such a [967] way that uh makes you not want to tear [968] your eyeballs [970] out okay so first things first uh we [974] need to set up a slack app so what I'm [976] going to do is I'm going to go over to [977] my workspace go to tools and settings [979] and then go to manage apps that'll take [981] me to this page here and then on this [984] page I can go to the top right and click [986] build and what I'm going to do is you [988] can see I've already created one called [989] block kit example earlier when I was [990] screwing around at this but I'll click [992] create new app and then go from scratch [994] the app uh name is going to be NYX super [998] awesome 2way [1002] slack NY cool 2way slack [1007] automation that's rough [1011] man all right that looks good workspace [1014] I'm going to develop this in is my own 1 [1015] second copy and then I'm going to click [1016] create app uh you should call yours Nick [1019] super cool slack automation too by the [1020] way all right uh now we're confronted [1023] with a pretty intimidating looking [1024] screen what we need to do is use this [1025] interact click on this interactive [1027] components button turn this puppy to [1030] on and we need to uh go to request URL [1033] and then we need [1034] to uh let me see so this will send the [1037] slack [1042] message what I'm going to do is I'll [1044] call this scenario number one new le [1046] generated send to slack for approval [1049] and then I'll go back here and then I'm [1051] just going [1052] to clone this even though I H that's [1056] annoying sometimes when you clone a new [1058] scenario um that has a web hook as a [1060] trigger It'll ask you to replace the web [1061] hook which is just the worst but I'm [1064] just going to create a new web hook in a [1065] new scenario and I'm going to call this [1067] two slack button [1070] pressed um change lead status to [1074] qualified or [1076] unqualified okay and then I'm going to [1078] add a new hook I'm just going to call a [1079] slack button [1083] pressed and then I'm going to copy this [1085] address to my clipboard then if we go [1087] back here to the app uh you'll see [1089] there's a request URL parameter this is [1092] the place where we paste in our make web [1094] hook and that make make web hook after [1096] we do this will receive all of the [1097] queries that are coming in so we paste [1100] it in like this and we see that we now [1102] have um the ability to save the changes [1104] which is quite cool I will say um this [1107] may require a little bit of playing [1109] around with on your end um you know [1111] depending on when you watch the video [1112] slack may have a slightly different [1113] interface they've been discussing [1114] changes to this and I think they [1116] recently changed the flow here quite [1118] considerably that's why I spent a little [1119] bit of time mucking around so if it [1120] doesn't look exactly like it looks right [1122] now just sort of understand the [1123] fundamentals of what I'm talking about [1125] which is that essentially in order for [1127] interactivity to work you're going to [1128] need a URL or a web hook to send the [1130] request to there's going to be a place [1131] to configure that and we're also going [1133] to need to do a few other things [1135] um probably the most important thing [1137] we're going to do is go to ooth and [1138] permission [1140] and then we're going to have [1142] to add a bunch of ooth [1145] Scopes um for chat I believe so chat [1150] right [1152] chat uh I think that's it actually and [1154] then I am read I am WR oh there should [1158] be a chat read too no no there's no chat [1160] read okay so add those here and then I [1163] don't actually know if you need to do [1165] this but I always do this anyway um I'll [1167] do the same thing here on on uh user [1169] token Scopes because I find that um when [1173] I didn't this just this one time it [1175] didn't work so this is my [1177] magic um way to ward off the the failure [1181] and then we also need what's called a [1182] new redirect URL and this is kind of [1185] weird and funky um but in order to do [1188] this what we have to do is we have to go [1190] back here to basic [1192] information and then we need to install [1194] our app to our workspace so click [1196] install to workspace [1201] this is now installed on my workspace [1203] there's Now app credentials here with a [1205] client ID a client secret signing secret [1207] all that stuff so what what you're going [1208] to do is copy the client [1211] ID and [1213] then I should have kept the scenario [1215] open but we got to go back to the [1216] previous scenario [1217] here so let's go to [1222] slack and then we have to change the [1224] connection um I was using an example [1226] connection here that I had already set [1227] up previously you probably don't even [1229] have a connection set up so what you [1230] need to do is you need to go to add go [1232] slackbot I'm just going to call this [1234] slack interactive block kit example and [1239] then go down to show advanced settings [1240] here and paste in the client [1242] ID and then go back and grab the client [1245] secret as well paste that [1247] in paste that in here okay so what'll [1250] end up happening when you try and do the [1251] connection um I just give it a try and I [1254] had an issue where I wasn't actually [1255] logged into the right slack workspace so [1256] I had to cut it but what happens when [1258] you try and do do the connection to the [1259] specific slack workspace that you are [1261] supposed to be logged into is you'll get [1262] this message redirector URI did not [1264] match any configured uis past URI this [1267] integrat docomo CBS slack3 and now I've [1270] looked long and hard for this [1272] documentation I haven't really been able [1273] to find it anywhere um but I have as I [1275] mentioned mucked around in the mud and [1277] I've realized that what you need to do [1278] is you need to copy this [1280] URL and then you need to go back to [1283] install not install app [1289] um I think ooth and permissions [1292] probably and then you need to go to [1294] redirect URLs here then add new [1297] redirector Ro and just paste this puppy [1298] in and then [1300] save what you are basically doing is [1303] you're just adding [1306] um like an additional layer of [1308] verification where the request is now [1310] being sent back to make really quickly [1312] um just to verify that you know you are [1313] who you say you are and all that stuff [1314] so what I'm doing now is it's told me [1316] the respons is marked is invalid I'm [1317] just going to like retract [1319] and I'm going to get a little modal here [1321] that is now saying hey we are requesting [1322] permission to access the 1 second copy [1324] slack workspace what can I do um I click [1331] allow all right and now by doing so what [1334] we've done is you know we basically [1335] created a slack app and then that's [1338] hosted over on slack essentially and now [1341] what we're doing is we're using that [1342] slack app and then we're connecting it [1345] to our make account so now we're going [1346] to send and we're going to receive [1348] messages using the slack app as opposed [1350] to just using the basic integrat bot [1352] like I was doing earlier U most people [1354] here are probably just using the basic [1355] integrat bot or you know maybe you're [1357] just using like a user account that [1359] you're authenticating um if you do that [1361] you're just not going to get the message [1362] from the right person it's not going to [1364] be your slack app for one and then for [1366] two um you know if you do all of your [1368] automations through like a specific user [1370] account instead of a bot account or [1371] whatnot then [1372] um uh like you know if you send a DM or [1375] something it'll be receiving a DM from a [1376] person as opposed to from a bot which [1378] can be sort of tricky um any that's all [1381] Nuance you could use whatever method you [1382] want but essentially in order for this [1384] to work you're going to have to use the [1384] slack app that you created and then once [1386] you have that now if I send this [1388] message oh sorry I'm going to have to [1391] redo the whole thing again so let's go [1392] to run once let's go back to my CRM [1395] let's change the status to [1397] nothing let's change the status to [1399] intake that's going to run my [1402] flow now what we'll see is if we go back [1404] here uh we received the message from NY [1406] cool two-way slack automations but to [1408] integrat right so that's pretty neat and [1411] then the other thing is um now when I [1413] click approve or deny it's actually [1414] going to do something so what's it going [1416] to do well it's going to send the [1418] request when we click either approve or [1420] deny to the URL that we added earlier to [1423] our web hook in make so if I go back to [1425] make here you'll see that there's this [1426] web hook just waiting patiently if I [1427] click run once then I go back here and I [1429] click approve we'll just have sent the [1432] message and so we receive a payload [1435] that's basically just a ton of CH in [1438] with like a million in one different [1439] fields and now we basically have [1441] everything we need to be able to um go [1444] back to clickup and then update that [1445] lead right we have the username of the [1448] person that made the change so we can [1449] log that we have um the data here [1454] including like the the lead name the [1456] email we have the phone number we have [1460] the form answer we have basically [1461] everything that we need in order to to [1462] go back and do it with some pretty fancy [1464] parsing uh so what do we do now uh we [1466] just need to go into click up and we [1468] need to um update the update the flow so [1472] I'm going to paste this [1474] in first I'm just going to C get [1477] task and then actually what I'm going to [1479] do before then is because this is Json [1481] we can actually just parse this all in [1482] Json and that's going to be much [1484] prettier and it's just going to be a lot [1485] easier to use so I'm just going to use [1487] the parse Json module here paste that in [1489] and then right now for the purposes of [1490] this test I'm just going to copy this [1492] into the parse Json module is hardcoded [1495] I'm going to run this make sure that [1496] it's parsed nicely you see now we have a [1498] bunch of fields and these fields are [1500] very easily [1502] accessible and then what I'm going to do [1504] here is the field that we want is going [1506] to be in message most [1509] likely um I guess thinking back we could [1512] probably just add the clickup ID as a [1515] field we could just say click up ID and [1517] then have [1519] it um but that's not a big deal we can [1522] also just parse it yeah let's just parse [1524] it using Rex that'll be [1527] fun okay so what I'm going to do is okay [1529] we have this message field here right uh [1531] if we go back to message then you have a [1533] new lead blah blah blah and then we have [1534] the clickup ID of the record right over [1536] here so what I'm going to do is I'm just [1537] going to parse this message so that I [1538] can grab the clickup ID again which you [1540] know if you think about it logically is [1542] just creating more work because I had [1543] full control over the uh the pattern [1546] earlier and now I'm like going through [1548] the more complicated pattern um but [1550] that's okay um the pattern is going to [1552] be something like this and then the text [1555] that I'm going to feed in is going to be [1556] message text [1558] now anytime I make a Rex I always do I [1561] go to Rex [1564] 101 then I insert whatever I want my [1566] string to be and then I insert all of my [1568] test data as well so I'm going to be [1571] feeding in all of this data into Rex [1574] right and what I want is I want this [1575] section right here so what I'll do is in [1578] Rex you have to cancel out backs slashes [1580] like this and then um whatever the data [1583] that you want to extract needs to be [1585] within these two little curly brackets [1588] so got the curly brackets here and then [1591] my group one is the ID which is what I [1593] want so this reject should work I think [1596] it'll work uh I'm just going to go in [1597] and and pump this in give it a try [1599] pattern that I'm looking for is here the [1601] message that I'm looking for is there um [1603] I'm just going to hardcode the message [1605] again just because I'm doing [1607] testing let me just paste this in make [1609] sure that I grab the actual ID of the [1612] record and then I'm just going to give [1614] this a [1615] run we we didn't get anything why didn't [1618] we get anything [1621] H maybe because Global match was off [1624] case sensitive no multi-line it's [1627] probably [1630] multi-line well actually that doesn't [1631] mean [1633] anything yes so that that shouldn't [1635] matter let's try this [1638] again okay we didn't get anything there [1641] oh man what was it that I was not doing [1643] correctly here [1645] again was it the pipe character might be [1648] the pipe character yeah okay it was the [1651] pipe character so sometimes in Rex you [1653] have to like cancel out or Escape [1654] various characters um and sometimes [1657] the way that that Rex is interpreted by [1660] Rex 101 is different from the way that [1662] the Rex is interpreted in make that's [1664] the tldr there it's not super important [1666] if you aren't capable of getting [1668] something that you can get in Rex 101 I [1670] would just start adding some backslashes [1672] randomly like I did and then eventually [1673] you'll be able to you know isolate the [1674] variable that you want anyway um that's [1677] good I verified that this works so I'm [1678] going to go back here I'm going to swap [1680] this out with the message text then I'll [1683] go to click up and then the variable [1685] that I'm going to feed in is going to be [1689] um this dollar sign one so I think it's [1691] going to be four. doll sign one back [1695] here I believe we'll see and then once I [1699] get that uh I'm going to go back to [1700] click up and then I'm just going to [1702] update let's edit a task with custom [1705] Fields this allows me to access the [1708] custom fields that I want to [1709] change and then uh I suppose I could add [1713] a router here and then I could say if [1714] it's approved then we do approve if it's [1715] denyed then we do it denied but let me [1718] cover that in a second let me just [1719] verify that all this stuff works [1721] first we'll go to folder lless [1725] lists and [1728] then uh what you slack CRM [1735] here and then the ID of the record that [1738] feeding in is just going to be the ID of [1739] this get a task module and then the [1742] custom field that we're changing is [1743] going to be called stage and we're just [1745] going to change this to qualified for [1749] now okay let me go in and actually add [1751] the real data to all this so this is the [1754] payload so the pattern we got the task [1756] and then we're editing the task custom [1758] Fields great I'm going to give this a [1759] run and what I'll do is I'll take a [1762] close look at this [1763] stage then I'll go over to my slack and [1766] then I'll click approve [1769] then I'll see that the stage was just [1771] changed to qualified and it happened [1774] when I triggered it in slack which is [1776] nice if I go back to the make scenario [1778] you'll see that all of these were [1780] completed pretty nicely um looks like we [1782] found the ID and all that stuff and then [1785] um sorry I just realized that I'm [1787] hardcoding in an ID which is dumb uh [1790] what I'm going to do is I'll go um [1792] period and then this and this should now [1795] be able to hardcode anything [1798] as opposed to just that uh modifier yeah [1801] there you go so the Rex previously I was [1804] actually just looking for 86 DT g69 H7 [1808] which is dumb obviously every ID is [1810] going to be different um what you can do [1812] is you can just put a dot and then the [1813] star symbol and it'll just capture [1815] everything up until you know the [1817] character outside of this little um uh [1820] round bracket if you guys are interested [1822] in me doing like an actual breakdown of [1824] Rex at some point as opposed to just [1825] mumbling my way through various uh [1827] builds that include Rex just let me know [1829] I'm more than the Habit to like actually [1830] focus on Rex maybe give you guys like a [1831] brief eli5 I'll be honest I just use [1834] chat GPT for probably 70% of my rxes [1836] nowadays um it's just a lot faster than [1838] me having to memorize every single part [1840] of the flow but you know I you can still [1842] make it pretty far with just a little [1844] bit of procedural knowledge but all [1846] right so that's more or less the flow [1848] for Approved um why don't we see okay [1852] there's a variable here I think it's [1855] actions and then it's under value [1858] so what we need to do is we need to [1860] change the stage that we're updating it [1863] to depending on the presence of this [1865] value if it's qualified we'll change it [1866] to qualified if it's unqualified we'll [1868] change it to [1869] unqualified what I'll do here um because [1872] this is probably just simpler for [1873] everybody watching is I'm just going to [1874] attach a router I'm not a big fan of [1877] routers if you've seen my previous [1879] videos you'll probably know why but this [1881] will just make it a lot easier for [1882] people that are unfamiliar with how [1883] switches work to get up and running with [1885] this [1888] and then what I'm going to do is I'll [1889] use filters and then I'll say if this is [1892] equal to go to actions and then value [1896] and if this is equal to [1899] qualified then we'll go the qualified [1902] route and then if actions is equal to [1906] unqualified then we'll go the [1907] unqualified [1909] route and then what I'm going to do is [1911] down [1914] here I'll change this to unqualified [1919] so now we should have the ability to [1922] dynamically change the status of a lead [1925] based on a button [1927] click so this is currently qualified I'm [1929] going to click deny and now this should [1931] move to [1932] unqualified and you see that's exactly [1934] what's happening there's a little bit of [1935] a lag here so it changes twice but this [1936] is now [1938] unqualified all right that looks great [1940] um now that we have both of these up and [1941] running why don't I just add one new [1943] lead to this flow and then we can just [1945] give this thing a quick little test um [1946] I'll just pretend that I'm adding [1948] a completely new person uh what I think [1950] I'll do is I will add the person that [1953] requested this video in the first place [1955] uh the person that requested this video [1956] was named Jason guest 3447 so I'm going [1959] to pretend that first of all I need to [1962] add a new [1964] lead here we'll go Jason [1967] guest me just create this um up here um [1972] handsome looking fow I'm just going to [1973] pretend his email is Jason guest totally [1976] reil.com [1978] that looks legit his phone number is uh [1981] very auspiciously a 604 phone number [1984] that's close to mine and he wants [1987] hi I want an agency to help me grow my [1992] Consulting [1994] Biz okay so we have a new lead basically [1997] ready to go all we need to do is change [1998] the stage and Jason guest should be [2000] coming into our slack what I'm going to [2001] do is I'm going to add him to intake I'm [2003] going to go over here to my slack um [2005] Channel and boom we have a new lead from [2008] Nick's cool two-way slack automation [2010] from Jason guest let me give this a [2012] quick click CU I'm not sure if he's [2013] qualified H looking through all of his [2016] information I don't know about this [2017] Jason guest fell man no I'm just kidding [2020] he's totally qualified I give him the [2022] quick little approve button I go back to [2024] my slack what you'll see just happened [2027] is assuming that this automation is [2031] working oh sorry I didn't actually run [2033] this Let Me Wait for new data I go back [2036] here I click the deny button and then [2038] what ends up happening is he goes down [2040] the unqualified route and then Jason's [2042] unqualified because we hate him no I'm [2044] just kidding um he's probably pretty [2046] qualified so if I go back here I run [2048] this puppy again and then I click [2050] approve um let's make let's make Jason [2052] qualified I think he deserves it at this [2054] point yeah awesome I hope that makes [2057] sense guys um you know if you aren't [2059] immediately seeing the value in an [2060] automation like this you probably [2061] haven't worked at either a coaching [2062] business or one that uses slack to [2064] manage most of their internal [2065] Communications but essentially enabling [2067] two-way interactivity between a block [2069] component and then a CRM and then a CRM [2071] and then you know your slack channel uh [2073] can be incredibly powerful especially [2074] for faster moving companies that spend [2076] most of their time living inside of a [2077] little slack message box so I really do [2080] uh hope that that helped you guys if you [2081] guys have any requests for similar [2083] videos on slack or maybe Discord I [2085] haven't really played around Discord too [2087] much but I'm happy to learn for the [2088] purposes of showing it to y'all uh then [2090] feel free to just drop a message down [2091] below more than happy to walk you [2092] through it if you guys have any [2094] recommendations for videos that aren't [2095] related to this feel free to drop them [2096] down below as well I have a lot of fun [2097] doing these sorts of builds otherwise [2099] thanks so much for watching please like [2101] And subscribe do all that fun YouTube [2103] stuff and I'll catch you on the next one [2104] cheers

Title: Watch Me Build An Automatic AI Lead Magnet Generator Using Make.com
[0] what's going on everybody got a quick [1] and easy video for you today on building [3] an automatic lead magnet generator using [6] make.com this was another request that [8] was sent to me about a month and a half [10] to two months ago uh I've been taking my [12] sweet time with this one because I [14] wanted to make sure that I got it right [15] and that the system that I developed was [18] simple enough that 99% of the people [19] watching could probably do it within an [21] hour but also complicated enough I [23] suppose that it offered um enough value [25] to actually be used in like a sales flow [28] in real life so if that sounds like [30] something you guys want to learn how to [30] do for yourselves stay tuned and let's [32] get into [35] it okay so first things first this idea [38] was sent to me by ni. [41] m527 um essentially he was asking for [45] some sort of lead gen agency automation [46] flow for example for cold emailing it' [48] be amazing if we could automate lead [50] magnets a prospect could fill out a form [51] and use AI to write some cold email [52] scripts for them specific to their [53] company and then send them in a Google [55] doc doesn't have to be this but [57] automating a sales asset we could use to [58] grow a pipeline would be insanely [59] valuable [60] and I agree I mean I sort of do this um [62] if you guys have seen my my generator [64] proposal video that's basically a very [66] similar flow but you know a lot of [68] people don't have access to pandadoc and [69] a lot of people don't have access to a [70] few of the swankier sort of tools that I [72] like to use so I thought that I'd create [73] a flow that generates a pretty good [75] quality lead magnet um just upon a [77] prospect filling out a form maybe you're [79] in the middle of a cold email sequence [81] and your big offer is hey let me create [83] a lead magnet for you for free um all [85] you need to do is fill out this form and [86] then it'll like automatically draft the [88] lead magnet maybe you have some Q Anda [90] or something like that at the very end [92] before you send it back to them but [93] generally speaking this is just like [94] another way to I guess up the ante of [96] your sales game you're providing some [97] asset for free I did a lot of this with [99] one second copy when I first started [101] what we were doing is obviously using AI [102] to pre-draft articles uh but we would [104] offer a free 500w sample article on a [107] topic of they're choosing and then all [108] they had to do is fill out a little form [109] with three or four bits of information [111] like the keyword the topic any example [114] articles that sort of thing um and then [116] AI would would actually get like 70 to [117] 80% of the way there we'd send it to an [119] Editor to do a quick 5-minute touchup [121] and the internal cost of us being able [123] to offer this on the front end very [124] goodlook offer uh was like I don't know [127] three or four bucks so made perfect [128] sense for us I fig this might make good [130] sense for you too so how do we actually [133] proceed with this well as I mentioned [135] earlier I wanted to keep this as simple [137] as humanly possible and so what I've [139] done is I basically went and I googled [141] Google Slides [143] templates the first hit that I got was [146] this website called slides [148] go.com then I just scroll down until I [150] found something that I thought looked [151] pretty [153] reasonable which was this one right here [156] gave a little click and then I press [158] download this template Google [159] Slides what is what this is doing is [162] it's now just copying this template over [163] to my [165] account and this is going to be one of [168] the templates that you would use or in [170] my case I'm going to use to build this [171] flow out now what I would recommend you [174] guys do if you guys wanted to build out [176] like a real dedicated solution is create [179] four five templates and then create your [181] own variables inside of the templates [183] like I'll show you in a second uh and [184] then use either like a random function [186] or iterate through them like round robin [188] style so that uh you know you're not [191] just using the same template over and [192] over and over again you know if somebody [194] happens to generate something U more [196] than once you know they get something [197] different um and you know it looks a [199] little higher quality that way but yeah [202] what we're going to be doing is we're [202] going to be using this template um to [205] sort of you know guide our way uh [207] through this process so I'm just going [209] to make a copy on the account that I [211] know has access to Google um slides [214] inside of [216] make.com so we're just going to go [218] interactive and animated social media [221] strategy and what I'm going to do next [223] is just delete a bunch of the slides [225] that I don't really think matter or they [226] would just be a little bit too difficult [228] to like template with AI so this is a [230] title page I'm imagining we would [232] probably swap the title out um for some [234] AI generated title that would seem very [236] customized the prospect so I'm going to [237] leave that there there's like a [238] subheading down there that's nice this [241] is I guess just a instructional guide on [244] how to use the template so I'll delete [245] that this is a table of contents um I'm [248] going to use this that seems pretty [249] interesting so let's give it a try this [251] looks pretty interesting too [253] um let's delete these sorts of pages and [256] then let's leave sort of like the [259] content [260] pages and then for the purpose of [263] demonstration I'm just going to delete [264] all the other Pages we'll just use this [265] as the [266] um this is the last page here oops there [270] we go and why don't we just pretend [271] there's like some call to [274] action we'll say get started today and [276] then maybe um I don't know we'll just [279] link uh my website for the purpose of [282] the [283] demonstration and let's say the whole ID [285] here is that we are selling [287] to um I don't know like digital [290] marketing audiences I suppose so maybe [292] they run a digital marketing agency and [294] we're going to ask them like you know [296] like what what what do you want your [297] lead Banker to be about or something uh [299] and then because these images are sort [300] of quasy people are on their phones it's [302] something to do with social media [303] digital marketing that sort of thing [305] they'll probably work so we don't even [306] need to really edit the uh edit the [308] images okay great so now that I have my [311] Google Slides template set up uh what am [313] I going to do next well it's quite quite [314] simple and quite straightforward [316] essentially I'm going to go over to make [317] and then I'm just going to test an MVP [319] of generating um you know just a Google [321] slide using this presentation very [323] easily and so I've set up a scenario [325] here called new request form entry [326] generate lead magnet and email to [328] Prospect and I'm going to hook this up [329] to type form and I'm going to hook this [330] up to like the rest of the flow in a [332] second but all I really want to do at [333] the very beginning is just verify that I [335] can generate um the I don't know [337] templated feature that I want to [338] generate so really quick and easy hack [341] for you uh and one of the reasons why I [342] love Google slides and how it interacts [344] with Mak so much it's just so easy to [345] get started with this stuff I built [347] proposals I built like whole [349] presentations in seconds using AI uh [351] they have a built-in feature in make [352] that allows you to replace any variable [355] that has two um curly brackets so if for [358] instance I were just to go title like [360] this then maybe down here I'd go [363] subheading and then if I were to go to [365] make.com choose [368] slides and then create a presentation [370] from a [372] template that's right down here uh what [374] I could do then is just add an example [376] title and then I'm going to choose a [379] specific presentation here called [380] interactive and animated [383] whatever there you go that's this one [385] and then you'll see because we put in [387] these two curly brackets here if I go [389] back um there's like a curly left [391] bracket and then two curly right [392] brackets they've actually pulled the [394] variables for us and we can just put [396] them in however we want so I'm just [398] going to go interactive and animated [399] social media [401] strategy Welcome to our awesome lead [405] magnet and then for now I'm just going [407] to store this in my [409] root and then I'm just going to give [411] this a quick run let's just show you [414] guys what this looks like at the end [420] it's going to take a little bit of time [422] just because there's some heavy assets [424] but anyway we now have the presentation [427] um stored and um instead of me going [430] through the process of generating a link [432] I know that this ID is tied to the [435] presentation so I'm just going to go and [437] I'm going to replace this section here [438] after the slash D with the presentation [441] ID and this is going to jump me to that [444] awesome and you see now this is the the [447] actual presentation that I generated the [448] title was interactive and animated [450] social media strategy and then it says [451] Welcome to our awesome lead magnet so [453] all I did there was I basically just [454] verified that you know we can do [456] probably the most important part of the [457] flow I started at the end and I'm just [458] going to work my way backwards from the [460] end to you know the stuff that I [461] actually care [462] about so probably the most difficult [465] part of this if I'm just being honest is [467] going to be the AI prompting if you [468] think about it AI is not really going to [470] be able to generate this whole thing in [471] one Fell Swoop like we can't just have [473] it generate a bunch of text and then you [476] know use one variable and then populate [478] it all we're going to need to use [479] multiple variables and then we're also [480] going to have to be cognizant to the [482] fact that uh if you look closely like [484] there are different text lengths Here If [486] This Were goals and objectives and a [488] bunch of other stuff this would look [490] pretty crappy right so we need to make [492] sure that you know they're approximately [494] the same lengths you know like target [496] audience demographics if we have a table [497] of contents and we're generating six [499] pages and then you know instead of [501] target audience demographics this has [503] like 40 words in it or something this [504] would obviously spill over and just ruin [506] our our whole design uh so I guess from [508] a professionalism perspective and also [510] just making sure that you know this is [512] cohesive and this all makes sense and [513] this is readable uh we need to be a [516] little more precise in how and how we're [517] going to prompt it so I'll show you how [518] to do that in a second um what we're [521] probably going to do is we're just going [522] to use variables to replace all of these [528] sections and we're going to populate [530] them all manually and then I'm probably [532] going to have to now that I'm thinking [534] about a train it and give it like three [535] or four examples of what I want it to [536] look like um so it may be a little bit [539] involved but that's okay this is sort of [542] work that we'll do once and then AI will [543] just do it forever after that and then [547] just thinking off the top of my [548] head that's about it I mean you could [550] throw in a bunch of extra functionality [552] here you could have it like um pull [553] images from one of the various image [555] apis out there to customize the images [557] or you could have generate a color [559] palette and then you know like modify [560] the colors uh but to be honest I think [562] that goes a little too far and I think [564] that most people that want to be able to [566] generate lead magnets like this they [568] don't really care about that as I me you [569] could create three or four templates and [570] just cycle through it so without further [573] Ado let's get into the AI training side [576] of things I'm going to go to open [579] AI then we're going to create a [581] completion and as I mentioned we're [583] working backwards so now we're going to [585] start at open Ai and then we're going to [586] go to the Google Slides [589] template okay we're going to create a [591] chat completion I've just been using the [594] GPT 4- turbo uh it's not the highest [596] quality but it's very simple and easy to [598] get up and running with [600] and as always I will have the model [602] self-identify by saying something like [603] you are a helpful intelligent writing [605] assistant most of the time I'm getting [607] it to do writing so that makes sense I [610] always follow a system user user [613] assistant user assistant user assistant [615] pattern if you guys have seen my [616] previous videos essentially the system [618] is what the model identifies as the user [620] is the instructions that you are [621] providing to the model to get it to do [623] something and then afterwards you just [624] do a bunch of user assistant pairs which [626] are examples that you provide and then [628] the example out output from the model [630] this is how you sort of guide it in a [632] specific Direction these are the guard [633] rails that you put down so what I'm [636] going to need to do here first is I'm [638] going to need to provide it some [639] instructions I'm going I'm going to [642] say using the following [646] input generate a [649] high [651] quality let's [654] do I don't want to say lead magnet [657] because I might not understand lead [659] magnet [660] okay we'll try lead [666] magnet we're going to say [669] Jason then over here what I'm going to [672] do is I'm just going to interact with it [673] in Jason so I'm going to send it Jason [675] and then I'm going to train it to send [677] me back Jason and then we're just going [678] to go back and forth and back and forth [680] and that's how it's going to work now [681] obviously the contents of the prompt [684] that I'm going to be providing it [684] depends on the form that we're going to [686] set up so I'm not going to worry too [687] much about it right now I'm just going [689] to to sort of scaffold the stuff and [691] then after I've scaffolded the um uh the [695] variables in the in the slide deck or [697] sorry in the Google slide lead magnet [700] that I'm interested in then I'll go back [701] and then we can create the form as well [703] but I think I'm probably going to need [704] two examples here so we're going to do [707] two user assistant Pairs and then at the [709] end what I'm going to do is I'm actually [712] going to have like the real data [713] essentially that that is provided from [715] the form so um as I mentioned this is [718] the system user user assistant user [721] assistant and then user pattern this is [723] basically called two shot learning in uh [727] you know kind of like ml speak and then [729] Max token count I'm just going to choose [731] something long I don't really care too [733] much about that advanced settings I [735] always like to choose 0.7 for the [737] temperature I just find the quality is a [739] little bit better um and I don't need [741] the frequency penalty presence penalty I [742] don't need any of that stuff they keep [744] on adding more parameters here but um I [746] haven't really found any of them hyper [748] relevant in the last a little bit so [751] that's that okay great so now that we [752] have um all of that scaffolded what I [755] want to do next is I want to actually [756] figure out the variables that I'm going [757] to need to have open AI generate for us [760] and so obviously title is going to have [761] to be one of the variables subheading is [763] going to have to be another one of the [764] variables uh we'll leave table of [766] contents as is but why don't we [769] do section one [772] heading like this then why don't we do [776] section two heading we'll do section [779] three [781] heading section 4 [784] heading section five [787] heading and I think there's six sections [790] here but I just need to make sure [791] because I deleted a bunch of pages right [792] so let's say this is one two three four [796] five you know what there isn't six so [799] why don't we just remove [800] this then why don't we use our lovely [802] design skills to try and Center this [805] puppy o that's rough [807] Man Okay so all of our lead magnetes are [809] going to be exactly five pages because [811] we're templating the hell out of them um [813] I like the bolded [815] text [818] um and then I'll have this also be [821] section one [824] heading so the idea is this is going to [826] be the table of contents for the [827] document this is also just going to like [828] add us an additional page fluff up our [830] lead mag a little bit make it seem a [832] little more valuable and then uh [834] whatever the section one heading is in [836] the table of contents is obviously going [837] to be the heading of the next section [839] one part right so that part makes sense [842] um and then we'll probably [844] generate um like a paragraph so I might [847] say section one paragraph and then maybe [849] we'll just do like two bullet points so [850] section one bullet point one section one [851] bullet point two I should probably come [853] up with an acronym now that I'm thinking [854] about it um simply because if I were to [856] do a paragraph here and then bullet [859] point one bullet point 2 like the the [861] Json itself is going to be pretty long [863] that's going to be a fair number of [864] tokens so there's probably a more [866] effective way to uh to figure that out [868] but anyway so we'll do section one [869] heading and [872] then you know what I should do before I [874] go any further here I'm just going to [876] make a copy again just that I could see [879] what the um paragraph lengths are you [882] know uh what I mentioned earlier was [883] that it's very important that the length [884] of these sections isn't like super crazy [886] long or short and they're pretty similar [888] to what was on the [889] template so um obviously I just need [892] like a a source document that I can look [893] at and that Source document is going to [895] be right over here okay we'll call this [898] section one parag [900] graph we'll call this section one bullet [904] 1 we'll call this section one bullet [909] two and then let's just not do a bullet [912] three that looks pretty [914] nice here we'll go section two [919] heading we'll go section [923] two [926] subheading [927] one let go section to subheading [931] 2 we'll go Section to paragraph [935] one I'm just following roughly anyway um [939] some format for this just that it's a [942] little bit easier and maybe more uh [944] maintainable when somebody reads it [946] later section three heading is going to [949] be over [951] here um this is going to be section [953] three subheading [955] one it's going to be two don't worry too [959] much that the textt is kind of being [961] pushed all over the place um that part's [963] not super [965] important the um uh we're going to be [968] able to control that by training it uh [970] later so we're going to say section [972] three paragraph 1 Section 3 paragraph [976] 2 Section 3 paragraph [980] 3 it will also make it a lot easier to [982] see the um blueprint and kind of see how [985] that works now that I think about [987] it one of the really cool things that [990] I'm excited to um create a community for [993] is it'll allow me to very easily put up [996] all of these assets like uh one thing [999] that I've missed in previous videos is [1000] I'll put up the blueprint but then the [1002] blueprint will be Consulting some [1004] pandadoc or something like that and it's [1006] sort of like [1007] meaningless so um what I'm going to do [1010] is I'll probably open up like [1012] a school Community or something like [1014] that and then um I'm pretty sure they [1016] have oh I guess this is heading [1018] subheading one they have built- in [1020] support for [1023] um uh you know like uploading various [1025] files and that sort of thing so that way [1028] I'll basically be able to just have like [1029] a big compendium of I don't know [1032] proposal documents [1034] and Lead magnet documents and all the [1037] sorts of things that people have been [1038] asking me for so that's going to be [1040] pretty [1042] cool okay this is going to be section [1044] four paragraph one as you see a lot of [1046] this is extremely boring [1049] and uh [1051] very [1053] monotonous but rest easy you know that [1055] you are only doing it [1058] once now we got to do six brutal I'm [1061] just going to copy this from before [1063] paste this here call this [1067] five going to do [1070] section [1073] five subheading [1075] one we'll do section five subheading [1079] two we'll go Section Five subheading [1083] 3 this is going to be [1087] four this is going to be [1090] five and this is going to be six [1095] awesome now we're just going to wrap [1097] this up with the [1103] paragraphs oh I just realized thatth [1106] that needs to be five doesn't it [1118] now one other thing that I should [1119] mention just when you're doing this on [1120] your [1121] own is that uh Google Slides has the [1124] annoying habit of generating a bunch of [1126] extra lines and so just make sure that [1129] you don't have any extra new lines at [1130] the bottom of these paragraphs because [1131] the new lines are going to push text [1134] down and [1135] stuff so add an extra new line there [1138] extra new line [1140] there um probably same with this no [1143] didn't have anything there probably have [1145] an extra new line here yeah that's why [1147] the text was all [1150] high so we'll do this just make sure [1152] that everything here is hunky dory [1153] looking [1155] good okay awesome yeah so this is going [1158] to be uh this is going to be our [1159] template um and now all we have to do [1160] that we've basically created what like [1162] 30 variables or something like that we [1164] have to have ai generate those variables [1166] the simplest way for us to do that is as [1167] I mentioned earlier using Json so if I [1170] go back here notice how you know I just [1173] sort of like templated it out like this [1175] uh what we can do instead is we [1176] basically have to go through and we have [1178] to um sorry not here down here we [1182] basically have to go [1184] through and then we have to have ai [1186] generate all of these for us um so let's [1192] just for the purposes of [1195] this h [1199] yeah I gotta essentially write all these [1201] again that's annoying I also can't just [1203] copy and paste them because kind of a [1205] weird hack in a quirk and um you know [1208] most people won't really care about this [1210] but because there are two curly braces [1211] here and that's makes built-in variable [1213] syntax if you try and copy and paste [1215] this in it'll have like a built-in [1217] variable called section one heading [1219] which obviously doesn't exist which is [1221] why it's uh returning that black sort of [1223] rectangle which is annoying but anyway [1226] um yeah great so basically what we're [1227] going to have to do is we're going to [1228] have to turn turn all of these variables [1230] here um into Json format and just [1233] because I don't want this video to be [1234] like 3 hours of me just [1236] monotonously copying and pasting [1238] headings and that sort of thing I'm just [1239] going to cut this and post um and then [1241] in a few seconds you know we'll uh we'll [1243] be right back to developing okay I had [1245] to do some fancy prompt engineering off [1247] screen there just because uh I realized [1249] that I was essentially generating an [1250] essay every single time which is pretty [1252] long and in order to really make sure [1254] that the quality of the content is good [1256] enough you know it required a fair [1257] amount of tweaking but anywh who [1259] assuming that you have uh you know 20 or [1261] 30 minutes to spend to generating this [1263] amazing super high value lead magnet [1266] Creator um this is essentially what I [1269] what I did first and foremost I made a [1271] couple of changes to the prompt here I [1272] said ensure the following variables are [1274] present every time and then I included [1275] every single one of them simply because [1277] I noticed that uh the AI had a tendency [1279] to Omit one or two and if it omits one [1281] or two obviously the end result is we [1283] just have a big blank space in the [1284] template that's not going to be good so [1286] to get ahead of it I just thought that I [1288] would um add this piece of [1290] instruction stuff like this probably [1291] lowers the quality a little bit just [1293] being this explicit with the model but [1295] at the same time it ensures that you [1297] know we don't miss anything and then [1299] what I've done here is I've essentially [1300] picked a very simple data model for the [1302] form that I'm going to be connecting in [1303] a minute and it's just going to ask [1305] three questions the first is it's going [1307] to ask what's the topic of the lead [1308] magnet you want to create what's a brief [1310] summary of the points you want made in [1311] the piece and then what's your company [1313] name obviously we're going to ask for [1315] their email and stuff because we need to [1316] connect it to an email sending module [1318] but these are like the three pieces of [1319] information that we're actually going to [1320] use inside of the template itself and [1323] then I trained it a little bit by adding [1325] some in context learning I add a bunch [1327] of user and assistant pairs in my case I [1329] did two which I think is sufficient for [1330] most use cases without also making it [1332] very expensive to run because it you [1334] have to keep an eye on token count and [1335] that sort of deal uh and essentially the [1338] topic was how to price for graphic [1339] designers the summary was well basically [1341] graphic designers aren't pricing high [1343] enough and it's nurtur and it's hurting [1344] them I want to talk about strategies for [1346] improving that you can imagine how Maybe [1348] it's like a digital marketing agency [1350] that's creating an offer specifically [1351] geared towards helping graphic designers [1353] grow their business this might be a lead [1355] magnet for that and then all I did was I [1357] filled in all of those variable um or [1360] Json keys that I showed you guys earlier [1362] and uh you know wrote a bunch of example [1364] content and that sort of deal and then I [1367] did the same thing again for another [1368] topic why Cold email Isn't Dead just [1371] thinking about um you know the sorts of [1372] topics that a digital marketing company [1374] would probably be um you know or its [1377] prospects probably be writing and then I [1380] filled in a bunch of stuff here same [1381] deal and then um all I'm doing now is [1384] I'm just providing it one final example [1385] so that I can personally test and verify [1387] the quality of the [1388] output so what I'm doing is I'm saying [1391] YouTube marketing is really effective [1392] pound-for-pound the money you spent on [1394] YouTube is anywhere for five to 15 times [1395] as effective as most other mediums [1396] companies should be using YouTube Not [1397] only Market their products but to Market [1398] their people and then my company name is [1400] 1 second copy now I'm not actually [1402] hooking this up to a form yet because [1403] again I want to test this um from the [1405] back to the front essentially now after [1407] we generate this you'll see that the [1409] result is um a bunch of Json and we [1412] can't actually access the Json in our [1413] Google Slides module so that's a problem [1415] what we need to do is we need to go and [1417] select Json and then go and grab parse [1420] Json and what this will do is you'll [1422] feed a giant Json or JavaScript object [1426] like this and then it will process it [1428] into a list of variables that you can [1430] access through the make variable [1432] selector you know how like when you [1433] click on something you have this little [1435] modal that pops up down here on the [1436] bottom right hand corner um I don't know [1438] if you you guys can see that specific [1439] thing so let me scroll up um we just [1442] currently can't access any of these [1443] variables without doing like rexes and [1445] parsing the hell out of it so um by [1447] parsing the Json um we'll just eliminate [1449] that and it'll be really really quick [1450] and easy um road map for us to do and [1455] what I'm doing here is I'm just removing [1456] a bunch of the unfortunate variables [1458] that [1459] I um did while testing a moment ago so [1463] oops that's not what I wanted to do [1469] got a couple more here and then I [1471] believe that's it yeah and what I'm [1473] going to do now is uh I'm just going to [1475] add a block [1476] here the reason why I'm doing this is [1478] because make can be a little bit finicky [1480] sometimes as I mentioned in my course [1482] it's a little bit rough on the edges and [1484] there are some instances in which you [1485] will try and run it just so you have [1488] access to the variables but if it's not [1490] connected you you won't actually be able [1492] to see them in the modal so this is me [1494] just sort of you know getting ahead of [1496] that what I'm going to do now is I'm [1497] going to run my example with my YouTube [1500] Pitch uh and then I'm going to parse the [1502] Json and then after parsing the Json [1504] we'll get a list of all the variables [1505] and then it'll just be able to map them [1507] one for one and add them to the Google [1508] Slides module that's the Hope anyway [1510] we'll see how it goes um but keep in [1513] mind we are generating quite a long [1514] string of text here I think it's like a [1517] th000 or two or maybe even 2 200 tokens [1520] and because of that it's going to take a [1521] little bit of time so just make sure [1522] you're not sending this like immediately [1524] to a prospect I would personally [1525] recommend you guys like if you're at the [1527] point where a prospect is filling out a [1529] form they're obviously interested in the [1530] product or service that you have to sell [1532] I would be willing to commit a large [1534] amount of time and money to that [1535] Prospect to make sure the experience [1537] they receive is incredible so I probably [1538] wouldn't even send them an AI lead [1540] magnet immediately I would probably send [1542] it to a salesperson that's on and just [1544] say hey quickly take a look at this [1545] before we send it if you have any [1547] additions you want to make then feel [1548] free but yeah you know if you think [1550] about the cost um let's say you run a [1553] campaign it's cold email or something if [1555] you run a campaign and a thousand people [1557] get back to you [1559] um and then only 10 of those people ask [1561] you for some type of like followup or [1563] whatnot maybe 100 people then that's [1565] still one in 10 meaning the value of [1568] somebody that ask you for the form or [1571] wants to generate a lead magnet is 10 [1572] times the value of the people that [1574] responded and then maybe the people that [1576] responded are like 100 times the value [1578] of just the people that you emailed and [1579] so at every step you know the amount of [1581] Leverage that you should be willing to [1582] invest in the amount of time and energy [1584] and resources you should uh be willing [1586] to essentially provide in order to close [1588] the client should naturally go up just [1590] makes sense [1592] right okay I think this is pretty good I [1594] feel like we're missing like one [1596] variable here I think um section five [1598] paragraph 6 [1600] honestly or section four paragraph 4 [1603] possibly I don't know but uh we'll see [1606] let's just remove this [1608] filter then let's just go through and [1610] map all of these so title subheading [1613] section one heading section two heading [1615] section three [1616] heading we'll do four four and then five [1620] we'll go Section one paragraph bullet [1622] one bullet [1623] two and then we'll go paragraph 1 [1626] paragraph 2 and then we'll go subheading [1628] 1 subheading 2 now we're into paragraph [1630] three so we'll go paragraph [1634] one [1636] to yeah I think we only generated two [1639] subheadings I don't know this is sort of [1641] all over the place simply because it [1642] takes into account the um y AIS and then [1645] it sees where all these variables are to [1648] like the pixel and then it just sorts [1649] them based off their vertical position [1652] for my understanding [1653] anyway so what do we do now section [1655] three subheading one section 3 [1657] subheading 2 section three paragraph 3 [1660] now section three subheading [1662] 3 section four paragraph one oh [1666] boy then we have subheading [1669] one which is here and then we have [1671] paragraph three subheading [1675] three paragraph two [1678] subheading [1680] two I'm going to have to double check [1682] this after make sure that I'm not making [1684] a complete ass of myself right now um [1687] but I think all these variables are [1688] right just off the top of my head [1691] section four paragraph 4 that looks [1693] empty I don't think we have a section 4 [1695] paragraph [1696] 4 yeah no we [1699] don't um we don't have a subheading [1701] either so we'll just move on to section [1703] five that that's okay that we don't have [1705] a subheading it's um not not a very big [1707] deal [1709] let's just call the section five and [1711] then we can just index all of these U so [1713] we did paragraph one we'll have to do [1715] subheading one now paragraph [1718] 3 subheading [1720] three paragraph [1723] 2 subing [1725] 2 paragraph 4 subing [1729] four paragraph 5 subheading five looks [1735] like we're missing paragraph six [1736] subheading six and then we're also [1737] missing [1738] um these two here um section 4 paragraph [1741] 4 section 4 sub adding 4 so what I'll do [1744] here is I'm just going to go 6. section [1746] 4 paragraph [1748] 4 paste that in and then I'll also do [1752] subheading [1753] 4 and what this is doing is uh this is [1756] just mapping those [1757] variables so even if the variables [1759] aren't currently accessible it allows us [1762] to access them because we're just using [1764] makes like built-in Syntax for the [1766] stuff this is going to be subheading [1770] six okay so every variable should now be [1773] filled in which is nice I click okay [1775] there verify that uh it's all in and [1778] then I'm just going to very quickly just [1780] double check why we didn't generate um [1783] what was it section five subheading six [1785] just want to make sure that I included [1788] this yeah okay so this wasn't in the [1790] instructions [1792] actually so we'll do [1796] six oh [1798] uh that's sort of [1800] annoying whatever oh I you know what I [1803] guess I have to change all of these [1805] numbers okay I'm just going to have ai [1809] remove all of the numbers [1812] here after I'm done [1815] um what was the other thing that I [1817] needed to take out I don't remember [1819] let's go back here and [1822] see uh for paragraph 4 okay let's just [1825] see if maybe I forgot for paragraph 4 [1829] no we got four paragraph 4 in [1832] here uh we got four subheading four so [1834] odd that it didn't generate probably [1836] because I'm using the cheaper model GPT [1838] for Turbo what I'm going to do here is [1840] I'm just going to go over to my own [1842] little chat GPT and then I'm just going [1844] to say remove the numbers and put this [1847] all on one [1848] line this is going to um help us remove [1851] a couple of tokens because I believe [1854] every new line is considered a new token [1856] and that's like what 40 tokens right [1857] there [1858] uh and then we're also not going to have [1860] to like rewrite all those numbers which [1861] is annoying [1865] so yeah I just pasted all these [1867] variables in there that should be [1868] good and then I'm just going to try [1871] doing this with the smarter model um [1874] gb24 turbo isn't as smart [1876] unfortunately and we're just going to [1878] see if maybe the equality is a little [1879] bit better and then yeah we have all the [1881] variables present so this should be good [1883] let's give it a go now I should mention [1886] that gp4 is even slow lower than gp4 [1888] turbo gp4 is like a generation before [1892] the turbo models um but I always find it [1894] funny because people people seem to [1896] think that you know the next Generations [1897] are always better at least when it comes [1898] to Ai and my response to that is no not [1901] really unfortunately if you think about [1903] it you know the the models require a [1907] massive amount of infrastructure in [1908] order to run successfully we're talking [1910] like data centers I mean at this point [1913] probably the size of small cities if you [1914] like take all the cloud compute and like [1916] stick it all in one big factor [1918] um and so open Ai and these other [1920] compute providers you know they're [1922] looking to minimize the demand on their [1925] software and so next Generations like [1927] every time they develop a new model they [1929] usually incentivize everybody to switch [1931] to it by making it really cheap and [1932] making it really fast making it so [1933] convenient but if you think about it [1935] from their perspective um what they do [1937] is they actually just dumb it down and [1938] they make them a little bit a little bit [1940] um it's almost like cranking their IQ [1942] down 5 10 or 15 points because then they [1945] become faster to run and then obviously [1947] it's cheaper for open Ai and they're not [1948] spending a trillion dollars on servers [1951] and all that stuff right any okay let's [1954] see what happened uh we just got a [1955] generation out here and I'm just reading [1958] through making sure that you know we [1959] have all the variables that we need I [1961] think we did um looks like we generated [1963] the Google slide we got the presentation [1966] ID over here so I'm just going [1969] to copy and paste this in like I did [1971] last time I'll show you why we had to do [1974] that in a [1975] second um this looks pretty good already [1979] honestly so this looks yeah pretty solid [1982] I mean you know we have like three lines [1983] here instead of sorry four lines here [1985] instead of three lines we could be a [1987] little bit more generous with the width [1989] of these sections um that would probably [1991] help eliminate that issue so I might be [1993] able to go back and then fix that we [1995] could also be more generous with how [1996] this is structured like um I think we [1998] might have a line here or something or [1999] this is pushed down for some reason so [2001] you can imagine how if you pushed like [2003] in the [2005] template um [2009] I don't know something like this maybe [2011] then even if it was longer or shorter it [2013] would still look [2014] good this looks [2016] good that looks good that looks good ah [2021] this looks [2022] unfortunate yeah same sort of um issue I [2026] would say we can eliminate this problem [2028] by just making this a little bit wider [2030] and then also in the training data we [2032] would have to make this um what is this [2036] section uh five [2038] heading or something like that we we'd [2040] have to make that a little bit shorter [2042] and then these titles are going to have [2043] to or these um uh what's the term [2046] subheadings are going to have to be a [2046] little bit shorter just because they [2047] seem to cut into things a bit so yeah [2050] that's okay when don't we go back here [2052] then and then just edit this to be a [2054] little bit more forgiving so let's move [2056] this up for one let's make this a little [2059] bit longer for two and then why don't we [2061] also just make this like 28 or something [2063] we'll make this a little bit smaller and [2065] then for these um what I'm going to do [2067] is I'm going to move this [2072] down uh actually I think I can probably [2074] select multiple and just move them all [2075] down at the same time oops [2080] nope we're going to go probably down to [2082] here I would say maybe a little bit [2084] higher there I'm going to select these [2089] and then move [2091] them [2094] up and then um [2098] I think one of the main problems with [2100] the way that this was [2103] before was that uh these [2106] headings tended to be going like they [2110] just all went over a little bit so it [2112] probably has less to do with the width [2113] and it has more to do which is with the [2114] training data so I'll edit that uh what [2116] other problems were there let's [2120] see yeah these look fine I think that [2123] this should probably be a little bit [2124] wider too uh there's no need for [2128] these sections to be as small I would [2132] say so let's just widen these maybe even [2135] a little bit [2136] more stick that over there oh you know [2139] what we should just widen everything [2140] what am I [2142] doing let's go back to here and then [2146] let's just select all of [2148] us widen didn't it maybe out to [2156] Here There you go [2159] should be a little bit better now keep [2161] in mind I'm not like a god tier designer [2163] but uh I like to think that I know my [2165] stuff at least a [2166] little and then I mentioned at the [2168] beginning how we were going to want to [2170] move this up a [2171] bit and then we're going to move this [2173] down a bit just to have a little bit of [2175] extra [2176] space all right I think that's [2177] everything I needs to been on the [2178] template side so I'm going to go back to [2179] the integration here and what I'm going [2180] to do is just for anything that's [2182] section um what was [2185] it four or section five I'm just going [2188] to decrease the length on average of the [2191] generated subheading [2194] titles so I'm going to go over here to [2197] section 4 [2201] subheading so I'll just say [2204] preparation I'll say [2207] presentation I'll say [2210] objections then I'll say seal the deal [2213] that'll probably be the longest [2215] one and then [2218] I'll say review [2220] pricing upskill SL [2223] update we'll say [2229] testimonials [2231] relationships we'll say Market [2234] changes then we'll say um long-termism I [2238] don't know it's probably a little better [2241] there and then I just have to do the [2243] same here on the other example because I [2245] I just wanted to know [2248] that for some reason they really [2250] want um short uh [2262] subheadings we'll say cost Effectiveness [2266] good then down here it'll be email Strat [2269] or content [2271] strategy say [2275] optimization testing SL [2278] iteration [2285] customize stay informed it's probably [2289] shorter right I think so just [2295] barely test [2297] fit okay good all right let's give this [2302] another run and let's see how it works [2304] now that we've taken a little bit of [2306] time and effort just to optimize a [2308] template um my expectation is it's going [2310] to perform better but uh you never [2313] know might still be a couple of issues [2315] like one thing that I always mention is [2317] that the flexibility of AI is both its [2318] greatest strength and its greatest [2319] weakness especially when you try and [2321] incorporate into a procedural flow like [2322] this we're trying to generate a product [2325] but we were constrained by the platform [2327] that we're using and so we have fixed [2329] like text width of boxes we have [2332] obviously only so much text that we can [2333] generate before it spills over the page [2334] and starts ruining the design makes it [2336] look unprofessional that sort of thing [2338] uh and it'd be really nice if we could [2339] just say you know generate 19 characters [2342] exactly but AI is a little too flexible [2345] so it'll read it but it's not really one [2347] competent enough to understand it and [2348] two even if it was you know some of the [2350] outputs have like a Randomness feature [2352] to it where you know if you even if it [2355] understood 19 sometimes it generate 21 [2357] sometimes it generate 17 and that sort [2359] of fuzziness is really like the main [2361] point of Leverage right it's why AI is [2363] uh capable of actually conversing with [2365] us in natural language now but but it's [2367] also a drawback when you're attempting [2369] to design High Roi systems like this and [2371] so you just need to be you need to be [2373] aware of that and you need to be able to [2374] work against it by giving yourself some [2376] tolerances just like uh I've [2380] done [2382] okay again that one's four lines but [2384] that's okay this looks much better so [2385] that was fixed this is fixed this is on [2388] three lines not as good but not bad [2391] that's on two still looking good okay [2395] looks a lot better um [2397] I would say all we have to do now is [2400] change all of the [2402] last um titles what's this uh this is [2407] heading five so we just have to change [2409] all of heading fives to make them [2410] shorter and then it looks like I moved [2412] some of these down a little bit too much [2414] because now there's that weird Gap in [2415] between but that's okay so we're going [2418] to remove my ugly [2420] gap make these go [2423] up that should be better as a whole and [2427] then going to make this go down a [2429] bit and then on my training sets I'm [2433] going to [2435] change the titles for Section Five [2439] heading we'll say profitability so I'm [2442] just going to do one word for all [2443] section five hings and hopefully that'll [2446] help we'll [2452] go crafting winning emails good [2461] we'll save that and give that one final [2464] Hail [2469] Mary kind of OCD but I I just don't like [2472] how that had that extra two lines there [2477] okay yeah should be good it makes sense [2479] because on every one of the examples [2480] section five heading was just a little [2482] bit too long so hopefully this will [2485] work um any you know these small changes [2488] here there they're to be expected and if [2491] you are following along what I recommend [2493] at the beginning so instead of just [2494] having one template maybe you make five [2496] and then you like attach a router to the [2498] end of this and then based on the [2499] presence of some variable you kind of [2501] like choose a different template um you [2504] know you you'll probably have to do a [2505] little bit more tweaking with every [2506] template to ensure that like the text [2507] generated for one works for the other [2509] and that sort of thing but uh all of [2511] that is you know in in due [2514] course you know I think if you were [2517] trying to sell this um as a service to [2520] somebody I think that it' be very clear [2522] that the product that you're going to be [2524] receiving at the end [2526] will just differ a little bit every [2530] time okay looks like I didn't actually [2532] move this down low enough but uh say [2536] V cool I mean you know we fix the [2538] heading [2539] there um and everything else looks [2542] good which is quite nice and then you'll [2546] also notice that uh we included the [2548] brand name at one second copy we believe [2551] in the power of YouTube not just for [2552] marketing products but also for [2553] showcasing your team blah blah blah blah [2555] uh you know feel free to pause the video [2556] and give this a quick read but uh you [2558] know if we go to slideshow mode here and [2560] then um this template includes buttons [2562] so you can give this a click basically [2564] to like animate and that sort of thing [2566] uh you'll see this is pretty high [2567] quality of a slide deck and you know a [2568] template that we're providing get [2570] started today and then you open up left [2572] click all right awesome so now that we [2574] built out the functionality what do we [2575] do from here um obviously I'm going to [2576] build out the type form so I'll do two [2579] things I'll do type form for one I'll [2581] say watch responses instant acid that'll [2583] be the new [2584] beginning and then this will be the [2586] email module at the end and I'm just [2588] going to send this email to the [2592] prospect I'm going to do my fancy [2594] twostep type form flow [2597] here because I want to be able to [2601] maintain this flow later on so I'm going [2605] to first generate the response and then [2606] I'm going to list it and then I'm going [2608] to pull all the variables from the list [2610] module [2612] here so I'm going to go to type form and [2615] then I believe the account that I'm [2617] using for this oh jeez I don't actually [2620] remember might be mine I don't know [2623] we'll find out uh soon [2628] enough that looks [2630] good okay so I'm going to create a new [2633] form we're just going to call this our [2635] lead magnet generator [2640] quick and [2643] easy and then there are three questions [2646] what's the topic of your lead magnet [2649] what do you want the topic of your lead [2651] magnet to be let's do that we're really [2655] curious we're not that curious uh we're [2658] going to do long text for all of these [2660] and then I'm just going to duplicate and [2661] then [2663] duplicate provide a brief summary of The [2666] Point point you wish made in your [2671] piece then I'll say what's your actually [2674] no we can do this with um a contact [2677] field module so we'll go contact info [2681] here then we're not going to ask for the [2683] last name we're not going to ask for the [2685] phone number we're just going to ask for [2690] this and let's do this at the [2695] end we'll say what's the best email to [2699] send your finished lead magnet [2702] to that looks nice and then because I a [2707] big for um black sexy star [2711] backgrounds I'm going to do this let's [2714] actually delete this last screen here [2716] I've always disliked [2719] these um oh there's one other thing that [2721] I'll do here just for completeness sake [2723] I'm going to make all of these fields [2725] required that's always a good idea [2728] so uh required required required they're [2730] going to have to provide us a company [2731] even if it's their name looks [2734] good okay got my form now popping it [2737] open right [2738] here and then what I'm going to do is [2741] I'll go and select this I'll say lead [2743] magnet generator example build example [2746] build is just how I tell myself what is [2749] um for YouTube and what's for my actual [2752] work got an okay there and then we're [2754] going to go list the responses here on [2756] the back end so I'm going to go grab the [2758] left click type form and then the form [2759] ID is going to be the same as the other [2762] one lead magnet [2764] generator wonderful we're only going to [2766] grab [2770] one we're going to scroll all the way [2772] down here and then what we're going to [2774] do is just fill in these variables the [2776] topic is going to be what do you want [2778] the topic of your lead magnet to [2780] be um let's actually just copy all of [2784] this so I have it after that way I don't [2786] have to refill like I don't actually [2787] have to think when I fill out the form [2788] later I'm just going to use the same [2790] example and then the summary is going to [2793] be provide a brief summary or finished [2794] piece and then the company name is going [2796] to be over [2798] here oh actually we can't get the [2800] company name [2802] yet that's annoying we need to fill out [2805] the form First [2807] Once [2809] okay I'm going to set up a filter and [2813] I'll say block and I'll do xals y same [2817] thing as last time and then I'm going to [2820] run this actually going to fill out this [2823] form um and I'm just going to use [2826] everything [2827] here we'll say YouTube marketing is [2829] really [2831] effective summary pound for pound [2833] YouTube is anywhere as 5 to 10 times [2835] effective as effective [2838] lovely and then um Nick send it to my [2843] email here and then my company name is [2845] one second copy [2848] they are selling themselves on the back [2850] of my work that's annoying and it looks [2853] like there's some issue here cannot [2853] initialize the scenario because the [2855] reason cannot read properties of [2856] undefined reading account oh well that [2858] sucks um I don't think I've I'm not [2861] sending this to anybody so yeah that [2864] makes sense um I guess we'll just have [2866] to unlink this then and I've already [2868] filled out this form so we'll just use [2870] this verify that this was indeed [2872] gotten cool we got the variables let's [2874] see if we can access them now [2877] sometimes we can sometimes we can't okay [2879] great we can uh company name is just [2882] this one right here one second copy and [2884] then the email that we're going to be [2885] using that we're going to be sending [2886] this to uh let me try relinking this [2889] sometimes that makes it work no so you [2892] see how over here if we go back to the [2894] GPT module uh we can access it from here [2897] but we can't access from there that's [2898] because there was an issue on the module [2899] when we ran it um namely there was just [2901] nobody in the two field and if you're [2903] trying to run an email module like a [2905] send email module without anybody in the [2906] field it'll just cancel out on you but [2908] because of that um the data I guess just [2910] never had a chance to reach the the end [2912] of this flow and so we can't access it [2916] there but we can access it here so what [2917] I'm going to do is I want the email so [2918] I'm just going to select it here I'm [2920] going to copy it I'm going to go over [2922] here and then I'll paste it in and [2924] you'll see that it's white again but [2925] that's just because um this module does [2928] not have access to that yet we'll say [2933] um the title [2937] um I guess we should do first name too [2941] yeah let's do first name so I'm going to [2943] grab their first name and I'm going to [2944] say hey first name your lead magnet is [2950] here so we'll go your lead magnet is [2955] ready then we'll say hi blank and then [2959] I'm going to use brbr those are email [2960] tags that um just add a couple of new [2962] lines then I'll say your lead magnet [2968] titled and then I'm going to to grab the [2972] oh never mind I have the title [2977] here and then I'm going to say thanks um [2980] I don't know let's just pretend it's my [2981] company left click that's providing [2983] it that looks nice uh and there's one [2986] more thing that we have to do that I'm [2987] just realizing now like we need to [2989] actually send them the lead magnet what [2991] I've been doing so far is sort of hacky [2992] I've been grabbing the document ID of [2994] the generated lead magnets directly from [2996] the Google module I'm not going to do [2997] that anymore I'm going to go over [3000] to um Google Drive cuz you have to use [3004] Google Drive for this and then I'm going [3005] to go create a share link get a share [3007] link for a file or folder it's sort of [3009] annoying that you have to two-step it [3010] like this but just part of um working [3013] with this and then what you do is uh [3014] when it asks for file ID just feed in [3016] the presentation ID like if you're using [3018] Google Sheets for this it's going to ask [3020] for the sheet ID I believe using Google [3022] doc it's going to be like the doc ID uh [3024] but none of that stuff matters just use [3026] the um whatever the thing is that [3028] preface is the word ID is [3032] sufficient I'm G to say find it here and [3034] then I'm going to go and add myself just [3036] a little bit of HTML here you don't need [3037] to be in HTML Pro for this uh we're just [3040] going to be using share link stick that [3042] in the ahr that's just like a clickable [3044] link in the [3046] email all right looks good we're going [3049] to remove this [3050] block and um you know I'm just going to [3052] use the the pre created uh response here [3056] as opposed to to like watch the response [3057] back there we're just going to give this [3059] a run see whether or not this works as a [3063] test my intuition is that everything [3065] should be pretty hunky D at this point [3067] um we're using a smarter model you know [3069] it's generated all of the headings [3071] pretty reasonably we uh have not [3073] generated the share link which was an [3075] issue we have the email address even [3077] though it's inaccessible in the email [3078] module because we screwed up the very [3079] first time with the um the two field [3082] should be fine now because we copied [3083] over the same [3085] um the same variable ID and all that [3088] stuff from the modules where it was [3090] accessible yeah I'm looking forward to [3092] getting a nice beautiful custom [3094] generated lead magnet in my inbox as a [3097] as a fellow digital marketing company [3099] these are quite [3105] valuable think my screen is changing [3107] colors here because I have a um like an [3110] automation setup to change my screen [3112] color at 618 [3114] p.m. so if things get very red all of a [3117] sudden that's why I normally counteract [3118] that by recording a little bit [3120] later okay this looks good we gener the [3122] Shar okay we got the email so why don't [3124] I jump in and see my email address [3126] here nice that looks pretty sexy um I [3129] like how it's down here too however the [3132] fact that there's like a title here is [3135] kind of weird okay yeah no that looks [3137] good oh wonderful how beautiful I can [3140] even click through it right here oh look [3142] at those Auto oh man that's gorgeous [3148] oh [3149] man how could we the paragraphs are just [3153] a little bit too long tskk Tusk but man [3157] how cool was everything else with those [3160] little animations coming down o it's got [3163] to be the sexiest thing I've ever seen [3164] imagine sending that to somebody um you [3166] know like less than 5 minutes after they [3168] request it would be absolutely [3172] incredible okay uh I'm not going to go [3174] through and then re-edit the titles and [3176] reedit the training and stuff like that [3177] I think it's clear at this point that [3178] you can tweak it um a fair amount but [3181] obviously there are marginal and [3182] diminishing returns after a while uh [3183] what I would do if I were you at this [3185] point um is you know take the blueprint [3187] that I'm going to be providing you and [3188] then just copy all of the paragraphs and [3191] then just make them a little bit shorter [3192] maybe like 10 or 15% shorter and then [3194] the model will just pick up on that and [3197] um you know it'll sort of like latently [3199] write shorter paragraphs from there on [3200] out I would also space these out just a [3202] little bit more just in case they're two [3204] lines like there are here maybe I don't [3207] know the monitor analytics yeah maybe [3209] the second line here you just go like 30 [3211] or 40 pixels um down so just in case [3215] even if there is a paragraph that's a [3216] little bit longer then that's okay it [3217] doesn't really matter but yeah I think [3220] that um at you know the end of it this [3221] is quite quite attractive and uh you [3224] know you can make this as long or as [3225] comprehensive as you want totally up to [3227] you what I'm going to do here is I'm [3229] going to save this U blueprint and then [3231] I'll make this accessible to everybody [3233] that's watched this video and that might [3234] want to create something like this for [3236] themselves uh keep in mind you are going [3237] to need you know a type form that you're [3238] going to have to connect to going to [3239] need your own gp4 credentials obviously [3242] um and then you're going to need your [3243] own Google Slides template but I had a [3246] lot of fun building it and I'm sure you [3247] will [3248] too awesome thanks so much for watching [3250] everybody hope you guys enjoyed if you [3252] have any questions about the build that [3253] I did specifically in this video feel [3254] free to reach out leave me a comment [3256] down below and I will uh answer them I'm [3258] getting a lot better at keeping up to [3259] date on the comments the flood that I've [3261] been receiving recently uh if you guys [3264] want any videos on topics similar to [3267] this then please let me know down below [3269] I've been sourcing common ideas directly [3271] from my viewers over the course of the [3273] last couple weeks and it's actually [3274] really help me because um you know one I [3276] get to sort of have my finger on the [3278] pulse of what you guys enjoy building [3280] and the sorts of things that are [3281] relevant in the community today um but [3283] two you know I also get to interact [3285] directly with the people that I think [3286] have also been rewarding me in many ways [3288] both in terms of AD revenue and just [3290] putting a fat smile on my face every [3292] time I see one of your amazing comments [3293] so if you guys have been wondering on [3295] how to build system X or system why just [3296] drop that comment down below and there's [3298] a pretty reasonable chance that I'll [3299] build your system sometime in the next [3300] month or so anyway do all that fun [3302] YouTube stuff like subscribe what am I [3304] missing send me gold bars to my address [3307] uh and I will catch you on the next [3309] video thanks so much bye-bye

Title: Watch Me Build A Personal Productivity Newsletter Summarizer
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here and [1] in this video I'm going to build a [3] system that was requested by one of my [5] viewers I made a post about a week and a [7] half ago and I essentially sourced a [8] bunch of video ideas this is one of them [11] we're going to be taking daily [12] newsletters that come into our inbox and [14] then we're going to be summarizing them [16] and then converting them into basically [17] an MP3 using open ai's new text speech [20] function uh and then we're just going to [22] be listening to that every day as [24] opposed to scrolling through miles and [25] miles of pointless newsletter garbage so [29] if that sounds like something good [30] interested in stay tuned and let's get [31] into [34] it okay so first things first this video [37] was requested by the lovely uh fuk 4477 [41] he wanted an automation that summarizes [42] all of our daily newsletters and [43] converts them into audio to allow you to [45] listen to all your newsletters in one go [47] every day I thought that it was a really [48] cool idea um I would never personally [50] use this for myself I don't know if I'd [52] be able to sell this to people to be [53] honest because it seems like more of a [54] personal productivity hack than [56] something like B2B something that has [57] pronounced Revenue benefits but I just [60] figured you know while I was going [61] through the requests might as well do a [62] video like this maybe you guys just want [64] a cool little portfolio piece or uh [67] something you guys can just use to learn [68] a little bit more about how make.com [70] works okay but obviously in order to [71] make the system work we're going to need [72] some email addresses so what I have over [74] here is I just have a few email [75] addresses sorry a few newsletters that I [78] forwarded from uh another inbox that [80] actually receives newsletters I've [82] basically like unsubscribed from the [84] vast vast majority of newsletters that I [86] was previously subscribed to and so what [88] I'm going to do here just in lie of like [90] actually having some type of daily [91] newsletter is I'm just going to um add a [93] label to all of these and I'm just going [95] to label it something like [97] newsletter and this is just going to be [99] my own search term um if you guys get [101] newsletters every single day for [102] instance you can either manually add [104] them to the search term that I'm about [105] to show you um maybe you know that [107] you're always getting a beehive [108] newsletter from Peter Watson who you [110] know writes about I don't know B2B sass [113] um or you could also procedurally search [115] for the term newsletter uh you could [118] also have ai um try and like find [120] newsletters in your mailbox um this [122] would be a lot more token intensive and [123] a fair amount of work but something that [125] you could do uh but I'm going to keep it [126] simple and I'm just going to say hey [128] anything with a label newsletter is [129] going to be part of our automation for [131] the day so that's where I'm at the [133] really cool part about the system is you [135] don't just have the ability to apply to [137] newsletters you could use a system like [139] this to theoretically you know if you [140] wanted to create like a personal [141] productivity system summarize every [143] single um email that you've received in [146] I don't know the last like 24 hours or [148] something so whether it's from a friend [150] or a family member or a business or [152] whatever uh you can actually have the [153] system go through and then be like hey [155] you know yesterday Peter asked you what [156] you were doing on Wednesday night you [158] know Sally wants to talk a little bit [159] about I don't know Jerry or something [162] like that right like you have a lot of [163] options here and that's one of the [165] really cool Parts about using AI That's [167] as flexible as this so that's what I [170] have over here uh on the left tab here I [172] have a scenario that I created called [173] newsletter to MP3 very straightforward [175] um essentially let me delete all these [177] so we can just start from scratch [178] together I'm clicking this plus [181] button and then you know I'm thinking [183] about it in my head the first thing that [184] I want to verify that works is sort of [187] like the the last thing that we'd [189] actually use in the scenario and this is [190] a very um useful pattern to use when [195] designing systems you know start at the [197] end and then work your way back to the [198] beginning because usually what's going [199] on at the end is more important than [200] what's going on at the beginning uh and [202] if you verify that that works you can [203] usually save yourself a fair amount of [204] time so when I say the end what do I [208] mean well like if you think about we're [209] going to do a bunch of stuff to [210] newsletters we're going to get a bunch [211] of data and at the end we're going to [213] need to turn it into speech right [214] because that was part of the scope um [216] that was provided by the levely fuk 4477 [219] so if we want that to work then we're [221] going to need like a transcription or [223] like a text to speech sort of tool now [226] luckily for US Open AI has this built in [228] and this is a reasonably new endpoint [230] that they've added um probably in the [232] last like four or five months ago called [233] generate an audio it's actually built [235] directly into make.com now which is nice [237] previously you had to do it via API call [239] but all need to do is just go down to [240] generate an [242] audio and then you'll see I already have [244] my connection set up and stuff like that [246] uh if you don't you know you have to go [248] through and add your organization key [249] you'll have to add your API key you can [251] click the online help for that but [252] there's simply two Fields there's an [254] input field and then there's a model [256] field so what I'm going to do is I'm [258] just going to [259] say hey my name is Nick and it's nice to [262] meet you and I'm going to send this over [265] to our Texas speech service and there [267] are a variety of different models you [268] could use but they B basically differ in [271] how long it would take to generate the [273] audio uh and so essentially you know [275] tts-1 I think is the fastest one tts-1 [279] d106 uh I don't know if this is faster I [282] think this might be a little bit slower [284] tts1 HD is a like high definition so [286] you'll get higher quality audio and then [287] TTS 1-hd d106 is like I believe the 11 [291] stands for November and then I think it [292] was like developed on November the six [294] or something so not going to worry too [296] much about that if you go down to show [297] advance settings you have a bunch of [298] options here and you can actually select [299] like the voice that you want um you can [302] you know select alloy or echo or fable [305] right they've added all of these names [306] to different voices I personally like [308] the one called Onyx uh just sounds like [309] a pretty cool dude and then you can [312] output it in whatever format you want so [314] MP3 Opus a [316] FLC um and then you know you can also [318] Define the speed so I'm just going to [319] keep this as default because my whole [321] idea here is just to test this as [322] quickly as possible and then I'm just [324] going to run this [325] puppy so it's taken in my text and then [328] you see it's already generated a result [330] now if you try and do this on your end [331] what you'll see is you'll quickly [333] realize that you know the only output is [335] binary and so it's not really something [337] that we can just like put our ears up to [338] our speaker and then listen to doesn't [340] really make any sense or mean anything [341] to us so essentially what we have to do [343] is we have to for the purposes of [345] testing convert this into a format um [348] that you know is is audible to the human [349] ear and not just a bunch of weird [351] hexadecimal binary data so what I'm [353] going to do in order to get that done is [355] I'll go over to Google Drive and then if [357] you guys watched my previous video I [359] used a a module called download a file [362] this time we're going to use a module [363] called upload a file so it's just the [364] exact opposite of that and essentially [366] what we need to do is we just need to [367] turn this into something that we can [369] access on the internet outside of [371] make.com because right now in make.com [373] it's just like this big binary file it [374] doesn't really mean anything to us what [376] we're going to do is we're going to take [377] this we're then going to upload it onto [379] a Google drive as an MP3 and then I'm [381] just going to play the MP3 so that I can [382] actually hear it so um I'm going to drag [385] and drop this Google Drive upload a file [387] module and then the folder ID that it'll [389] I'll just do like a backslash I'm just [390] going to do my um this just stands for [392] like your root and then you'll see that [394] it actually automatically mapped the [396] file open AI chat gbt this previous [399] module here and a make does this because [400] a lot of people get very intimidated by [403] binary so if we were just to run this at [405] this point it would upload a file but [407] then the um end result would be [409] inaccessible uh and this is just sort of [411] a quirk of make.com that you have to [412] know when you do these upload a file [414] things um the the end result is [416] inaccessible unless you explicitly add [418] another module called get a share link [420] after the upload a file module so in [422] order to make this work basically I'm [424] just going to feed in the file ID that I [425] have from the previous module here and [428] then the role just for the purposes of [429] this I'm just going to go um type anyone [433] and then the role let's just do [436] owner actually let's just do reader okay [439] and then I'm going to set allow file [441] Discovery to know I believe this means [442] that like it would actually be indexed [444] on Google or something like that which [445] is to be fair pretty crazy I don't want [447] my files to be indexed on Google I don't [449] really I know anybody who would any who [451] uh so yeah that's that I'm going to [453] click okay and everything here should be [455] mapped properly so I'm going to click [456] run once and see what [461] happens looks pretty good awesome and [463] the end result is I have a share link [464] here that I can copy and then open up in [467] a new [468] tab you see I have this open ai- TTS [472] output. MP3 and then I believe I have my [474] audio hooked up so you should be able to [475] hear this if not I'll figure this out in [477] post hey my name is Nick and it's nice [480] to meet you that's pretty good if you [482] can imagine a longer form um you know [486] podcast style or I don't know I guess in [488] our case it's like a story where it [489] reads your newsletters in the morning uh [491] that's pretty good yeah pretty solid I [493] think that that would do quite well so [494] I'm going to stick with the onx voice [496] and then let's get to work building out [497] the rest of this so just off the top of [499] my head I mean I haven't spent more than [501] 30 seconds scoping this but back when I [503] was um clicking this generate an audio [504] module I noticed that it said must be [506] between 1 and 4,096 characters long uh [509] so I have a feeling this is probably [511] going to result in some issues for us so [513] I'm going to go command C and then paste [517] I'm sorry um I'm just going to get like [520] a rough estimate of the number of words [521] that is by going to characters to words [523] calculator apparently and it looks like [526] we can feed in at once about 630 to 819 [531] words I'm thinking that if we were to [533] summarize like three or four [536] newsletters um where was my inbox here [539] if I were to try and summarize like [541] three or four newsletters that would [543] probably work um we'd probably be able [545] to summarize like one newsletter and [547] like 100 words or whatever despite how [548] long it is maybe more um but if we were [552] to do like an infinite number of [554] newsletters we would need a system that [556] would accommodate that and what I mean [558] by accommodate that is if if you can [559] only feed in 4,096 characters per GPT [563] API call then what we should probably do [565] is we should come up with a system that [567] chunks that uh the text into 496 [571] character chunks or maybe not 496 [574] characters but we have to go up until [576] like the last word [577] basically and then [581] um then we should run it a bunch of [584] times and then we should [587] aggregate those files and then find a [589] way to stitch them together so this is [591] actually going to be pretty exciting now [592] that I think about it because I don't [593] think I've done something like um [594] stitching MP3 files together um so it's [597] yeah it's actually going be quite [598] exciting I'm happy that I uh chose this [600] request now okay so anyway um I'll deal [603] with that specific aspect of things in a [605] second for now I'm just going to hook up [606] the email and make sure that works I'm [607] going to go to email built-in and then [610] I'm just going to do get emails so [612] return emails that match the specified [614] criteria and I'm just going to make sure [616] this hooked up to my inbox and [618] then I think I want let's see like a [622] label or something so I'm going to go [626] newsletter for now and then the max [629] number results I'm going to do [630] four I'm not going to do any subject not [633] before after criteria um I guess I'll [636] just do all emails and then maybe folder [639] is where I can select the label I don't [640] know let's [642] see okay let me do newsletter oh yeah [645] Okay cool so I can actually just select [646] my newsletters um automatically um now [649] you know let's think about it if you [650] guys wanted to develop this for yourself [652] or maybe your own system um as I [654] mentioned earlier when I said like you'd [656] be coming up with a search term if you [657] guys wanted to just like add all of the [659] emails that have the term newsletter in [661] them into our pool to be processed you [663] would just go down here to phrase and [665] you would type the word newsletter just [666] like I did so this would process only [668] emails containing a specified character [670] string anywhere which means in the [671] subject in the body and like the email [673] footer from a guy called newsletter you [675] know there's a lot of options there and [676] maybe it'll be a little bit too many but [678] um that would work quite quickly as as a [680] rough estimate um and then maybe you [682] want it from a specific person or [683] something like that you could use [685] subject um for that or maybe you know [688] you know that it's from um um a specific [691] recipient email address or something [692] that sends you a bunch of newsletters a [694] day or I mean there are like a million [696] one different ways to do this just off [697] the top of my head you could like have [699] an email address called newsletter at [701] whatever your domain is and then any [703] newsletters that go there you forward it [705] or something like that to you and then [706] you could set your recipient email [707] address here um that might be one way to [709] organize it you could use mail hooks so [710] instead of using the get email module [712] what you do is in Gmail you would set up [714] a um filter rule that says anything with [717] the term newsletter or anything from all [719] of these people get sent to a mail hook [722] and then in make what you do is you'd [724] set up a mail hook [726] using this here and a mail Hook is just [730] an email address that you can send [731] emails to that'll basically trigger a [733] make.com flow so you'll have to go and [734] like create it and do all that stuff but [736] anyway that's not the purpose of the [738] video so I'm not getting too caught up [739] in that um we just want to verify that [741] this get emails modu works so yeah let [743] me just double check make sure [744] everything's good here um I'm not going [745] to filter by emails not going to filter [747] from from or before dat not going to [748] filter by subject phrase or email ID and [750] then because I have four emails in that [752] label I'm also just going to return a [753] maximum number of [755] four so it's running it's getting my [759] emails okay great and then awesome we we [762] got everything that I wanted I imagine [764] because we got four results and then the [765] first is Nick example newsletter so [767] that's this one here uh Nexus SAS [769] beginner friends of fsp and how to index [771] sneaky back [773] links yeah great so awesome let's run [775] through and see what sort of data that [777] we get just verify that we have [778] everything that we need [780] there's first text content and then [782] there's also HTML content and HTML [787] content is way longer than the text [788] content part of me thinks that what's [790] happening under the hood is whatever [792] system they're using to get the emails [793] is just taking the HTML content and then [795] it's just stripping the HTML from it and [798] then it's creating a new variable called [799] text content so assuming that text [801] content doesn't have any major [802] differences um this should be sufficient [804] for us to feed into AI now let me see [807] what the sort of length that we're [808] dealing with here this is not that [811] long but I imagine if we were to try and [813] summarize this I don't know if we'd be [815] able to do in like 100 words but any who [818] let let's give it a try and let's see [819] what happens so I'm going to get these [821] emails and then what I'm going to do [823] is I'm going [826] to um for every one I'm going to create [830] a [831] completion and because this is [833] outputting multiple bundles as you see [834] it say bundle one bundle two bundle [836] three bundle four um that means that [838] every module after the module that [841] outputs multiple bundles will run [843] however many times there are bundles so [846] that means that if I put an open AI [848] module here it will run four times one [850] for every bundle and I'll show you what [851] that looks like in a second but for now [853] what I'm going to do is I'm going to [855] create a chat completion I'm going to [857] choose gp4 turbo just for the purpose of [859] this demonstration I'm going to say you [861] are a helpful intelligent writing [864] assistant and then I'm going to call it [866] um or I'm going to tell it your job is [869] to summarize [871] email [873] newsletters um [877] preserve [880] details and all of the main [884] points let's do main SL important points [887] use Spartan casual language let's do [892] that and then what I just realized is I [894] should probably summarize something as [896] an [897] example actually no let's just just see [899] how it goes on actual live data okay I'm [901] going to go down to text content just [903] paste that in [912] here let's say right as if you [915] assistant we're [917] counting the daily emails to your boss [920] that's basically what we're trying to [922] have it do um I'm not going to set a Max [924] token limit I'm just going to see oh I [926] guess I have to set a Max token limit I [927] lied um I'm going to say I don't know [931] 500 600 uh the temperature I'm going to [933] set lower I always like to set the [934] temperature on 0.7 or 0.6 I may be wrong [937] here but um I just yeah I just like the [939] way that that [941] feels and then so that I'm not just [943] wasting tokens I'm only going to [944] generate two examples I'm not going to [946] do one because I want to show you guys [947] the multiple bundle feature um but I [949] don't want to do four because then it [950] would just take you know an extra five [952] or 10 or 15 seconds or something like [954] that so it's got our email you'll see [956] that it's still running despite already [958] getting one email and the reason why is [960] because it's multiple bundles right so [962] even though we got one result here um [964] over here on all of the subsequent [966] modules we're going to have two results [968] and so that's that's why we see that [969] pattern there with one and two I'm going [971] to go down to result and then I'm going [973] to say hey just finished going through [974] Nix Ras latest newsletter here's the [977] lowdown oh I got a sneeze coming [980] on no I'm not going to sneeze I'm strong [985] uh Nick points out a common issue where [986] staff waste a lot of time 70% of their [988] day okay okay this is pretty reasonable [991] I'm not going to lie [995] um let let's see the other [997] one I'm going to go down to operation [999] two and then go [1004] result yeah okay this is um sort of all [1007] over the place so I think that we should [1009] probably do a little bit of example [1012] summarization first so what I'll do is [1015] I'm going to go and grab my blog post [1018] just one of the short [1022] ones huh short ones that's funny then [1025] I'm going to copy it all text [1027] wise this is weird I don't know why I [1030] can't copy this um I'm going to create [1033] create an example [1035] basically so I'm going to drag this one [1038] down to the [1040] bottom and then this is going to be user [1042] I'm going to paste this whole blog post [1045] in it's pretty long right [1049] and then I'm going to add another one [1051] actually got to drag this one more time [1052] down to the bottom and then um I want [1055] this to be my assistant now basically [1056] telling me the summarized version of [1058] this article and then just for the [1060] purpos of the video I'm just going to [1062] cut here and then I'll um you know fill [1064] it in with the the summarized version [1066] otherwise it probably take like an extra [1067] 15 or 20 minutes of just writing okay [1069] great um I just gave it a quick example [1071] of the sort of thing that I wanted to [1073] write you know so with like tone of [1074] voice and that sort of thing so I think [1075] this will do a substantially better job [1077] now let's click run once and then give [1079] it a go you know a lot of the time you [1081] have to massage these systems if you [1082] want the prompting to work well um just [1085] an inevitability right you have to train [1087] it a little [1088] bit training isn't really the right term [1091] to be using here but uh I believe [1095] it's probably as close as you can get [1099] to [1101] um like the closest and simplest way to [1103] represent kind of what's going on under [1105] the hood here so I'm just going to leave [1107] it at that [1109] okay great this looks pretty well [1113] formatted and then oh sorry I hasn't [1117] actually finished outputting yet [1119] so yeah great this looks substantially [1122] better to me okay that was kind of [1123] annoying but my camera just turned off [1125] um so where we are right now is we've [1128] essentially generated a bunch of [1129] summaries of um the various emails in [1134] the newsletter label on my inbox and the [1137] question is you know how do we convert [1139] this like if I already to just run this [1140] one more time because I think it's been [1142] like half an hour since last time I ran [1143] it so let's actually be able to consult [1145] some primary data here me think about it [1147] what we have now is we have you know one [1148] pass through gp4 where we basically [1151] changed the email and we've summarized [1153] it a ton and we've removed a lot of the [1155] fluff um but you know it's not really in [1158] a format that would sound good if you [1160] know a robot voice started reading it [1162] out there'd be too many pauses probably [1164] there are you know a bunch of these like [1166] numbers with stars and that sort of [1168] thing so the next step is to take this [1170] list of summaries and then to [1171] consolidate it further uh and then also [1173] sort of wrap it in like nice [1175] storytelling sort of cadence and and [1176] that sort of deal so that's what I'm [1178] going to do next and I've actually [1179] created a module here just um while my [1181] camera wasn't working um that basically [1184] does this and it's a very similar flow [1185] to previously where we're creating a [1187] completion with GPT 4.5 I think or GPT 4 [1190] Turbo rather and then we're basically [1193] feeding in this stuff which is you know [1195] that [1196] summary into this module [1199] and this module says you're a helpful [1200] intelligent writing assistant it says [1202] below is a list of email newsletter [1203] summaries consolidate these summaries as [1205] if you were recounting them to your boss [1207] and that's sort of like the idea here [1209] right we want it to sound like it would [1210] sound like if you know assistant was [1212] recounting the the various goings on in [1215] the day to their boss and that's yeah [1216] that's more or less what we're doing so [1219] um that's what I've done here [1222] and so that's what I've done here and uh [1225] I'm just connecting both sides of the [1226] flow now sticking them together and then [1229] I've also created an email module just [1231] the very far end and this is just meant [1233] to deliver the summary to me there are [1236] like probably 15 different ways you [1237] could do so uh you could do so directly [1239] through make so you could have like make [1240] on your phone and then you could send a [1242] result to mobile and actually like open [1244] it on your phone every morning at a [1245] certain time or you could just email [1247] yourself uh you could use like the [1248] twillo API to send yourself a text [1250] message I guess the point of that I'm [1252] making is like the delivery is not [1253] really the the sauce here obviously the [1255] sauce here is the stuff that we're doing [1257] before that um by just passing it [1258] through a bunch of AI [1260] modules um probably the last thing that [1262] we need to do is you know we just do it [1263] every day at I don't know let's say like [1266] 6:00 a.m. in the [1267] morning and then we send the email [1270] probably a couple of minutes after that [1271] so maybe every day you'll get it at like [1273] I don't know [1274] 602 and just being cognizant of that [1277] let's just make it like 558 or something [1279] instead that'll be [1281] nice um for the purpose of demo I'm just [1283] going to leave four maximum results and [1287] then uh let me just make sure everything [1289] else is working here I got my training [1293] example here I got the training output [1295] there I got the max tokens temperature [1297] okay that looks good we're now creating [1299] a completion here um that looks good [1301] with the temperature nice and then we're [1303] generating an audio okay and then here [1305] is um yeah this is where I was using [1307] actual test data but I don't want to use [1309] test data I want to use real data and [1312] then we're uploading to Google Drive [1314] we're getting a share link and we're [1315] sending the email okay great so I'm just [1317] going to give this a run with the four [1318] emails that I had previously and then [1321] I'm going to open up my email address [1322] and hopefully get um a brand spanking [1324] new beautiful looking email with my text [1327] sum or audio summary uh that I can then [1330] listen to while I'm on the go drinking [1332] my cup of joe in my [1336] automobile I don't know man I'm not cut [1338] out for [1340] rap um yeah so it's going to [1344] run oh you know what I I just realized [1346] this is not going to work and why won't [1349] it work because we need to aggregate all [1352] the text yeah see how um it's just [1355] running once for every module um [1359] basically this is outputed four bundles [1360] right and so um this is just using the [1363] first modules output the first modules [1365] output first modules or sorry first [1367] bundles output for every single one of [1368] these so that was kind of silly my bad [1370] what I'm going to do is I'm going to add [1372] a variable in [1374] here and I'm going to call it um [1379] let's just do like aggregated text [1381] actually no I'm not going to do that [1383] what I'll do is I'll specifically use [1384] the text aggregator so we scroll down [1386] here there's a text aggregator function [1388] looks like this and then um The Source [1391] module is going to always just be the uh [1393] module that generates those bundles so [1396] the multiple bundle generator in this [1397] case was the get emails module and then [1399] the text that I'm going to do is I'm [1401] just going to feed the result in and [1403] then I'm going to go new line new line [1405] uh then I'll just do three hyphens [1407] that's probably the simplest and that'll [1409] that'll give us a bunch of text and then [1411] the output will feed into here instead [1415] of what I had previously that's nice and [1417] then I'll Auto align it then I think I [1420] had an extra send an email module for [1421] some reason okay so that was the problem [1424] excellent so now we should basically be [1428] getting all the emails uh we're going to [1429] generate multiple bundles for those and [1431] then what'll happen is this will run [1432] every single time times the number of [1434] bundles so if there are four bundles [1435] here this will run four times what this [1437] will do then is it'll generate four [1440] individual bundles which this text [1441] aggregator will just squish into one and [1444] then every module from the end of this [1446] dark uh dark out gray sort of section is [1450] just going to proceed to running to run [1452] once again uh and in that way we [1454] basically get to get the concatenated [1456] form of all of those summaries that [1457] we've independently generated and then [1459] we feed it into open ai's um you know [1462] our little consolidation thing which you [1464] know changes into a storytelling format [1466] and then from there we generate the [1467] audio from there we up the file and then [1468] from there we send the email I should [1471] preface this with you don't actually [1472] need all of these steps depending on how [1474] high quality you want the output to be [1476] um you could theoretically have gotten [1477] it to do the storytelling and the um [1481] summarization just in one step uh but [1483] from my experience GPT 4 Turbo at least [1485] at the time of recording this video just [1487] isn't good enough yet to be able to take [1489] on like multiple two or three different [1490] instructions at the same time and then [1492] do like a fantastic job at them are [1494] usually much better off just giving it [1495] like one lane to sort of drive down and [1497] say hey man your job [1499] is to consolidate this into a summary [1500] and meant your job is to take a a list [1503] of summaries and then turn that into you [1504] know a story or something along those [1506] lines so there are obviously multiple [1508] ways to do so and I think that uh you [1510] know we're all mature enough to [1511] understand that this isn't the only way [1512] uh but this is certainly the way that I [1513] would I would do it in practice if I [1515] were tasked with building this for an [1516] actual client or something like that um [1519] yeah okay so where we at now we've [1521] generated the text aggregate so if I [1524] open this up you'll see um that [1526] basically every summary is demarcated [1529] with these three um hyphens so three [1532] hyphens three hyphens then we'll feed [1535] that into [1538] this this is the summary of the [1540] newsletters which is quite nice so we [1543] now have a sort of Storytelling thing [1545] hey here's a Consolidated summary of the [1546] latest insights from various newsletters [1548] we then generate the audio which is nice [1551] we upload the file we get the share link [1553] and then I should have just received an [1554] email and I think I did there you go [1556] your Consolidated newsletter can be [1558] found here uh so if I open this it'll [1560] just open a Google drive [1561] file and then what I'm going to do now [1563] is just let it play for I don't know 10 [1565] seconds or something just you guys can [1566] verify the quality of the [1568] output here's a Consolidated summary of [1570] the latest insights from various [1572] newsletters one Nick sv's newsletter SV [1577] focuses on optimizing agency operations [1579] before considering new hires He suggests [1582] measuring re fascinating Ser that's not [1585] how you say my name I wonder how long [1588] it'll take uh before these models get [1590] good enough to like sus out not just the [1593] phonetics but I don't know like the [1595] language backgrounds that sort of thing [1597] very interesting um anywh who uh yeah [1599] you know that's that's more or less [1600] where we're at now um I would encourage [1602] you guys if you wanted to build out your [1603] own productivity system to make a couple [1605] of tweaks to The Prompt U maybe change [1607] the tone of voice so that I don't know [1608] you want it to be spunkier or maybe you [1610] want it to be more dry or maybe instead [1613] of uh like listicle style things you [1615] want it to like I don't know just like [1617] be a bunch of paragraphs you have the [1618] power to do that um just by adding the [1620] instructions to the GPT modules that [1622] preface the audio generation one you [1625] also don't have to be married to this [1626] audio generator as well there are a [1628] variety of uh Texas speech platforms out [1630] there like Google cloud services offers [1632] a really really good um Texas speech [1634] platform where the voices are a little [1635] bit more robotic uh but they're still [1637] they're still very high quality and [1638] definitely good enough for you to be [1640] able to like you know meaningfully get [1642] information from an email summary every [1643] morning so yeah that's where we're at [1646] right now um believe that's it if you [1648] guys have any questions or anything like [1649] that about how this specific system [1650] works just let me know um otherwise [1652] thanks so much for watching uh let me [1654] know your thoughts like comment [1656] subscribe do all that fun YouTube stuff [1658] and I will catch youall in the next [1660] video thanks so much bye-bye

Title: How I Grew My Make.com YouTube Channel To 10K Subs In ~2.5 Months
[0] hey everybody it's Nick and in this [1] video I'm going to take a departure from [2] my usual make.com stuff and talk a [4] little bit about YouTube specifically [6] how I hit 10,000 subscribers on YouTube [9] in a little over 2 and a half months [11] using a pretty unconventional strategy [13] that I don't think a lot of people on [14] YouTube are using so if you've wondered [16] about potentially getting started on [17] YouTube which I would highly recommend [19] you to by the way uh or just want some [21] more insight into the sorts of things [23] that I'm seeing on a daily basis when I [25] make my Youtube videos maybe the [27] revenues maybe the analytics that sort [28] of deal and this is the video for you [30] stay tuned and let's get into [34] it so I got a couple things that I want [36] to talk about in this video Loosely [38] structured this video is going to [39] involve three parts the first is I'm [41] going to talk about what you can expect [43] at around 10,000 subscribers on YouTube [46] and what I mean what you can expect I [47] mean what sorts of Revenue are you [49] looking at in terms of AdSense what [51] sorts of numbers are you looking at in [52] terms of I don't know comments analytics [54] that sort of deal obviously some of this [56] varies depending on the niche and on the [57] channel obviously cpms are very [59] different across industry so keep some [62] of that in mind but I'll show you guys [63] What It's Like on my end number two is [65] how to get there it's a simple three [67] strap strategy for producing large [68] amounts of content quickly then ensuring [70] that that content is relevant to your [72] audience and then grows increasingly [73] relevant which I I personally feel is [76] crucial on YouTube in order to make a [78] really good impression and obviously to [79] grow your brand uh I'm going to include [81] some thoughts of my own just in terms of [83] you know the mindset that I have behind [85] starting YouTube why I think my YouTube [87] has grown um so much faster than most [88] other people's that started around the [90] same time as me um and you know ways [92] that you can Implement that same mindset [94] on your end in order to achieve a [96] similar result if you wanted to get on [97] YouTube and that sort of deal and then [99] the final part of the video is going to [100] be just some ideas that I'm having [102] related to monetizing my own audience [104] and ways that you when you're at this [106] level uh can consider moving forward I [108] guess on a personal brand perspective to [111] both make large amounts of money online [112] obviously but also to provide a ton of [114] value to people that are watching I [116] firmly believe that anybody at the [117] around 10,000 subscriber Mark in YouTube [119] can make more than a million dollars a [120] year if they do it right um they just [122] need to do it right and they obviously [123] need to not sacrifice the brand [125] reputation that they've built uh by [126] doing it in a really shitty way so I got [128] some thoughts on that I'm going to talk [130] about all these three things let's get [131] into it first thing that I want to touch [133] on obviously is my own YouTube growth um [136] what that's looked like you know I made [138] a video similar to this I think when I [140] was at like 3,000 subscribers or [141] something which now that I think about [143] it was like a month maybe a month and a [144] half ago so things have changed quite [146] quickly um but I just want to revisit [148] some of the same things that I talked [150] about there obviously I have [153] 10,687 subscribers as of today I believe [156] yesterday I had like 10,500 or something [158] so it's been growing between 100 to [161] maybe 200 a day seems to fluctuate [163] depending on the Content Volume that I'm [165] putting out you'll see that I have [167] 990,000 views in the last 28 days so a [169] little over 3,000 views a day which is [170] quite nice and then um that translates [173] to 9,000 watch hours which I personally [175] think is cool as hell um I have an [177] estimated revenue of about 1,27 784 [180] which is basically exactly my mortgage [183] which I find really funny and I've [184] repeated this a couple of times because [185] it's just it's interesting how you know [188] you just start recording videos and you [189] don't really think too much about it um [191] and then you know within a couple of [192] months your mortgage is paid for so I [194] don't consider this a very large sum but [196] I think this sum would make a difference [197] to a lot of people's lives and it's [198] worth at least um at least mentioning [201] now let's actually head over to the [203] analytics page and let's see what sorts [204] of numbers we're running so reiterating [207] a couple of these stats obviously um 9 [209] ,000 views in the last 28 days 9k watch [211] hours 2.8k subs and then estimated [214] Revenue I want to touch on views a [215] little bit because if you guys have been [217] following my channel for you know more [218] than the last 28 days uh you'll know [221] that my my Channel's gone through some [224] pretty large fluctuations in um in [226] viewership and subscriber count and that [228] sort of thing and there are periods upon [230] which it grows very very quickly and [231] then there are periods in which it's [232] grown a little bit slower and so if I [235] just walk you through the last 90 days [237] here I believe I started posting [238] consistently on February the 6th yeah [242] there he is February the 6th uh with my [244] first video that said I made $48,600 [246] last month here's how interestingly [249] enough I didn't really know like I [250] didn't have a Content strategy back then [252] at all and so all I was doing was [253] thinking okay what's impressive about my [255] life the other people might find [256] interesting um and you know I I'd list [258] out five or 10 different things and then [260] I just talk about it my idea there was [262] just to get as much feedback as quickly [263] as possible and see if the sort of thing [264] really was as interesting as I thought [266] it was um and interestingly it turns out [269] that it wasn't you know U videos in [271] which I talk about obviously the amount [272] of money that I make are valuable to [274] some people they do find it very [275] valuable and I see why it's you know uh [277] measure of legitimacy and that sort of [279] deal but actually systems um SL [283] automation talk tend to do substantially [285] better um and you know talking about the [287] systems and the automation how they make [288] money is way more important to people [290] than just making money uh and I have a [292] strong feeling that that's because [293] there's just so many more people talking [295] about all the money they've made online [296] but very few people talking about how [298] they made the money that they made [299] online so important little distinction [301] there anyway I started posting [302] consistently on February the 6th I guess [305] looking back here and then you'll notice [306] that for the first few days I got [308] basically no views I got like 100 views [310] um across all of the content that I was [312] posting and then all of a sudden at [314] around February the 15th or so um I [317] started taking off and when I say take [318] off I mean you know I was at like 100 to [320] 150 here let's just say 150 um for a [323] brevity and then within you know 3 days [326] I was all of a sudden at 2100 which my [328] math Ain't So Good I believe it's about [330] 15 times 14 times higher immediately [333] after uh I wasn't just 14 times higher I [334] was like 35 times higher or something 38 [337] Times Higher and then I ended up peing [339] at um you know [342] 7,598 which was 50 times more views than [345] I was getting just a week and a half [346] before then so 50x is a very very large [350] difference and immediately I noticed a [351] lot of changes happening in my channel [353] right around this time number one was [355] obviously views and subscribers are [356] heavily correlated so I was getting [358] substantially more subscribers right on [359] the time which is pretty cool um I [361] jumped from getting like four five maybe [363] six a day to you know 360 a day um if [366] you consider the 50x multiple on the [368] views then 50x multiple on 6 to 360 [370] makes sense right it's approximately um [372] approximately [373] similar um I starting to get a lot of [375] requests from people on videos uh which [377] I found very valuable and this is really [379] to me I mean even though as you see [381] there are two big spikes here and then [382] it sort of levels off this is really to [384] me when things started like taking off [386] um you know I only had like a th [387] subscribers around that time but [390] now that I had a sufficient mass of [391] people that were viewing my stuff I had [394] a sufficient mass of people providing me [395] feedback and telling me hey Nick I [398] really like that you talk about this can [399] you talk about this this topic more or [402] you know hey do you mind recording a [403] video on this right and by doing so I [405] was able to basically Channel what I was [407] doing before which if you think about it [409] sort of like conceptually I was like in [411] the middle of a big space and I was [413] reaching in as many directions as [414] possible I would take two steps to the [416] right then I would take two steps to the [418] left and then one step up and then one [419] step down you know I was I was doing all [421] these random actions I was moving a lot [423] but I wasn't actually making a lot of [425] progress in a particular direction but [427] the second that I started receiving [428] regular and consistent feedback from [430] people that were watching my stuff right [431] the second I hit that critical mass um I [435] started actually being able to like tend [437] towards a direction AKA a goal AKA like [440] a a personal brand essentially um and [442] that's when not only did I remain super [445] consistent I like to think so anyway um [448] but my content quality shot way up and [450] then the value that people were getting [451] was also going way up and then the [453] conversations that I was having when [454] people were booking meetings with me and [455] that sort of thing they were so [456] fantastic I was getting tons of [458] inquiries for very very big projects um [460] like government project Municipal [462] projects um projects with private Equity [465] firms right just the quality of the [467] conversations that I was having right [468] after this point went way the hell up so [470] even though you know the view count [472] dipped subscriber count dipped all that [473] stuff um I just kept on going and uh I [476] sort of attacked it with renewed Vigor I [479] hit a second Spike um about a month [481] after I started posting be 3 and a half [483] weeks after I started posting [484] consistently the second Spike was much [485] higher than the first Spike about um [487] what like 1.8 times higher um and I just [490] considered this like delayed results [492] after you know consistently hitting the [496] type of content that I wanted to hit for [498] you know two weeks prior to that after [500] getting all that feedback and so not [501] surprised that I hit a higher Peak and [503] then after that I I tended down and you [505] know I seemed to be I don't know [507] hovering somewhere around the 3,500 to [509] 5,000 views a day sort of deal um my [512] subscriber count terms the Peaks you [515] know I I shot all the way up to I think [516] 522 in a day which is pretty cool like I [518] like woke up that day and I was at 2,000 [520] and then later on the night no 3,000 [523] maybe and then later on the night I was [524] at like 3500 or 4,000 which is obviously [526] quite uh quite fun to be in that [528] driver's seat and then since then it [531] seems to be hovering somewhere around [532] like 100 to 150 a day sometimes I have [535] spikes and it's a little bit higher but [537] yeah seems to be right around there now [539] you'll notice no that these little gray [540] bubbles they stop right around uh you [543] know March the 15th March the 19th I [546] guess and that's because I was doing a [548] 30-day content challenge up until that [550] point in time and then I did a couple [551] more posts but um you know I also ended [555] up getting a pretty large business [556] opportunity which involved me flying to [559] um Prague or the Czech Republic if you [561] guys are familiar um to do a business [562] turnaround for a company um that you [565] know I liked and respected a lot and [567] that was pretty time intensive as you [569] can imagine um as a result of that I was [572] unable to continue the constant posting [574] obligations that you know I'd grown [575] accustomed to and that I think a lot of [576] my audience had grown accustomed to so [578] immediately after I guess like three or [580] four days after I stopped posting [581] consistently I saw a market decrease in [583] subscriber count every day and uh you [585] know we went down from like 130 or so a [588] day down to like 60 70 that sort of deal [591] and I think the reason for that is just [593] because one the YouTube algorithm [594] obviously really likes when you post [596] consistently especially the long form [597] stuff that I'm posting because it acre a [599] lot of watch time cre a lot of watch [600] hours uh and um I think YouTube is is [604] really trying to push long form content [606] a lot harder because there's just such a [607] surplus of short form stuff um two I [610] think people are just more interested in [611] long form stuff at least the people that [613] I'm talking to right now my audience and [615] so talking long form and that sort of [616] thing that everybody just grew sort of [618] accustomed to having a video every day [619] maybe they'd watch it while they ate [621] lunch or something like that um as I [623] know um you know I've been known to do [625] from time to [626] time uh so yeah you know when I when I [628] stop posting I think think I saw a [629] pretty substantial decrease in [631] subscriber count and then when I was in [632] prago I was like okay I got to find a [634] way to make this work so I posted a [635] couple of videos and then the second [636] that I posted this videos my um my [638] viewer account shot up again my [639] subscriber account shot up again and [642] then it just tended somewhere around [643] like the 100 range every single day [645] basically from that onwards which is [646] quite nice so yeah that was pretty [649] exciting obviously um that persisted [652] until about April the 20th or so when I [656] got back from uh from my operations [659] Consulting uh project you can you can [661] call it and then right around that time [663] I got extremely sick for four or five [664] days so I didn't post at all and then [666] now I'm back and I've started posting it [668] consistently again you know YouTube is [670] sort of delayed with this stuff so it [671] doesn't actually show you um the stats [673] for today and so it says that I've have [675] two videos posted but I really posted [676] another one I wonder if I could include [678] today yeah I don't think that there's a [679] way I can automatically do so so I'd [680] have to just like set this custom to [683] include May the [685] 4th yeah I can't really do that [687] unfortunately but um anticipate that my [690] subscriber count in the last 48 hours is [692] probably like a time and a half as high [694] as these just because I'm you know [695] posting consistently again I think it's [697] like the third day in a row or something [698] along those lines maybe like the third [700] time in two days or something so that's [702] quite positive and uh yeah you know [705] watch time views they sort of mirror the [707] same thing there's no real interesting [709] um I guess patterns there that differ um [712] what I'll do now is I'll talk a little [713] bit about the estimated revenue and sort [715] of like the level of I guess AdSense rev [717] that you can expect at around 10,000 [718] followers follow obviously this depends [720] on how engaged your audience is I'd [722] consider the people that watch my videos [723] very engaged because you know I drop [725] nuggets all the time I like to think and [728] uh you know I it's sort of like a live [731] build and so [734] um you know you sort of have to be [736] engaged if you want to get value out of [738] it contrast that with some other stuff [739] which I think a lot of people just put [741] on in the background or something um I [743] think it's quite different you have to [744] sort of like use your eyes use your ears [745] you have to like be fully cognitively [747] present so um yeah let me just run you [750] through what that looks like so I got [753] monetized [755] in I think late February let me try [758] pumping this in and seeing what [761] happens um 31 let's do [765] 2024 yeah so very late February and then [769] um I got $104 in the month of [772] February and then in March I got [775] $1,421 27 and you'll see that right [777] around that time when like the mass of [779] videos was the highest is when I [780] received the most money from AdSense [782] obviously uh a couple of my videos went [784] viral around this time particularly how [786] to scrape a website on make people [788] really really like that one because I [789] think it's just like a new approach to [790] web scraping they didn't really realize [792] that they could do it in make and that [793] sort of thing so you know a lot of my [795] Revenue was coming around that time [796] obviously and it looks to me [799] like since then um you know the first [803] half of the month so probably about one [804] and a half times the money the second [806] half of the month [807] generated I could run the numbers but [809] I'm not really going to but any who uh [811] you can really see the the impact when [813] you stop posting consistently right like [814] when I was posting consistently it was [816] averaging about $7 a day I would say and [818] then when I stopped posting consistently [819] the second that I missed a day and that [820] sort of thing i' standed up about 40 30 [823] 35 40 that sort of thing so um well that [828] was back in uh that was back in March I [830] should say since then April uh was [833] pretty good you know seem to hover [835] around $35 to $40 a day note that I [837] posted like twice once at the very [838] beginning of the month and then once at [840] the very very end of the month so with [842] those two posts sort of at the beginning [843] and at the end um I really feel like [846] YouTube is like a flywheel and you just [848] need to be posting reasonably [850] consistently in order to see results [851] with this um obviously you have to make [853] sure your content's pretty high quality [854] but yeah that's more or less where I'm [856] at 40 bucks is a day in the month of [859] April and then the month of May let's [861] see where we're at uh 64 54 and then 49 [866] so about 50 so I'm averaging maybe 55 [869] bucks in May so yeah it's definitely [871] going up it's probably going to continue [872] to Trend up and I imagine this month [874] they probably going to make somewhere [875] around $2,000 a month um us considering [878] I'm posting consistently um let's see [881] I'm Canadian so it's a $2,700 Canadian [884] which you know it's pretty good money [886] but the revenue only tells half the [887] story because it's not just the revenue [890] that I'm making off of AdSense um if you [893] consider like the YouTube stuff like a [895] like a business um in addition to the [897] revenue that I'm producing through ad [899] sense I'm also producing um Revenue [901] through Affiliates and then I'm also [902] producing Revenue through closed deals [904] like I'm still selling my products as a [908] service no I'm selling my Consulting but [911] I'm also selling my building and my [912] integrating time um and so I've closed [915] several deals as a result of working on [916] this YouTube project that I otherwise [918] wouldn't have um so you know you have to [919] factor that Revenue in as well um the [922] deals that I'm getting from YouTube are [923] substantially bigger than the deals that [925] I was getting previously with cold [926] Outreach like the deals when I was doing [928] cold Outreach were maybe average of like [930] 3,000 to $4,000 the deals that I'm [933] getting when I'm doing YouTube are on [935] average maybe $7,000 8,000 um there's a [938] retainer aspect and it's hard for me to [941] see just how much better the turn rate [943] is from YouTube than it was on cold [945] Outreach so you know I've only really [947] had a couple of these deals for what [948] like a month now and since they're on a [950] recurring basis I I don't really know [952] how long they're going to last but my [953] intuition is they're probably going to [955] last like five or six times longer than [956] the cold Outreach ones because one if [958] they came into my funnel you could say [962] through YouTube um odds are they really [965] like and respect the content that I'm [966] putting out otherwise that wouldn't have [967] been like their main the main way that I [969] acquired them and so me constantly [972] producing more and more and more value [973] probably makes me appear like more of an [975] authority in their eyes for one probably [977] makes me seem like I know what I'm doing [978] more for two there's a positive brand [980] Association like a lot of the time [982] people want to work with people that you [985] know are more famous or more popular and [987] so you need to consider um a good [989] example this is a company that I'm [990] working with has a Taylor Swift's [992] copywriter and Taylor Swift's copywriter [995] like when you just hear that you're like [996] damn that's Taylor Swift cooperator for [997] real it's like yeah yeah we got Taylor [999] Swift cooperator you're so much more [1000] likely to want to work with a business [1002] if you have somebody that has some level [1003] of notoriety no I'm not t- Swift yet I [1006] just got to dye my hair and do a couple [1008] other things to my body but uh you know [1011] I I I think um probably within the next [1014] uh 3 to four months I'll become one of [1016] the most reputable uh if not well [1018] recognized people in the space um and I [1020] think that you know anybody that is [1022] learning about the space or in the [1023] industry or whatever would want that [1024] positive brand Association hence a much [1027] lower turn rate so we'll see how that [1029] manifests but yeah the deals are at [1031] least two times larger and then I think [1032] when you take into account the reduced [1034] turn like the lifetime value of a of a [1036] YouTube um customer is probably going to [1038] be like six or seven times whatever the [1040] lifetime value was of my cold Outreach [1042] customers pretty good stuff in addition [1044] to that I'm also making some affiliate [1045] Revenue so I mentioned um that in order [1048] to be really accurate we have to take [1049] all of that into account I believe and [1052] this is just off the top of my head [1053] because my affiliate revenue is spread [1054] across like seven or eight platforms I [1057] believe in April 2024 I made an [1059] additional $ 400ish dollars maybe $500 [1063] somewhere around those lines they don't [1065] all pay out at the same time which is [1066] annoying when you start YouTube um and [1068] you start you know approaching these [1069] companies or these companies approach [1071] you I should say pitching their [1072] affiliate deals and that sort of thing [1074] you have to be cognizant of the fact [1075] that they all have really weird payment [1076] schedules some of them are going to pay [1078] you [1079] at the end of the month others are going [1080] to pay you every 60 days others are [1081] going to pay you when their credit [1082] amount reaches over $150 and then [1085] they'll pay you on the 21st of like the [1086] third Harvest Moon after that right [1090] there are a lot of variables there but [1092] um yeah just looking at like the the [1094] closed deals um from people that are [1096] using my links and stuff it's between [1097] $400 to $500 which would put my total [1100] revenue um just in terms of like the [1102] like not in terms of the actual services [1104] that I'm providing uh for the month of [1106] April closer to 1,700 to 1800 US which I [1109] think is quite healthy um you know it's [1111] definitely not like a living living but [1112] I think that uh that amount of money [1114] would make a big difference to a lot of [1115] people's lives which is pretty crazy to [1117] think about I mean I'm just here sitting [1119] not in my boxers not today anyway uh but [1121] I'm just sitting here in my house [1122] talking about things that I really enjoy [1123] talking about and uh it's allowed me to [1125] create a pretty reasonable amount of [1127] Revenue without even worrying about you [1129] know the closed deals or anything like [1130] that so pretty exciting stuff that's why [1132] i' recommend YouTube to basically [1134] anybody [1135] watching okay so that's analytics um I [1138] wanted to talk a little bit about [1138] comments because I've had a lot of [1140] people ask me U what the comments look [1142] like and I've also had some people uh [1143] basically saying like ask me Nick is [1146] this you really replying to my stuff or [1147] is it like an artificial intelligence it [1149] is me I would never demean the people [1151] that are watching by having some AI [1153] respond to your your comments um I don't [1155] think that there's anything morally or [1157] inherently wrong with using AI but you [1159] know my whole point or my whole [1161] objective is to be very respected in the [1162] industry and I think that it would just [1164] be a very big hit to personal reputation [1166] if somebody else were responding to my [1168] comments or AI was responding my [1169] comments to that sort of thing so on the [1172] comment side of things I'm not going to [1173] lie the first 5,000 subscribers or so [1176] that I got I could manage it pretty [1178] reasonably and I would have a schedule [1180] where basically every single day um you [1183] know after I did like my morning work [1185] and you know I have a little routine [1186] going on where I read a certain amount [1187] and I do some flashcards and that sort [1189] of thing at the end of that stretch I [1191] would just go on my YouTube and then I [1192] would respond to all the comments [1193] received in the last 48 hours and then I [1195] I could actually stay on top of it but I [1197] think between the 5,000 at 10,000 mark [1199] my ability to do so is really really [1201] dropped off um and I just I can't really [1204] keep on top of it because if I spend all [1205] my time doing the YouTube comments um [1209] you know I guess like what in the last [1210] day or so I've this doesn't account for [1212] the ones that I have responded to so in [1214] the last day or so I probably receive [1215] like 40 or something like that and um I [1217] really like to provide a lot of detail [1220] in the comments especially when people [1221] are ask me questions so it's just very [1223] very difficult to do so consistently I'm [1225] thinking of making um this a bigger [1227] priority moving forward because I think [1228] that there's a ton of value in comments [1230] this is what a lot of YouTubers w't tell [1231] you but I think there's a ton of value [1233] in responding to comments one because [1237] every time you do so it's an opportunity [1238] to show all the people that you follow [1240] that are following you rather um that's [1242] the sort of person that you are whether [1243] it's a positive or negative comment like [1245] if it's a positive comment then that's [1247] great you know we're keeping the party [1248] going and obviously I'm delivering a [1249] fair amount of value so I enjoy the [1251] positive comments it's nice for my [1252] psyche too because staring at a screen [1254] all day can be kind of boring but two [1256] when it's a negative comment I think [1257] it's a really good opportunity for you [1259] to show your character to the people [1260] that are watching um a lot of the time [1262] people try combating negativity with [1263] more negativity but you know in my case [1265] a lot of the time when people are [1266] negative I just try and respond [1268] positively or I try and treat it as a [1270] learning experience um I had somebody [1271] the other day say something along the [1273] lines of uh you can't make $220,000 a [1276] month on upw workk or something like [1277] that's not [1278] realistic um but it you know it totally [1280] is uh my Peak month was 20 almost [1282] $26,000 I think or like [1284] $255,000 I have like the certificate of [1287] earnings I got everything so think I [1288] said something to him like you know I [1290] feel like you have some limiting beliefs [1292] I think you can do I think you can make [1293] that money if you really put your mind [1294] to it and I believe that that's sort of [1296] thing um considering that you know the [1298] lifetime value of these comments like [1300] these comments are going to be up for [1301] like the next five or 10 years I think [1303] they're just great ways to build um [1304] reputation and character and that sort [1306] of deal so a lot of YouTubers are going [1307] to disagree with me but I would respond [1309] to every single comment if I had the [1310] time to do so and I I will probably go [1312] through and try and find a way that I [1313] can actually stay on top of things um if [1316] that means responding to fewer comments [1319] or responding to them like more shorter [1322] form then I probably will but uh I just [1324] really want to interact with the people [1325] that are following me they're assisting [1327] me build my brand they're just lovely [1329] people honestly like all the guys that [1331] are watching this at this point are um [1333] are [1334] fantastic and I you know I think that [1336] there's a lot of synergistic business [1337] opportunities as well so if I'm thinking [1339] about this from the perspective of [1340] somebody that only cares about making [1341] money on the internet um then responding [1343] to people that are watching my content [1346] is probably also valuable just in so far [1349] that the people that are watching are [1350] probably in my industry and so they're [1352] in some type of business automation or [1353] consulting or they just own businesses [1355] so obviously you want to be in touch [1356] with them wherever possible right but [1359] that's not even accounting for all of [1360] the positive uh relationship benefits [1363] that I'm getting the fact that I've I've [1364] met just so many great amazing people [1366] over the course of the last two months I [1367] think I've probably been on over 60 70 [1370] calls and everybody that I've talked to [1371] so far is just left me with a giant [1373] smile on my face so yeah tons of value [1376] in responding to comments guys if you [1377] start a YouTube channel I'd make sure [1379] that you respond to every single comment [1380] yourself for as long as you humanly can [1383] you know obviously still do whatever you [1384] have to do to put bread on the table but [1386] uh the comments are just like the icing [1387] on the cake um insane squirrel that made [1391] me crack up yeah I swear a little bit [1393] too much on here but uh it's funny some [1396] people say uh Nick like why do you swear [1399] so much you're so crass and then other [1400] people are like dude I love that you [1401] swear so it's like I don't know what to [1403] do I'm just going to continue being [1404] myself and see where that lands great so [1407] that's comments um um and then if I go [1409] down here to [1410] earn so I didn't realize this um until I [1413] actually got monetized but there are [1415] various ways to monetize your channel in [1417] addition to just AdSense you can [1419] monetize through [1421] um let me see here uh memberships yeah [1426] um supers which I've personally never [1428] used in my life but I think it's sort of [1430] like patreon where people provide some [1431] type of benefit they donation or [1433] something like that when you do a really [1434] good job um you can do shopping and then [1437] there's some type of like charity [1438] affiliate program here so I'm not [1441] worrying about any of that stuff I mean [1442] it's possible that maybe this that sort [1444] of thing could make me a little bit more [1445] money like 10% here 20% there um but I I [1448] prefer to keep things as simple as [1450] possible for now and so I'm just doing [1451] the um I'm just doing the watch page ads [1454] um and then I guess I'm also doing [1455] supers and giving although I I don't [1457] think I've ever encouraged somebody to [1458] do any of that and I don't actually [1459] remember explicitly selecting that maybe [1461] that's just what YouTube does um [1463] automatically yeah so that's about what [1466] you can expect when you reach um about [1468] 10 ,000 subscribers or so you know [1469] assuming that you do a pretty good job [1471] assuming that your cpms are pretty [1472] reasonable um you can probably expect [1474] around $ 1,200 [1477] $1300 um you know some videos are going [1480] to perform disproportionately well like [1482] check out uh this graph how to scrape [1484] any website make.com has almost uh it's [1487] like three and a half times as much ad [1489] Revenue as the next video up right but [1492] that said um you know [1495] content follows an exponential graph [1498] essentially where a like a reverse [1500] exponential graph it's sort of like the [1501] 8020 I think it's called the power law [1503] where 1% of causes result in 99% of [1508] effects and so um so so too does content [1511] right so do the videos that you record [1512] it's like the 8020 principle so yeah I [1514] don't know if you can all expect the [1516] $14.22 RPM I hear that that's pretty [1518] high just based off some some research [1520] that I've done um but if you do long [1522] form content as well and if you just [1523] talk about things you're passionate [1524] about and you know you have an audience [1525] I think you'll probably get there um at [1527] some point [1529] okay great so that's just me nerding out [1530] over analytics and giving you guys just [1533] a barometer I want to say of the sorts [1536] of um dollar figures analytics view [1539] count subscriber count all that sort of [1541] stuff that you can expect at around my [1542] level at least in this industry and [1544] hopefully that'll help anchor you guys [1545] to more realistic expectations moving [1547] forward because as I'm sure you guys saw [1549] I didn't really do anything for the [1551] first like 10 days and I post it every [1553] single day for 10 days sometimes 30 40 [1555] 50 minute videos so you know keep keep [1558] on grinding and you'll get there um you [1560] know very uh it's a very realistic road [1563] map and that was my hope with this video [1565] the second thing that I want to talk [1566] about is okay great so now you know what [1568] to expect to 10,000 subscribers um how [1571] do I actually go out and get there and I [1573] thought as opposed to like giving you [1575] guys this I don't know I think people [1576] are really clickbaity when they go on [1578] YouTube and they search up like how to [1579] get subscribers on YouTube I've I've [1582] watched some of that content myself and [1583] it just makes me cringe and I can't [1584] really pay attention to it because it [1585] cuts every goddamn two seconds and I'm [1587] clearly an old man get off my YouTube [1589] but uh I I thought I'd just be very [1591] straightforward and show you guys how I [1593] how I did this so essentially I have um [1596] what I'd consider a three-step system [1599] for growing on YouTube and I can only [1602] speak for what's worked for me but this [1603] has work what has worked for me and I [1605] was very very um intentional about how I [1608] set this up and so I'm not surprised [1610] about the results that I was getting [1611] because I spent a lot of time thinking [1612] about this before I [1614] began the first thing that you need to [1616] do is you need to build build your [1618] lifestyle in a way that you can produce [1620] a lot of high quality content and so a [1624] lot of people when they started on [1626] YouTube they think that they need [1628] to gain a ton of willpower and they need [1631] to post every day no matter how hard it [1633] is for 60 or 90 or 120 days or whatever [1637] and they have to grind and push and just [1638] really try as hard as they can and [1640] that's what's going to get them the [1641] result right the effort that they put in [1644] and I hate to break it to you but [1646] contrary to basically everything that [1649] you know a lot of people that are [1651] starting here have probably heard from [1652] other people is the it's not the degree [1655] of effort that you put in that yields [1657] the results because if this is really [1661] hard for you then you probably haven't [1663] picked the right thing to talk about and [1665] you haven't probably thought about how [1667] to arrange your life in such a way that [1668] it's easy and so instead if you just [1671] spend a few hours before you begin your [1674] YouTube Journey or campaign or whatever [1677] you want to call it [1678] and you just try and think how would I [1682] need to structure my life to make it as [1684] easy as possible to post every day for [1686] the next [1687] year and if you can think about that [1689] question earnestly and honestly and if [1691] you can structure your life in such a [1692] way that allows you to do so um then you [1695] will go way further than all of the [1697] people that started around 2 and a half [1698] to 3 months ago um that are now only at [1701] 500 subs and you know I'm at [1703] 10,700 or [1705] something so that sounds like a lot but [1709] let me be more clear and more direct if [1712] we were to turn this from this vague [1714] thing where it's like you structure your [1715] life in a way that allows you to produce [1716] content and turn it into something [1718] that's concrete what I mean by this is [1722] um you need to make recording as [1724] frictionless as possible and as easy as [1726] possible for you now in my case I'm very [1729] good at um talking head videos or at [1731] least that's what I hear from people I [1733] explain things reasonably clearly that's [1735] obviously a strength of mine and I know [1737] a lot about automation and [1739] make.com and so I used my knowledge of [1743] what I'm good at and then I created a [1745] Content format that allowed me to [1747] produce content with my points of [1749] highest leverage very quickly and very [1752] often and my format for this was you [1755] know and I I wrote this down somewhere [1758] um I don't know if I have my notebook [1760] but I explicitly wrote down you know [1762] long form content no Cuts do it all in [1765] one take just talk for a long long time [1768] about stuff and hopefully people will [1770] listen and you know I set up OBS studio [1774] um which is down here at the bottom [1776] rightand corner and it allows me to just [1778] screen share as I talk about stuff which [1780] is why I'm jumping back and forth and [1782] then I just have a little hotkey that [1783] allows me to go to my face and then to [1785] the screen and then back to my face and [1788] doing this allows my content to just be [1790] a little bit more engaging or exciting [1792] than most other people that are either [1793] their face or their screen or whatever [1795] and it also allows me not to have to do [1797] any work in post it allows me not to [1798] have to like worry about hiring a big [1800] video editing team uh because I can just [1802] you know press a couple of buttons and [1803] then jump back and forth and back and [1805] forth between these two screens live and [1808] at the end of it I just have like an mp4 [1810] and I can take that MP4 and I can upload [1812] it to YouTube or if I want to do any you [1814] know postwork then I just uh I drag and [1816] drop into Premier Pro uh and then I just [1818] have some adjustment layers here [1819] everything's all templated it's very [1821] easy so that's one part of it obviously [1824] like the logistics of how you structure [1826] another one is the type of cont that you [1828] produce you know if you want your [1829] content to be really really easy to [1831] create then just make your content about [1834] stuff that you would have had to do [1836] either way so one thing that I love [1839] doing is I love just making New Passion [1841] projects on make.com I do that sort of [1843] thing all the time I literally you know [1845] if I didn't run a channel I'd probably [1848] still have created exactly as many [1850] make.com flows as I've created over the [1853] course of the last 30 days like the fact [1854] that I have a channel hasn't actually [1856] changed that I'm not doing any [1857] additional work all I'm doing is I'm [1860] funneling that exact same energy and I'm [1862] recording videos on new make.com flows [1864] that I'm building but it's just time [1866] that I would have spent anyway building [1868] make.com flows just without a camera in [1869] front of my face so if you think about [1871] it um intelligently the additional time [1875] cost of just slapping the camera turning [1877] it on and then talking people through [1878] what I'm doing it's quite low you know [1881] maybe there's like uh if I'm trying to [1883] think about this mathematically it's [1884] like there's a 20% premium to having a [1886] camera in front of me while I do one of [1888] these things yeah you know if I didn't [1889] have the camera in front of me I would [1890] have been able to do it about 20% faster [1892] but I'm willing to spend 20% additional [1895] time doing something I would have had to [1896] do that day anyway on also building a [1899] brand so that's number two number three [1902] in order to build your lifestyle and way [1904] that allows you to generate content at [1905] least in my case I'm doing talking head [1907] content right and so it's just it's just [1909] me talking for the most part and then [1911] I'm sharing my screen and walking [1913] through systems and that sort of deal [1914] well I want you to think about how much [1918] time and energy people spend trying to [1920] like come across a certain way on camera [1923] um you know I was faced with essentially [1927] being like the very first video that I [1929] recorded I was like man I'm really not [1930] like well-kept enough like I'm not [1932] groomed enough you know I keep on saying [1934] um and ah and all these weird filler [1936] words that I would rather not say I look [1938] like a total [1940] dumbass and I sort of thought for a [1942] second and I said [1944] well you know logically if I spend all [1947] the time and effort worrying about how I [1950] appear on camera how I present or all of [1953] that stuff and that's probably just [1955] going to take substantially more time to [1956] produce content so why don't I just not [1958] worry about it and just trust that there [1960] are somewhere in the you know four [1962] billion internet users or whatever that [1965] there's a group of people that would [1966] like me for who I really am as opposed [1968] to like who I'm pretending to be on the [1970] internet um and then that way the [1972] content that I produce takes less time [1973] and energy because I'm just myself and I [1975] don't worry about you know all the minor [1977] things that I I think a lot of content [1978] creators worry about and then I'll [1981] probably look more authentic and then be [1983] able to build stronger relationships [1985] with people too so it's a win-win and so [1988] I bring that whole point up because I [1990] think a lot of people believe that they [1991] need a certain Persona on the internet [1993] to do really well and they'll take [1996] courses on how to do talking head videos [1998] or the worry about their accent you know [2001] I had a guy worrying about his accent he [2002] was asking me how he could do it on [2004] YouTube and he was like my English is so [2005] bad and I have such a strong accent and [2007] he was trying to like be different on [2009] camera than he was in real life and I [2011] remember just saying something along the [2012] lines of no man if you do this you will [2014] always have to do this why would you [2016] start with your life on extra hard [2019] difficulty why not just do it regardless [2022] of whether or not you have an accent and [2024] just trust that somewhere in the four [2025] billion human beings out there that [2028] there will be an audience that likes [2030] that sort of thing that can understand [2032] you whether or not you have a harsh ax [2033] and he really didn't if I'm [2035] honest um and yeah you know use that Ely [2038] to build your lifestyle in a way that's [2039] extremely frictionless and that allows [2040] you to record a lot more content a lot a [2042] lot quicker and a lot higher quality so [2045] uh those are the three or maybe the four [2046] points on how to convert that idea of [2049] building your lifestyle in a way that [2050] allows you to produce a lot of high [2050] quality content effortlessly into a [2052] series of actionable road maps obviously [2055] you know get get a nice light or [2057] something um I just bought this [2059] microphone but I should say that I got [2060] to 10,000 subscribers that actually [2062] having a nice microphone I just had a [2063] little lapel one uh which honestly had [2065] pretty crappy audio quality um you know [2069] when you have the funds upgrade your [2071] camera do do do do that sort of thing [2073] because people that are watching [2074] obviously do appreciate that you put [2076] time and energy into it but just don't [2078] allow any of that stuff [2080] to stop you from producing your point of [2084] highest leverage which most of the time [2086] is just the content and it's you just [2087] talking about stuff that you like or I [2089] don't know maybe writing about stuff [2090] that you like or whatever your content [2092] format on YouTube should [2094] be okay so that's number one U build [2097] your lifestyle in a way that allows you [2098] to produce a lot of high quality content [2100] quickly effortlessly and friction free [2102] number two is create a lot of high [2105] quality content so that sort of Falls [2108] with the first one and that's not [2110] something that I can explain [2111] specifically how to do because you just [2113] have to sit in front of your computer or [2114] sit in front of whatever your content [2116] medium is and just produce a lot of [2117] content the way that I did this and the [2120] way that I pushed myself I I did do a [2123] little bit of pushing um not going to [2124] lie but the way that I did this was I [2125] set a 30-day challenge for myself and I [2127] said hey every single day after you're [2129] done with you know your day's activities [2131] just sit down in front of the camera and [2132] then talk about something that you want [2133] to talk about look through your past [2136] accomplishments and see if there's [2138] anything interesting that you might be [2139] able to provide that's valuable to other [2140] people and if there is then record a [2142] video on it and just talk for a while I [2145] worried I didn't worry about you know [2146] doing any editing or anything I just [2147] drag and drop those videos directly into [2149] YouTube and I just did it every single [2151] day for uh for 30 days a little longer [2153] than 30 days and by the end of the 30 [2155] days I had learned so much um because [2159] what you learn when you do this is as I [2160] mentioned earlier you're just sort of [2163] trying to see what works right and then [2166] eventually from one of those directions [2168] that youve produced content on one of [2170] those topics or whatever there'll be [2171] slightly more positive feedback than on [2173] any of the previous topics and so that [2175] to you is like a learning signal it's [2176] like hey I need to go that way because [2179] you know I've already received some [2180] positive feedback that way it's like if [2182] you're stuck in like a very dark cave [2184] and then you try and look around and you [2186] really can't see anything you notice [2187] that when you turn your head a little [2188] bit to the left like it just seems a [2190] little bit lighter so then you put your [2192] hands out and then you start walking [2193] that way down the cave and then the [2195] closer that you go to that direction the [2197] lighter and lighter it becomes well odds [2199] are you're going you know you're you're [2201] getting out of the cave you're following [2202] this light source out right and just [2205] like in that analogy you're following a [2206] light source to get out of the cave and [2207] presumably free yourself when you follow [2210] feedback and when you follow the numbers [2213] if you post a video about zapier and it [2215] does really well you know do more videos [2217] on app here you can iterate towards a [2221] good Niche for you for yourself without [2224] worrying too much about all of the silly [2226] BS that people do where they do like [2228] market research and they spend like a [2230] million in one hours trying to figure [2232] out oh like what's my target audience or [2234] my Persona or whatever right the reality [2237] is you have no idea what your target [2238] audience is and even if you think you [2240] have an idea you're probably wrong so [2242] just go produce a bunch of content in [2245] and around those topics and then [2247] whatever ever reacts the strongest [2249] that's where you go you go where the [2250] data tells you essentially you go where [2251] the people that are watching you tell [2253] you so that's number two you know [2256] produce a ton of high quality content [2259] and number three is engage with your [2261] audience um I think that's pretty [2263] self-explanatory I just talked about [2264] going through my comments for you know [2266] 45 minutes to an hour every day and then [2268] writing out responses and recording [2270] videos and just trying to make it as [2272] effortless a part of my routine as [2273] possible but obviously there are many [2274] ways to do so you could set polls you [2277] could do I mean on YouTube I've think [2278] I've created one or two posts but that's [2280] just because I've never done this before [2282] you could create regular posts in [2283] addition to the content that you're [2284] doing where you're asking viewers [2285] questions you're attemption to learn [2287] things about them you could set up [2288] office hours so you could have some type [2291] of weekly office hour session where you [2293] just host a call and people that have [2294] questions can physically come on that [2296] call and you know you can answer them um [2298] you can help them out live you could do [2300] tons of things you could add a community [2302] offering to whatever you're doing maybe [2303] a free community or very low paid [2305] Community to be able to interact with [2306] people that like you a lot um and give [2309] them more time energy and care but [2311] that's you know in addition to the [2312] videos that you're making on YouTube um [2314] essentially you just need to find a way [2315] to engage with your audience and show [2316] them that you really care you can't just [2318] be blasting your content into the void [2320] because sure you'll get some views and [2321] you'll get some respect I want to say [2323] but the leverage that you lose by not um [2326] taking advantage of like engaging with [2328] real human beings is crazy you're [2330] probably losing on like three four 5x [2331] the channel growth not to mention the [2334] life benefits and the quality of life [2335] benefits of just having a network of [2338] people that like you and being able to [2339] provide value giving is probably like [2342] the straightest line path to being happy [2344] that I've ever found so yeah my [2348] three-step sequence again to reiterate [2350] build a lifestyle theow produce a lot of [2351] high quality content second is produce a [2353] lot of high quality content learn from [2355] that content and eventually identify [2357] your point of highest leverage and then [2359] three engage with your audience a lot [2360] and I think when you engage with your [2361] audience a lot it just helps everything [2363] else it's just a general lift to your uh [2365] to your content or branding strategy [2368] okay great those were two of the [2371] things I think getting a little tired [2373] here those were two of the three things [2375] that I wanted to talk about today the [2376] last one is um monetization and how you [2379] take a channel that is doing pretty well [2382] at you know maybe 10,000 subscribers and [2383] how you scale it up um I'm firmly of the [2386] belief that just seeing what I've what [2387] I've seen now anybody at 10,000 10,000 [2390] subscribers in a BB Niche can probably [2392] make over a million dollars a year uh [2394] assuming that they're just intelligent [2395] about how they monetize [2397] um you know if you hit 10,000 [2399] subscribers you are I think in like the [2401] top I think it's 8% of YouTube something [2404] along those lines um in addition to [2406] being in the top 8% of YouTube you've [2408] obviously proven that your ideas are [2409] worthwhile that people like you people [2411] like the content that you're putting out [2412] the niche that you're in is is hot and [2414] you know reasonably [2416] successful there are so many ways to [2418] convert all of those things into Cold [2421] Hard Cash and over the course of the [2423] next few minutes I'm just going to talk [2424] about a few of those ways now I should [2426] preface this with I'm not actually doing [2428] any of these things I found it very [2430] important to build my reputation first [2431] and foremost and then also not to worry [2433] about optimizing my cash flow but just [2435] to get in the habit of posting [2436] consistently and doing those three [2438] things that I talked about because I [2439] don't really care about making money in [2441] the next two or three months I care [2442] about making money in the next like 10 [2443] or 15 years um I truly think that your [2445] personal brand is one of the most [2446] powerful ways that you can elevate your [2448] business success um just like uh [2451] engaging with your audience it's just a [2452] general lift to the rest of your life [2454] whether you're working on one specific [2456] business or multiple you can always take [2459] um excitement and energy and positive [2463] outcomes from one of those businesses um [2465] and then just like take it into your [2466] personal brand and then apply it to [2467] another uh it's just it's just the best [2469] and and clearest way to achieve freedom [2471] I would say so for me it's it's not [2474] about acquiring a ton of money very [2475] quickly but if you were to try and [2477] optimize every little aspect about you [2480] know your YouTube Persona or something [2482] like that there are a couple ways to get [2483] there and these are the ways that have [2484] been presented to me essentially at this [2486] point in a B2B Niche so the first thing [2490] that you could do is you could start a [2491] community of some kind and so um many of [2494] you that follow me will know that I've [2496] mentioned this community on um probably [2499] the first like three or four videos that [2501] I posted quite a while ago but this one [2503] is called agency scalers it's a [2504] school.com community and essentially [2506] it's just a free community that allows [2508] people that are growing their agencies [2509] to interact with each other share the [2511] social medias talk about you know things [2513] that they're struggling with and that [2514] sort of deal and ultimately get help [2516] from people as well um this is great but [2519] a ton of these communities will [2520] eventually transition to some type of [2522] paid offering as well so in addition to [2524] having you know the a free community [2525] you'll also have a community for maybe [2527] 15 or 20 or $30 a month at around 10,000 [2530] subscribers assuming that you're doing [2531] it right you probably have somewhere [2534] between a, to maybe 1500 people that [2536] will purchase something that you put out [2538] that's less than 20 or $30 um a month I [2541] want to say uh and so if you do the math [2543] on that you know if you have 1500 people [2544] that like respect and they really value [2546] what you're putting out and you charge [2547] them all $30 a month for access to some [2549] Community or something like that you [2551] know, 1500 time 30 is 45,000 I believe [2555] right yeah 45,000 which is already [2558] extremely valuable and obviously there's [2560] um there's a ton of alpha there that you [2562] know that people [2567] can so assuming you have 10,000 [2569] subscribers you know if you're looking [2571] at I don't know um I think at that level [2574] you're probably realistically going to [2576] have between 5 to a th000 people that [2578] will purchase anything that you put out [2579] that is less than $30 uh so you know if [2582] we're doing $30 and we're saying a th000 [2584] people if a th people sign up for your [2586] community at $30 a month then you're [2588] making $30,000 a month number one and [2590] two you also have a direct channel to [2592] people that have already expressed [2593] interest in wanting to purchase [2594] something from you um and so you you [2596] have a lot of upsell potential so you [2598] can upsell them on I don't know there a [2600] lot of people that ask me for one-on-one [2601] coaching for instance they say Nick like [2604] is there any way we can get uh get on a [2605] call consistently weekly or or can we do [2607] some type of like make tutoring or or [2609] something along those lines um some [2610] people are willing to pay quite a lot of [2612] money and they're willing to throw like [2613] a fair amount of uh Fair number of [2615] Benjamins at me for that sort of thing I [2617] don't personally accept that because [2618] it's not very scalable and my time is [2620] pretty limited enough as is you can [2622] imagine how if you had a community of [2624] people that you know obviously followed [2627] you they liked you they respected you [2628] and you were delivering a ton of value [2629] to it would be a pretty Shortline path [2632] from there to having some very high paid [2634] coaching or consulting or mentorship [2636] offer where people instead of paying $ [2637] 20 or $30 a month are now paying several [2639] thousand a month um to potentially be in [2642] some type of group with you and maybe [2644] talk to you once or twice a week so that [2647] in and of itself is already probably [2648] halfway to about a million dollars a [2650] year um I think if you were to take [2653] advantage of sponsorships and affiliate [2654] offers and stuff like that you could [2656] probably make up that other half now I [2657] haven't talked about sponsorships um [2659] that much but essentially I want to say [2661] once you reach like the 1,000 or 2,000 [2663] subscriber Mark a lot of people will [2665] start reaching out to you saying stuff [2667] along the lines of hey we run a software [2669] platform that is X Y and Z we feel like [2671] your audience would really really be [2672] interested in this sort of thing um [2674] would you be amendable and if so could [2675] you send me over your price sheet and so [2678] when you are like an influencer or [2680] something like that uh you know [2682] influencer marketing is when people will [2683] pay you to advertise their products for [2685] them I haven't done any of this because [2688] I personally feel that that cheapens the [2689] value of what I'm talking about [2691] substantially um and I would only ever [2693] do this if I had a product that I was [2695] planning on talking about that day [2696] anyway and then somebody said hey do you [2698] also want $500 in order you know in [2700] addition to what you were going to talk [2701] about anyway and I I would be like well [2703] do I have to change anything about what [2705] I was going to say they'd be like no I'd [2706] be like okay yeah sure I mean I'm going [2707] to take the free money why the hell not [2709] so you can make a lot of money with the [2711] sponsorship stuff if you think about it [2713] if you're doing you know one video Let's [2715] just say one video every three days so [2716] what's that 10 videos a month and then [2718] every month um you know you have every [2721] video you do one sponsorship and that's [2723] $1,000 which people are willing to pay [2725] once you're at about the 10,000 [2726] subscriber level espe people with Micro [2728] Niche um style products that cater [2731] specifically to your audience you know [2733] you can make an additional $10,000 just [2735] with sponsorships that month if you push [2737] your Affiliates really hard if you uh [2739] negotiate better affiliate rates with [2741] the vendors that you are working with so [2743] if you guys notice in my videos If you [2744] scroll down a little bit right now [2746] you'll see that there are a bunch of [2747] affiliate links like rise and site [2749] ground and that sort of thing these are [2750] all just the standard affiliate links um [2752] I don't have any like special secret [2753] bonuses or anything these are just [2754] affiliate links they give out to people [2756] that are influencers that um you know [2758] have audiences and that you know they [2759] want to incentivize people to sign up [2761] with the influencers link because a lot [2764] of the time there's a discount or some [2765] incentive or [2766] whatever but if you have like a [2768] reasonably um active engaged following [2770] you can actually just Reach Out directly [2771] to these affiliate companies or [2773] companies with affiliate programs you [2774] could say Hey listen I know that you [2776] normally offer 5% but uh I want to [2778] record videos specifically about your [2780] product I'm going to send you a ton of [2781] leads and as a result I want 20% or [2784] something and you know these companies [2786] are in the business of making money just [2787] like anybody else if you send them an [2789] offer of basically giving them a BN like [2792] 80% of a bunch of free money most of [2794] them are going to say yes or you'll be [2795] able to negotiate with them for at least [2796] a substantially higher affiliate rate [2798] than you'd uh you'd get normally which [2800] is quite nice so you can do some of that [2803] obviously um you can also optimize your [2805] content for better AdSense revenue and [2807] that sort of deal um I haven't really [2809] been doing any of that either I'm just [2810] talking to the camera and I'm really [2812] enjoying myself and again I'm trying to [2813] make this a post every single day for as [2815] long as seemly possible sort of a fair [2817] rather than a um you know let's make as [2819] much money as I can in the next 3 months [2820] sort of deal but you can optimize your [2822] content substantially uh by increasing I [2825] don't know if you can increase the ad [2826] roles that are placed but you can like [2829] select where the ads are um you could [2832] talk about specific software products [2833] with higher cpms or RPMs or whatever [2836] they're called you know you have a lot [2838] of options to basically make these minor [2839] optimizations here or there um and then [2842] you know you you can also get [2844] into um obviously the service side of [2847] things you know I mentioned how I was [2848] offering done for you Services I was [2850] offering a bunch of systems I'm offering [2852] like operations Consulting and that sort [2854] of deal so this is what I was doing [2855] before I even started YouTube and so I [2857] figured that it was just a logical [2858] extension to have like a little calendar [2860] booking link and be like hey do you want [2862] me to build you a system if so book a [2863] call with me below and so as a result of [2865] that I've made a fair amount of money [2866] and I've done it quite quickly but you [2868] know you can imagine if you include if [2869] you combine that with some type of [2871] community offer and potentially some [2873] type of mentorship offer or something [2874] like that you know your combined [2875] revenues can very quickly approach the [2876] 80k a month which would be sufficient to [2878] hit you about a million dollar a year um [2880] and it would be a fair amount of work [2882] don't get me wrong but uh you know I [2883] think for the margin for like the [2885] operational complexity of being of of [2887] managing something like that in [2888] comparison to managing like a whole [2889] agency uh from the ground up I think [2892] it's a pretty good deal so yeah that's [2894] what a lot of people are doing I would [2895] say right around my level and that's [2896] something that you would be able to do [2898] probably even before you get to the [2899] 10,000 subscribers um maybe even like 7 [2902] or 8,000 or something so if that sounds [2904] like something you want to do you can [2905] just have 10,000 be your North Star and [2907] then as you work closer towards it you [2908] can worry about monetizing and all that [2910] stuff afterwards um but just know that [2912] you know there are a lot of people that [2912] are leaving a lot of money on the table [2914] myself included and um it's it's really [2916] just what you want out of YouTube and [2918] what you want out of life okay great I [2920] think that's everything that I wanted to [2922] talk about today I realize this is a [2924] mouthful and this is probably a lot more [2925] boring than my other videos because you [2927] just listen to me talk non-stop without [2929] producing a system or anything like that [2931] so hopefully you found this valuable um [2934] if you guys have any questions about my [2935] specific Channel or maybe anything that [2937] I said during the video just drop them [2938] down below as a comment I made this [2940] video specifically because tons of [2942] people have asked me hey Nick can you do [2944] a video on YouTube hey Nick can you talk [2945] about your YouTube growth hey can you [2947] talk about why you grew so much faster [2948] than everybody else so if you guys have [2950] any other requests for videos that are [2951] similar or I don't know tangentially [2954] related to growth online or branding or [2956] anything like that yeah just just leave [2957] a comment down and then I'll uh I'll [2959] attend to it if it makes sense for me to [2961] do so and and when I can otherwise [2963] please like the video please subscribe I [2965] really appreciate everybody that's been [2966] following me up until now and I'm [2967] looking forward to producing that next [2969] one have a great rest of day bye-bye

Title: Watch Me Build An Automated YouTube → Article Generator In 30 Mins
[0] what's going on everybody Nick here and [1] in this video I'm going to develop a [3] Content repurposing system that turns [5] videos into blog posts this is a really [8] fun and interesting system that a lot of [9] people are sort of working through right [11] now on their own and uh a viewer [13] requested it about a week ago I thought [15] I'd dive in and show you exactly how I [17] would build this sort of system out in [18] make.com so as always I'm going to show [20] you everything that I personally would [22] do I'm going to build the system live [24] we're going to do some fun AI rewriting [25] stuff and really the purpose of videos [27] like this is to give you guys the sorts [28] of tcid knowledge [30] that is difficult to explain but easy to [32] see when somebody does it live if that [33] sounds like something interesting to you [35] then stay tuned and let's get into the [39] video all right first things first the [41] video request was made by the lovely at [43] Orange book Clips uh I made a post on [45] YouTube a few days ago just talking [47] about how I was sick as a dog and you [49] know I'm finally back from Prague I'm [51] ready to make some videos do you guys [52] have any requests um one of the ones [53] that was suggested was this podcast [55] content repurpose system I'm [57] operationalizing podcasts here as just [59] YouTube videos sorry I think my laundry [61] is going pretty intensely in the [62] background so hope you guys can't hear [63] that um but by operationalizing podcasts [66] just YouTube videos then this system now [68] doesn't just work on podcasts but it [70] also works on short form content midform [73] content like 20 30 minutes long and [75] really like everything in between so uh [77] that's what we're going to be doing [78] we're going to be making a system that [79] takes uh YouTube videos based off a [81] search term and then converts that into [84] just a bunch of blog posts for you and [86] there are many different ways to convert [88] content into blog posts like there are [89] are extremely complex W ways which I've [92] recorded videos on before where you get [94] very high quality blog posts and there [96] are also simpler ways where you just [97] tell it to write you a blog post I'm [98] going to use a simpler way in this video [100] and then I'm going to link resources [102] that you can use to convert that into [103] the more complicated way later on if you [104] want to um but that's going to be the [106] system from start to finish we're [108] basically going to convert a video like [110] this um from good work which is what [111] does a consultant actually do into a [113] blog post that looks something like this [115] what do consultants actually do the [116] clearest explainer you might ever read [118] Consultants those corporate magicians [120] who appear to own every frequent flyer [122] program and dominate the coffee shops of [123] skyscraper log bees barely visible yet [125] everywhere they managed to be the most [126] intriguing characters in the [127] professional sphere as you can see [129] there's a little bit of that GPT style [131] in there um but for the most part it's [133] uh it's actually pretty reasonable and [135] it's converted the vast majority of the [136] content in the video into like really [139] granular text format which is nice so [141] this is something you'd probably be able [142] to put on a blog or you know in a [145] newsletter or something like that uh and [146] it happened completely automatically so [149] without further do how would I actually [150] go about and build a system like this [152] well great question um I'm a big fan of [154] using the open AI endpoints and so I use [157] them quite often you don't have to use [159] open aai for this stuff but just off the [160] top of my head I know that open AI has [162] basically everything we're going to need [163] here it has the ability to transcribe [165] videos into text which is one that we're [167] going to need and then it also has the [169] ability obviously to like rephrase or [171] repurpose text just using the usual GPT [174] uh for endpoint so that's going to be my [176] Approach here I'm going to start with um [178] you know a YouTube video [180] and uh we we'll just test it with one [182] video and then assuming that that works [183] we're going to build out the rest of the [184] flow so in order to get started I have a [187] make scenario here already set up called [189] convert mp3 to blog post and let's just [191] pretend I haven't added anything here um [194] really the first thing that we need to [195] do if you think about it is we need to [197] test this on just one video because if [198] it works on one video odds are it's [199] going to work on a bunch of videos and [201] um that's sort of how I how I chunk up [202] the problem you know if I'm trying to [204] determine whether or not this is even [205] feasible I'll always just start with a [206] minimum viable product and that minimum [208] viable product in this case is going to [210] be hey can we like make one video into [213] you know a podcast or sorry into a blog [215] post and turns out you can uh if you use [218] one of the many MP3 generator services [221] you can plug in your own video what I've [224] done is I've taken this same video what [225] do consultants do and I've basically [227] plugged it into one of those services [228] and then I've gotten an MP3 file the MP3 [230] file is right over here and I think it's [232] like 96 kilobit a second or something [234] like that and this is just going to be [235] like my my tester file that I'm going to [237] use to build out most of this flow and [239] then ler on we're actually going to plug [240] new videos in um using uh you know a [243] third party scraping tool which I'll [245] walk you guys through in a second but [247] essentially what I've done is I've taken [248] the video and then I put it into one of [249] these MP3 conversion uh Suites and I've [252] downloaded it and then I put it on [253] Google Drive and the reason why I put it [254] on Google Drive is just so it's [255] accessible to me for [257] make.com so if you think about it really [259] the first task here in any type of [260] content repurposing system is we just [262] need to get it in the same format like [263] the content format that we're going to [265] be producing is a blog post and so the [267] content format that we're going to need [269] the video to become is in is in text [272] right so that's what I'm going to do I'm [273] going to find a way to convert this into [275] text and really the first thing I'm [276] going to do is I'm going to give this a [277] click I'll go to the open AI Suite here [279] and then I'm going to scroll down to [281] create a transcription with whisper so [283] this is buil-in support for exactly what [286] we need it for uh with some of the [288] highest quality transcription currently [289] available on the web now if you're [291] unfamiliar with this file format it's [293] okay I'll walk you guys through in a [295] second but basically in order for this [296] to work we need to download a file onto [299] make [300] so make.com Cloud software we need to [302] download it onto their servers and then [304] we can feed that file into um you know [307] whisper and Whisper isn't the only [309] module that requests content like this [312] there are quite a few and if you've ever [314] sort of been mystified about how file [316] data and binary works and stuff don't [318] worry I'll explain it in this video but [320] just setting that aside there are a [322] couple of other parameters we could use [323] here one is um the model type and I [325] believe we can map more model types but [327] right now there's just whisper one [328] available to us then we can also add a [330] prompt and the prompt here is basically [332] just I mean open as say it down here [334] it's optional text to guide the model [336] style or continue a previous audio [337] segment The Prompt must match the [339] language of the audio but in practice I [341] find that this isn't very relevant I'm [343] going to leave response format as the [344] same and then I'm just going to change [345] the temperature to 0.7 I don't actually [347] know if temperature affects the quality [349] of the transcription but I always just [350] change the temperature to about 0.7 [352] because I found the quality of the [353] response are just more what I like uh [355] which is T which tends to be dry kind of [357] more Spartan more straight to the point [359] I'm not going to put a language in [360] either because I've experimented with [362] this before and it's really not that [363] relevant okay so um I'm just going to [367] write a bunch of random stuff here I'll [368] click okay just so we can get that out [370] and now what we need to do is we [371] basically need a way to feed a file in [374] now what I've shown you before is we [375] actually already have a file it's in [377] that Google drive over there so go to [379] Google Drive and then what I need is I [381] need the module called download a file [383] right over here so I'm going to make [385] this the start of our sequence I'll feed [387] it into this module I'm going to give [389] this a click and for now I'm just going [390] to select this myself you can imagine [393] how in the future we're going to map [394] over this because we're going to have a [395] bunch of files but that's okay for now [396] I'm just going to do this myself what [399] I'm going to do is I'm going to choose [400] whisper transcription [402] example and then uh I've already [404] uploaded a video here called what does a [405] consultant actually do I guess it's 128 [407] kilobits per second then press okay and [409] now I'm going to give this a click and [411] when I give this a click you'll see that [412] a new uh line was added here new Option [415] previously we can only map but now we [417] can actually just select the output of a [418] previous download a file module and if [420] we do that it'll automatically go [422] through and then select the file that we [423] are downloading from the previous step [425] so very simple you don't have to deal [426] with like actual binary or mapping or [428] anything like that just very [429] straightforward uh anytime you find a [431] module that has like a file um sort of [434] selector here then just always um you [436] know that somewhere earlier on in the [437] sequence you're going to have to [438] download the file on make.com I always [440] just use the Google Drive download a [441] file module it's really simple okay so [443] now I actually have basically everything [445] I need to turn this into a transcript I [446] have the Google drive folder here and [448] then I have the open AI chat gbt whisper [450] Dolly over here and earlier I was [452] experimenting with this just to make [453] sure that I could um actually produce um [456] one of these so I'm just going [459] to exit and delete out all those and [461] then I'm just going to run this [464] once you'll see that it did download the [466] file successfully now it's sending it to [468] open aai to do the [470] transcription and I will say longer [472] videos can take quite a quite a long [473] time I've experimented with videos up to [475] I think 25 or 30 minutes in length and [477] the average transcription time is [478] something like 30 45 seconds so just [480] keep that in mind basically every 1 [482] minute of video is like another second [483] of transcription this also isn't uh [485] accounting for the time that we're going [487] to take to generate the article [488] afterwards so you know if you're doing a [490] ton of videos you might hit that 45 [492] minute make timeout um but if you guys [494] have seen my previous videos there's [495] also ways around that uh so I'm not [496] going to worry too much about making it [497] perfect in this video but uh but yeah [499] you can always visit some of my other [500] videos if you want to see what that [502] looks like okay so what we have here is [505] this is Rand first things first I'm [506] going to give the Google drive module a [507] click and you'll see that it downloaded [510] the file we have a bunch of like you [513] know file binary and data over here [515] that's what this looks like and we've [517] automatically fed it into this module [520] then what we get is we get um a bunch of [523] text and you see this is actually pretty [524] funny video Consultants they live among [525] us in our cities and our suburbs and [527] fancy airport lounges that look down at [528] poor people I didn't realize it was that [530] funny um any who uh you know this is [533] kind of a comedy video right like it's [535] not super informational you can imagine [536] how for really informational content the [538] quality of this probably be better but [540] okay great so now we basically just have [541] a giant string of text right how do we [543] actually go ahead and convert this into [544] a blog post well as I mentioned earlier [546] there are many ways to do so uh I'm [548] going to do it in a pretty simple way [550] I'm just going to tell gp4 to turn this [551] into a blog post but you can imagine how [554] you know they're increasingly complex [555] ways to add um semantics um you know [558] images you could do editing rewrites [562] essentially this is just meant to [563] provide you something that you can plug [564] into a Content system later on and so [567] these two modules these are just our [568] black box for now and everything from [570] the right of this module is like the [571] actual content production system I've [573] produced a Content production system [575] before that works very very well um so [577] you know you could just plug it into [579] that system if you guys like if you guys [580] want something a little bit more [581] sophisticated but for the purpose of [582] this video I'm just going to write you [585] are a helpful writing [587] assistant then I'm going to have a user [590] prompt that [592] says um below is a transcript from a [595] video we recorded [599] convert this into a blog post in [602] markdown ATX format make it [607] comprehensive and write in a casual [610] Spartan tone of voice so that's [612] literally I'm going to say and then I'm [613] going to click add message I'm going to [615] feed in the um text from here and I've [618] said this on most of my other AI videos [620] but I always follow a design pattern [622] here um the first is always your system [624] prompt and that's where you tell the [625] system how it defines itself sort of [627] like how it identifies us right like [628] identify as a man I identify as a woman [630] I identify as a helpful writing [632] assistant by making this align as [634] closely as humanly possible to um the [638] role that you want it to play the [639] quality of the outputs are so much [640] better so just make sure you do that uh [642] and then after that I do a user prompt [644] where I tell it what I want it to do and [645] then I'll always just you know feed in [648] um example pairs of like a user and then [652] an assistant user and assistant user and [653] assistant now in this case I'm not [655] actually going to go through and write a [656] whole blog post because I've already try [657] and give it a bunch of examples it take [658] me forever ever um but I'm just going to [661] you know sort of leave it at that and [663] then um yeah so I'm feeding in the text [665] on the previous step awesome now that I [667] have these three all I'm going to do is [668] I'm going to give this a quick click and [669] I'll click run once and let's see what [672] happens looks like the Google Drive [674] download a file module worked so that's [680] nice wonderful wonderful this is the [683] transcription which is probably going to [685] take between 7 to 10 seconds [690] we need some hold music one hour [693] later okay great looks like the [695] transcription came through notice it's [697] the exact same transcription as last [698] time so if you're curious or if you're [700] hesitant to use tokens or that sort of [702] thing you could just like get one test [704] sample and then just feed the raw text [705] in as opposed to having to actually go [708] through and make it query at every time [710] but this is sort of like basically the [711] the entire back end of the system so I [713] just wanted to run it from uh start to [717] finish and and then we are also creating [720] that completion lovely awesome and uh if [723] I click on this result module here then [725] we'll see um the actual blog post and [728] this looks pretty long not going to lie [729] I'm using gp4 turbo which is 20244 D9 uh [733] it's pretty pretty long context window [735] normally you don't get blog post this [737] long but yeah looks like uh looks like [739] we have this so what I'm going to do [740] here is just because I want this to be a [742] little bit more readable I'm going to go [743] markdown live preview I'm going to paste [744] this in here this just converts a [746] markdown format which is what all these [748] hashtags are for [749] into um like a format that you can just [752] copy and paste into Google Docs I'm [753] going go to my other thing and I'm just [755] going to paste this in decoding the [757] Enigma of management consulting [759] management consulting firms like BCG [761] Bane McKenzie and doot are surrounded by [762] Halo Prestige and exclusivity accepting [764] only about 1.5% of the nearly 200k [766] applications they receive each year but [768] beyond these statistics and the high [769] walls of fancy airport lounges what [770] exactly do these Consultants do let's [772] dive into the elusive world of [773] management consulting and attempt to [775] untangle this Enigma I don't know if you [777] guys have seen the news but gp4 always [779] uses the word delve I'm happy it didn't [781] use the word delve here it's probably [782] because of the uh the lower temperature [785] great this looks awesome to me it even [786] got uh oh it didn't get the title [788] actually but it would get the title um [790] if this was produced so uh we got a [793] couple of steps now what we could do is [794] we could actually just have it produce a [795] Google [798] doc um instead of outputting it as you [801] know what we just outputed it as [804] so I will um I guess we'll just create a [808] new Google Document by adding the [809] content in HTML [811] format um we could [816] just I don't know I'm just going to [818] leave the name as blank I mean it [819] doesn't really matter that much you [820] could theoretically um select the [824] decoding the Enigma of management or [825] whatever but I'm just going to say like [827] example blog post and then the content [829] notice how it says this parameter [831] supports HTML format so what I'm going [833] to do first let me just set a document [835] location I'm just going to set it in my [837] uh in my main Drive content I'll just go [840] X for now notice how it it's asking for [842] HTML but the output of this is in [845] markdown which is where we have those um [846] number signs for headings so there's a [848] module here called markdown which allows [851] us to go markdown to [852] HTML and what I'm going to do is I'm [854] just going to feed in the previous step [856] and you know because I'm just testing it [857] I want it to run again I'm actually just [858] going to copy this in myself [860] manually I'm going to feed this [863] in and I'm not going to click sanitize I [866] don't think I need to click either of [868] these so I'm just just going to run this [869] and see what [871] happens okay this looks pretty good to [873] me now I'm going to copy all of this [875] text in and then use it to create my [877] example Google doc just to make sure [879] that there are no problems with um any [881] of the modules that I've picked so [885] far then we're going to give this a [887] quick run just make sure that we can [888] actually generate Google Docs with [890] this there's a web view link here that I [893] can then copy and paste and this will [895] allow me to dump in okay great so now [898] this looks like uh now we have a [899] pipeline which automatically converts [900] into a Google doc um I'll notice that [902] the I don't really like the formatting [904] um now that I'm looking at this like I [905] don't like the fact that the paragraphs [908] are just stacked on top of each other um [910] you can make this look sexier by adding [912] your own formatting so 1.5 and then [914] maybe space after paragraph that looks a [916] lot nicer already maybe I want inter [918] font I'm a big fan of that uh what you [921] could do is if you wanted to [922] automatically have this be formatted in [924] a really nice and sexy way is instead of [925] using the Google Docs create a document [927] module you could use the create a [929] document from a template module and then [931] what you do is you would create like a [933] base template and then you would apply [935] all of your styling to that and then you [936] would you know fill in um the HTML using [939] the same approach that I just told you [941] so that'll allow us to achieve the [942] similar result with a higher quality [943] looking end result but sorry uh higher [945] looking end document but I don't really [947] think that's relevant for the purpose of [948] this most people are probably not even [950] really going to want this in a Google [951] doc um just my own personal preference [953] but Okay cool so what I'm going to do [955] now is I'm just going to replace all of [957] this with the actual variables [961] nice um and then we know now that this [964] section of our flow works that's that's [966] great but that's not all we don't just [968] want a system that converts a single [970] blog post that we have already [972] downloaded the mp34 and then turn that [974] into um you know like a piece of textual [977] content ideally we want a system that we [979] can just feed in like a search term into [981] YouTube or something we just say like I [982] don't know Consulting and then it could [985] go through a list of [987] videos select videos for US based off of [990] some feature or parameter and then [992] convert every one of those videos into [993] some blog post if you imagine that's how [996] um a lot of kind of content companies [998] already work they'll look to see what's [1000] trending on one platform and then [1002] they'll just like try and repurpose the [1004] content that maybe somebody else has [1005] produced and then spice it up a little [1007] make it a little better that sort of [1008] deal so if you were a big content [1009] company maybe you would do this um and [1011] then you would generate a bun of these [1012] drafts and then you would send these [1014] drafts to your writers and be like hey [1015] let's make this even better so like [1017] let's add another angle to this make [1019] this something that's you know 10% [1020] improved version of the previous content [1023] any who I'm going on a limb here but um [1027] now that we're done with a single [1030] example let's find a way to turn this [1032] into you know that more General purpos [1034] system that I mentioned earlier where we [1036] can just feed in a search term and then [1037] it can go and it can grab us a bunch of [1038] Articles now in order for this to work [1040] we're going to need um an additional [1042] platform and a platform that I really [1044] really like for this is called apify [1046] apify is something that integrates [1048] natively inside make.com uh it's just [1050] super high throughput super high yield [1052] it's a very very good platform and I use [1053] it for the vast majority of honestly my [1056] uh my automation needs outside of make [1058] um so I know for a fact that there is a [1062] um actor they call it here appropriately [1065] named uh which allows us to jump in add [1068] a search term and then pull up a list of [1070] YouTube videos that we can then [1072] essentially get as a list of Json over [1075] here um inside of that we will have the [1078] URL we will have um you know the text of [1083] the title uh we don't get all the texts [1085] we get like the text of the description [1087] we get description links we get a bunch [1089] of stuff um and you know I think I think [1091] for a lot of people stuff like this [1093] could be [1094] enough oh sorry you know what I realized [1096] that this is the wrong [1098] scraper okay and so I know for a fact [1100] that there is a apify actor which is [1104] appropriately named which allows us to [1106] take a bunch of links and then pass them [1109] in and then have those links converted [1111] essentially into um You Know MP3 files [1114] which is great for us and then the [1115] second that we have them as MP3 fils we [1117] can just feed them into the system um so [1119] in order for this to work we're going to [1120] need another one which allows us to [1122] basically just put a search term in this [1124] one is also appropriately named uh it [1125] allows us to plug a search term in and [1127] then just get a list of YouTube videos [1129] and so we're sort of going to use these [1130] two in conert we're going to get a list [1131] of YouTube videos and then we're going [1132] to pump them into this and this is going [1133] to get us a bunch of MP3s uh so pretty [1135] cool stuff now you'll notice that both [1136] of these have costs pay $5 for for 1,000 [1139] videos 3 days trial than $9 a month for [1141] instance um so just keep that in mind [1143] when you sign up for these services like [1144] you know being able to do this sort of [1146] thing at scale um a thousand times [1148] faster than a human obviously isn't free [1150] uh but because they have a trial I can [1151] just go in and then you know give this a [1152] quick little sign up and and do it on my [1154] end [1156] so um I don't think I've actually signed [1159] up [1159] before with this so I'm just going [1164] to create my own account we'll just call [1167] this Nick daddy now no I'm just Kidd [1169] call this Nick s apparently my username [1171] is mustard [1173] question and then we'll do no code [1175] Integrations and then okay I got to go [1178] grab my [1180] email so I'm going to verify this [1184] here awesome awesome great great great [1187] looks like I'm in um for my personal [1188] account so two that I want to use here I [1191] don't just want to use this this is just [1192] going to be my intro um the other one [1195] that I want to use is this so I'm just [1198] going to copy this link address and [1200] because I'm in a different tab I have to [1201] paste it in over here which sort of [1202] annoying but whatever okay great I got [1205] two here um awesome so the search term [1208] that I want for the purposes of this is [1209] just Consulting and I'm just going to [1212] like test this out um here uh we're just [1215] going to do let's do five videos for now [1217] I don't want it to run a bunch we don't [1219] have direct URLs we're not going to [1221] worry about that scraping subtitles oh [1222] we might be able to script the subtitles [1224] that'd be pretty cool if we [1226] could H I don't know if we can do [1232] that huh I mean if we can do this in [1234] plain text then we're only going to need [1235] one right we're not going to need two so [1236] I'm going to I'm going to give this a [1237] try that'd be pretty cool uh filtering [1239] and sorting for search I mean we're [1241] setting all these terms manually here [1243] but um you can imagine how you can set [1244] them all automatically I'm just going to [1247] leave them as is channel sorting [1249] filtering run options okay great I'm [1252] just going to click save and start now [1254] that's as easy as it is when you use [1256] appify all you do is just set a couple [1258] of parameters ERS uh if you're using a [1259] pre-built actor then you know just click [1261] Start and then it'll go through [1264] basically whip up a web server somewhere [1266] um using best proxy practices and that [1268] sort of thing and then it'll go through [1269] and then scrape the um you know the data [1271] source so that's quite nice it says [1273] finish total six requests six succeeded [1276] zero failed and then it looks like we [1278] have a bunch of videos which is quite [1279] nice we have the ongoing crisis in [1281] Mackenzie home bar demand dropping fast [1282] Zill CEO she's 2024 Market warning I'm [1284] put in consulant for 3 months while I'm [1285] taking a break for Steve Jobs and [1286] Consulting what does a consultant [1287] actually do love [1289] something else that I really like is [1290] this says a duration here so if you only [1292] wanted videos over a certain length you [1294] could easily add a filter and you could [1296] say I only want videos over 10 minutes [1298] in which case you know all these other [1299] ones would be filtered out and then we'd [1300] have the home buyer demand dropping fast [1302] one you could also feed this into Ai and [1305] you could have it um filter just like [1307] without keywords you could have it just [1308] say hey I want videos about this um you [1311] know if the video isn't about this then [1313] just like return false or something so [1315] there's there's a lot of freedom that [1316] you have with data in this way but okay [1318] great we just ran this on apify oh uh [1321] let me actually see if there's um my [1323] subtitles as [1325] well let's jump through here yeah okay [1328] so it doesn't look like there are any [1329] subtitles I figured because um being [1331] able to scrape the subtitles would just [1332] be too good and it would make my life [1334] too easy so we do have to pass this into [1335] another [1336] um you know another another video and [1339] that's fine we have the sorry another [1341] modol that's fine so we have the URL [1342] over here that's good so what we're [1344] going to do now is we're going to go [1345] back to [1346] make and I'm going to set up an [1347] integration between [1350] apify and there are a couple things that [1351] we could do we could run an actor so I'm [1354] just going to show you what that looks [1355] like in case you guys have never seen [1356] this [1357] before and I have to add my new one here [1361] oh I have to add an API token that's [1362] kind of [1364] annoying [1366] um let me see if this is something that [1369] I can [1371] um [1372] rotate CU in the last video I tried uh [1377] doing this without an AP key that I [1379] could rotate and it was the [1381] worst okay we're going to do example [1384] video API [1386] token nice oh and then I can delete this [1388] fantastic so I'm going to copy this API [1391] key go back here I'm going to paste it [1393] in and then I'm going to say this is my [1397] example YouTube video repurposing system [1402] key and then from here I can then just [1405] delete it later which is nice the actor [1407] that I'm going to select for this is [1408] YouTube scraper that's one that's set up [1411] um run synchronously uh this is a term [1414] that basically allows us just to run it [1417] right here and now um the maximum time [1420] up for the run is 120 seconds which just [1421] means if it takes longer than 120 [1423] seconds then it's not actually going to [1425] return any data but in our case I'm just [1427] assuming that we're going to run this [1428] once every I don't know maybe like [1429] several times a day but we're only going [1431] to do 10 results at a time or something [1432] like that which is pretty [1434] simple and then here we can actually [1436] like specify the input Json uh so if we [1438] go back to the other tab here where we [1441] had our run and then we go to input [1445] you'll see that there's actually um a [1447] Json ja or JavaScript object [1450] notation input that's provided and this [1452] was the text or Json or code version of [1455] just those little fields that I changed [1456] earlier where I said hey I want the [1458] keyword to be Consulting I want the [1460] subtitles to be in plain text right so [1464] um for my input I'm going to put all of [1465] these and I just noticed that download [1467] subtitles is false for for some reason [1468] I'm going to try setting that to trial [1469] see what happens and then I'm not going [1472] to worry about build I'm not going to [1473] worry about timeout uh I'm not going to [1475] worry about memory because I think [1477] that's just going to pick the [1479] default so um notice how I'm pie wising [1483] this and I'm testing at every step like [1485] when I did the Google Drive stuff I [1487] tested it with one file and then I [1489] tested it on the same data over and over [1491] and over again with the apify stuff I [1493] actually tested it on apify then I [1494] confirmed that it worked on apify so I [1496] took the API apify configuration and I [1498] put it on make now I'm going to test [1499] that it works on make the reason why I [1501] do this is so that I don't just make a [1503] bunch of assumptions that the system is [1504] going to work or that these API [1506] endpoints are all perfect or whatever [1507] I'm basically building up my knowledge [1509] almost like a staircase uh building up [1511] these systems um so that I just know [1513] that like the data is solid and sound at [1514] every possible step and this is how I [1517] usually build out these systems I'll [1518] just start with some type of raw test [1520] data and then I'll test it successively [1522] and iteratively and then I'll just add [1524] element to element to this so that by [1526] the end of the flow I'm not spending s [1527] hours testing I've already spent most of [1529] my testing time just building it um I [1530] know that it's going to work and then [1532] you know it's just much [1533] faster great this one looks like it's [1536] succeeded uh let's check out [1539] the um oh actually I don't think we get [1542] the data from this I think we actually [1544] have to go and like collect the [1546] data yeah we have to make another call I [1548] realized now and that call has to be [1550] like get data or something get data set [1552] items so that's sort of annoying um but [1554] whatever I'll just run it again okay the [1556] data set ID is should be able to feed it [1560] in [1561] here default data set ID I believe [1564] that's what that's going to be data [1566] transformation clean format Json limit [1568] 100 that sounds good to me um let's run [1570] this one more time and again this is [1572] actually going out and running that web [1574] service that's scraping um results right [1576] now so if we had selected um don't run [1580] synchronously then this would have just [1582] instantly sorry if we had selected um [1585] don't run asynchronously this would have [1586] instantly succeeded and then we would [1588] have had to collect the data um [1590] ourselves [1593] afterwards okay this looks good okay [1597] yeah and we actually could get um we [1600] actually did get uh subtitles which is [1602] nice so we don't actually have to do [1603] anything else we just turn these [1604] subtitles into blog posts we're [1606] basically already done then uh let me [1608] just check the other ones [1612] here okay this looks [1616] good A lot of Squarespace at [1618] ads um at the end of the video they're [1621] saying buy so I'm assuming this is [1622] getting all of the [1624] subtitles yeah this looks good to me [1627] okay great so uh now what do we do once [1629] we have these data set items um we [1631] actually already have the transcripts [1633] right the subtitles so we don't actually [1635] need our our whisper step anymore um so [1637] I was just assuming that we'd have to [1638] convert into MP3 but what we can [1640] actually do is we can just unlink this [1641] I'm going to keep this because I don't [1643] necessarily like deleting all of my [1644] modules immediately I like um holding on [1646] to them [1649] and then I'm going to feed this into [1650] open a [1652] GPT and then what I'm going to do is [1654] I'll feed in these subtitles here in [1656] plain [1659] text and let me can I set this to one [1663] result just set this to one result to [1666] start and then um because you know the [1671] thing about YouTube sub subtitles is uh [1672] realistically the quality of like the [1674] automatically generated subtitles is [1675] usually a little bit lower than the [1676] actual transcript um I don't think they [1678] use whisper under the hood they use [1680] something else and it's just not as good [1681] so we may have to add another module in [1683] between the get the subtitles and then [1686] produce the content uh we may have to do [1688] something like hey this is a transcript [1689] of a video if something doesn't make [1691] sense then like fill in the blanks but [1693] we we'll see how this looks U my [1695] intuition is that this will work [1696] okay now I've set this to only grab one [1699] result so it's only going to you know go [1701] and pick one this time instead of the [1702] five and the reason why I'm doing that [1703] is I'm just verifying that this whole [1704] flow works for one result before I do [1706] multiple [1708] it did then uh get the data set what [1711] does a consultant actually do looks like [1713] it got two different types of subtitles [1715] oh there's user generated and there's um [1718] other one great this is actually the [1720] same video that I did the example on so [1722] this is [1724] fantastic it's now going out and [1726] creating that blog post which is [1729] nice and then just converting it to HTML [1732] now it's going out and creating a [1735] document we got a web view link right [1737] here so I'm going to copy that open a [1738] new tab paste it in let's check [1741] it [1743] nice okay great you know we ran into a [1746] couple issues here um again the [1748] formatting just doesn't look super good [1750] uh but that's because I haven't gone out [1751] and you know fixed it um by using the [1754] template [1755] thing the content quality looks pretty [1758] solid honestly I think um just reducing [1760] the temperature was all we really needed [1762] to do you know people complain about how [1764] weird and dumb gpt's gotten recently but [1767] uh I think it's just because they they [1769] change the default temperature to one [1772] and uh you know you're much better off [1773] of something like 0.6 [1774] 0.7 okay awesome so now we have a [1776] Content generation machine essentially [1778] uh what you can do is you could um let's [1781] say we have like a Google sheet we could [1783] add a Google sheet before this and then [1785] in the Google sheet we just have a list [1786] of Search terms and then you know the [1788] system could just pull a search term [1790] from the Google sheet use that to feed [1792] into apify you know you would have a [1795] variable over here with like whatever [1799] Google sheet [1801] keyword and then it would use that [1803] variable and then on every run it would [1804] go and grab a new keyword and then um it [1807] would just produce a bunch of blog posts [1808] and you could you know create a Google [1809] drive to house the specific blog post [1811] you could do a lot with this you could [1813] also feed this into as I mentioned [1814] earlier I have like a much more [1815] sophisticated content system you can [1817] produce some images there's basically an [1819] unlimited amount of things that you [1821] could do to improve the content quality [1823] now I will just preface this before I [1825] wrap up the video that you know I I run [1827] a content company seven figure content [1829] company um AI generating content and [1832] then just posting it on the internet the [1834] quality that you get or the results that [1836] you get from that is usually [1837] substantially lower than if a human [1839] being just looked over it for like five [1840] minutes and so what I personally do in [1842] practice is we will generate a lot of [1844] content using AI but a human being will [1846] be involved in the process just at at [1848] some point regardless of how quick or [1851] how low cost or how high cost the [1852] content is um because just having a a [1855] human being simply be a part of the [1856] process um reading something from top to [1859] bottom adding just a little bit of [1860] additional detail or whatever that's [1861] really the 8020 here where by having a [1864] human do that you get to beat a bunch of [1866] like the AI content detectors you get to [1868] make the content like a lot more [1869] interesting semantically relevant to the [1872] audience and you know maybe add a couple [1873] images or whatever um that's definitely [1876] the 820 and I'd recommend if you guys [1877] are doing a Content repurposing system [1879] like this just always have a human in [1880] the loop it sounds nice being able to a [1882] generate a trillion blog posts but I've [1884] done a ton of experiments at this point [1886] with the ability of that content to rank [1888] or the ability of that content to engage [1890] an audience and it's just nowhere near [1892] as valuable as if you had a human in the [1893] loop so instead of spending $200 for [1896] blog post now you can spend five right [1898] but just make sure you still spend that [1899] five make sure there's still a person [1901] somewhere in that process okay great [1903] thanks so much for watching this video I [1904] hope you guys enjoyed if you have any [1905] questions about this leave it down as a [1907] comment below likewise if you have any [1909] other video requests or you guys want [1911] systems I Source

the same [1920] time it's like it's like a double whammy [1922] it also does and solves a problem that [1923] you guys really want solved so I [1925] consider a win-win otherwise please like [1928]

Title: Watch Me Build A $10K High-Ticket Email System In 1 Hour (2/2)
[0] what's going on guys Nick here this is [1] the second part of my cold email system [4] Outreach video I suck at Premier Pro so [6] for some reason I got cut off last night [8] but say lovey [11] enjoy so you can imagine you feed 2,500 [14] emails in um you're going to get [16] probably sorry 2,500 leads in you're [17] going to get about 1,00 emails 1,500 [20] emails a day that's a lot of people um [22] you're going to need a ton of mailboxes [23] in order to satisfy that but obviously [25] that's you know more people than most um [28] most whole sales teams are probably able [29] to process so you're you're probably [31] okay with that any who uh awesome so we [33] have that so what do we need to do next [35] well we need to sort of if you think [37] about it um there are two cases here the [39] first case is that we don't find an [40] email and if we don't find an email who [42] cares right I'm just going to make this [44] very quick and dirty I'm not going to [45] worry too much about like saving the [47] contact for later because I don't really [49] think it's worth it there just so many [50] leads out there that I don't give a crap [52] I'm just going to have the VA drag and [54] drop another thing in right if you think [56] about it from the perspective of the [57] company owner um so so I'm I'm not going [60] to worry about doing anything unless an [62] email address is found and it's valid [64] luckily for us there's a very simple and [65] easy way to do that if you just go to [66] data there's a success variable that is [68] set to either true or false like that [70] last one so what I'm going to do is [72] depending on the presence of this check [75] um if it's true then I'll continue and [77] then I will do some email enrichment uh [79] like personalization with AI and then if [81] it's false then I'm not going to [83] continue so yeah not exactly rocket [85] science pretty straightforward um so why [88] don't we get a GPT 4 open a module [92] here and what I'm going to do now is I'm [94] basically going to feed in the whole [95] LinkedIn profile uh to open Ai and then [97] I'm just going to say something along [98] the lines of hey based off this LinkedIn [100] profile I want you to create a oneline [102] personalized Icebreaker um that just [105] like a warm introduction to this person [107] and then in the sequence for instantly [109] uh which is the cold emao platform we're [110] just going to set a variable called [112] Icebreaker and then that's where the um [114] introduction is going to go and now that [116] I'm thinking about it um we might not [118] even need the high first name [120] we might just be able to do Icebreaker [122] and then we'll have the AI do the high [123] first name as well because if I go back [126] to this lead list you'll see that a [127] bunch of people here have like weird [129] spellings of their name like Sheldon is [131] Sheldon all [133] caps uh and so I could probably bundle [136] in both the email personalization along [139] with like reformatting of the name and a [141] single API call which is kind of neat [144] there are a lot of Nicks [145] here probably very [147] handsome Okay so so yeah that's what I'm [150] going to do um how exactly do we do that [153] well I'm going to set this open AI [154] module the method I'm going to use is [156] the chat completion um I probably have [158] very different modules or models to what [160] you have uh simply because of my rate [162] limits and um the fact that I've had GPT [165] access for a very long time now you may [167] also be watching this in the year 2029 [169] in which case you you probably win U but [171] I'm just going to use GPT Ford turbo and [174] then for Max tokens I'm going to set [175] this to like 250 or something and then [178] let's get into the real magic which is [179] the messaging first I'll write roll [182] system and then um what I'll always do [184] in this case is I'll just um have the [186] model identify itself as like somebody [188] smart who does writing so you are a [190] helpful intelligent writing assistant [192] that's what I'm going to have it [194] say you don't have to say you're a [196] helpful intelligent writing assistant I [197] just find that it helps uh it's a lot [200] more helpful when you tell it it's a [202] helpful intelligent writing assistant [203] you could say it's an email assistant [205] you could say it's like a I don't know [206] cold Outreach assistant you can do [207] whatever you want but generally speaking [209] this is just the biggest bang for your [210] buck just have it self-identify as [213] somebody smart um message two I'll go [216] over to user and now I'm going to [217] provide it instructions so I'm going to [221] say um [224] write a [227] personalized ice breaker to be used in a [230] cold [232] email yeah that sounds good um we'll say [237] use the provided LinkedIn [241] profile as [243] information I'll say B [245] succinct [247] casual and use a Spartan tone of [252] voice respond in Json only there you go [255] that sounds uh pretty reasonable to me [257] it's probably already going to work [258] great we're probably not going to have [259] to do a lot of fine-tuning and then I do [261] a design pattern where I'll do system [263] then I'll do user with instructions and [264] then I'll do user with an example and [266] then I'll do assistant with with the [268] result and then I'll do user example [269] assistant result user example assistant [271] result I'll just do that as many times [273] as I feel is necessary in order to get a [274] good result from the model and the way [277] that I want this model to think is I [279] want this model to basically just be [280] like a database or an API endpoint where [282] I will send it Jason and then it will [284] respond with you know what I want it to [286] respond with so what I'm going to do is [288] I'm just going to pull all of the [289] information from this Google sheet um [292] that I have here so like I will [295] say um first uh let's do full name [299] actually [301] and then I'll put in the person's full [304] name and then I'll [306] do company name and then I'll feed in [309] the company [311] name and then I'll do let's do title and [314] then I'll feed in the title like I [315] basically just want to dump all the [317] stuff in there um keep mind you don't [319] have to use Json format for this but I I [321] just really like it because [324] um kind of a nerd no cuz it's uh a lot [328] more straightforward I would say to talk [329] to models in this like code way than it [333] is to use um natural language honestly [337] and then by doing this uh it also [339] improves the probability that when the [340] model responds it'll respond in like [341] perfect [343] Json and then um yeah I'm going to [345] include the company location as well and [348] then I'll say person location here uh [350] just cuz the word location is a little [351] bit vague and [354] then we could like feed the image into [356] AI if we wanted to but I don't know that [358] to me seems like a little a little bit [359] of an [360] Overkill um yeah there should be more [362] than enough information for us to do [363] some personalization uh why don't I [365] paste this and go to Json for.org little [368] hack [370] here uh I'm going to click format [372] beautify yeah that looks good uh [374] basically if you want to very quickly [376] check whether or not your Json works I [377] just copy and paste it into um a free [380] service called Json formatter and then I [381] click format and then it also like [383] returns it in a nice and sexy way that I [384] can copy and paste back into my um into [387] my service uh and then that way I just [389] have like the nice spacing and all that [390] fun stuff so yeah that's what I'm doing [392] so anyway um oh I just realized that I'm [395] actually supposed to do an example [396] aren't I [398] uh yeah that's annoying okay whatever [401] I'll just do a bunch [405] more I don't know how many examples I'm [407] going to do but um I'm just going to [409] copy this and then I'll make this like [411] the last user prompt uh sorry this is [414] the actual data that I'm going to be [415] providing right but in this case I [416] actually just want to train it on data [418] that I'm I'm bringing up so um the [421] simplest way to should train is just by [423] using actual data so um I'm just going [426] to use actual data here from this fella [429] and then I'm just going to remove it [431] from the sample [433] later the title is going to be founder [436] and [438] CEO oops I keep on all tabbing the other [440] way I apologies um [444] summary oh now that I'm thinking about [446] this these summaries are probably [448] multi-line right yeah yeah so since [450] these summaries are multi-line um [452] something you you should know is that [454] when um you're dealing with multi-line [457] data and you're attempting to send or [458] receive in Json it'll tell you that it's [460] improperly [461] formatted um this doesn't really matter [463] all that much because we're just [465] sending [467] like uh gp4 isn't actually an endpoint [470] so it doesn't actually care if our [471] Jason's Mis formatted right we're not [472] sending this to an API well we are [474] sending this to an API but I guess the [476] point I'm making is it doesn't actually [477] matter that this is um unformatted but [479] for best practice purposes I should [481] probably format this correctly like if I [483] paste this [484] in [485] um you know there won't be any problem [489] if I do it that [491] way okay I think I know what I'm going [493] to [494] do uh I'm going to go back [497] here and then um I don't think I can [501] actually save this because I need to add [503] messages okay so I'm going to delete all [504] these first then I'll solve the problem [507] that uh that I was talking about in a [508] second the way that I'm going to do it [510] is I'm going to create a [511] new um module and I'm going to use the [514] set multiple variables module I'm going [516] to automatically readjust the flow and [519] then I'm just going to feed in all of [520] the information that I fed in before but [522] I'm just going to do it um here and that [524] way I can do a bunch of stuff and cool [526] like text functions without it really [528] mucking up the um the rest of my flow so [531] anyway uh I'm going to do full name [533] first and then I'll do company [536] name uh let's just start feeding in [538] these variables we'll do full name we'll [540] do company [541] name what happened to me I didn't used [543] to be anywhere near this [546] meticulous okay we'll do title and we'll [548] feed in the title and then uh we'll do [552] summary and then we'll feed in the [557] summary and then what else did I do I [559] think I did title description I'm feed [562] in the title [565] description and then we also did uh [568] company location I think and then we'll [570] feed in the company [572] location then I believe I believe I also [574] did person [575] location and we'll feed in just the I [578] think it's called the location variable [579] okay great and I'm just going to save [582] that by clicking okay and I'm going to [583] go back here and then what I really care [585] about are these summaries um I'm just [587] going to replace all um empty uh new [591] lines with um spaces [593] instead but that's not really going to [595] matter and then now that I'm thinking [597] about it too I'm also going to replace [599] all quotes um with single quotes this is [603] just good to get in the habit of doing [605] and then I think that I should also [606] probably do this for the title [610] description oh that's annoying sometimes [613] when you cut uh text and make it [615] doesn't um preserve it from one field to [618] the other and then I don't think it's [620] I'm going to worry about it for company [621] location because it's probably like a [622] oneline field person location probably [624] on line field um title you know we might [628] as well replace title [633] too um that's good and then company name [636] I don't think that I'll have any quotes [637] in it full name it shouldn't have any [638] quotes in it unless the person's [642] crazy and then um we're just going to [645] say like Escape new lines and quotes [647] there you go okay now that we have that [649] formatted we can actually go in and then [652] I'm going to replace all of [654] this with my nicely formatted variables [657] that I don't actually have to jump in [658] and then [660] sort of muck up this [663] um gp4 module instead I can Muck up you [666] know the make a variable module instead [669] we sort of abstracted away all of that [671] complexity right okay fantastic now that [674] I've done that I can actually go to you [675] know training my module or um providing [678] training examples so first things first [681] I'm going to copy this and I'll put this [682] down to message content and then now I'm [684] just going to do message um assistant [687] Pairs and then um what I'm going to do [689] is I'm just going to copy over real live [690] data and then I'm just going to write [692] like you know three or four of these U [695] myself and I keep on alt tabing the [698] wrong way so I'm just going to jump back [699] here and then hopefully this way um it's [701] not going to be really confusing when [702] you guys watch this video at 17 times [705] speed like yall probably [708] do okay title founder and CEO uh here's [711] the summary so I'm just going to feed [712] the summary [714] in and then here's the title description [720] and then uh here's the company [725] location and then here's the [727] location okay awesome so assuming that [730] we feed this as the input what do we [731] want the model to Output let's go into [733] assistant I just want one um variable [736] called Icebreaker and then uh let's just [741] say hey whatever the person's first name [744] is so [745] Jamie and then uh I'm going to need some [748] new lines here um um if I try and do new [750] lines uh it'll break the Json as I [752] mentioned before so you can sort of do a [753] hack with this by adding back SL ends [756] and then you can just regenerate the new [757] lines later so I'll say hey Jamie you [760] know enter enter so now I have hey Jamie [762] with a space like a new line in between [764] the hey Jamie and then the next part and [766] then um I just need to write something [768] that's pretty customized [771] so let's see um he is host of the [775] metaverse podcast okay great this is [776] awesome when I see stuff like this is [778] quite valuable because it's uh you know [781] you can imagine if you're somebody [783] that's getting a cold email and [784] somebody's like hey man love your [785] podcast um I'm also on the convergence [787] of you know blockchain and Ai and VR and [791] I that kind of spoke to me so I thought [793] I'd reach out like you're much much much [795] more likely to get back to that person [797] right so I'm gonna I'm going to write [798] something like [799] that love your podcast let's do mate [803] because he's presumably in the UK that's [805] another layer of [807] customization I'd consider [810] myself [812] on at the intersection of AI of [817] blockchain AI and VR as well and figured [821] I'd reach out cool so you know in Jim's [825] mind he'll probably see this and be like [826] oh wow that person actually read through [828] my LinkedIn they understand me uh you [831] know I'm actually going to give this [832] email the second that it deserves and [834] this is how we achieve the really high [835] response rates right we provide [837] something that you know we would only [838] really know if we'd actually done the [840] research um and generally speaking good [842] rule of thumb for this is you just want [843] to stay away from stuff like about about [845] the main company um because people's not [848] alarm Bells but people are usually a [849] little bit more skeptical if you just [851] like cite a bunch of information about a [852] business uh but if you can find a way to [854] like grab some personal nuggets you know [856] he runs a podcast which isn't really [857] personal but it's a lot more personal [859] than his real business if you can find a [861] way to grab those personal nuggets then [862] your response rate is going to be so [863] much higher so yeah that's one example [866] and then let's actually add one more and [869] then I think it'll do pretty well we'll [871] add a user assistant [872] pair and then what I'm going to do is [875] just paste in what I added before into [877] the user part just paste in what I added [880] before and the assistant part as [882] well and then I'm just going to you know [885] do the next person on my list um this is [887] going to be a good example because [887] there's a lot less information I don't [889] think they have a summary do [891] they yeah they do have um they do have [895] one I am Chris sorage a managing partner [897] with storage travels awesome so what [899] I'll do here is I'll say what the [902] person's name was [904] Chris Christopher [908] Sorge and [909] then his company name is sword of [912] travels and then his title is managing [916] partner paste that [919] in and then I'll go back to my lead list [921] and then I just need to copy that [923] summary in and then a couple of other [924] fields and then I can actually write it [926] out [930] okay this go are very long summary [931] that's unfortunate there's going to be a [933] little bit of [934] um you know more token usage on the AI [937] side but hey is what it is then title [940] description I'll feed that in as well [943] let's go right over [945] here and then I'll do um company [949] location is going to be empty so that's [951] okay and then location like his location [953] is going to be campill Pennsylvania so [955] I'm just going to leave this empty and [957] then personal location is going to be [959] Campo Pennsylvania awesome um let's see [961] you know what personalization I could [962] use there um he says he's Chris a [965] managing partner with s travels for full [967] server travel [971] agency iot [974] Solutions web 3 space Quantum [978] Computing wow okay this guy's extremely [982] intimidating this guy's Jimmy Neutron [986] brain um well think about this so we [990] could reference Evo travel but I think [992] it' probably be better if I reference [994] something to do with [995] um first of all I'm going to use Chris [997] his short form version of the name even [999] though his first name is as listed as [1000] Christopher because this is probably [1002] going to be considered uh more casual [1004] and he's probably just going to like [1005] think that you [1006] know uh like we're not doing formal [1009] business correspondence maybe we're a [1010] friend of a friend or something which is [1012] valuable and then I'll say love your [1015] history [1020] um history I don't [1024] know okay I've also draft and published [1026] a study on an IT analysis of sexual [1028] assault kit tracking systems for the [1029] Commonwealth of [1032] Pennsylvania um let's [1037] do I'll say [1040] red through your [1045] bio you have such an interesting [1049] background not the best but it's not the [1053] worst [1056] um blockchain Times [1060] travel [1063] times Commonwealth of Pennsyvania is [1065] that uh let me just Google that really [1069] quickly is that like a state or [1072] something yeah interesting [1083] um let's do blockchain Times travel [1085] times Quantum [1090] Computing government is pretty [1094] wild I think we have similar [1097] interests so I figured I'd reach out [1100] okay great so you know not the best [1102] Icebreaker I probably ever written in my [1104] life but uh not the worst either I think [1106] that would still probably Merit an open [1108] and then you can do which a lot of [1109] people don't realize in make is you can [1110] rearrange um objects just by dragging [1112] and dropping um that little button on [1114] the on the right hand side here and so [1116] that's what I've done so now if we look [1118] through our AI sort of like training we [1120] start off with the system prompt that [1122] says you're a helpful intelligent [1123] writing assistant we then do the user [1125] which provides instructions we then have [1127] um another user prompt where we start [1129] doing the essentially like example and [1132] then solution for the assistant and then [1134] another example and then the solution [1136] with the assistant we finally we have [1138] like our last um request which is with [1140] actual live data uh and then you know [1142] we'll have the AI respond with Max [1144] tokens at 250 so that sounds pretty good [1146] to me couple things that we need to do [1148] if we want this to work I'm just [1150] realizing [1152] here is [1154] um just going to jump into the specific [1158] lead list here and then I'm going to [1160] delete the first two records because if [1164] you think about it we've already fed [1165] that into AI as a training example so we [1167] don't really want this to be you know [1169] part of the um part of the actual set [1173] and then what I want to do is I just [1173] want to test this um so I'm going to [1175] have a filter here and then I'll say if [1179] valid and then if success is equal to [1183] all lowercase true then continue um and [1187] then why don't we just try this [1188] on you know it's probably going to do a [1191] bunch of API calls so we want to make [1192] sure that at least one of them is valid [1194] um I'll just do let's do five [1199] I'll do five and then I'll just um have [1201] it run once and then assuming that it [1203] runs once I'll I'll stop it right after [1205] that so we'll move the um trigger over [1208] to the Google Sheets Bros module and [1210] then we'll just run it oh sorry there's [1213] one more thing I need to [1214] do let me force stop that I need to go [1217] over here and change this example data [1219] into actual data so I'll go [1222] company then I'll go full [1225] name [1227] um that's sort of annoying man this [1229] Anthony day guy has an emoji in his name [1231] so it's a terrible example I don't think [1233] he'll be able to find [1235] anything yeah we should process that [1238] too okay I'm just going to run this as [1240] is and then after I'm going to put in [1242] another GPT module that basically just [1245] processes the the full name to make it [1246] so that we don't have to deal with that [1248] problem [1249] anymore because um yeah you know just [1252] from the top of my head I think if you [1253] were to feed in emojis into one of these [1256] email validation tools they probably [1257] wouldn't come up with anything [1259] so the first you know result was a wash [1261] second result was a wash third result [1262] was a wash yeah looks like only the [1264] fifth result made it um which is sort of [1267] unfortunate but any who uh let's see [1269] what the example was like and let's just [1271] make sure that our prompt is right [1272] because that's what we really care about [1274] I'm going over here to messages and then [1276] I'm going all the way down to this [1278] Jeffrey one and I'm saying Hey Jeffrey [1280] he's the founder of crowd crate a [1281] leading marketing agency how business [1283] grow blah blah blah he's got a lot of [1284] big names here $250 million it's huge um [1288] Hey Jeffrey impressed to see your [1289] journey from bootstrapping charge Tech [1291] advised on glober Partnerships Eco [1292] gloves you got quite the track record [1294] and scaling impactful projects let's [1296] connect I don't like the let's connect [1298] line don't like that at [1301] all [1303] um so what I'm probably going to do is [1305] decrease the temperature of this [1308] substantially really don't like the [1310] let's connect [1312] stuff and then I really want um I [1317] figured I'd reach [1331] out I'm just going to use the exact same [1334] words figured I'd reach out and then in [1337] the prompt I'm going to say end with [1339] figured I'd reach [1344] out uh and that should uh that should [1346] help and then for the example here [1348] because I know that only Jeffrey um was [1351] found because it looks like the rest of [1353] these people either have um [1357] abbreviations in their name or you know [1359] Anthony so really the only ones we [1361] actually got to test were Shawn Corey [1362] and then [1364] Jeffrey uh which is unfortunate I'm just [1366] going to delete these and then I'm only [1368] going to feed in this Jeffrey example to [1370] the model just so I can test it um sort [1372] of every time so Maxum number of Row one [1375] we're going to [1377] search it's going to work and then we're [1380] going to see what our email says [1382] here okay Hey Jeffrey your journey from [1385] bootstrapping to garage scaling Global [1386] Enterprise truly inspiring also big [1387] props in eco-friendly Mission with EOG [1389] gloves figured I'd reach out awesome so [1390] that to me looks great if I were to um [1392] put that into instantly I think the [1394] results on a campaign would be fantastic [1397] um and that's what I'm going to do here [1398] I'm going to use the ice breaker [1399] variable um and then I'm just going to [1401] yeah just going to pump that into [1403] instantly with the Icebreaker variable [1405] so that's great why don't we now um um [1409] do another HTTP [1413] request oh actually let me fix the name [1415] part [1416] first let me go back to um create a [1419] completion and I'm just going to do this [1421] as like very cheap text processing so [1423] I'm going to use [1424] um uh the GPT 3.5 turbo model this was [1429] like 300 times cheaper [1433] probably format the name remove [1438] format the name so it's proper remove [1441] emojis if present and fix [1444] capitalization let's do that um oh we [1448] got to do a system prompt too that I'm [1450] realizing go system you are a helpful [1453] intelligent writing [1455] assistant I'm going to rearrange this [1457] that'll be the first this will be the [1459] instructions and then we're going to [1461] just feed in a bunch of examples from [1463] our actual list so we'll do this and [1467] then I want it to respond with the [1469] properly formatted [1472] name um let's get somebody with an emoji [1476] we'll do this and then I just wanted to [1479] respond with the properly formatted name [1481] with no [1483] Emoji let's [1485] do this guy here this is a good [1489] example um let's just have him respond [1492] with the actual [1494] name and then let's just do one more [1496] because it's cheap and uh because I see [1499] that one instance we haven't done before [1501] is the Emoji at the beginning of the [1505] name so there's no um last name here [1510] unfortunately [1512] um let's just pretend that there [1517] is um so that you know it doesn't really [1519] get confused okay yeah that looks good [1522] and then the last thing I'm going to do [1523] is I'll feed in the actual full name [1525] here we will set max to tokens at 100 [1529] there should not be more than 100 here [1531] at all uh and then the full name of the [1534] person um I believe we now have a I mean [1537] I could just go to choices and then [1540] message content I believe but I think we [1542] can also just use result I think um they [1544] just change their [1545] API let's just see how that goes [1549] first you know you can use AI as a text [1551] processor extremely easily and I do it [1553] all the time um you know the cost on [1555] this the fact that there are five [1556] completion tokens I could probably run [1558] this all day and it would cost me like [1559] one cent so obviously it fixed Jeffrey [1562] which is nice but Jeffrey wasn't really [1563] a [1565] problem nice yeah yeah I think this is [1567] going to work really well okay sweet let [1569] me just rename this now to format full [1573] name and then this one to generate [1577] Icebreaker this one here will be enrich [1581] email um let's do enrich lead with email [1587] and then this one will be [1590] list rows uh and then what I'm going to [1592] do is I'm going to have another HTTP [1594] call and uh now I'm going to send it [1595] over to [1597] instantly so as I mentioned before this [1600] is platform agnostic you can use any [1602] cold email service you want any cold [1604] email service you have uh you don't have [1605] to be married instantly but I really [1607] like instantly because it's probably the [1609] best bang for your buck on a volume [1612] perspective like if you were to try and [1613] use one of the other big uh cold email [1616] platforms out there today uh you'd [1618] probably end up spending for I don't [1621] know let's say like 1,000 emails a day [1623] you might be spending like $300 or [1625] something like that for th000 emails a [1626] day with instantly you can get away with [1628] that in the $97 a month plan so you [1630] could save 200 bucks a month up front [1632] and then there are also a variety of [1633] like very simple and easy workflows um [1636] that instantly sort of provides out of [1637] the box that are just great for cold [1639] email like they strip all of your HTML [1641] they do a bunch of other stuff too so [1643] I've worked with the API quite quite a [1645] bit at this point but I'm going to [1646] pretend that I haven't and then I'm just [1647] going to go to instantly API and we'll [1649] pretend that I'm just building all this [1650] from the ground up for the first time [1652] just so that you know anybody that wants [1654] to do this on your own um understands [1656] how to do so so what I did there is I [1659] just Googled the instantly API um and [1661] then I'm reading through there finding [1663] your API key documentation so it says [1665] the first step to using our platform is [1666] to find your API key to get your API key [1669] go to your instantly dashboard then [1670] settings and Integrations API you can [1671] also just click this button and so [1673] that's what I'm doing [1674] here you see there's an API I can copy [1677] my API key which is quite nice and then [1681] um you also need to be on the [1682] hypergrowth plan or above to be able to [1683] access the API key which I am just keep [1686] that in mind um you know if you're using [1688] your own once you have your API key send [1691] a get request to ensure everything is [1692] ready sure more than happy to uh what [1694] I'm going to do here is just for the [1696] purposes of this video and because I [1698] don't think the instantly API is so [1699] sophisticated that I can just rotate the [1701] keys is I'm actually going [1704] to go over here and Set uh no I'm not [1707] going to do that [1710] let me [1713] think yeah I'm going to go back here and [1715] then I'm just going to set a [1719] variable and I'm just going to call this [1721] my instantly API [1723] key I'm going to paste this in but I'm [1726] uh in post I'm going to blur this so [1728] that you can't actually see oh I don't [1730] know if that's actually going to work [1732] that'd be sort of annoying if you just [1733] saw it every single time that uh I [1735] referenced this in a a subsequent module [1738] let's [1741] see um well you don't see it now which [1743] is nice but maybe you'll see it later uh [1746] but anyway um yeah so what I'm going to [1747] do is I'll I'll do that and then I'm [1749] going to go test [1751] the [1753] um uh the API key just using a request [1757] it looks like a get request to this URL [1758] to ensure that it works so I'll go copy [1761] over this and then you'll see how the [1764] instantly API varies from the um any [1766] mail finder API where's the instantly [1768] API sorry whereas the any mail finder [1770] API used a post request with a request [1772] in the body uh the instantly API uses a [1775] get request and then all of the [1776] information that you need is in this URL [1778] at least for the um you know at least [1779] for the initial like authentication [1781] request and they're also doing it the [1783] right way and so far that they're [1784] telling you hey you know verify that [1786] this works before you do anything else [1787] and so that's what we're doing all we're [1788] doing is we're just leaving the basic [1790] settings I'm clicking parse response to [1791] yes but everything else is left the same [1793] and then I'm just copying and pasting [1794] this variable that I've set with the API [1796] key um over here [1798] and [1799] then [1801] um okay that's kind of annoying now I [1803] think about it because I want to run [1804] this whole flow so I'm just going to go [1806] back here and then I'm going to [1809] unlink this for now and then I'm going [1812] to drag this over here and then I'm [1815] going to run this [1816] puppy we'll see what happens okay yeah [1819] that that did not work unfortunately but [1821] hey say love uh we received a status [1824] code of 200 with the workspace name so [1826] fantastic that's exactly what we wanted [1828] so very nice um now what we need to do [1831] is we need to go and then uh the way [1833] that instantly works is you'll basically [1834] set up a campaign so I've set up one [1836] here called example campaign and then [1838] you can add leads to this campaign and [1840] then that's sort of how it works um and [1842] these leads need need some some [1843] variables right so [1846] um I'll pretend that I have an [1848] icebreaker variable well I do have an [1850] icebreaker variable so I'm going to feed [1851] that in um we're going to need to feed [1853] in the company name and then we're going [1855] to need to feed in the you know first [1857] name is as well actually we should just [1858] feed in like more variables than we [1860] really need just in case uh so what I'm [1862] going to do is I'll go back here to list [1864] rows and then just because I verify that [1867] this works I'll [1870] go um back here unlink I'll actually use [1873] this as the trigger to my flow so that I [1876] could start with something that isn't an [1878] iterator like the search rows module is [1880] an iterator and then I'll just bring [1883] this down here because it's a little bit [1885] prettier and then for my might instantly [1888] flow now I'll go to the API [1889] documentation and I'll see how do we add [1891] something to a campaign we [1894] go lead add leads to a campaign there we [1897] go so it looks like you can add uh a [1900] bulk amount of leads which is nice but [1901] we only really want one and this is the [1904] way that you do it so it says you post [1907] this address slv1 lead this may look [1911] like nonsense to you um but this is [1912] what's called a relative URL essentially [1915] uh relative URLs are just everything [1916] after the/ in this instance so slv1 [1919] authenticate in our case it wouldn't be [1921] slv1 authenticate it would be [1925] um um slash V1 lead and actually I lied [1931] the the whole URL is right over here so [1932] I'm just going to copy [1934] this I'm going to paste that in so then [1937] they said post so we're going to do a [1938] post [1939] request um and then the data is just a [1942] huge object here which is nice so I'm [1944] just going to [1946] copy it looks like they're sending [1948] multiple leads so they're sending two [1949] leads in this instance we only want one [1951] lead so I'm just going to copy all of [1953] this [1953] stuff I'll go down to body type I'll go [1957] Json and then request content I'm just [1958] going to paste all this stuff [1960] in and then I'm just going to make sure [1962] that this is correctly formatted which I [1965] think it is but I'm going to go back to [1966] my best Json formatter and then just [1968] paste that in [1969] format cool format looks good to me [1971] we're going to go back here paste that [1973] in um just so I can get that nice sort [1975] of staircase effect um with the the [1978] close brackets and stuff like that and [1980] then what do we got to do we got to [1981] paste in the API key which is simple [1983] enough um let's see what is this [1987] called oh 8. instantly API key nice uh [1992] campaign [1993] ID this is just going to be um the URL [1997] of our campaign after slash campaign and [2000] before SL sequences so I'm just going to [2002] copy this long unique identifier then [2005] I'm going to go here and then paste it [2007] so skip if in workspace I don't actually [2009] really know what that means but I'm not [2010] going to worry about it uh and then we [2012] can proceed with just the the actual [2014] like adding of the leads the email of [2015] this lead um is going to come out of [2019] here so I think it's going to be results [2022] and then email so we're going to stick [2024] that in there the first name right yeah [2027] instantly separates the first and the [2029] last name which is sort of unfortunate [2031] so our full name thing um it's not that [2034] it won't work it's just we sort of have [2036] to like do a roundabout method of [2039] um getting the full name and [2042] then splitting the full name based off [2045] the presence of a new line or sorry um [2049] space and then you know getting the the [2052] first value [2054] there um yeah getting the the first [2057] value there I think that's right so [2058] split bracket [2061] bracket and bracket okay we had too many [2064] brackets um so that's good and then we [2066] just need to write two for for this next [2068] one instead of [2069] one paste that and I'll just wrate two [2073] so the last name should be the second [2074] element that we're getting from the [2075] split and then the first name is the [2077] first element the company name um is [2080] hopefully not going to be that annoying [2081] yep we just paste the company name in [2082] and then personalization we're actually [2084] using a custom variable called [2086] Icebreaker instead of personalization [2087] but I think personalization is actually [2088] meant for what I've done here um just a [2091] heads up in case you guys are unfamiliar [2093] with that uh and I'm just realizing that [2095] because we outputed it as Json we we [2097] actually need to go in and then um [2099] extract this Json so I'm not I'm not [2100] actually going to do that yet what I'll [2103] do is I'll just make sure everything [2104] else looks good I'll remove the [2105] personalization I'll remove the phone [2108] I'll remove the website and then I'll [2109] just have custom variables Icebreaker [2111] okay that looks good and then uh what [2113] I'm going to do here is after I generate [2114] the Icebreaker I actually need to parse [2115] the [2116] Json that's something that I forgot so [2119] you can do so just by typing [2120] parse and then going to parse Json what [2124] we basically want to do is we want to [2125] feed in this Json string to uh get the [2128] Icebreaker um value and the the name of [2133] that value is going to be 9. Icebreaker [2136] um wrapped in these curly braces and I [2138] already know that that's going to be the [2139] name so just to save me from having to [2141] run this a couple times I'm just going [2142] to paste in what I know will work after [2145] it you know [2146] runs um and then I'm just going to [2148] double check that everything else looks [2149] good got the API key got The Campaign ID [2151] got the leads got everything okay great [2153] so that looks good to me what I'm going [2156] to do now is I'm I'm just going to go to [2158] instantly and then I'm going to go to [2159] the lead section here and I'm just going [2160] to see if there are any leads and there [2162] aren't uh I'm just going to go to search [2164] list rows and just make sure it's only [2165] one row that's being listed that looks [2167] good what I'm going to do now is I'm [2169] just going to run this from start to [2171] finish because I know this is valid [2174] email and then uh we got a 400 from [2177] instantly which is unfortunate means [2178] that there was some issue and the issue [2180] in particular was that there was an [2181] unexpected token in Jason at position [2184] 355 um this is good because now we can [2187] diagnose that token is so I'm going to [2189] copy and paste this and I'll go back to [2190] best Json [2191] formatter paste this in here and then [2194] I'll format [2195] beauy looks like it's good not really [2198] sure what the issue is [2201] um there might be a quote somewhere [2204] might be the skip if in [2206] workspace not entirely sure so why don't [2208] I do this why don't I remove the skip if [2210] in [2211] workspace let's just make sure that [2213] there's no um additional commas or [2216] anything sometimes that can break these [2219] apis that looks good uh and then I'm [2221] going to paste this and bring this back [2223] um and I'm just going to paste the whole [2226] thing and then I'm going to run this [2229] again now for testing purposes I don't [2231] actually really usually like running it [2233] like this I like just um the only [2235] information I put in is the the [2237] information um in that module okay it [2239] looks like there's an unexpected token [2241] in Jason a position 321 as well so I [2243] need to go through the request content [2244] and see what's going on okay so I [2246] figured it out the the unexpected token [2248] is this new line here um so we need to [2251] fix this new line and the way that we're [2253] going to fix it [2261] is [2264] um I guess we had it generate the new [2269] lines so like a a quick hack would just [2271] be to replace the new line with um a new [2275] line [2281] replace the two new lines with this for [2284] now I'm just to double check that this [2289] works let's run this puppy and see what [2291] happens ran instantly which is usually [2294] not a good sign okay this time there's [2296] an unexpected token in Jason in position [2297] 321 so let's go back to request [2300] content oh I think I see the problem the [2303] problem is that there is no new line um [2306] at this point because of the way that [2307] make is uh formatting the text um when [2311] it gets output from our Json module or [2315] from our generate Icebreaker module it [2316] looks like this with the back slashback [2318] slash n but after we parse the Json [2320] it'll actually take those back slash [2321] ends and then convert them into into [2323] whole new lines so actually what I think [2325] we have to do is we have to replace the [2328] new [2329] lines with these back slash ends and [2332] then we have to hope that instantly on [2334] their end can replace the backs slash [2335] ends with um [2338] with uh actual new [2343] lines okay that took a little bit longer [2346] to run there see that flash status was [2349] success uh 14 15493 leads remaining in [2352] plan okay let me refresh this puppy [2355] awesome and now we have our lead here [2357] who's been added in uh and great looks [2359] like the Icebreaker actually kept the [2361] formatting there which is nice I think [2363] we need a comma now that I think about [2364] it I didn't add a comma there but we can [2367] test how this looks on the guy by [2370] deleting everything and then um I think [2372] I'm just going to use first name Q I'm [2376] going to save this and then instantly [2377] allows you to preview so I go here I'll [2380] say Hey Jeffrey your journey from [2381] bootstrapping in garage to scaling [2382] Global Enterprise is nothing short of [2384] inspiring sorry with EOG gloves figured [2385] I'd reach out nice and then we have the [2388] rest of our cool sexy copy down here so [2390] that looks really nice to me um what I'm [2392] going to do back here is just uh when I [2394] generate the Icebreaker I forgot to add [2395] a comma after the hey whatever name and [2399] little stuff like that I think is [2400] important so just going to add a comma [2402] there and then I'm going to add a comma [2405] here and then this should just you know [2407] tell the AI like hey man make sure to [2409] add a comma next time you generate one [2411] which is what we want um and now we have [2414] you know uh a system I believe uh which [2418] does everything that we want it to [2420] do I'm going to uh run this on let's do [2426] 30 [2429] rows and then what I'm going to uh let's [2432] not do 30 I just um consume unnecessary [2435] operations for testing let's do [2438] 10 let's remove this fella here we don't [2443] need them anymore goodbye that's it guys [2447] on the Cho and block let's save this um [2451] let's name this something [2454] like enrich leads and S to [2459] instantly and then let's run this whole [2462] thing and we shouldn't run every time [2464] right we should only run if we don't get [2466] the [2467] email sorry if we do get the email what [2469] I'm noticing here though is this is [2470] taking a fair amount of time e if we [2473] look at this I mean this is like 15 [2475] seconds already if we wait 15 seconds [2477] per run um and then we try and process a [2480] whole list of like 2,500 let's think [2483] about that um let's just make it really [2485] conservative and let's say it's 5 [2486] Seconds [2487] 5 seconds is what 5 over [2490] 60 wow that run would take 208 minutes [2494] uh okay that's not good um I thought I [2497] was super close to finishing I'm not [2498] actually super close to finishing the [2500] reason why this is a problem is because [2502] the make um scenario timeout is 45 [2504] minutes so you can imagine how if you [2506] were to drag a list with 2,500 prospects [2508] in it without emails and then run it [2511] through this scenario it would time out [2514] after 45 minutes despite there still [2516] being like another 100 what 160 minutes [2519] 170 minutes left to process um on [2521] average uh and you know averages are [2524] always averages uh and we don't just [2526] want this to be comfortable for averages [2527] so actually what we need to do now that [2529] I'm thinking about this is we need to [2530] take this flow and then we need to split [2531] it into two scenarios there needs to be [2533] a scenario that sends it to an email [2536] finder and then what most of these [2538] platforms do is they have um they have [2541] what are called callback URLs and this [2542] is only something you'll really know if [2544] you know you've experimented with these [2545] apis before but what we'll need to do is [2547] we'll need to put a call back URL and [2550] then we'll send it to any mail finder [2552] and then after any mail finder is done [2554] doing its thing then it can send it to [2555] another scenario and the only purpose of [2557] that scenario is going to be [2560] to um to process it one at a time um [2565] yeah so I mean the good news is we we [2567] validated this and it works right we fed [2569] in what 10 or something and then of the [2572] 10 we got six um leads added to [2574] instantly which is quite nice um so [2576] that's that's pretty impressive honestly [2579] um more or less exactly what I was [2580] thinking about I thought we'd get about [2582] 60% and uh looks like that's what we're [2584] looking at but that doesn't really [2585] matter too much to us right now because [2587] we need to solve that time problem um [2589] you know this run probably already took [2591] like a minute and a half and it was only [2592] 10 imagine if we want to do that on [2595] 2,000 so we don't have to go back to the [2597] drawing board but we do have to consider [2599] how we're going to change this um I want [2602] to split this into two scenarios number [2604] one is I'm going to watch Google Drive [2608] and send to let's do any mail [2611] finder that should be good and then [2615] after I send to any mail finder I'm [2617] going to catch the result of the what's [2620] called a call back um and then I'm going [2622] to do all of the AI stuff and I'll only [2625] do it if the email is valid okay that [2629] sounds pretty simple to put up in [2631] practice so what we'll do is we'll go [2633] back to the example builds folder here [2636] I'll create a new scenario [2637] I'll call this [2639] um get results from any mail [2643] finder and then I'll say enrich um [2648] personalize and add to instantly that [2651] looks good to me and then what what do [2653] we need to do here we need [2656] to uh first I need to figure out whether [2658] this call back is real but I [2660] believe [2663] I yeah okay so using web hook so you can [2667] make a request to any mail finder [2668] receive a web hook call back when the [2670] result is ready perfect this is exactly [2671] what I was talking about yeah I figured [2673] these guys had it um I I thought I'd [2674] read it somewhere so what we need to do [2677] is we need to set an x- web hook- URL in [2679] the header with the URL you want us to [2682] send the result to web hooks are [2683] avilable for post end points uh great [2685] that's simple so what do we need to do [2687] on scenario two then we need just to [2688] make this a web [2691] hook I'm going to do custom web hook and [2693] then what I'm going to do is I'll say [2695] any mail finder oh nice an email finder [2698] call back uh well I should probably [2701] distinguish this from the other one I'll [2702] say April 30th [2705] 2024 and then I'm going to copy this [2707] address to the clipboard which is this [2709] long um web hook URL I'm going to run [2712] this and then what I want to do is I [2714] need to go back to any mail finder and [2716] add an x- web hook- URL right so when I [2720] enrich this lead I need to add an X web [2723] hook URL paste this in and let me just [2726] check the formatting is correct yeah URL [2728] capital u then lowercase R and then [2730] lowercase L um okay great [2733] so that's that [2737] um well how am I going to get all [2739] the other information now if you think [2741] about [2743] it um if I do this this way then I need [2745] to feed in okay whatever I'm not going [2747] to worry about that I'm just going to [2748] send [2749] it just send it if you don't know [2752] whether or not something's going to work [2753] just send it bro okay so enrich lead [2756] with email um I'm just going to [2759] list one result here I'm going to [2763] run this should send to any mail yeah [2766] okay great and then any any mail finder [2768] will let me know if it's done okay great [2769] so success no result Eric we couldn't [2771] find any emails to this domain sorry and [2773] then we also receive the input uh which [2775] is perfect this is what we're going to [2776] use to pass all the rest of the [2777] information in um so we just solved the [2779] problem that uh you know didn't even [2781] fully know that we had which is [2783] fantastic so what we're going to do is [2786] uh we need to feed in [2789] in all of these we need to feed in the [2792] full name the company name the title the [2793] summary the title description the [2796] company location and all that stuff so [2798] what I need to do is remove this and [2800] then remove this and then drag this back [2803] here we're going to remove this filter [2805] because validity doesn't matter before [2806] we sent it to any mail finder then what [2808] I'm going to do is I'm also going to [2809] feed in a bunch of additional [2811] information here [2814] like um that like four space yeah like [2818] uh company [2821] name 1 2 3 4 we'll do [2826] title 2 three four we'll do summary [2829] which is going to be a long [2831] summary 1 two 3 4 we'll do title [2834] description [2839] oops and then one two three 4 we'll do [2842] company [2845] location one t34 and then we'll do [2847] person [2849] location um this is like a quick and [2851] easy hack uh I don't actually know if [2853] we're going to be able to send all this [2854] information in as text to the API there [2856] might be like a Max character limit or [2857] something and if there is what we'll do [2859] is we'll just feed in the Google sheet [2861] instead with the row um number and then [2865] on the scenario number two we'll use the [2868] Google sheet information to recreate all [2870] of this um over there so that's what [2872] we'll do if that doesn't work out let's [2874] run this again [2877] let's send it we received [2879] it um okay great yeah that looks that [2882] looks awesome uh there was no title or [2884] description or company location let me [2885] just verify that that's correct for this [2887] guy dig [2890] ecoin [2893] um it's got the summary doesn't have a [2896] title description and then he doesn't [2897] have a company location okay that's good [2899] I noticed that we just like doubled up [2900] on company name so that's dumb we don't [2903] need to do that so I'm just going to [2905] remove that uh and then the rest of this [2907] should be good okay great so what we're [2908] going to do is we're going to send it [2909] back and then over here uh we're just [2912] going to check success and see if it's [2913] false and then because I already have [2915] all the rest of the logic here I can [2917] just copy this into scenario number [2919] two and then I'm going to say if [2923] valid if email exists let's do that [2927] we'll say success is equal to true if [2930] and only of [2932] true and [2934] then um [2937] we just need to swap these variables [2939] out so full name will be this company [2942] name will be this title will be that [2945] summary will be [2946] this um title description and then [2950] company location and then finally person [2953] location and then there are a few more [2955] variables that we need to change here uh [2957] we need to add the instantly API key and [2959] then email will only be if there is an [2963] email [2965] and oh I got a cancel this out um this [2968] was 3. dat. results. email so now this [2971] will [2973] be uh one. data. results. email so I can [2977] just sort of do my little hack here [2978] pasting this in the URL copying this and [2980] then rewriting it and then um [2985] Icebreaker should be what's generated um [2989] out of the Json so it'll be 3. [2991] Icebreaker which is already good and [2993] then we need to split the full name so [2996] I'm going to split the full name [3000] here um what else company name we got to [3003] get the company name stick that here um [3007] and the API key that I've so desperately [3010] tried to [3011] hide it's right over [3017] here um paste that [3020] in okay this didn't work so let's just [3023] do away with this guy cuz he sounds [3028] clim and then let's try um Eddie good [3031] old Dependable Eddie let's run this [3034] scenario here and then run it on on the [3036] back end looks like the email does exist [3039] so now we're generating the Icebreaker [3040] we're Parson the Json and then we're [3042] adding it'll say 400 here because [3046] um [3047] well there's no email [3051] H oh that means that we must have not [3053] selected the right one okay great so [3056] let's let's go back over here to our [3058] object and then just see why we didn't [3059] get the right [3060] email oops that's not what I wanted to [3063] do Escape is your best friend when you [3066] muck up like this because when you copy [3067] and paste stuff in um oh I get it it's [3071] because it was a parameter of the [3074] object okay and then company name [3076] doesn't exist but this exists okay great [3078] yeah so this will work now we'll run [3081] this and then in the back and we'll run [3083] this um it's going to pick up the [3085] response and then it'll go through it'll [3087] send it to instantly we sent it voila um [3091] and then this should escape the problem [3093] that we had [3094] previously where we um you know would [3098] have had to like wait a bunch I'm going [3100] to delete [3101] this I'm going to go and just do a big [3103] end to end test right now on a subset of [3105] 30 of these [3107] leads and then I'm going to save this [3110] and then I'm going to run this and then [3113] what do I need to do I need to drag and [3114] drop this lead list into that folder so [3117] I'm going to go back to here and then [3119] I'm just going to drag this out of that [3120] folder [3122] first and then I'm going to run this [3126] oops oh yeah this isn't an acid module [3129] my bad um if it's not an acid module [3131] that means that uh it'll process after [3134] uh through polling so I'm just going to [3135] drag this back now this is inside then [3138] I'm just going to run [3141] this and run this [3144] again I'm going to have to choose where [3146] to start [3147] start we're going to choose all we're [3150] going to run this one more goddamn [3152] time all right it should [3155] work all right and you see how it's [3157] sending him U basically every [3159] second maybe like two or three times a [3162] second [3162] really right 17 18 19 whatever uh we [3167] only ran this once because this is [3168] running on like a like a piecewise [3170] manner so it's only running every you [3172] know if you test it once it'll but uh if [3173] you click again we'll see it in the web [3175] hook queue you you'll see that that [3176] email actually did exist and then we [3179] sent this over to instantly uh which is [3182] nice so yeah we just processed 30 on the [3184] front end and then we don't really care [3186] how long it takes on the back end [3187] because you know the back end is not our [3189] business it's any mail finders business [3191] which is awesome and then um on the back [3193] end here we received the successfully [3196] processed email we generated an [3197] icebreaker for and then we added it [3198] instantly then if I go over to instantly [3201] and then I just um go through and [3203] preview again you'll see that it's um [3205] it's formatted correct ly now and it's [3207] hey Dan your journey through digital [3208] marketing web through is quite the [3209] evolution 25 years in the game is still [3210] pushing the boundaries figured I'd reach [3211] out right um so very very good uh and [3215] very straightforward and clean uh yeah I [3218] think my my friend is going to be very [3219] happy with this um that's that pretty [3223] sure just off the top of my head [3225] anything else I got to do no that's it [3228] um awesome that is an end to-end cold [3230] Outreach system that hopefully anybody [3233] here uh can build on their own now with [3235] a knowledge and expertise that I [3236] provided you whether you are looking to [3238] sell the system to other people agencies [3241] um web 3 companies essentially small [3243] business owners that do some type of [3245] cold outbound or whether you want to [3246] build this for your own business you [3248] should have the tools and you know the [3250] techniques necessary to do a dang good [3251] job of it as I mentioned earlier this [3253] system um at least the actual emailing [3256] part is so incredibly ridiculously high [3258] Roi right now that you can easily [3260] achieve uh reply rates of you know 15 to [3262] 20 to 25% um maybe even more you know if [3266] you go and build the system and you [3267] achieve reply rates of 45% let me know [3269] I'd love to take a look the reason why [3271] this is so valuable is because as cold [3274] email volumes have increased over the [3275] course of the last I want to say like [3277] two years or so with the Advent of tools [3278] like instantly reply rates have just [3280] slowly been going down and cold email [3282] has been getting more and more and more [3283] difficult uh simply because people's [3285] bars are a little bit higher now they [3286] get spammed so often that you know [3288] simply saying hey Pete loved your look [3290] man so I'm reaching out you know it's [3292] not sufficient in order to get a reply [3294] uh but now when you can you know process [3295] things and profile rewrite it in your [3297] own tone of voice pick up things that [3299] maybe are more personal to them than is [3301] necessarily business that isn't on like [3302] a user generated content platform like [3304] LinkedIn or whatever um now that you can [3306] do that you know we're shooting the [3307] reply rates way back up and yeah tons of [3310] companies that have introduced this to [3312] are selling you know 10 20 30 $100,000 a [3315] month of new business just using this [3317] exact same system you guys can [3318] definitely do that as well thanks so [3320] much for watching um this was a return [3323] to video recording I haven't done one of [3325] these in quite a while [3327] because to be completely honest I've [3328] been overwhelmed with the Prague trip [3330] and abys turnaround that I've been doing [3332] uh and immediately after I got back I [3333] got sick as a dog for like nine days so [3336] just got back into it now I'm going to [3337] be posting consistently again really [3339] appreciate all the love and the support [3341] on my journey to 10,000 subscribers [3342] which I think I hit like 48 hours ago so [3345] thank you so much to everybody that [3346] subbed

Title: Watch Me Build A $10K High-Ticket Email System In 1 Hour (1/2)
[0] what's going on everybody it's Nick been [1] a long time in this video I'm going to [3] be showing you a cold Outreach system [5] build from start to finish uh this is [7] one of probably the most effective cold [9] Outreach systems that anybody's building [11] in the world not to T my own horn uh but [13] it's extremely extremely powerful I [16] personally achieved anywhere from 15 to [17] 25% reply rates with this and basically [20] every company that I introduced this [21] into uses it as their sole sales method [24] moving forward so super effective stuff [26] uh I'm going to show you everything from [28] like the scoping at the very beginning [30] all the way to you know Translating that [31] into uh sort of a workflow and you know [34] what my mindset and design choices are [37] so hopefully you guys can pick that [38] knowledge up and then use it to build [39] your own systems later on if that sounds [41] like something you guys are into buckle [43] up and let's get into the [47] video okay so first things first anytime [49] you're dealing with a project like this [50] you obviously need to convert what the [52] client wants uh which you know in my [54] case is somebody that I'm I'm building a [55] system for into you know what is [58] feasible and what is realistic you know [60] a lot of the time a client will want [61] something um and then they will make it [63] out to be 400 steps when really that [65] only takes one step and the inverse [67] applies a lot of the time as well well [69] where they'll say something like oh [70] that's super easy right you just send it [72] from here to here and then turns out [73] that is like a waterfall of 500 [75] different triggers and actions uh [77] luckily in this case it seems pretty [78] straightforward so this is just a [80] message that I received um when I was [82] asking for a little bit of clarification [84] and honestly I read through it it's more [85] than sufficient you can actually turn [87] something like this into a very high Roi [89] system and in my case because I'm [90] combining it with the email uh knowhow [93] that I have and the fact that I've [94] introduced these systems into you know [96] seven and even eight figure businesses [97] at this point I know that the system is [99] going to crush it so let's go through [102] this scope essentially um hey mate [107] thinking a Google folder I can drop a [109] big list of leads into most likely [111] LinkedIn sales navigator to Phantom [113] Buster so he's referencing a lead [116] sourcing method that I have shown in a [118] previous video which I'll touch on in a [120] second and then I'll also leave a a link [122] down in the description if you guys are [124] looking for leads yourselves very [125] straightforward method you can export up [127] to I think 2.5 to 3K a day uh and I use [130] it for you know most of my businesses [132] and the businesses that I partner with [133] but anyway then the system will [135] automatically find their emails which is [138] important uh it'll automatically do AI [141] personalization which is something that [142] I'll touch on but it's extremely [144] powerful if you do it at scale and then [146] from there uh the lead will go into [148] instantly as usual it's important that [149] the only manual step that anyone has to [152] do is drag and drop the lead list into [154] the folder everything else should be [155] automatic so the reason why first of all [158] that I chose this um system to sort of [161] talk about today is because I think this [163] is more or less the perfect marriage of [164] like human um effort and then like [168] leveraging automatic processes because [171] if you think about it you could extend [172] the system and then you could also have [173] it do the lead sourcing automatically [176] but the lead sourcing you know at least [178] from my experience I know there's just [179] just so many little tweaks and quirks [182] and sort of like finicky bits that if [185] you do automate it it's usually not [186] really worth the sunk time energy and [188] cost into building like this [190] extremely um what's the term inflexible [194] pipeline to Source leads it's almost [196] always better to just pay a virtual [197] assistant or somebody in like a lower [199] cost of living area you know 10 maybe [201] $15 an hour to just go and do the lead [203] sourcing mechanism which in our case [205] probably would take like an hour or [206] something for 2,500 leads mathematically [209] just make a lot more sense than um [211] trying to build a system to do [212] everything and so the reason why I'm [215] bringing this up is because you know a [216] lot of novice automation um engineers [219] and people attempting to implement these [221] sorts of flows in their own businesses [223] they think I want to automate everything [225] and you know kudos to you I thought that [227] a lot myself but what I found is you [229] know there are things that it makes [230] sense to automate and then there are [232] some things that you know a little bit [233] of human supervision just because the [235] flexibility of people uh and the fact [237] that you know you can like open a new [239] tab and know ah can't really do that yet [241] um just makes it a lot more cost- [243] effective to get up and running with [245] with people first you know after you [246] validated the system maybe you know six [248] months to a year out and you know if you [251] really want to cut on the $15 per 2,500 [253] leads that you're sourcing then maybe [254] you can you know build a system out but [257] you you're more than you have more than [259] enough capability to make a boatload of [261] money um by just building AI systems in [265] sort of these modular steps as opposed [267] to owning the entire space so any who [269] that's my big rant um but I learned it [272] from experience and hopefully it's [273] valuable to you what essentially um this [276] person is going to do behind the scenes [278] is they just have uh a team of virtual [280] assistants and their jobs are [282] essentially they have LinkedIn profiles [283] and then um they use Phantom Busters to [285] Source lists and the way that these [287] lists look is they look just like this [290] this is just an example list that I [291] sourced for I think like web 3 marketing [293] agencies or something all I did for this [296] was I went to LinkedIn sales Navigator [297] you do need to have a LinkedIn sales [298] Navigator account of course [300] um and then I like did a LinkedIn sales [304] Navigator search and then I took the URL [305] of that search and then I put it into [307] Phantom Buster uh I waited about 10 or [309] 15 minutes and then this is the result I [310] have a massive list of [313] 2500 it says 251 but that's because [316] these rows are one indexed uh literally [318] 2,500 leads here and you can see you [321] know we have a ton of information on [323] them we have their first name we have [325] their last name uh combined we have [327] their full name you'll see that there's [329] a little bit of processing that these [330] leads need to have like um this guy's [333] name probably is an Anthony day clock [334] emoji it's probably just Anthony day so [337] you know that's worth taking a look at [339] we're obviously going to have to fix [340] that when we build out our [342] system um but we have everything else [344] that we need in order to you know do [346] email enrichment we have the company [347] name we have the title right we have the [349] company ID company [351] URL um we have a bunch of stuff for AI [353] personalization here we have like a [354] summary column right this is more than [357] enough to do some really really good [358] work and um you know as I mentioned [360] earlier like this list might [361] realistically cost you like a cost of [364] goods of maybe $10 or $15 if you just [366] get somebody to click a couple buttons [367] for you very straightforward essentially [370] these virtual assistants will then take [371] this list um and then I would imagine [374] they're just going to have it as like a [377] Google yeah they're just going to have [378] it as a Google sheet and then in Google [380] Drive they're just going to drag and [381] drop uh this folder in sorry this uh [384] Google spreadsheet I should say into a [387] folder and then that'll be the trigger [388] to the flow so so that's sort of like [390] the highle scope um you'll see that I [391] wrote a couple of notes down here um and [393] this is just super simple I'm not even [395] going to do a flowchart for this system [397] um the craziest thing is this system is [398] so high Roi you could probably charge [400] over $110,000 for it and you know I'll [402] probably be able to build up most of the [403] bones of it in like 20 minutes so yeah [406] very straightforward sort of stuff but [408] um you know it's it's sort of like that [410] old plumber analogy where you know the [412] plumber comes over and then he like [414] looks at the pipe and then he grabs his [416] hammer and just goes knock once and you [417] know he's like that'll be $500 and the [419] person's like what the hell why would I [420] pay $500 to do a knock and it's like [422] well you're not paying me $500 to do a [423] knock you're paying me $500 for all of [425] the time energy and experience I've [427] built to get to the point where all I [428] need to do is a knock so yeah that's [431] more or less uh where we are here but [432] anyway we know that we're going to watch [433] a Google drive folder module that's [435] going to be step one um then we're going [437] to grab uh every Row in this Google [439] sheet and then we're going to send it to [440] an email verification or validation tool [442] I'm going to use a platform called any [443] mail finder for that then if the email [446] exists I'm going to send every record to [448] open AI to basically personalize the [450] email and this is how I achieve open [451] rates of you know 15 to 20 to [454] 25% sorry reply rates not open rates [457] Yeah we actually get replies of like [460] basically one in four emails that we [461] send at one in five uh gets a gets a [463] response now which is pretty sick and [465] then the last step is if the email [466] exists we're also going to send it to [467] instantly via the API so yeah couple [471] couple of cool steps here but um that's [472] more or less what the system looks like [474] if you're unfamiliar with any of these [475] platforms um just the brief rundown [477] obviously make is the system that we're [478] going to be using to build out the [479] automations it's like the glue that [481] holds everything together the email [483] validation tool that I'm going to be [484] using is called any mail finder and I'll [485] touch on that when I actually go through [486] the build and then the um cold email [489] platform I'm using is called instantly [490] and it's just the um I guess most [493] cost-effective cold email platform out [495] there I just copy and pasted a campaign [497] that uh I've used for other people that [498] seems to work quite quite well and uh [500] yeah I'm just going to use this as sort [501] of my example so I'll get the system 99% [504] of the way there and then I'll just [505] change the campaign that I'm sending to [507] you from my account over to uh my [509] friends account okay great so that is it [512] without further Ado let's get into the [514] building so very first thing I need to [517] do is I need to set up a Google drive [520] folder um and then I need to basically [522] watch that Google drive folder so what [524] I'm going to do is go to [525] drive.google.com [527] and then I know that I'm not going to do [529] this on my account I'm going to do this [530] on this [532] account and then I should have an [535] example build folder here yeah there we [537] go okay great yeah and I see set this up [540] already so for the purpose of this video [542] I'm just going to delete [543] this but anyway inside of this example [545] builds folder I'm just going to pretend [547] that I have a folder here for um let's [550] just call an example client to preserve [552] his confid [553] confidentiality and then um this is [556] going to be the folder that I'm going to [557] watch and essentially the whole job of [559] this system is anytime a Google sheet [562] gets dropped into this that's when we're [563] going to trigger the flow that's when [564] we're going to do all that fun stuff so [566] first things first I'm going to go over [568] here to New scenario [570] then I'll just go to drive I know make [572] had some changes to their UI recently um [575] it's a little sexier but to be honest I [577] don't really think it helps uh then [579] we're going to click um watch files in a [581] folder watch files by created time we'll [583] choose a drive the folder to be watch [585] we'll do example [587] build so we'll do that and then I'm [590] going to do example client and then [592] here's a really cool thing that you can [594] do uh you can select the file type to [595] watch so we're only going to select the [597] Google spreadsheet and we're just going [598] to do uh a limited one I'm going to run [601] this nothing's going to happen here [602] because we haven't actually dragged any [604] dragged and dropped anything in yet but [606] what I'm going to do is I'll [608] go lead [610] list [612] here and then I'm just going to make a [614] copy of this so that I still have that [616] other lead [618] list and then I'm going to go back here [622] and then [624] um Google Drive is really annoying [627] sometimes I'm just going to search [629] search it here and then I should be able [631] to move [632] this yeah I can't move this one because [634] this is the um one on my other account [636] okay so this is the one and then I'm [637] going to move this over to the um [642] example client [643] folder so we're going to move that in [645] this is now in the [647] example client folder which we'll just [649] go back to [650] here you see that we have the lead list [652] in and now that we have that uh we can [654] basically run this again and then test [656] it so run [659] great w
